In [[computer science]], an '''abstract semantic [[Graph (data structure)|graph]]''' ('''ASG''') or '''term graph''' is a form of [[abstract syntax]] in which an [[expression (computer science)|expression]] of a [[formal language|formal]] or [[programming language]] is represented by a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] whose vertices are the expression's [[Term (mathematics)|subterm]]s. An ASG is at a higher [[abstraction (computer science)|level of abstraction]] than an [[abstract syntax tree]] (or AST), which is used to express the [[syntax|syntactic structure]] of an expression or [[program (computer science)|program]].

ASGs are more complex and concise than ASTs because they may contain shared subterms (also known as "common subexpressions").&lt;ref name=Garner2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard|title=An abstract view on syntax with sharing|publisher=[[Oxford University]] press|year=2011|doi=10.1093/logcom/exr021|quote=The notion of term graph encodes a refinement of inductively generated syntax in which regard is paid to the sharing and discard of subterms.|arxiv=1009.3682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract semantic graphs are often used as an [[intermediate representation]] by [[compilers]] to store the results of performing [[common subexpression elimination]] upon [[abstract syntax trees]]. ASTs are [[tree (computer science)|trees]] and are thus incapable of representing shared terms. ASGs are usually [[directed acyclic graph]]s. However, they may contain [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]{{clarify|last sentence said acyclic|date=August 2017}}, particularly in the field of [[graph rewriting]]. Graphs that contain cycles may represent [[recursive]] expressions which are commonly used to express [[iteration]] in [[functional programming language]]s without [[loop (computing)|loop]]ing constructs.

The nomenclature ''term graph'' is associated with the field of [[graph rewriting#Term graph rewriting|term graph rewriting]],&lt;ref name=Plump1999&gt;{{cite book | last = Plump | first = D. | editor1-first = Hartmut | editor1-last = Ehrig| editor2-first = G. | editor2-last = Engels| editor3-first = Grzegorz | editor3-last = Rozenberg |title=Handbook of Graph Grammars and Computing by Graph Transformation: applications, languages and tools | volume = 2|year=1999|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789810228842|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves the transformation and processing of expressions by the specification of rewriting rules,&lt;ref name=Barendregt1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barendregt|first=H. P.|first2=M. C. J. D.|last2=van Eekelen|first3=J. R. W.|last3=Glauert|first4=J. R.|last4=Kennaway|first5=M. J.|last5=Plasmeijer|first6=M. R.|last6=Sleep|title=Term graph rewriting|journal=PARLE Parallel Architectures and Languages Europe (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)|year=1987|volume=259|pages=141–158|doi=10.1007/3-540-17945-3_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''abstract semantic graph'' is used when discussing [[linguistics]], [[programming languages]], [[type systems]] and [[compiler|compilation]].

Abstract syntax trees are not capable of representing shared subexpressions due to their simplistic structure; this simplicity comes at a cost of efficiency due to redundant duplicate computations of identical terms. For this reason ASGs are often used as an [[intermediate language]] at a subsequent compilation stage to abstract syntax tree construction via parsing.

An abstract semantic graph is typically constructed from an abstract syntax tree by a process of enrichment and abstraction. The enrichment can for example be the addition of [[back-pointer]]s, [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] from an [[identifier]] node (where a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] is being used) to a node representing the [[declaration (computer science)|declaration]] of that variable. The abstraction can [[logical consequence|entail]] the removal of details which are relevant only in [[parsing]], not for semantics.

'''Advocacy groups''' (also known as '''pressure groups''', '''lobby groups''', '''campaign groups''', '''interest groups''', or '''special interest groups''') use various forms of [[advocacy]] in order to influence [[public opinion]] and/or policy. They have played and continue to play an important part in the development of political and social systems.

Motives for action may be based on a shared [[political]], [[religious]], [[morality|moral]], health or [[commerce|commercial]] position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims including [[lobbying]], media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the [[political process]], while others have few or no such resources.

Some have developed into important social, political institutions or [[social movements]]. Some powerful advocacy groups have been accused of manipulating the democratic system for narrow [[Commerce|commercial]] gain&lt;ref name=fury&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/18/heathrow-third-runway|title=Fury at airport lobby links to No 10|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2010-03-04 | location=London | first=Toby | last=Helm | date=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some instances have been found guilty of [[political corruption|corruption]], [[fraud]], [[bribery]], and other serious [[crimes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmselect/cmstnprv/240vii/sp0703.htm|title=Complaints from Mr Mohamed al Fayed, ''The Guardian'' and others against 25 members and former members|publisher=Parliament UK|accessdate=|date = 1 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; lobbying has become increasingly regulated as a result.

==Overview==
{{See also|Classification of advocacy groups}}
An advocacy group is a group or an organization which tries to influence the government but does not hold power in the government.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:William Hogarth - John Wilkes, Esq.png|thumb|150px|right|upright|Satirical engraving of Wilkes by [[William Hogarth]]. Wilkes is holding two editions of ''[[The North Briton]]''.]]
The early growth of pressure groups was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including [[political representation]], [[market capitalization]], and [[proletarianization]]. The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, [[John Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/51006/232.pdf?...1|title=BRITAIN CREATES THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT|author=Charles Tilly}}&lt;/ref&gt; As editor of the paper ''[[The North Briton]]'', Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]] and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Charged with [[seditious libel]], Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a [[general warrant]], a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful – the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes – people began chanting, "Wilkes and Liberty" in the streets.

After a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and [[obscenity]], Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], where most of his support was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Cash|first = Arthur|date= 2006 |pages=204–226|title = John Wilkes: The Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty|isbn =  978-0300123630|publisher = Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilkes was imprisoned in the [[King's Bench Prison]] on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan "No liberty, no King."{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=216–26}} Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an [[Alderman]] of [[City of London|London]] in 1769, and an activist group called the ''Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights'' began aggressively promoting his policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/18reform/ssbr.htm www.historyhome.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first ever sustained social advocacy group;—it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion;—it tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rudbeck | first1 = J. | title = Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement | doi = 10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x | journal = Theor Soc | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–601 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The force and influence of this social advocacy movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement's demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, [[general warrant]]s were declared as unconstitutional and press freedom was extended to the coverage of [[Parliamentary debate]]s.

Another important advocacy group that emerged in the late 18th century was the British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement against [[slavery]]. Starting with an organised sugar boycott in 1791, it led the second great petition drive of 1806, which brought about the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|banning of the slave trade]] in 1807. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), "...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0674050002|title=The Association British Extra Parliamentary Political Organization, 1769-1793|author=Eugene Charlton Black|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and spread===
[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Great Chartist Meeting on [[Kennington Common]], London in 1848.]]
From 1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] after victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. [[Chartism]] was the first mass movement of the growing working-class in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/75-our-history/12331-chartism-the-birth-of-mass-working-class-resistance|title=Chartism: the birth of mass working class resistance |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the [[People's Charter of 1838]] as its manifesto – this called for [[universal suffrage]] and the implementation of the [[secret ballot]], amongst other things. The term "social movements" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist [[Lorenz von Stein]] in his book ''Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)'' in which he introduced the term "social movement" into scholarly discussions&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; – actually depicting in this way [[political movement]]s fighting for the social rights understood as [[welfare rights]].

[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther King]] led the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century.]]
The [[labor movement]] and [[socialist movement]] of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of [[communism|communist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|of 1917]], resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the [[World War I|First World War]].

In the post-war period, [[Feminism|women's rights]], [[gay rights movement|gay rights]], [[peace movement|peace]], [[civil rights]], [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and [[environmental movement]]s emerged, often dubbed the [[New Social Movements]],&lt;ref&gt;Westd, David B. "New Social Movements." Knowledge Center. Built on the Thematic Theme Framework., 16 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which may be considered "[[public interest|general interest]] groups" as opposed to special interest groups. They led, among other things, to the formation of [[green parties]] and organisations influenced by the [[new left]]. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new ''type'' of social movement is latent—they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a [[global citizens movement]].

==Activities==
Advocacy groups exist in a wide variety of genres based upon their most pronounced activities.
* Anti-defamation organizations issue responses or criticisms to real or supposed slights of any sort (including speech or violence) by an individual or group against a specific segment of the population which the organization exists to represent.
* Watchdog groups exist to provide oversight and rating of actions or media by various outlets, both government and corporate. They may also index personalities, organizations, products, and activities in databases to provide coverage and rating of the value or viability of such entities to target demographics.
* Lobby groups [[Lobbying|lobby]] for a change to the law or the maintenance of a particular law and big businesses fund very considerable lobbying influence on legislators, for example [[Lobbying in the United States|in the USA]] and [[Lobbying in the United Kingdom|in the UK]] where lobbying first developed. Some Lobby groups have considerable financial resources at their disposal. Lobbying is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into [[Political corruption|corruption]]. In the United States the [[Internal Revenue Service]] makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248 |title=Lobbying Versus Advocacy: Legal Definitions |publisher=NP Action |accessdate=2010-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402225054/http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248 |archivedate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lobby groups spend considerable amounts of money on election advertising as well. For example, the 2011 documentary film ''[[Hot Coffee (film)|Hot Coffee]]'' contains interviews of former [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver E. Diaz, Jr.]] and evidence the [[US Chamber of Commerce]] paid for advertising to unseat him.
* [[Defense (legal)|Legal defense]] funds provide funding for the legal defense for, or legal action against, individuals or groups related to their specific interests or target demographic. This is often accompanied by one of the above types of advocacy groups filing an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' if the cause at stake serves the interests of both the legal defense fund and the other advocacy groups.

==Influence==
In most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], advocacy groups tend to use the [[bureaucracy]] as the main channel of influence – because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the [[legislature]] to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions – groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; "the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests".&lt;ref name="Heywood 2007 305"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Politics|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to [[George Monbiot]], the influence of [[big business]] has been strengthened by "the greater ease with which corporations can [[:wikt:relocation|relocate]] production and investment in a [[global economy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monibot|first=George|title=The Captive State: The Corporate Take-Over of Britain|year=2011|publisher=Pan|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government.

Advocacy groups can also exert influence through the assembly by lobbying. Groups with greater economic resources at their disposal can employ professional lobbyists to try and exert influence in the assembly. An example of such a group is the environmentalist group [[Greenpeace]]; Greenpeace (an organisation with income upward of $50,000,000) use lobbying to gain political support for their campaigns. They raise issues about the environment with the aim of having their issues translated into policy such as the government encouraging [[alternative energy]] and [[recycling]].

The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence. In states where legislation cannot be challenged by the courts, like the UK, advocacy groups are limited in the amount of influence they have. In states that have codified constitutions, like the USA, however, advocacy group influence is much more significant. For example, – in 1954 the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lobbied against the [[Topeka]] Board of education, arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government.

Advocacy groups can also exert influence on political parties. The main way groups do this is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, the conservative parties campaigns are often funded by large corporations, as many of the conservative parties campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. For example, [[George W. Bush]]'s re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour – when the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers.

Advocacy groups also exert influence through channels that are separate from the government or the political structure such as the [[mass media]] and through [[public opinion]] campaigning. Advocacy groups will use methods such as [[protesting]], [[petitioning]] and [[civil disobedience]] to attempt to exert influence in Liberal Democracies. Groups will generally use two distinct styles when attempting to manipulate the media – they will either put across their outsider status and use their inability to access the other channels of influence to gain sympathy or they may put across a more ideological agenda. Traditionally, a prime example of such a group were the trade-unions who were the so-called "industrial" muscle. Trade-unions would campaign in the forms of industrial action and marches for workers rights, these gained much media attention and sympathy for their cause. In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained much of its publicity through civil disobedience; African Americans would simply disobey the racist segregation laws to get the violent, racist reaction from the police and white Americans. This violence and racism was then broadcast all over the world, showing the world just how one sided the race 'war' in America actually was.

Advocacy group influence has also manifested itself in supranational bodies that have arisen through [[globalisation]]. Groups that already had a global structure such as Greenpeace were better able to adapt to globalisation. Greenpeace, for example, have offices in over 30 countries and has an income of $50 million annually. Groups such as these have secured the nature of their influence by gaining status as [[nongovernmental organisation]]s (NGOs), many of which oversee the work of the UN and the EU from their permanent offices in America and Europe. Group pressure by [[supranational]] industries can be exerted in a number of ways: "through direct lobbying by large corporations, national trade bodies and 'peak' associations such as the [[European Round Table of Industrialists]]".&lt;ref name="Heywood 2007 305"/&gt;

There have been many significant advocacy groups throughout history, some of which could operated with dynamics that could better categorize them as [[social movements]]. Here are some notable advocacy groups operating in different parts of the world:
* [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC), the American Israel lobby, which is described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the "most influential Lobby impacting US relations with [[Israel]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JF03Ak01.html|title=And the winner is ... the Israel lobby|quote=Former president Bill Clinton defined it as "stunningly effective".

==Adversarial groupings==
On some controversial issues there are a number of competing advocacy groups, sometimes with very different resources available to them:
* [[Pro-choice]] vs [[Pro-life movement]]s ([[abortion]] policy in the United States)
* [[SPEAK campaign]] vs [[Pro-Test]] ([[animal testing]] in United Kingdom)
* [[The Automobile Association]] vs [[Pedestrians' Association]] (now 'Living Streets') (road safety in the United Kingdom since 1929)
* [[Tobacco Institute]] vs [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (tobacco legislation)
* [[Flying Matters]] vs [[Plane Stupid]] (aviation policy in the United Kingdom since 2007)

==Benefits and incentives==
;Free rider problem
A general theory is that individuals must be enticed with some type of [[:wikt:benefit|benefit]] to join an interest group.&lt;ref name="John R p. 19"/&gt; However, the [[free rider problem]] addresses the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, even those who are not members of that particular interest group. Thus, there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if the farmer will receive that benefit anyway.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite book | first=Mancur | last=Olson | authorlink=Mancur Olson | origyear=1965 | year=1971 | title=The Logic of Collective Action : Public Goods and the Theory of Groups | edition=Revised | publisher=Harvard University Press | location= | isbn=0-674-53751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111–131}}  For another example, every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, but an [[environmental protection]] interest groups do not receive monetary help from every individual in the world.&lt;ref name="John R p. 19"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wright, John R. |title=Interest Groups and Congress, Lobbying, Contributions, and Influence|pages=19–21|isbn=0-02-430301-1|publisher=Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This poses a problem for interest groups, which require dues from their members and contributions in order to accomplish the groups' agendas. &lt;ref name="John R p. 19"/&gt;

;Selective benefits
Selective benefits are material, rather than monetary benefits conferred on group members. For instance, an interest group could give members [[travel discount]]s, [[free meal]]s at certain restaurants, or [[free subscription]]s to magazines, newspapers, or journals.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Many trade and professional interest groups tend to give these types of benefits to their members. 

;Solidarity incentives
A solidary incentive is a reward for participation that is socially derived and created out of the act of association. A selective [[solidary]] benefit offered to members or prospective members of an interest group might involve such incentives as "socializing congeniality, the sense of group membership and identification, the status resulting from membership, fun, [[conviviality]], the maintenance of [[social distinction]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Peter B. &amp;  Wilson, James Q. |title=Incentive Systems: A Theory of Organizations|publisher=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]|issue=6|year=1961|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Expressive incentives
People who join an interest group because of expressive benefits likely joined to express an [[ideological]] or [[moral]] value that they believe in, such as [[free speech]], [[civil rights]], [[economic justice]], or [[political equality]]. To obtain these types of benefits, members would simply pay dues, and donate their time or money to get a feeling of satisfaction from expressing a political value. Also, it would not matter if the interest group achieved their goal; these members would merely be able to say they helped out in the process of trying to obtain their goals, which is the expressive incentive that they got in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salisbury|first = Robert H. |title=An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups|journal=Midwest Journal of Political Science |volume =13|number =1|year=1969|pages=1–32|url = http://pavroz.ru/files/salisburyexchangetheory.pdf|doi= 10.2307/2110212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of interest groups that rely on expressive benefits or incentives are environmental groups and groups who claim to be lobbying for the public interest.&lt;ref name="John R p. 19"/&gt;

;Latent interests
Some public policy interests are not recognized or addressed by a group at all. These interests are labeled latent interests.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Theoretical perspectives==

Much work has been undertaken by academics attempting to categorize how advocacy groups operate, particularly in relation to governmental policy creation. The field is dominated by numerous and diverse schools of thought:
* '''[[Pluralism (political theory)|Pluralism]]''': This is based upon the understanding that advocacy groups operate in competition with one another and play a key role in the political system.  They do this by acting as a counterweight to undue concentrations of power.
:However, this pluralist theory (formed primarily by American academics) reflects a more open and fragmented political system similar to that in countries such as the United States. 
* '''Neo-pluralism''': Under neo-pluralism, a concept of political communities developed that is more similar to the British form of government. This is based on the concept of political communities in that advocacy groups and other such bodies are organised around a government department and its network of client groups.  The members of this network co-operate together during the policy making process.
* '''[[Corporatism]]''' or '''[[elitism]]''': Some advocacy groups are backed by private businesses which can have a considerable influence on legislature.

==Social media use==

A study published in early 2012&lt;ref name="Advocacy 2.0" /&gt; suggests that advocacy groups of varying political and ideological orientations operating in the United States are using [[social media]] to interact with citizens every day. The study surveyed 53 groups, that were found to be using a variety of social media technologies to achieve organizational and political goals:
*[[Facebook]] was the social media site of choice with all but one group noting that they use the site to connect with citizens. 
*[[Twitter]] was also popular with all but two groups saying that they use Twitter. 
*Other social media being used included [[YouTube]], [[Linkedin]], [[wiki]]s, [[Flickr]], [[Jumo]], [[Diigo]], [[Tumblr]], [[Foursquare]], [[Identi.ca]], [[Picasa]], and [[Vimeo]]. 
As noted in the study, "while some groups raised doubts about social media’s ability to overcome the limitations of weak ties and generational gaps, an overwhelming majority of groups see social media as essential to contemporary advocacy work and laud its [[democratizing]] function."&lt;ref name="Advocacy 2.0" /&gt;

In [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]], like all [[Northwest Caucasian languages]], morphology is the most important part of the grammar. An Adyghe word, besides that it has its own lexical meaning, sometimes, by the set of morphemes it is built of and by their aggregate grammatical meanings, can reproduce a sentence. For example, a verb by its set of morphemes can express subject's and object's person, place, time, manner of action, negative, and other types of grammatical categories. For example: къыпфэсхьыщтэп "I will not bring it for you" consists of these morphemes: къы-п-фэ-с-хьы-щт-эп – which have these literal meanings "from there (къы) you (п) for you (фэ) I (с) bring (хьы) will (attribute of the future tense - щт) not (эп)".

==Verbal Prefixes==
In Adyghe there are two kind of prefixes : Directional prefixes and informative prefixes. Directional prefixes express the direction of the verb while informative prefixes add additional information related to the verb like the location, the reason and the participants.

===Directional prefixes===
Directional prefixes express the movement of the object and the direction of the verb.

====Positional prefixes====
{{Main article|Adyghe_verbs#Positional_conjugation}}

====Cislocative (къэ~)====
{{Main article|Adyghe_verbs#Directional_prefix}}

====Towards (лъ~)====
The verbal suffix ~лъ (~ɬ) designates action directed towards someone or something. for example:

* макӏо /maːkʷʼa/ (s)he is going → лъэкӏо /ɬakʷʼa/ (s)he is going after; (s)he is following.
* мачъэ /maːt͡ʂa/ (s)he is running → лъэчъэ /ɬat͡ʂa/ (s)he is running after.
* мэкуо /makʷəwa/ (s)he is shouting → лъэкуо /ɬakʷəwa/ (s)he is shouting toward.
* маплъэ /mapɬə/ (s)he is looking → лъэплъэ /ɬapɬa/ (s)he is looking after.
* ео /jawa/ (s)he is hitting → лъэо /ɬawa/ (s)he is hitting toward.
* едзы /jad͡zə/ (s)he is throwing → лъедзы /ɬajd͡zə/ (s)he is throwing toward.
* ехьэ /jaħa/ (s)he is entering → лъехьэ /ɬajħa/ (s)he is entering after.
* мэӏабэ /maʔaːba/ (s)he is trying to reach → лъыӏэбэн /ɬəʔaban/ (s)he is trying to reach toward.

====Backwards (зэкӏ~)====
To indicate a verb that was done backwards, the prefix зэкӏ- (zat͡ʃʼ-) is added. It indicates that the verb was done toward behind the subject, for example:

* макӏо /maːkʷʼa/ (s)he is going → зэкӏакӏо /zat͡ʃʼaːkʷʼa/ (s)he is going backwards.
* мачъэ /maːt͡ʂa/ (s)he is running → зэкӏачъэ /zat͡ʃʼaːt͡ʂa/ (s)he is running backwards.
* маплъэ /mapɬə/ (s)he is looking → зэкӏаплъэ /zat͡ʃʼaːɬapɬa/ (s)he is looking backwards.
* едзы /jad͡zə/ (s)he is throwing → зэкӏедзы /zat͡ʃʼajd͡zə/ (s)he is throwing backwards.
* мэӏабэ /maʔaːba/ (s)he is trying to reach → зэкӏэӏабэ /zat͡ʃʼaʔaːba/ (s)he is trying to reach out backwards.

===Informative prefixes===
Informative prefixes add additional information related to the verb like the location, the reason and the participants.

====Definiteness (къэ~)====
The prefix къэ~ /qa~/ can also be used to add a tinge of definiteness to the verb. In this case the verb does not necessarily have to be done towards the speaker. For example:

:{|

|-
|colspan=4|"The boy went to work and '''worked'''."
|}

====Causative (гъэ~)====
The verbal suffix гъэ~ (ʁ~) designates causation; rendered by the verbs. It designates that the object was forced to, compelled to, made to, was ordered to, was allowed to, was permitted to, was given the opportunity to do something. Verbs receive an additional argument in the causative construction, i.e. their [[Valency (linguistics)|valence]] is increased by one. All Adyghe verbs can form the causative, including intransitives, transitives, and ditransitives.

Examples :
* кӏо! /kʷʼa/ go! → гъакӏу /ʁaːkʷʼ/ make him go!
* макӏо! /maːkʷʼa/ he is going → егъакӏо /jaʁaːkʷʼa/ he is making him go.
* къакӏу /qaːkʷʼ/ come! → къэгъакӏу /qaʁaːkʷʼ/ make him come back!
* ӏо /ʔʷa/ say! → гъаӏу /ʁaːʔʷ/ make him say!
* шхэ /ʃxa/ eat! → гъашх /ʁaːʃx/ make him eat!; feed him!
* машхэ /maːʃxa/ he is eating → егъашхэ /jaʁaːʃxa/ he is making him eat; he is feeding him.

By adding prefix гъэ- (ʁa-), it is possible to create transitive verbs from nouns, adjectives and intransitive verbs.

Examples :
* фабэ /faːba/ hot → гъэфаб /ʁafaːb/ make it hot; heat it
* дахэ /daːxa/ pretty → гъэдах /ʁadaːx/ make him/it pretty
* плъыжьы /pɬəʑə/ red → гъэплъыжь /ʁapɬəʑ/ make him/it red
* дышъэ /dəʂa/ gold → гъэдышъ /ʁadəʂ/ make him/it gold
* кӏэхьы /t͡ʃʼaħə/ long → гъэукӏэхьын /ʁat͡ʃʼaħən/ to make it long; to extend; to lengthen
* хьазыр /ħaːzər/ ready → гъэухьэзырын /ʁawħazərən/ to make it ready; to prepare

Adyghe allows "double causatives", i.e. the causative suffix can be added to a transitive verb that has already been derived by causativization: thus the causative гъэжъон /ʁaʒʷan/ "make boil, cook" can be causativized to гъэгъэжъон /ʁaʁaʒʷan/ "make someone cook", taking three arguments.

====Time (з~)====

To indicate the time a certain verb was done, the prefix з~ (z~) and the past tense suffix ~гъэ (~ʁa) are added. To indicate the time the verb gonna happen, the prefix з~ (z~) and the future tense suffix ~щтэ (~ɕta) are added. For example:

* аукӏэгъ /jaːwt͡ʃʼaʁ/ they killed him → заукӏыгъэр /zaːwt͡ʃʼəʁa/ the time they killed him is
* ышхэгъ /jəʃxaʁ/ (s)he ate it → зышхыгъэр /zəjʃxəʁar/ the time (s)he ate it is
* еплъэгъ /japɬaʁ/ (s)he watched it → зеплъыгъэр /zepɬəʁar/ the time he watched it is
* еплъыщт /japɬəɕt/ (s)he gonna watch it → зеплъыщтэр /zepɬəɕtar/ the time he gonna watch it is 
* мэкӏуагъ /makʷʼaːʁ/ (s)he went → зыкӏуагъэр /zəkʷʼaːʁar/ the time he went is

===[[Frequentative]] (~жь)===
The verbal suffix ~жь (~ʑ) designates recurrence/repetition of action. It can also be used to indicate an action that someone was doing before and now continuing it.

Examples :
* кӏо! /kʷʼa/ go → кӏожь /kʷʼaʑ/ go back
* къакӏу /qaːkʷʼ/ come → къакӏожь /qaːkʷʼaʑ/ come back
* къаӏу /qaːʔʷ/ say → къэӏожь /qaʔʷaʑ/ say again
* шхэ /ʃxa/ eat → шхэжь /ʃxaʑ/ eat again
* шхы /ʃxə/ eat it → шхыжь /ʃxəʑ/ eat it again; continue eating it

===While (~эу)===
To indicate an event that is happening while a certain verb is done, the suffix ~эу (-aw) is added to the verb. Usually this suffix is added to present tense verbs regardless if the whole sentence is about the past or future. For example:
* сэкӏо /sakʷʼa/ I am going → сыкӏоу /səkʷʼaw/ while I was going
* тэлажьэ /talaːʑa/ we are working → тылажьэу /talaːʑaw/ while we were working
* машхэ /maːʃxa/ (s)he is eating → машхэу /maːʃxaw/ while (s)he was eating

The verb with the suffix ~эу is usually followed by another verb that has a tense suffix indicating the time the sentence occurred. For example:
* сыкӏоу сылъэгъогъ /səkʷʼaw səɬaʁʷaʁ/ while I was going I saw.
* сыкӏоу сэлъэгъу  /səkʷʼaw saɬaʁʷə/ while I am going I see.
* сыкӏоу сылъэгъущт /səkʷʼaw səɬaʁʷəɕt/ while I go I will see.
* сыкӏоу сылъэгъущтэгъ /səkʷʼaw səɬaʁʷəɕtaʁ/ I was going to see while going.

|-
|colspan=3|"You called me '''while I was going to go''' somewhere."
|}

To indicate an action that occurred instead of another action, the action that did not happen is expressed in the present tense form and it gets the suffix ~эу and the negative infix ~мы~. For example:
* сымыкӏоу сычъагъ /səməkʷʼaw sət͡ʂaːʁ/ instead of going I ran.
* сымыкӏоу сэчъэ /səməkʷʼaw sat͡ʂa/ instead of going I am running.
* сымыкӏоу сычъэщт /səməkʷʼaw sət͡ʂaɕt/ instead of going I will run.
* сымыкӏоу сычъэщтэгъ /səməkʷʼaw sət͡ʂaɕtaʁ/ instead of going I was going to run.

To indicate something before a certain verb was done, the suffix ~эу and the negative infix ~мы~ are added. In this case the verb should also get the tense suffix indicating the time.

The Yurok are the largest [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribe]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], with approximately 6,000 members.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Lee|last=Romney |title=Archie Thompson dies at 93; Yurok elder kept tribal tongue alive |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/07/local/la-me-archie-thompson-20130407 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnt&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Spencer|title=Elder leaves legacy of language, love |url=http://www.triplicate.com/News/Local-News/Elder-leaves-legacy-of-language-love |work=[[Del Norte Triplicate]] |publisher= |date=2013-04-03 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson was the oldest living Yurok and the last known native-born, [[active speaker]] of the [[Yurok language]] at the time of his death in 2013.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was the last of about twenty Yurok elders who worked to revitalize the [[Yurok language]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He worked with academics and linguists to preserve and revitalize the language among younger Yurok generations throughout the 1990s and 2000s.  Those same linguists had originally predicted that Yurok would be extinct by 2010 and Thompson received much of the credit for saving the language.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Yurok is now taught in five high schools throughout [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]] and [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]] counties in [[northern California]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; While the language is still [[endangered language|endangered]], the effort to preserve Yurok is considered to be the most successful revitalization effort in [[California]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Childhood==
Thompson was born in a [[smokehouse]] on May 26, 1919 in Wa'tek Village (now known as [[Johnsons, California]]) in Humboldt County.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He was sent to a government school in [[Hoopa, California]], when he was five years old, where he was discouraged from speaking Yurok.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He returned home when he was eight years old, but his mother soon tried to put him up for adoption. He was taken in by his grandmother, Rosie Jack Hoppell.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;  Thompson was raised by his grandmother, who only spoke Yurok in her home, and his uncle. His relatives raised him in a traditional Yurok lifestyle.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; As a child, Thompson trapped ducks to fill feather mattresses, harvested [[seaweed]], fished for [[eulachon]] and [[salmon]], and tracked [[elk]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Education and military service==
Thompson earned [[varsity letter]]s in [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]] and [[track and field|track]] at [[Del Norte High School (Crescent City, California)|Del Norte High School]] in [[Crescent City, California]], from which he graduated in 1939.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Thompson was one of the first Native American students to have his name engraved on the Del Norte H.S. Coach's Cup, a school award which honors exception skills in multiple athletic sports.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; He attended the [[Sherman Institute]], a Native American [[boarding school]] in [[Riverside, California]], (now known as [[Sherman Indian High School]]) where he learned [[welding]]. He served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] and was sent to the South [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

==Personal life==
Thompson and his wife, Alta McCash, a member of the [[Karuk]] people, moved to Crescent City in 1959.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; The couple had eight children before Alta died from complications of a fall in 1968.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

'''Army creole''' was a term used in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'' to describe an English dialect spoken by military personnel. The dialect relies upon extensive use of profane [[intensifier]]s like "fuck" to gain attention in confusing circumstances requiring prompt, decisive action. Before 1980, basic training drill instructors, drill sergeants, military training instructors, and recruit division commanders used the dialect to increase the stress-levels of recruits, simultaneously emphasizing a recruit's subordinate status to the instructor, and increasing the probability of the recruit focusing on the instructions being provided in distracting situations. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Military personnel learning the dialect in training may use it to improve communication in stressful situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.military.com/NewContent/0%2C13190%2CDefensewatch_101904_Dodd%2C00.html |title=Has Marine Corps Training Gone Soft? |last=Dodd |first=Matthew |website=Military.com |publisher= |accessdate=22 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
After losing his uniform during boarding party combat aboard the sinking {{GS|U-94|1940|6}}, World War II [[Royal Canadian Navy]] officer [[Hal Lawrence]] was mistaken for a German prisoner of war following rescue by the crew of the {{USS|Lea|DD-118|6}} until Lawrence's fluency with the English military dialect convinced the American sailors of Lawrence's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Bloody War |author=Lawrence, Hal |publisher=Bantam Books |year=1979 |isbn=0-553-20692-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[AWOL]] entered the vocabulary during World War I, and acronyms became increasingly important to simplify descriptions of command structure and technical innovations of mid-20th-century warfare. Technical acronyms like radar and [[sonar]] have been widely adopted by conventional English dialects alongside profane acronyms like [[wikt:snafu|snafu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/a-history-of-acronyms/ |title=A History of Acronyms |last=Joyner |first=James |website=Outside the Beltway |publisher= |accessdate=25 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 20th-century attempts to reduce use of profanity during United States military recruit training increased reliance on imaginative verbal descriptions of violence as an alternative means of inducing stress and gaining attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dyer |first=Gwynne |authorlink =Gwynne Dyer |title =War |publisher =Crown Publishers |volume = |edition = |date =1985 |location =New York |pages =114—128 |isbn =0-517-55615-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4879">'''Audience Measurement &amp; Analytics Limited (aMap)''' is an overnight TV [[audience measurement]] system that used to provide data on [[television in India]] such as demographics, ownership, and viewership. It also runs the [[AmapDigital]], an overnight DTH ([[Direct-To-Home|Direct-to-home]]) TV [[audience measurement]] panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/realtime-trp-rating-starts-with-dth-viewers/357783/ Real-time TRP rating starts with DTH viewers] [[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]]&lt;/ref&gt; The data is now being provided by [[Broadcast Audience Research Council|Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India]]. 

==Background==
aMap began in 2004 on the basis of its research in [[India]], which showed that a number of opinion leaders felt that the industry required an audience measurement system.

aMap collects viewership data using Telecontrol VIII data collection units sourced from Telecontrol AG, and wireless connections using GSM modems.

==Activities==
aMap provides data on television ratings, [[gross rating points]] (GRP), reach, time spent, [[market share]], target groups, connectivity of channels, content analysis and more.

aMap has an overnight panel encompassing 6,000 metered homes.

aMap delivers data overnight so that yesterday’s data can be accessed today by the subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/803398.cms New TV rating system to challenge TAM monopoly] ''[[The Times of India]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2004/08/04/stories/2004080401660900.htm aMap brings TV ratings online] ''[[The Hindu]]'', ''[[Business Line]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Over and above the usual demographics like SEC, age, gender and C&amp;S availability, viewing data is also reported across [[durabl]]e ownership, [[vehicle]] ownership, type of TV, size of [[household]], occupation and education of individuals, monthly household income, [[children]] at home, chief wage earner, type of dwelling and more.

==aMap's methodology==
A team of Telecontrol experts, three professors at [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIM]] Ahmedabad has developed mathematical and statistical modules that help aMap undertaking a data health check every day. 

==aMap chosen as audience measurement currency by Eurodata TV worldwide==
Eurodata TV Worldwide has released, ‘One Television Year in the World’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediametrie.fr/webmail/newsletterDI/2010_02/ANTV.pdf One Television Year in the World 2010] Eurodata TV Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt; a handbook on TV audience measurement data across the world. 
 
“Eurodata TV Worldwide” is the international data bank of TV programmes and audiences, which now covers over 2000 channels throughout 80 territories and provides daily program information including: content, production, international distribution and the audience levels for targeted programs, all data emanating directly from the authorized institute based in each country. For India the institute is aMap. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiantelevision.com/mam/headlines/y2k9/mar/marmam87.php aMap chosen as audience measurement currency by Eurodata TV Worldwide] IndianTelevision.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity data==
aMap is the only system in India that gathers and disseminates connectivity data on an overnight basis, for three times of the day. To aMap’s subscribers, data is provided on an overnight basis by market and by band. The bands in which data is disseminated are Prime band, Colour Band, S Band, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Hyper Band.&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1229263 aMap tool to monitor broadcaster presence] ''[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA Money]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It gives the percentage of homes that receive a channel on a particular band.

==Audience Research Laboratory==
aMap collaborated with Optimum Media Solutions (OMS)–a media agency and Mudra Institute of Communications Ahmedabad (MICA) to set up the “aMap OMS Audience Research laboratory” at the [[Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad|MICA]] campus. The laboratory was inaugurated in 2006. The lab is operated under the directions of its advisory council. It works with experts in social sciences, psychology, [[anthropology]], [[advocacy]] and [[market research]] to explore [[audience]] research data.

==Lisu==
[[Lisu language|Lisu]] is part of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] family. [[Samuel Pollard]] and [[James O. Fraser]] prepared simple Christian literature while they were in the first stages of learning the Miao and Lisu languages, later moving on to translating the [[New Testament]]. 

In the Central Lisu dialect, Fraser, after creating the [[Fraser alphabet]], first worked on Mark and John. He then handed on the translation task to [[Allyn Cooke]] and his wife, Leila, coming back to help the team with revision in the mid 1930s. [[Isobel Miller Kuhn]] also worked on the translation. The New Testament was finished in 1938, and the complete Bible in 1968.

==Eastern Lisu/Lipo==
The New Testament in [[Eastern Lisu language|Eastern Lisu]], translated by [[George E. Metcalf]], was first published in 1951 in Hong Kong, however no copies ever got back to [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name="Tian"&gt;For background, see
Tian, Rukang. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mUVC1411DiwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Peaks of Faith: Protestant Mission in Revolutionary China]''. Leiden, The Netherlands; New York: E.J. Brill, 1993  pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Testament in Eastern Lisu is not yet fully translated.&lt;ref name="Covell"&gt;

==Miao==
[[Sam Pollard]] began work translating the New Testament into the [[Large Flowery Miao language]] of northeastern [[Yunnan]] in 1906,&lt;ref name="Covell " /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Norma. “Christianity and the Hua Miao: Writing and Power,” in Daniel H. Bays, ed ''Christianity in China from the Eighteenth Century to the Present'' (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1996), 138-157.&lt;/ref&gt; publishing parts of it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3APollard%2C+Samuel.&amp;dblist=638&amp;se=yr&amp;sd=asc&amp;fq=ap%3A%22pollard%2C+samuel%22+%3E+ln%3Ahmn&amp;qt=facet_ln%3A WorldCat Listing Search "Samuel Pollard Hmong"]&lt;/ref&gt; however died of typhoid in 1917 before he could finish it. Colleagues completed the work. The book was typeset in Japan, and eventually 85,000 copies were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Yu Suee Yan, "The Story of the Big Flowery Miao Bible," ''The Bible Translator ''62.4  (2011), [http://www.ubs-translations.org/fileadmin/publications/tbt/practical/BT-62-4-2011-Yu.pdf p. 209].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Miao Christian leaders decided to finish Pollard's work and translate the [[Old Testament]]. After discussion with the Yunnan Christian Council and the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]], semi-official organizations, a translation team was formed in [[Kunming]]. One question was whether to continue to use the [[Pollard script]], which was familiar to Christians from their reading of older materials, or to use the new script promulgated by the government in 1956. In the end, a modified version of the old script was used. Since Pollard's Miao characters are not included in [[Unicode]], standard computer word processing programs could not handle the text. Consultants from among the missionaries created keyboard shortcuts, but their unique characters could not be copied or the text checked. The new translation was launched at a ceremony in Kunming in September 2009, with an initial printing of 10,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, "The Story," pp. 209-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naxi==
The [[Gospel of Mark]] was translated into [[Naxi language|Naxi]], spoken in [[Yunnan]], by Elise Schapten using the [[Pollard script]] and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/gospel-according-to-st-mark-in-naxi/oclc/79445693&amp;referer=brief_results Gospel according to St. Mark in Naxi], tr. Samuel Pollard, Elise Schapten (British &amp; Foreign Bible Society, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wa==
The New Testament in [[Wa language|Wa]] was translated by Vincent Young and published in 1938 by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. The entire Bible was completed by Wa Christians in the nineties, and a trial version was published. Since the trial version, the Bible Society of Myanmar has been worked on a thorough revision of the text, and a finalized Wa Bible was published in April 2012. Amity Press has published the New Testament in Wa, available on [https://www.bible.com/bible/325/jhn.1.wcl YouVersion].

==Xishuangbanna Dai==
The Bible was first translated into [[Xishuangbanna Dai language|Xishuangbanna Dai]] in 1933.

[[File:Dissen Dešno Bogumił Šwjela.JPG|thumb|Bust in [[Dissen-Striesow|Dissen]] where Šwjela worked for 28 years as a pastor]]
Krystijan '''Bogumił Šwjela''' (also spelled "Schwela" and "Schwele") (5 September 1873 in [[Schorbus]], [[Drebkau]] – 20 May 1948 in [[Naumburg]]) was a [[Wends|Wendish]]/[[Sorbs|Sorbian]] Protestant clergyman and ethnic activist in the Lower [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] region. 

He also acted as a linguist and journalist, was chairman of the ''Masica Serbska'' organization and co-founder of the Sorbian umbrella organization [[Domowina]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Šwjela advocated the preservation of [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian language]] and culture in the Lower Lausitz.

==Life==
After Šwjela had in 1898 completed his theological studies, he sought a long time for a pastoral position in the Lower Lausitz. Beginning in 1904, he was curate at the Wendish church in [[Cottbus]], where he preached regularly in Lower Sorbian, rather than in German.

His ordination took place at a time when the oppression of Sorbian language and culture by the Prussian authorities peaked. Education in Sorbian at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Cottbus was stopped in 1888 and later religious instruction in the language was also stopped. The older Sorbian intellectuals were initially paralyzed. Šwjela, of the nationally conscious young Sorbian movement, was motivated strongly to work for the cultural interests of the Sorbs. Things came to a head in the Cottbus parish where he continued to minister in Sorbian. In 1908, Swjela had to leave the city because he had refused to hold sermons in German only. He was then several years as vicar in Nochten  before he came to the [[Dissen-Striesow|Dissen]] parish in 1913.

Šwjela's father, Kito Šwjela (1836–1922), had edited the Lower Sorbian newspaper ''Bramborski Serbski casnik'' beginning in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Following in his father's journalistic footsteps, Šwjela wrote for the Lower Sorbian newspapers and magazines ''Pratyja'', ''Bramborski Casnik'', and ''Woßadnik'', whose main author was himself. He founded the series ''Serbska knigłownja'' (Sorbian Library), in which he published especially poetry but also published literary, religious and popular scientific works by different authors. Šwjela published his textbooks for teaching the Lower Sorbian language in two parts, in 1906 and 1911.

Šwjela succeeded in motivating young Sorbs in his region to work on behalf of their traditional national cultural work. He strengthened them in their self-image by contacts in the Sorbian core areas of Oberlausitz.

In 1912 Šwjela co-founded the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina. He suggested the name for the association, and was also elected Deputy Chairman. In the interwar period Šwjela collected the Sorbian geographical name in the Cottbus area and worked on a Lower Sorbian dictionary. Neither work was allowed to be printed until after his death.

With the increased power of the National Socialists (Nazis) from 1933 onward, the pressure on the small Slavic minority in Germany increased. The imposition of prohibitions of Sorbian language and some cultural expression began in Domowina in 1937, initiating open persecution of Sorbian life. From that year onward, no publications in Sorbian were allowed to be published. While in most Protestant congregations, services were not held in Sorbian, Šwjela refused to be intimidated. During the Nazi era, he led in the renovation of the church in Dissen, where the Sorbian quoations were again painted on the balcony. He preached in Dissen and [[Sielow]] in Sorbian, even though this was forbidden. On April 7, 1941, the Gestapo informed the leading Wendish pastor that all the Wendish pastors' association had been dissolved and its assets seized.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hymn singing, teaching, and preaching was required to be in German, both officially and in private. Therefore, Šwjela was forced to retire and was banished from the Lower Sorbian area of Lausitz to [[Rudolstadt]]. In his exile, Šwjela remained committed to the Sorbian cause. Together with earlier companions, including the journalist [[Mina Witkojc]] and the painter [[Fritz Lattke]], he developed an important foundation for the revival of the Lower Sorbian culture in the postwar period.

In 1946 he was involved in the re-establishment of the Lower Sorbian branch of Domowina and since 1947 he was editor of the Lower Sorbian newspaper ''Nowy Casnik''. Before he found a new apartment in the Lower Sorbian region, Šwjela died in 1948 from a stroke on a railway journey from Rudolstadt to Cottbus. In Cottbus, a street was named in his honor him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6031">The '''Charles Babbage Institute''' is a research center at the [[University of Minnesota]] specializing in the history of [[information technology]], particularly the history of digital computing, programming/software, and computer networking since 1935. The institute is named for [[Charles Babbage]], the nineteenth-century English inventor of the programmable computer.&lt;ref&gt;William Aspray, "Leadership in Computing History: Arthur Norberg and the Charles Babbage Institute." [[IEEE Annals of the History of Computing]], 29(4) (October–December 2007): 16–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located in [[Elmer L. Andersen]] Library at the [[University of Minnesota Libraries]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].

==Activities==
In addition to holding important historical archives, in paper and electronic form, its staff of historians and archivists conduct and publish historical and archival research that promotes the study of the history of information technology internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/staff_publications.pdf|title=CBI Staff Publication List|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBI also encourages research in the area and related topics (such as [[archiving|archival methods]]); to do this, it offers graduate fellowships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/tfellowship.html|title=CBI Research Program: Tomash Fellowship|website=www.cbi.umn.edu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travel grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/research/ntravelfund.html|title=CBI Research Program: Norberg Travel Fund|website=www.cbi.umn.edu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizes conferences and workshops, and participates in public programming. It also serves as an international clearinghouse of resources for the history of information technology.

Also valuable for researchers are its extensive collection of [[oral history]] interviews, more than 400 in total.  Oral histories with important early figures in the field have been conducted by CBI staff and collaborating colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11299/59493|title=Oral history interviews|website=hdl.handle.net|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Owing to the poorly documented state of many early computer developments, these oral histories are immensely valuable documents.  One author called the set of CBI oral histories "a priceless resource for any historian of computing."&lt;ref&gt;M. Mitchell Waldrop, ''The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal'' (2001): quote p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of CBI's oral histories are transcribed and available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/index.html Oral histories], Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archival collection also contains [[manuscript]]s; records of [[professional association]]s; corporate records (including the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] corporate records and the [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]] corporate records, among many others); [[trade publication]]s; [[periodicals]]; manuals and product literature for older systems, photographic material (stills and moving), and a variety of other rare reference materials.

It is now a center at the [[University of Minnesota]], and is located on its [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]], Minneapolis campus, where it is housed in the [[Elmer L. Andersen]] Library on the West Bank.

==History==
CBI was founded in 1978 by [[Erwin Tomash]] and associates as the ''International Charles Babbage Society'', and initially operated in [[Palo Alto, California]]. 

In 1979, the ''[[American Federation of Information Processing Societies]]'' (AFIPS) became a principal sponsor of the Society, which was renamed the Charles Babbage Institute.

In 1980, the Institute moved to the [[University of Minnesota]], which contracted with the principals of the Charles Babbage Institute to sponsor and house the Institute.  In 1989, CBI became an organized research unit of the University.

'''Chewa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|w|ə}}), also known as '''Nyanja''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|j|æ|n|dʒ|ə}}), is a [[language]] of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] family. The [[noun class]] prefix ''chi-'' is used for languages,&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' ''Kiswahili'' for the [[Swahili language]].&lt;/ref&gt; so the language is usually called '''Chichewa''' and '''Chinyanja''' (spelled ''Cinianja'' in Mozambique). In Malawi, the name was officially changed from Chinyanja to Chichewa in 1968 at the insistence of President [[Hastings Banda|Hastings Kamuzu Banda]] (himself of the [[Chewa people|Chewa]] tribe), and this is still the name most commonly used in Malawi today.&lt;ref&gt;Kishindo (2001), p.265.&lt;/ref&gt; In Zambia, the language is generally known as Nyanja or Cinyanja/Chinyanja '(language) of the lake' (referring to [[Lake Malawi]]).&lt;ref&gt;For spelling Chinyanja cf. Lehmann (1977). Both spellings are used in Zambia Daily Mail articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chewa belongs to the same language group ([[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone N|Guthrie Zone N]]) as [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]], [[Sena language|Sena]],&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), pp.21ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nsenga language|Nsenga]].

== Distribution ==
Chewa is the most widely known language of [[Malawi]], spoken mostly in the Central and Southern Regions of that country.&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is also one of the seven official African languages of [[Zambia]], where it is spoken mostly in the Eastern Province. It is also spoken in [[Mozambique]], especially in the provinces of [[Tete province|Tete]] and [[Niassa, Mozambique|Niassa]], as well as in [[Zimbabwe]] where, according to some estimates, it ranks as the third-most widely used local language, after [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6PSaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq ''Malawian Writers and Their Country'', edited by Bridgette Kasuka, published on Lulu.com, page 143]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the 55 languages featured on the [[Voyager Golden Record|Voyager spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/greetings.html "Voyager Greetings"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Chewa were a branch of the [[Maravi]] people who lived in the Eastern Province of [[Zambia]] and in northern Mozambique as far south as the River Zambezi from the 16th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Marwick (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newitt (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Chewa" (in the form ''Chévas'') itself is first recorded by [[António Gamitto]], who at the age of 26 in 1831 was appointed as second-in-command of an expedition from [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] to the court of King [[Kazembe]] in what is now Zambia. His route took him through the country of King Undi west of the Dzalanyama mountains, across a corner of present-day Malawi and on into Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;Marwick (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Later he wrote an account including some ethnographic and linguistic notes and vocabularies. According to Gamitto, the Malawi or Maravi people (''Maraves'') were those ruled by King Undi south of the Chambwe stream (not far south of the present border between Mozambique and Zambia), while the Chewa lived north of the Chambwe.&lt;ref&gt;Marwick (1963), p.383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a few words recorded by Gamitto, the first extensive record of the Chewa language was made by [[Johannes Rebmann]] in his ''Dictionary of the Kiniassa Language'', published in 1877 but written in 1853-4. Rebmann was a missionary living near Mombasa in Kenya, and he obtained his information from a Malawian slave, known by the Swahili name Salimini, who had been captured in Malawi some ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Rebman (1877), preface.&lt;/ref&gt; Salimini, who came from a place called Mphande apparently in the Lilongwe region, also noted some differences between his own dialect (which he called ''Kikamtunda'', the language of the plateau) and the Maravi dialect (''Kimaravi'') spoken further south; for example, the Maravi gave the name ''mombo'' to the tree which he himself called ''kamphoni''.&lt;ref&gt;Rebmann (1877) s.v. M'ombo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first grammar, ''A Grammar of the Chinyanja language as spoken at Lake Nyasa with Chinyanja–English and English–Chinyanja vocabulary'', was written by Alexander Riddel in 1880. Further early grammars and vocabularies include ''A grammar of Chinyanja, a language spoken in British Central Africa, on and near the shores of Lake Nyasa'' by George Henry (1891) and M.E. Woodward's ''A vocabulary of English–Chinyanja and Chinyanja–English: as spoken at Likoma, Lake Nyasa'' (1895). The whole Bible was translated into the [[Likoma Island]] dialect of Nyanja by [[William Percival Johnson]] and published as ''Chikalakala choyera: ndicho Malangano ya Kale ndi Malangano ya Chapano'' in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''The UMCA in Malawi'', p 126, James Tengatenga, 2010: "Two important pieces of work have been accomplished during these later years. First, the completion by Archdeacon Johnson of the Bible in Chinyanja, and secondly, the completed Chinyanja prayer book in 1908."&lt;/ref&gt; Another Bible translation, known as the ''Buku Lopatulika ndilo Mau a Mulungu'', was made in a more standard Central Region dialect about 1900-1922 by missionaries of the Dutch Reformed Mission and Church of Scotland with the help of some Malawians. This has recently (2016) been reissued in a revised and slightly modernised version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblesociety-malawi.org/index.php/2016/02/24/buku-lopatulika-has-been-revised/ Bible Society of Malawi  newsletter, 24 February 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early grammar, concentrating on the Kasungu dialect of the language, was [[Mark Hanna Watkins]]' ''A Grammar of Chichewa'' (1937). This book, the first grammar of an African language to be written by an American, was a work of cooperation between a young black PhD student and young student from Nyasaland studying in Chicago, [[Hastings Banda|Hastings Kamuzu Banda]], who in 1966 was to become the first President of the Republic of Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Lewis (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This grammar was also the first to mark the tones of the words.

In recent years the language has changed considerably, and a dichotomy has grown between the traditional Chichewa of the villages and the language of city-dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;Batteen (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

===Vowels===

Chewa has five vowel sounds: {{IPA|/a, ɛ, i, ɔ, u/}}. Long or double vowels are sometimes found, e.g. ''áákúlu'' 'big' (class 2), ''kufúula'' 'to shout'.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.201.&lt;/ref&gt; When a word comes at the end of a phrase, its penultimate vowel tends to be lengthened,&lt;ref&gt;Downing &amp; Pompino-Marschall (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; except for non-Chewa names and words, such as ''Muthárika'' or ''ófesi'', in which the penultimate vowel always remains short.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The added 'u' or 'i' in borrowed words such as ''láputopu'' 'laptop' or ''íntaneti'' 'internet' tends to be silent or barely pronounced.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Consonants===

Chewa consonants are sometimes followed by a vowel, sometimes by ''w'', and sometimes by ''y'':

*''ba'', ''kha'', ''ga'', ''fa'' etc.
*''mphwa'', ''khwa'', ''gwa'', ''fwa'' etc.
*''thya'', ''mya'', ''fya'', ''nya'' etc.

The place of ''bya'' is taken by the palatalised affricate ''bza'', and the place of ''gya'' is taken by ''ja''.

Some consonants can also be preceded by a [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] nasal:
*''mba'', ''nkha'', ''mfa'', ''nsa'', ''ngwa'' etc.

The possible consonant combinations can thus be arranged on a table as follows:

The spelling used here is that introduced in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;See Kishindo (2001), p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the one generally in use in the Malawi at the present time, replacing the ''Chinyanja Orthography Rules'' of 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes on the consonants'''

*In most words, Chewa ''b'' and ''d'' (when not [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalised]]) are pronounced [[Implosive consonant|implosively]], by sucking slightly.&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), p.15; Atkins (1950), p.208.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also an explosive ''b'' and ''d'', mostly found in foreign words, such as ''bála'' 'bar', ''yôdúla'' 'expensive' (from Afrikaans ''duur'') (in contrast to the implosive ''b'' and ''d'' in native words such as ''bála'' 'wound' and ''yôdúla'' 'which cuts'). An explosive ''d'' is also found in ''kudínda'' 'to stamp (a document)' and ''mdidi'' 'confident step'.
*The affricate sounds ''bv'' and ''pf'' were formerly commonly heard but are now generally replaced by ''b'' and ''f'', e.g. ''(b)vúto'' 'problem', ''(p)fúpa'' 'bone'. In the ''Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja'' dictionary produced by the University of Malawi, the spellings ''bv'' and ''pf'' are not used in any of the headwords, but ''bv'' is used two or three times in the definitions.
*The combination ''bz'' is described by Atkins as an "alveolar-labialised fricative".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.208.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination sounds something like {{IPA|[bʒ]}} or {{IPA|[bzʲ]}}. Similarly ''ps'' is pronounced something like {{IPA|[pʃ]}} or {{IPA|[psʲ]}}.
*The sounds written ''ch'', ''k'', ''p'' and ''t'' are pronounced less forcibly than the English equivalents and generally without aspiration. Stevick notes that in relaxed speech, the first three are sometimes replaced with the voiced fricatives {{IPA link|ʒ||[}}, {{IPA link|ɣ||[}} and {{IPA link|β||[}}, and ''t'' can be heard as a voiced flap.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick (1965), p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the combination ''-ti'' (e.g. ''angáti?'' 'how many'), ''t'' may be lightly aspirated.
*''h'' is also used in Chewa but mostly in foreign words such as ''hotéra'' 'hotel', ''hátchi'' 'horse', ''mswahála'' 'monthly allowance given to chiefs'.
*''j'' is described by Scotton and Orr as being pronounced "somewhat more forward in the mouth" than in English and as sounding "somewhere between an English ''d'' and ''j''&amp;#x200A;".&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''l'' and ''r'' are the same phoneme,&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.207; Stevick et al. (1965), p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt; representing a retroflex tap {{IPA link|ɽ||[}}, something between {{IPA link|l||[}} and {{IPA link|r||[}}. The spelling rules are to write 'r' after 'i' or 'e', except after a prefix, as in ''lilíme'' 'tongue'.&lt;ref&gt;Kishindo (2001), p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''m'' is syllabic {{IPA link|m̩||[}} in words where it is derived from ''mu'', e.g. ''m'balé'' 'relative' (3 syllables), ''m'phunzitsi'' 'teacher' (4 syllables), ''anáḿpatsa'' 'he gave him' (5 syllables). However, in class 9 words, such as ''mphátso'' 'gift', ''mbale'' 'plate', or ''mfíti'' 'witch', and also in the class 1 word ''mphaká'' 'cat', the ''m'' is pronounced very short and does not form a separate syllable. In Southern Region dialects of Malawi, the syllabic ''m'' in words like ''mkángo'' 'lion' is pronounced [[homorganic consonants|homorganically]], i.e. {{IPA|[ŋ̍.ká.ᵑɡo]}} (with three syllables), but in the Central Region, it is pronounced as it is written, i.e. {{IPA|[m̩.ká.ᵑɡo]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''n'', in combinations such as ''nj'', ''ntch'', ''nkh'' etc., is assimilated to the following consonant, that is, it is pronounced {{IPA link|ɲ||[}} or {{IPA link|ŋ||[}} as appropriate. ''ny'' is pronounced {{IPA link|ɲ||[}},&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; In words of class 9, such as ''njóka'' 'snake' or ''nduná'' 'minister' it is pronounced very short, as part of the following syllable. It can also be syllabic, when it is contracted from ''ndi'' 'it is' or ''ndí'' 'and', e.g. ''ń'kúpíta'' 'and to go'; also in the remote past continuous tense, e.g. ''ankápítá'' 'he used to go'. In some borrowed words such as ''bánki'' or ''íntaneti'' the combinations ''nk'' and ''nt'' with non-syllabic ''n'' can be found but not in native words.
*''ng'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ŋg]}} as in 'finger' and ''ng’'' is pronounced {{IPA link|ŋ||[}} as in 'singer'. Both of these consonants can occur at the beginning of a word: ''ngoma'' '[[kudu]]', ''ng'ombe'' 'cow or [[ox]]'.
*''w'' in the combinations ''awu'', ''ewu'', ''iwu'', ''owa'', ''uwa'' (e.g. ''mawú'' 'voice', ''msewu'' 'road', ''liwú'' 'sound', ''lowa'' 'enter', ''duwa'' 'flower') although often written is generally not pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ŵ'', a "closely lip-rounded {{IPA link|w||[}} with the tongue in the close-i position",&lt;ref&gt;Atkins (1950), p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; was formerly used in Central Region dialects but is now rarely heard, usually being replaced by 'w'. ("It is doubtful whether the majority of speakers have {{IPA link|β||/}} in their phoneme inventory" (Kishindo).)&lt;ref&gt;Kishindo (2001), p.270.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol 'ŵ' is no longer used in books and newspapers. In the dialects that use the sound, it is found only before a, i, and e, while before o and u it becomes {{IPA link|w||[}}.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''zy'' (as in ''zyoliká'' 'be upside down like a bat') can be pronounced {{IPA link|ʒ||[}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tones===
{{Main article|Chichewa tones}}
Like most other Bantu languages, Chewa is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language; that is to say, the pitch of the syllables (high or low) plays an important role in it. Tone is used in various ways in the language. First of all, each word has its own tonal pattern, for example:&lt;ref&gt;Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''munthu'' {{IPA|[mu.ⁿtʰu]}} 'person' (Low, Low)
*''galú'' {{IPA|[ɡa.ɽú]}} 'dog' (Low, High)
*''mbúzi'' {{IPA|[ᵐbú.zi]}} 'goat' (High, Low)
*''chímanga'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃí.ma.ᵑɡa]}} 'maize' (High, Low, Low)

Usually there is only one high tone in a word (generally on one of the last three syllables), or none. However, in compound words there can be more than one high tone, for example:
*''chákúdyá'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃá.kú.ɗʲá]}} 'food' (High, High, High; derived from ''chá'' + ''kudyá'', 'a thing of eating')

A second important use of tone is in the verb. Each tense of the verb has its own characteristic tonal pattern (negative tenses usually have a different pattern from positive ones).&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), pp.195; 203-4; 244ff; Mtenje (1987), p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the present habitual has high tones on the initial syllable and the penultimate, the other syllables being low:
*''ndí-ma-thandíza'' 'I (usually) help'
*''ndí-ma-píta'' 'I (usually) go'

The recent past continuous, on the other hand, has a tone on the third syllable:
*''ndi-ma-thándiza'' 'I was helping'
*''ndi-ma-píta'' 'I was going'

Tones can also indicate whether a verb is being used in a [[independent clause|main clause]] or in a [[dependent clause]] such as a relative clause:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), pp.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''sabatá yatha'' 'the week has ended'
*''sabatá yátha'' 'the week which has ended (i.e. last week)'

A third use of tones in Chewa is to show phrasing and sentence [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. For example, immediately before a pause in the middle of a sentence the speaker's voice tends to rise up; this rise is referred to as a [[boundary tone]].&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; Other intonational tones are sometimes heard, for example a rising or falling tone at the end of a yes-no question.&lt;ref&gt;Hullquist (1988), p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Noun classes===
Chewa nouns are divided for convenience into a number of classes, which are referred to by the Malawians themselves by names such as "Mu-A-",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja.&lt;/ref&gt; but by Bantu specialists by numbers such as "1/2", corresponding to the classes in other [[Bantu languages]]. Conventionally, they are grouped into pairs of singular and plural. However, irregular pairings are also possible, especially with loanwords; for example, ''bánki'' 'bank', which takes the concords of class 9 in the singular, has a plural ''mabánki'' (class 6).&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

When assigning nouns to a particular class, initially the prefix of the noun is used. Where there is no prefix, or where the prefix is ambiguous, the concords (see below) are used as a guide to the noun class. For example, ''katúndu'' 'possessions' is put in class 1, since it takes the class 1 demonstrative ''uyu'' 'this'.&lt;ref&gt;Kunkeyani (2007), p.154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nouns belong to one class only, e.g. ''tomáto'' 'tomato(es)' (class 1), ''mowa'' 'beer' (class 3), ''malayá'' 'shirt(s)' (class 6), ''udzudzú'' 'mosquito(es)' (class 14), and do not change between singular and plural. Despite this, such words can still be counted if appropriate: ''tomáto muwíri'' 'two tomatoes', ''mowa uwíri'' 'two beers', ''malayá amódzi'' 'one shirt', ''udzudzú umódzi'' 'one mosquito'.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2015) s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Class 11 (Lu-) is not found in Chewa. Words like ''lumo'' 'razor' and ''lusó'' 'skill' are considered to belong to class 5/6 (Li-Ma-) and take the concords of that class.&lt;ref&gt;''Mtanthauziramawu wa Chinyanja''.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Mu-A- (1/2): ''munthu'' pl. ''anthu'' 'person'; ''mphunzitsi'' pl. ''aphunzitsi'' 'teacher'; ''mwaná'' pl. ''aná'' 'child'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(1a/2): ''galú'' pl. ''agalú'' 'dog'. Class 1a refers to nouns which have no ''m-'' prefix.&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}The plural ''a-'' is used only for humans and animals. It can also be used for respect, e.g. ''aphunzitsi áthu'' 'our teacher'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(1a/6): ''kíyi'' pl. ''makíyi'' 'key'; ''gúle'' pl. ''magúle'' 'dance'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(1a): ''tomáto'' 'tomato(es)'; ''katúndu'' 'luggage, furniture'; ''feteréza'' 'fertilizer' (no pl.)
*Mu-Mi- (3/4): ''mudzi'' pl. ''midzi'' 'village'; ''mténgo'' pl. ''miténgo'' 'tree'; ''moyo'' pl. ''miyoyo'' 'life'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(3): ''mowa'' 'beer'; ''móto'' 'fire'; ''bowa'' 'mushroom(s)' (no pl.)
*Li-Ma- (5/6): ''dzína'' pl. ''maína'' 'name'; ''vúto'' pl. ''mavúto'' 'problem'; ''khásu'' pl. ''makásu'' 'hoe'; ''díso'' pl. ''masó'' 'eye'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}Often the first consonant is softened or omitted in the plural in this class.&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(6): ''madzí'' 'water', ''mankhwála'' 'medicine', ''maló'' 'place' (no sg.)
*Chi-Zi- (7/8): ''chinthu'' pl. ''zinthu'' 'thing'; ''chaká'' pl. ''zaká'' 'year'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(7): ''chímanga'' 'maize'; ''chikóndi'' 'love' (no pl.)
*I-Zi- (9/10): ''nyumbá'' pl. ''nyumbá'' 'house'; ''mbúzi'' pl. ''mbúzi'' 'goat'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(10): ''ndevu'' 'beard'; ''ndíwo'' 'relish'; ''nzerú'' 'intelligence' (no sg.)&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(9/6): ''bánki'' pl. ''mabánki'' 'bank'
*Ka-Ti- (12/13): ''kamwaná'' pl. ''tianá'' 'baby'; ''kanthu'' pl. ''tinthu'' 'small thing'&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(12): ''kasamalidwe'' 'method of taking care'; ''kavinidwe'' 'way of dancing' (no pl.)&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(13): ''tuló'' 'sleep' (no sg.)
*U-Ma- (14): ''usíku'' 'night time'; ''ulimi'' 'farming'; ''udzudzú'' 'mosquito(es)' (no pl.)&lt;br /&gt;{{space}}{{space}}(14/6): ''utá'' pl. ''mautá'' 'bow'

Infinitive class:
*Ku- (15): ''kuóna'' 'to see, seeing'

Locative classes:
*Pa- (16): ''pakamwa'' 'mouth'
*Ku- (17): ''kukhosi'' 'neck'
*Mu- (18): ''mkamwa'' 'inside the mouth'

===Concords===
Pronouns, adjectives, and verbs have to show agreement with nouns in Chichewa. This is done by means of prefixes, for example:
*''Uyu ndi mwaná wángá'' 'this is my child' (class 1)
*''Awa ndi aná ángá'' 'these are my children' (class 2)
*''Ichi ndi chímanga chánga'' 'this is my maize' (class 7)
*''Iyi ndi nyumbá yángá'' 'this is my house' (class 9)

Class 2 (the plural of class 1) is often used for respect when referring to elders. According to Corbett and Mtenje, a word like ''bambo'' 'father', even though it is singular, will take plural concords (e.g. ''bambo '''a'''nga akuyenda, ndiku'''wa'''ona'' 'my father is walking, I see him'); they note that to use the singular object-marker ''-mu-'' would be 'grossly impolite'.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Mtenje (1987), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various prefixes are shown on the table below:

Although there are 17 different noun classes, because some of them share concords there are in fact only 12 sets of prefixes.

In the examples below, the concords are illustrated with nouns of classes 1 and 2.

====Demonstratives====
*''uyu ndaní?'' 'who is this?'; ''awa ndaní?'' 'who are these?' (or: 'who is this gentleman?' (respectful))
*''mwaná uyu'' 'this child'; ''aná awa'' 'these children'
*''mwaná uyo'' 'that child'; ''aná awo'' 'those children'

These are often shortened to ''mwanáyu'', ''mwanáyo'', ''anáwa'', ''anáwo''.

====Concords with ye, (w)o====
*''iyé'' 'he/she'; ''iwó'' 'they' (or 'he/she' (respectful))
*''ndiyé'' 'it is he/she'; ''ndiwó'' 'it is they'
*''Maláwi yénse'' 'the whole of Malawi'; ''aná ónse'' 'all the children'
*''yékha'' 'on his/her own'; ''ókha'' 'on their own'
*''mwaná yemwéyo'' 'that same child'; ''aná omwéwo'' 'those same children'
*''mwaná áliyensé'' 'every child'; ''aná awíri álionsé'' 'every two children'

In class 2 and 6, ''o-'' often becomes ''wo-'' (e.g. ''wónse'' for ''ónse'' etc.).

====Subject prefix====
*''mwaná ápita'' 'the child will go'; ''aná ápita'' 'the children will go'

The perfect tense (''wapita'' 'he has gone') has different prefixes from the other tenses.

The relative pronoun ''améne'' and demonstrative ''améneyo'' use the same prefixes as a verb:
*''mwaná améne'' 'the child who'; ''aná améne'' 'the children who'
*''mwaná améneyo'' 'that child'; ''aná aménewo'' 'those children'
*''nyumbá iméneyo'' 'that house'; ''nyumbá ziménezo'' 'those houses'

====Object infix (m(u), (w)a)====
*''ndamúona'' 'I have seen him'; ''ndawáona'' 'I have seen them' (sometimes shortened to ''ndaáona'')

====Numerals (m(u), a)====
Numeral prefixes are used with numbers one to five, and the words ''angáti?'' 'how many', ''angápo'' 'several':
*''mwaná mmódzi'' 'one child'; ''aná awíri'' 'two children'

====Concords with u, a====
*''mwaná uja'' 'that child (the one you know)'; ''aná aja'' 'those children'
*''mwezí uno'' 'this month (we are in)'; ''masíkú ano'' 'these days'
*''mwaná wapita'' 'the child has gone; ''aná apita'' 'the children have gone'
*''mwaná wá Mphátso'' 'Mphatso's child'; ''aná á Mphátso'' 'Mphatso's children'
*''mwaná wángá'' 'my child'; ''aná ángá'' 'my children'
*''mwaná wókóngola'' 'a beautiful child'; ''aná ókóngola'' 'beautiful children'
*''mwaná wína'' 'a certain child, another child'; ''aná éna'' 'certain children, other children'
*''mwaná weníwéní'' 'a real child'; ''aná eníéní'' 'real children'

====Adjectives====
Certain adjectives (''-kúlu'' 'big', ''-ng'óno'' 'small'; ''-(a)múna'' 'male', ''-kázi'' 'female'; ''-táli'' 'long', ''-fúpi'' 'short'; ''-wisi'' 'fresh') combine the possessive concord (''wá'') and the number concord (''m''):
*''mwaná wáḿkúlu'' 'a big child'; ''aná áákúlu'' 'big children'
*''mwaná wáḿng'óno'' 'a small child'; ''aná ááng'óno'' 'little children'
*''mwaná wámwámúna'' 'a male child'; ''aná áámúna'' 'male children'
*''mwaná wáḿkázi'' 'a male child'; ''aná áákázi'' 'male children'

===Historic changes===
Early dictionaries, such as those of [[Johannes Rebmann|Rebmann]], and of Scott and Hetherwick, show that formerly the number of concords was greater. The following changes have taken place:
*Class 2 formerly had the concord ''ŵa-'' (e.g. ''ŵanthu aŵa'' 'these people'), but this has now become ''a-'' for most speakers.
*Class 8, formerly using ''dzi-'' (Southern Region) or ''bzi/bvi/vi-'' (Central Region) (e.g. ''bzaká bziŵíri'' 'two years'),&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Hetherwick (1929), s.v. Ibsi; Rebmann (1877) s.v. Chiko, Psiwili/Pfiwili; Watkins (1937), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; has now adopted the concords of class 10.
*Class 6, formerly with ''ya-'' concords (e.g. ''mazira aya'' 'these eggs'),&lt;ref&gt;Rebmann (1877) s.v. Aya, Mame, Mano, Yonse; cf Goodson (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; now has the concords of class 2.
*Class 11 (''lu-'') had already been assimilated to class 5 even in the 19th century, although it still exists in some dialects of the neighbouring language [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]]. 
*Class 14, formerly with ''bu-'' concords (e.g. ''ufá bwángá'' 'my flour'),&lt;ref&gt;Rebmann (1877), s.v. Ufa; Watkins (1937), pp. 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt; now has the same concords as class 3.
*Class 13 (''ti-'') had ''tu-'' in Rebmann's time (e.g. ''tumpeni utu'' 'these small knives'). This prefix still survives in words like ''tuló'' 'sleep'.

In addition, classes 4 and 9, and classes 15 and 17 have identical concords, so the total number of concord sets (singular and plural) is now twelve.

==Verbs==
{{see|Chichewa tenses}}

===Formation of tenses===
[[Grammatical tense|Tenses]] in Chichewa are differentiated in two ways, by their tense-marker (or tense-[[infix]]), and by their tonal pattern. Sometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and differ in their tonal pattern alone. In the following examples, the tense-marker is underlined:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp.39ff, 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For tones, Mtenje (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-&lt;u&gt;ku&lt;/u&gt;-gúla'' 'I am buying'
*''ndí-&lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt;-gúla'' 'I usually buy'
*''ndi-&lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt;-gúla'' 'I was buying', 'I used to buy'
*''ndí-&lt;u&gt;dzá&lt;/u&gt;-gula'' 'I will buy (tomorrow or in future)'
*''ndí-&lt;u&gt;ká&lt;/u&gt;-gula'' 'I will buy (when I get there)'

One tense has no tense-marker:
*''ndí-gula'' 'I will buy (soon)'

Tenses can be modified further by adding certain other infixes, called 'aspect-markers', after the tense-marker. These are ''-má-'' 'always, usually' ''-ká-'' 'go and', ''-dzá'' 'come and' or 'in future', and ''-ngo-'' 'only', 'just'. These infixes can also be used on their own, as tense-markers in their own right (compare the use of ''-ma-'' and ''-dza-'' in the list of tenses above). For example:
*''ndi-ku-má-gúlá'' 'I am always buying'&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-ná-ká-gula'' 'I went and bought'&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.115.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndí-má-ngo-gúla'' 'I just usually buy'&lt;ref&gt;Salaun, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compound tenses, such as the following, are also found in Chichewa:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''nd-a-khala ndí-kú-gúla'' 'I have been buying'

===Subject-marker===
Chichewa verbs (with the exception of the [[imperative mood]] and [[infinitive]]) begin with a [[prefix]] agreeing grammatically with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp.19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This prefix is referred to by some grammarians as the 'subject-marker'.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''(ife) &lt;u&gt;ti&lt;/u&gt;-ku-píta'' 'we are going'
*''mténgo &lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;-a-gwa'' (for *''&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;-a-gwa'') 'the tree has fallen'&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject-marker can be:
*Personal: ''ndi-'' 'I', ''u-'' 'you (singular)', ''a-'' 'he, she, they', ''ti-'' 'we', ''mu-'' 'you (plural or polite)'. (In the perfect tense, the subject-marker for 'he, she' is ''w-'': ''w-a-pita'' 'he has gone'.)&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Impersonal: ''a-'' (class 1, 2 or 6), ''u-'' (class 3 or 14), ''i-'' (class 4 or 9), ''li-'' (class 5), etc.
*Locative: ''ku-'', ''pa-'', ''mu-''

An example of a locative subject-marker might be:
*''m'madzí &lt;u&gt;mu&lt;/u&gt;li nsómba'' 'in the water there are fish'&lt;ref&gt;Salaun, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object-marker===
An object-marker can also optionally be added to the verb; if one is added it goes immediately before the verb-stem:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp.26ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndí-ma-&lt;u&gt;ku&lt;/u&gt;-kónda'' 'I love you' (''ndi'' = 'I', ''ku'' = 'you')

The object-marker can be:
*Personal: ''-ndi-'' 'me', ''-ku-'' 'you', ''-mu-'' or ''-m'-'' 'him, her', ''-ti-'' 'us', ''-wa-'' 'them', 'him/her (polite)'. For 'you (plural or polite)',as well as ''-ku-'' ''-ni'' is added to the end of the verb, e.g. ''ndí-ma-&lt;u&gt;ku&lt;/u&gt;-kónda-&lt;u&gt;ni&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I love you (plural or polite)'.
*Impersonal: ''-mu-'' (class 1), ''-wa-'' (class 2), ''-u-'' (class 3 or 14), etc.
*Locative: e.g. ''m'nyumba mu-ku-&lt;u&gt;mú&lt;/u&gt;-dzíwa'' 'you know the inside of the house';&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.64.&lt;/ref&gt; but usually a locative suffix is used instead: ''nd-a-oná-&lt;u&gt;mo&lt;/u&gt;'' 'I have seen inside it'
*Reflexive: ''-dzi-'' 'himself', 'herself', 'themselves', 'myself', etc.

===Variety of tenses===
{{main|Chichewa tenses}}
Chewa has a large number of tenses, some of which differ in some respects from the tenses met with in European languages. For example, for referring to events which took place earlier today, either of the following two tenses may be used:
*''nd-a-gula'' 'I have bought' (Perfect)
*''ndi-na-gúla'' 'I bought' or 'I had bought' (Recent Past)

The difference between them is that the first one implies that the result of the event is still relevant (namely that the speaker still have the thing which I he or she bought), whereas the second one is used either when the result of the action isn't relevant (for example, if the speaker is narrating a series of events),&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), pp.110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; or when there is a definite implication that the result no longer holds (namely in this case that although the speaker bought the thing, he or she no longer has it). Thus ''wapita'' means 'he has gone (and not yet returned)' while ''anapíta'' means 'he went (but has now returned)'. 

A similar pair of tenses are used when referring to events of yesterday or earlier:
*''ndi-ná-gula'' (or ''ndi-dá-gula'') 'I bought' or 'I have bought' (Remote Perfect)
*''ndí-ná-a-gúla'' (or ''ndí-dá-a-gúla'') 'I bought' or 'I had bought' (Remote Past)

The first of these would usually imply that the speaker still has the thing that was bought, while the second implies that he or she no longer has it. Thus the second verb of each pair, unlike the English simple past, which is neutral in implication, generally implies that the effect of the action is no longer evident.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), pp.55-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they belong to the type of tense known as [[discontinuous past]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two pairs are not quite parallel, since for narrating a series of events of earlier today, the Recent Past would be used, but for events of yesterday or earlier, the Remote Perfect.

In addition to the distinctions described above, Chichewa also distinguishes perfective from imperfective aspect in every tense; thus for example, ''ndi-na-gúla'' 'I bought' (event) is distinct from ''ndi-ma-gúla'' 'I was buying' (ongoing situation). In the present tense only, the imperfective is further subdivided into progressive and habitual aspects:
*''ndi-ku-khála ku Lilongwe'' 'I am living (temporarily) in Lilongwe'
*''ndí-ma-khála ku Lilongwe'' 'I live (permanently) in Lilongwe'

There are several future tenses. One future tense not found in European languages is the ''-ká-'' future, which 'might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause':&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndí-ká-gula'' 'I will buy' (if I go there, or when I get there)

The following tenses refer to potentiality as well as time:
*''ndi-&lt;u&gt;nga&lt;/u&gt;-gule'' 'I can buy'
*''ndi-&lt;u&gt;kadá&lt;/u&gt;-gula'' 'I would have bought'

There are also two [[subjunctive]] mood tenses, as follows:
*''ndi-gulé'' 'I should buy'
*''ndi-&lt;u&gt;zí&lt;/u&gt;-gúlá'' 'I should be buying'

===Negative tenses===
Negative tenses, if they are main verbs, are made with the prefix ''sí-''. The tones of negative verbs usually differ from those of positive ones, and generally put a tone on the penultimate syllable, except in the present simple tense.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p.244ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative of the ''-ná-'' tense has the ending ''-e'' instead of ''-a'':
*''sí-ndí-gula'' 'I don't buy'
*''si-ndi-dza-gúla'' 'I won't buy'
*''sí-ndi-na-gúle'' 'I didn't buy'

Infinitives, participial verbs, and the subjunctive make their negative with ''-sa-'', which is added after the subject-prefix instead of before it, and has a tone on the penultimate syllable:
*''ndi-sa-gúle'' 'I should not buy'&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p.222.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ó-sa-gúla!'' 'do not buy'

===Dependent clauses===
The tenses used in most kinds of dependent or subordinate clauses (except those starting with ''kutí'' 'that') differ from those used in main clauses. Dependent verbs often have a tone on the first syllable. Sometimes this change of tone alone is sufficient to show that the verb is being used in a dependent clause.&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), pp.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; Compare for example:
*''a-ku-gúla'' 'he is buying'
*''á-kú-gúla'' 'when he is buying' or 'who is buying'

Other commonly used dependent tenses are the following (the last of these is toneless):&lt;ref&gt;Salaun, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndí-tá-gúla'' 'after I bought'
*''ndí-sa-na-gúle'' 'before I buy'
*''ndi-ka-gula'' 'when / if I buy'

===Extensions===
After the verb stem one or more extensions may be added. The extensions modify the meaning of the verb, for example:
*''gul-a'' 'buy'
*''gul-'''ir'''-a'' 'buy for' or 'buy with'
*''gul-'''ir'''-'''an'''-a'' 'buy for one another'
*''gul-'''ik'''-á'' 'get bought', 'be for sale'
*''gul-'''its'''-a'' 'cause to get bought, i.e. sell' 
*''gul-'''its'''-'''idw'''-a'' 'be sold (by someone)'

Extensions which have an intensive or stative meaning tend to have a high tone, e.g. ''yang'anitsitsá'' 'look carefully', ''pitirirá'' 'carry on, keep going', ''guliká'' 'be saleable, get bought'; however, there are some exceptions such as ''oneka'' 'seem'.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999b).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most extensions, apart from the reciprocal ''-ana'' 'one another', have two possible forms, e.g. ''-ira/-era'', ''-itsa/-etsa'', ''-ula/-ola''. The forms with ''e'' and ''o'' are used if the verb stem is monosyllabic or has an ''e'' or ''o'' in it, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Salaun, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''dy-er-a'' 'eat with', 
*''t'''o'''n-ol-a'' 'remove grains of corn from the cob'
*''bw'''e'''-re-ra'' 'come back'
*''ch'''e'''p-ets-a'' 'reduce'

The forms with ''i'' and ''u'' are used with the verb stem has ''a'', ''i'', or ''u'':
*''g'''u'''l-its-a'' 'sell'
*''s'''u'''ngun-ul-a'' 'melt (something)'
*''k'''a'''n-ik-á'' 'fail to happen'

An urban variety of Nyanja, sometimes called Town Nyanja, is the lingua franca of the Zambian capital [[Lusaka]] and is widely spoken as a second language throughout Zambia. This is a distinctive Nyanja dialect with some features of [[Nsenga language|Nsenga]], although the language also incorporates large numbers of English-derived words, as well as showing influence from other Zambian languages such as [[Bemba language|Bemba]]. Town Nyanja has no official status, and the presence of large numbers of loanwords and colloquial expressions has given rise to the misconception that it is an unstructured mixture of languages or a form of slang.

The fact that the standard Nyanja used in schools differs dramatically from the variety actually spoken in Lusaka has been identified as a barrier to the acquisition of literacy among Zambian children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=E|title=Investigating bilingual literacy: Evidence from Malawi and Zambia (Education Research Paper No. 24)|year=1998|publisher=Department for International Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concords in Town Nyanja differ from those in Chichewa described above. For example, classes 5 and 6 both have the concord ''ya-'' instead of ''la-'' and ''a-''; class 8 has ''va-'' instead of ''za-''; and 13 has ''twa-'' instead of ''ta-''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Lubasi, &amp; Bwalya (2013), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the subject and object marker for "I" is ''ni-'' rather than ''ndi-'', and that for "they" is ''βa-'' (spelled "ba-") rather than ''a-''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Lubasi &amp; Bwalya (2013) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke - 1989 "This quotation and other observations about Zhang Xinxin's life and thought are based on personal discussions with the ... 16 Sang Ye, "About Chinese Profiles," Chinese Profiles: 371. l At least one Chinese critic has remarked on the fruitful "&lt;/ref&gt; revised as ''[[Chinese Lives]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Chinese lives: an oral history of contemporary China Xinxin Zhang, Ye Sang, William John Francis Jenner - 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mao's Children in New China: Voices from the Red Guard Generation'' - Page xxvi Yarong Jiang, David W. Ashley - 2000 "Sang Ye and Zhang Xinxin, eds, Chinese Profiles (San Francisco: China Books and Periodicals, 1987), which contains interviews with 100 ordinary Chinese citizens, some of whom are from the Red Guard generation. One of the earliest works of this type was B. Michael Frolic, Mao's People: Sixteen Portraits of Life in Revolutionary China 1981"&lt;/ref&gt;

The author interviewed thirty-six citizens of the [[People's Republic of China]]; each chapter of the book is a transcript of each interview turned into a single narrative flow, as if the interviewed person is talking alone during the whole interview, without interruptions from the journalist.

Some people the author has interviewed are:
* a new tycoon
* a worker coming to [[Beijing]] from the countryside
* a young athlete
* the founder of a private orphanage
* a prostitute
* a computer hacker

It was translated into Italian in 2007.

'''''A Claim of Right for Scotland''''' was a document crafted by the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention|Campaign for a Scottish Assembly]] in 1988, declaring the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty]] of the Scottish people. It was signed by all then-serving [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrat|Liberal Democrat]] MPs, with the exception of [[Tam Dalyell]] (Labour),&lt;ref name="UKPA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://breakingnews.heraldscotland.com/breaking-news/?mode=article&amp;site=et&amp;id=N0275681319574307425A|title=SNP confirms Claim of Right move|date=26 October 2011|publisher=The Press Association|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a strident opponent of [[devolution]]. The list of signatories included several MPs who would later attain high office, including future prime minister [[Gordon Brown]], future chancellor [[Alistair Darling]], and future leaders of the Liberal Democrats [[Charles Kennedy|Charlie Kennedy]] and [[Menzies Campbell]].

The '''Claim of Right''' was signed at the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly Hall]], on [[the Mound]] in [[Edinburgh]] - on 30 March 1989 by 58 of [[Scotland]]'s 72 [[List of MPs for Scottish constituencies 2005-|Members of Parliament]], 7 of Scotland's 8 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, 59 out of 65 [[Regions and districts of Scotland|Scottish regional, district and island councils]], and numerous [[Scottish political parties|political parties]], [[Church architecture in Scotland|churches]] and other [[Civil society|civic organisations]], e.g., [[Scottish Trades Union Congress|trade unions]]. 

The Claim was part of a process which led to [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to a new [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/scottish_parliament_opening/380989.stm |title=Claim of Right passes to parliament |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=29 June 1999 |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its title was a reference to the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], an [[Act of the Parliament of Scotland]] which limited the power of the Scottish monarch (at the time, [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]) in much the same manner as the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights]] passed the same year.

In October 2011 the [[Scottish Government]] announced that the Claim of Right will be brought before the Scottish Parliament to allow MSPs to re-endorse the claims of the sovereignty of the Scottish people.&lt;ref name="UKPA" /&gt; The Claim of Right was debated in the Scottish Parliament on 26th January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/sp/?id=2012-01-26.38.0 | title=Claim of Right | date=26 January 2012 | work=TheyWorkForYou.com | accessdate=2018-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Claim==

The Claim of Right reads-

{{quote|We, gathered as the Scottish Constitutional Convention, do hereby acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of Government best suited to their needs, and do hereby declare and pledge that in all our actions and deliberations their interests shall be paramount.

We further declare and pledge that our actions and deliberations shall be directed to the following ends:

To agree a scheme for an Assembly or Parliament for Scotland;

To mobilise Scottish opinion and ensure the approval of the Scottish people for that scheme; and

To assert the right of the Scottish people to secure implementation of that scheme.}}

==Legal significance==
The Claim of Right has never had or claimed any legal force, but some imbue it with constitutional significance in relation to Scotland.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On 4 July 2018, the House of Commons officially endorsed the principles of the Claim of Right, agreeing that the people of Scotland are sovereign and that they have the right to determine the best form of government for Scotland's needs.

===Research===
McNeill specializes in [[psycholinguistics]], and in particular [[Research#Scientific research|scientific research]] into the relationship of [[language]] to [[thought]], and the [[gesture]]s that accompany discourse.&lt;ref name="UniversityOfChicagoMcNeill"/&gt;

In his research, McNeill has studied videoed discourses of the same stimulus stories being retold "together with their co-occurring spontaneous gestures" by "speakers of different languages, [...] by non-native speakers at different stages of learning English, by children at various ages, by adolescent [[Hearing impairment|deaf]] children not exposed to language models, and by speakers with neurological impairments ([[Aphasia|aphasic]], [[Cerebral hemisphere|right hemisphere]] damaged, and [[split-brain]] patients)."&lt;ref name="UniversityOfChicagoMcNeill"/&gt;

This and other research has formed the subject matter of a number of books which McNeill has written through his career.

==Research on the psychology of language and gesture==

===Central idea===
The "growth point" is a key theoretical concept in McNeill’s approach to [[psycholinguistics]] and is central to his work on [[gestures]], specifically those spontaneous and unwitting hand movements that regularly accompany informal speech.  The growth point, or GP, posits that gestures and speech are unified and need to be considered jointly.  For McNeill, gestures are in effect (or, McNeill would say, in reality) the speaker’s thought in action, and integral components of speech, not merely accompaniments or additions.  Much evidence supports this idea, but its full implications have not always been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, David. 1992. ''Hand and Mind.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, David. 2005. ''Gesture and Thought.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, Adam. 2004. ''Gesture: visible action as utterance.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth Points and multi-modality===
McNeill argues that thought is multimodal: both vocal-linguistic and manual-gestural, and the resulting semiotic opposition fuels change.  In terms of [[semiotics]], as a kind of sign, a gesture is "global" (in that the meanings of the "parts"—the hand shapes, space, direction, articulation–-depend in a top-down fashion on the meaning of the whole) and "synthetic" (in that several meanings are bundled into one gesture).  Gestures, when they combine, do not form what  [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] terms syntagmatic values; they paint a more elaborate picture but contain nothing corresponding to the emerging syntagmatic value of a noun as a direct object when combined with a verb (“hit the ball”, where “ball”, by itself, is not a direct object).  Speech contrasts on each of these points: it is bottom-up, analytic and combinatoric.

The synchronization of speech and gesture is the key to this theoretical GP unit. Gestures offer one kind of symbol, language a different kind.  These two kinds, when synchronized in a GP, bring semiotically opposite modes of thinking together at the same time. This synchrony of opposites sets in motion a dialectic of imagery and linguistic form that is the "fuel" of the dynamic dimension of language in which forms emerge, say their piece, and disappear.  The gestures coincide with speech, and the resulting dialectic is a model of this dimension.

In one example, a speaker describes an episode in a cartoon she has watched: “He goes '''up thróugh''' the pipe this time.”  (In this example, boldface type indicates where the gesture movements occurred; the accent indicates speech emphasis.)  At “up” the hand rises upward; at “thróugh” the fingers spread outward to create an interior space.  These movements take place concurrently and in synchrony with “up thróugh”, the linguistic package that carries the same meanings.  This creates a joint realization of the idea of upward motion and interiority, with interiority highlighted in both gesture (the flayed-out fingers) and speech (the accented vowel).  But the speech divides the event into semantic units: a directed path (“up”), plus the idea of interiority (“through”), which must be combined to obtain the composite meaning of the whole.  In the gesture, this composite meaning is fused into one symbol and the semantic units are simultaneous.  The synchronized speech and gesture are co-expressive but semiotically non-redundant.

A GP forms a single mental package or idea unit out of these semiotically opposed components.  McNeill argues that this semiotic opposition is unstable, and that the processes initiated to resolve it, called "unpacking", propel thought and speech forward.  This creates a new form of human cognition that animates language and gives it a dynamic dimension.

===Minimal units===
Speech and gesture, taken together, comprise minimal units of human linguistic cognition.  Following [[Lev Vygotsky]] in defining a "unit" as the smallest package that retains the quality of being a whole, in this case the whole of a gesture-language unity, McNeill calls the minimal psychological unit a Growth Point because it is meant to be the initial pulse of thinking-for-(and while)-speaking, out of which a dynamic process of organization emerges.  The linguistic component of speech categorizes the visual and actional imagery of the gesture; the imagery of the gesture grounds the linguistic categories in a visual spatial frame.

===Non-modularity===
The GP theory contrasts to "modular" theories such as those of Willem Levelt ([[:de:Willem Levelt]]), which posit a sequence in which thinking precedes and speech follows. A sequence of thinking before speaking has no place in the growth point. In a GP, speech and thought are inseparable, unified, and simultaneous.

===Connections to phenomenology===
McNeill employs the concept of “material carriers”, a phrase used by Vygotsky&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, Lev. S. 1987. ''Thought and Language''. Edited and translated by E. Hanfmann and G. Vakar (revised and edited by A. Kozulin). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the embodiment of meaning in enactments or material experiences to further develop the concepts of Mead’s Loop and the GP.  A material carrier enhances the symbolization’s representational power.  The concept implies that the gesture, "the actual motion of the gesture itself", is a dimension of meaning.  This enhancement is possible if the gesture "is" the very image; not an "expression" or "representation" of it, but "it".  From this viewpoint, a gesture is an image in its most developed: that is, its most materially, naturally embodied form.  The absence of a gesture is the converse, an image in its least material form.   The material carrier concept thus helps explain how an imagery-language dialectic can take place in absence of gesture. When no gesture occurs, there is still global-synthetic imagery in a dialectic with linguistic categorization, but we experience it at the "lowest level of materialization".  It is not an alteration of the dialectic of its essentials-–the simultaneous rendering of meaning in opposite semiotic modes-–but a bleached version of it.

McNeill furthers this conception of the material carrier by turning to [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] for insight into the duality of gesture and language.  Gesture, the instantaneous, global, nonconventional component, is “not an external accompaniment” of speech, which is the sequential, analytic, combinatoric component; it is not a “representation” of meaning, but instead meaning “inhabits” it.  Merleau-Ponty links gesture and existential significance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The link between the word and its living meaning is not an external accompaniment to intellectual processes, the meaning inhabits the word, and language ‘is not an external accompaniment to intellectual processes’.  We are therefore led to recognize a gestural or existential significance to speech. … Language certainly has inner content, but this is not self-subsistent and self-conscious thought.  What then does language express, if it does not express thoughts?  It presents or rather it ''is'' the subject’s taking up of a position in the world of his meanings. [emphasis in the original]&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice.  1962.  ''Phenomenology of Perception''.  Colin Smith, trans.  London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For McNeill, the GP is a mechanism geared to this “existential significance” of speech, this “taking up a position in the world”.  Gesture, as part of the GP, is inhabited by the same “living meaning” that inhabits the word (and beyond, the whole of a discourse).  A deeper answer to the query, therefore-–when we see a gesture, what are we seeing?--is that we see part of the speaker’s current cognitive being, "her very mental existence", at the moment it occurs. This too is part of the origin of language by Mead's Loop (and explains the gestural leakage of lies.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, Paul.  1981.  "Mistakes when deceiving."  ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', pp. 269-278.&lt;/ref&gt;  By performing the gesture, a core idea is brought into concrete existence and becomes part of the speaker’s own existence at that moment.  A gesture is not a representation, or is not only such: it is a form of being.  From a first-person perspective, the gesture is part of the immediate existence of the speaker.  Gestures (and words, etc., as well) are themselves thinking in one of its many forms, not only expressions of thought, "but thought, i.e., cognitive being, itself".  To the speaker, gesture and speech are not only "messages" or communications, but are a way of cognitively existing, of cognitively being, at the moment of speaking.

To make a gesture, from this perspective, is to bring thought into existence on a concrete plane, just as writing out a word can have a similar effect.  The greater the felt departure of the thought from the immediate context, the more likely is its materialization in a gesture, because of this contribution to being.  Conversely, when "newsworthiness" is minimal materialization diminishes and in some cases disappears, even though a GP is active; in these cases gestures may cease while (empty) speech continues, or vice versa, speech ceases and a vague gesture takes place.  Thus, gestures are more or less elaborated and GPs more or less materialized depending on the importance of material realization to the "existence" of the thought.

===Language origin and Mead’s Loop===
In terms of the origin of language, the GP "predicts" (of the remote past) that whatever evolved led to a GP system of semiotic oppositions.  This provides an empirical test of all theories on the [[origin of language]]: Can the theory in question explain the observed speech-gesture-thought unity of human cognition?  The widely popular "gesture-first" theory, according to which language began as pure gesture without speech, fails this test.  In fact, it fails it twice, predicting what did not evolve (that speech supplanted gesture) and not predicting what did evolve (our own speech-gesture unity).  An alternative, which McNeill calls "Mead's Loop" after the philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]], explains this unity. It too claims that gesture was essential to the origin of language, but not because it was "primitive" or more accessible.  Rather, it says that speech could not have evolved without gesture; neither could gesture have evolved without speech.  Speech and gesture originated together, at the same time, in response to the same selection pressures.

===Mirror neuron "twist"===
G. H. Mead said that a gesture is significant when it arouses in the person making it the same response it arouses in others (which explains why gestures occur face-to-face and over the phone but not to a tape recorder).&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George Herbert. 1974. ''Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist'' (C. W. Morris ed. and introduction). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mead's Loop, [[mirror neurons]] underwent a "twist" whereby they came to respond to one’s own gestures as if they came from someone else: this is what evolved.  The "twist" works because it brings the significance of one’s own gestures into the same areas of the brain where speech is being orchestrated. Gesture imagery co-opts the orchestration of speech.  The result is units of speech and gesture as the GP envisions. Uniquely in the animal kingdom, gestures came to orchestrate movements of the vocal tract, transforming the "vegetative" system of eating and breathing into an organ of speaking. According to Mead's Loop, this role of imagery in speech orchestration is a major reason why we gesture as we speak.

===Natural selection===
Mead’s Loop and the mirror neuron "twist" would be naturally selected in scenarios where sensing one’s own actions as social is advantageous. For example, in imparting information to infants, where it gives the adult the sense of being an instructor as opposed to being just a doer with an onlooker, as is the case with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, Michael. 1999. ''The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Entire cultural practices of childrearing depend upon this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, Lev. S. 1978. ''Mind in Society.'' M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (eds.). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John-Steiner, Vera, Panofsky, Carolyn P. and Smith, Larry W. (eds.). 1994. ''Sociocultural Approaches to Language and Literacy: An interactionist perspective.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-awareness as an agent is necessary for this advantage to take hold.  For Mead's Loop to have been selected the adult must be sensitive to her own gestures as social actions.

The link between the GP and self-aware agency also appears in children’s language development, which can be linked to the origin of language in a version of the long-dismissed "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" hypothesis of [[recapitulation theory]].  McNeill considers that when something emerges in current-day ontogenesis only at a certain stage of development, the original natural selection of the feature (if there was any) might have taken place in a similar psychological milieu in phylogenesis.  This opens a window onto the mindset of the creature in which the Mead's Loop "twist" was evolving.  As a mode of reasoning, it exploits the fact that children’s intellectual status is not fixed but changing.  Thus, McNeill argues, we look for new states that seem pegged to steps in the ontogenesis of GPs and Mead's Loop underlying them, and consider these steps as possible signals from ancient phylogenesis.  Evidence shows that self-aware agency could be such a signal.  The GP emerges around age 3 or 4 years, which is also about when children first become aware of themselves as agents, since before that age the speech and gestures of children have “…the character of ‘sharing’ experiences ''with'' the other rather than of ‘communicating’ messages ''to'' the Other”, as put by Heinz Werner and Bernard Kaplan in their 1963 book, ''Symbol Formation''.  The [[theory of mind]] (which is really awareness of other perspectives) also emerges about this time, and likewise depends on self-aware agency.

'''David Owen (Dewi Wyn o Eifion)''' (1784 &amp;ndash; 17 January 1841) was a Welsh poet and farmer. He is noted for developing two traditional Welsh verse forms: the [[awdl]] and the [[englyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-OWEN-DAV-1784.html Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
A dispute over an award, between him and members of the [[Gwyneddigion Society]], led to him largely give up poetry in 1823, although he did resume it in 1832. He had long been drawn to the [[Baptists|Baptist]] faith and converted to it a year before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Owen, David (1784-1841)|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Dullay is derived from the name Dullay-speaking groups use for the [[Weito River]]. Other terms that have been used for this language family in scientific literature are '''Werizoid''' (from the former administrative name of the area inhabited by Dullay speakers) and '''Qawko''' (from the word "man" in Dullay languages).

[[File:Enric Valor Plaque at Universitat de València.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A plaque to Valor i Vives at the [[University of Valencia]].]]
'''Enric Valor i Vives''' ({{IPA-ca|enˈriɡ vaˈloɾ|va}}; 1911 in [[Castalla]], [[province of Alicante|Alicante]] – 2000 in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] narrator and grammarian who made one of the most important contributions to the re-collection and recovery of [[Valencian]] lexicography and its standardization in the [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]].

==Biography==
Enric Valor was born in 1911, the son of an affluent family from [[Castalla]], in the Valencian [[comarca]] of ''l'[[Alcoià]]''. In 1930, at the age of nineteen, he became a journalist in [[Alicante]] writing in the [[satire|satirical]] newspaper ''El Tio Cuc'', in Valencian. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] he started to become politically active. His main demand was for [[autonomous status]] for the [[Land of Valencia]]. He was also at this time working in the [[Valencia, Spain|city of Valencia]] in the nationalist [[newspaper]]s  ''La República de les Lletres'', ''El Camí'' and ''El País Valencià''. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out he supported the Spanish Republic.

[[Francoist Spain|After the war]], he cut back on his political activities to concentrate on [[literature]]. At the beginning of the 1950s he started to compile "''[[rondalles]]''", a type of [[Folk culture|folk]] narrative, which were published as ''Rondalles valencianes'' (1950–1958). During the 1960s he returned to underground political activities involving Valencian [[nationalism]] and, as a result, he became a [[political prisoner]] of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Spanish State]] from 1966 to 1968. Once out of prison he founded almost the first [[magazine]] in Valencian in the postwar period; ''Gorg'' ("Whirl", in Valencian). When the Francoist State ended, Enric Valor was able to spread freely his opinions and literary works. He became honoured with many important literary and linguistic awards from all over the ''[[Països Catalans]]''. During the 1990s there was a move among some Valencian cultural groups to propose Valor as a candidate for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, but it didn't come to fruit.

Valor then died in 2000.

==Linguistic works==

His first linguistic work was in the weekly magazine ''El Tio Cuc'' based in [[Alicante]]. He was contributing to the development of the Catalan-Valencian-Balearic Dictionary (such a Catalan inter-dialectal dictionary) under the directorship of [[Francesc de Borja i Moll]], which included a Southern Valencian [[lexicon]]. Like [[Carles Salvador]] and [[Sanchis Guarner]], he was one of the principal promoters of the standardisation of Valencian by means of works such as ''Curs de la llengua valenciana'' (''Gorg'', 1961), ''Millorem el llenguatge'' (1971), and ''Curso medio de gramática catalana referida especialmente al País Valenciano'' (1973).

In 1983 he released ''La flexió verbal'' where he summarized the widely dialectised Valencian verbs. This work became the principal reference for the normative use of verbs, and is used as essential teaching material for Valencian pupils.

==Literary works==

His most known work is ''Rondalles valencianes'' (1950–1958), where 36 valencian popular tales are collected as a literary narration. Other works with a similar style are ''Narracions de la Foia de Castalla'' (1953), and ''Meravelles i picardies'' (1964–1970).

Valor was also a writer. His first novel was ''L'ambició d'Aleix'' which was started between the 1940s and 1950s, but it was being re-written until its release in 1960. Perhaps his most important novel work is ''Cicle de Cassana'' which is made up of three novels: ''Sense la terra promesa'' (1960), ''Temps de batuda'' (1983), and ''Enllà de l'horitzó'' (1991). The ''Cicle de Cassana'' trilogy aims for the regaining of collective memory between 1916 and 1939. In 1982 he published ''La idea de l'emigrant''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7154">In [[discrete geometry]], the '''Erdős distinct distances problem''' states that between {{math|''n''}} distinct points on a plane there are at least {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;1 &amp;minus; [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|o]](1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} distinct distances. It was posed by [[Paul Erdős]] in 1946 and proven by {{harvtxt|Guth|Katz|2015}}.

==The conjecture==
In what follows let {{math|''g''(''n'')}} denote the minimal number of distinct distances between {{math|''n''}} points in the plane. In his 1946 paper, Erdős proved the estimates
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n-3/4}-1/2\leq g(n)\leq c n/\sqrt{\log n}&lt;/math&gt;
for some constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. The lower bound was given by an easy argument. The upper bound is given by a &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; square grid. For such a grid, there are &lt;math&gt;O( n/\sqrt{\log n})&lt;/math&gt; numbers below ''n'' which are sums of two squares; see [[Landau–Ramanujan constant]]. Erdős conjectured that the upper bound was closer to the true value of ''g''(''n''), and specifically that &lt;math&gt;g(n) = \Omega(n^c)&lt;/math&gt; holds for every {{math|''c'' &lt; 1}}.

==Partial results==
Paul Erdős' 1946 lower bound of  {{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} was successively improved to:
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Moser|1952}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;5/7&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Chung|1984}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/5&lt;/sup&gt;/log ''n'')}} {{harv|Chung|Szemerédi|Trotter|1992}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/5&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Székely|1993}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;6/7&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Solymosi|Tóth|2001}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;(4''e''/(5''e'' &amp;minus; 1)) &amp;minus; ɛ&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Tardos|2003}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;((48 &amp;minus; 14''e'')/(55 &amp;minus; 16''e'')) &amp;minus; ɛ&lt;/sup&gt;)}} {{harv|Katz|Tardos|2004}}
*{{math|1=''g''(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''/log ''n'')}} {{harv|Guth|Katz|2015}}

==Higher dimensions==
Erdős also considered the higher-dimensional variant of the problem: for ''d''≥3 let ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') denote the minimal possible number of distinct distances among ''n'' point in the ''d''-dimensional Euclidean space. He proved that {{math|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and conjectured that the upper bound is in fact sharp, i.e., {{math|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = &amp;Theta;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} . {{harvtxt|Solymosi|Vu|2008}} obtained the lower bound {{math|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = &amp;Omega;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/''d'' - 2/''d''(''d''+2)&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

{{main|Kinship}}

'''Eskimo kinship''' is a category of [[Kinship and descent|kinship]] used to define [[family]] organization in [[anthropology]]. Identified by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in his 1871 work ''Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family'', the Eskimo system was one of six major kinship systems (Eskimo, [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian]], [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois]], [[Crow kinship|Crow]], [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], and [[Sudanese kinship|Sudanese]]).{{cite needed|date=October 2011}}

==Joint family==
The [[joint family]] system places no distinction between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives, instead, it focuses on differences in kinship distance (the closer the relative is, the more distinctions are made). The system emphasizes the [[nuclear family]], identifying directly only the mother, father, brother, and sister.  All other relatives are grouped together into categories. It uses both [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]] and [[descriptive]] terms, differentiating between gender, generation, lineal relatives (relatives in the direct line of descent), and collateral relatives (blood relatives not in the direct line of descent). The Eskimo system is defined by its "cognatic" or "bilateral" emphasis - no distinction is made between patrilineal and matrilineal relatives.

Parental siblings are distinguished only by their sex (Aunt, Uncle). All children of these individuals are lumped together regardless of sex (Cousins).  Unlike the [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian system]], Ego's parents are clearly distinguished from their siblings.
[[Image:Eskimo-kinship-chart.svg|center|700px|Graphic of the Eskimo kinship system]]

==Occurrence==
The Eskimo system is relatively common among the world's kinship systems, at about 10% of the world's societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthro.palomar.edu/kinship/kinship_5.htm Nature of Kinship]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now common in most Western societies (such as those of [[Europe]] or [[Americas]]). In addition, it is found among a small number of [[Hunter-gatherer|food-foraging]] peoples such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] tribe of [[Africa]] and the Eskimos/Inuit for whom it is named.

The system is widely used in non-unilineal societies, where the dominant relatives are the immediate family. In most Western societies, the nuclear family represents an independent social and economic group, which has caused the emphasis on the immediate kinship. The tendency of families in Western societies to live apart also reinforces this.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Native American name controversy}}
[[Eskimo#terminology|The term "Eskimo"]] is considered pejorative in Canada, and has been replaced there by [[Inuit#terminology|the term "Inuit"]]. The former remains in use in Alaska, though less so than in past decades. In Canada, the term "Inuit kinship" is therefore widely used instead of "Eskimo kinship".

[[File:Bale hooks and baling twine.jpg|thumb|Two hay hooks and some [[baling twine]]]]

'''Hay bucking''', or "bucking hay", is a type of manual labor where rectangular [[hay|hay bales]], ranging in weight from about {{convert|50|to|150|lb}}, are stacked by hand in a field, in a storage area such as a barn, or stacked on a vehicle for transportation, such as a [[flatbed trailer]] or [[semi truck]] for delivery to where the hay is needed. The act of throwing the bales up to a higher level is called "bucking".  The work is very strenuous and physically demanding, and is dependent upon using a proper technique in order to not become fatigued and avoid injury.  
[[File:Stacker.jpg|thumb|left|A mechanical hay stacker]]
Large quantities of small square bales are sometimes gathered with mechanical equipment such as a [[baler|hay stacker]], which can hold up to about 100 hay bales.

The workers generally wear [[chaps]] to protect their legs and use [[Longshoreman's hook|hay hook]]s, long metal hooks with wooden handles, to secure the bales and move them.  An apparatus known as an elevator is used to move the bales, conveyor belt style, to levels too high to buck them.  Workers are usually paid by the [[ton]] or by the number of bales. Because the work is so labor-intensive, many farmers have taken to making multiple ton bales that are moved with machines.

Hay bucking competitions are sometimes held at [[rodeos]] and county [[fair]]s.

* '''Mystery of the world calligraphy (special exposition)'''

December 9–14, 2008 the Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy held the special exhibit ‘Mysteries of the world calligraphy’ dedicated to the Constitution Day. A formal trigger to launch this exhibit was the arrival of a new item: the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation, first of its kind in the Post-Soviet Russia. This A2-sized work has been performed in five months by Pyotr Chobitko, Chairman of the National Union of Calligraphers, in person (with the exception of lining the sheets).

== Project’s development ==

=== National Union of Calligraphers ===

On May 14, 2008 the National Union of Calligraphers was established at the International Exhibition of Calligraphy. The handwritten charter with many famous Russian calligraphers’ signatures testifies to the Union’s birth. Under the Charter the Union aims at revival of the art of calligraphy in Russia, creating conditions for its development and admitting everybody who is willing to learn the beauty of writing. Petr Chobitko was elected Chairman of the Union with Alexey Shaburov as its President.

The most outstanding Union’s masterpiece is the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation performed by Pyotr Chobitko in person. It is stored at Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy. Miniature copies of the piece have been prepared as gift editions.

==Life==
Macwan's grandfather was a [[Hindu]], but he adopted Christianity in 1892. Macwan was born on 9 October 1936 in Tranol, a small village of Kheda [[Tehsil|taluka]], [[Anand district]], Gujarat. His family were natives of [[Ode, Gujarat|Oad]], a small village nearby. He was born in Tranol because his father Ignas {{aka}} Dahyalal was working with a Christian mission there. His father was also known as a master in his village. His childhood passed in poverty and lack of maternal care. His mother Hiriben {{aka}} Hira died when he was young. His father soon married another woman who was cruel to him.&lt;ref name=solanki&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Solanki|first=Vipul|title=A Translation of Joseph Macwan's Vyathana Vitak from Gujarati Into English with a Critical Study|date=2016|publisher=[[Saurashtra University]]|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/130572|place=Rajkot|format=PDF|type=PhD|chapter=Chapter 1|hdl=10603/130572|access-date=21 October 2017|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macwan was a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]]. He was admitted to school when he was five years old because his reading and writing skills were more advanced than those of most students of the usual admitting age of seven years. At that time it was unusual to study in school in his community. He had good memory skills and he could remember poems by listening to his brother who used to recite poems to his ill mother.&lt;ref name=solanki/&gt; He studied in the Missionary School of Oad village until fourth grade, then he did two grades at a local board school. He passed the vernacular final exam at the I P Mission School of [[Nadiad]] in 1950.

Due to poverty, he joined the Christian Missionary School at Khamloj as a teacher when he was fourteen. Later he was transferred to Missionary School, Nadiad as a Deputy PTC in 1955. In the same year, he passed [[matriculation]] with 72%. He then joined Primary Teacher's College (PTC) which he passed with 72%. He also completed ''Vinit Visharad'' and ''Rashtrabhasha Ratna'' during the same period. In 1957, he joined St. Xavier's School in [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]] as a teacher of [[Hindi language]]. He passed a Master of Arts in Hindi by studying in weekend classes while working as a teacher. He served as a visiting lecturer of Hindi at the College of [[Dakor]] from 1971 to 1972 and at M B College, [[Vallabh Vidyanagar|Vidyanagar]] from 1972 to 1977. Later he resigned from his visiting lecturer posts and continued to teach at the St. Xavier's School until his retirement in 1994.&lt;ref name=solanki/&gt;

He married Reginaben in November 1955, and they had four daughters and four sons.&lt;ref name= "mj"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vaghela |first1=Agnes |last2=Vaghela |first2=Ramesh |year=2004 |title=Chakdo |series=Collection of Writings of Joseph Macwan |location=Gandhinagar |publisher=Joseph Macwan Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in the Philippines}}

There are some 120 to 187 languages and dialects in the [[Philippines]], depending on the method of classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/PH|title=Philippines|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McFarland |first=C.

A number of Spanish-influenced [[creole language|creole]] varieties generally called [[Chavacano]] are also spoken in certain communities. The 1987 constitution designates [[Filipino_language|Filipino]] as the national language and an official language along with English.

While Filipino is used for communication across the country's diverse linguistic groups and is used in [[popular culture]], the government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Filipino than English in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/ph/languages/|title=Philippines|publisher=[[Ethnologue]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but does not specify any language in particular.&lt;ref&gt;The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein...

The indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the [[Kulitan alphabet|Kulitan]], [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] and others) are used very little; instead, Filipino languages are today written in the [[Latin script]] because of the [[Spanish Philippines|Spanish]] and [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial experience]]. [[Baybayin]], though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the indigenous Filipino scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on the [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso|Philippine banknotes]], where the word "Pilipino" is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the [[Arabic script]] is used in the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Muslim areas]] in the southern Philippines.

==National and official languages==
The [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] declares [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as the national language of the country. Filipino and [[Philippine English|English]] are the official languages, with the recognition of the regional languages as auxiliary official in their respective regions (though not specifying any particular languages). [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic]] are to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;'''Article XIV, Sec 7''': For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English. The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein. Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced [[universal education]], creating free public schooling in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=PhilCS-Edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm|title=Philippines - EDUCATION|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the language of the [[Philippine Revolution]], and the 1899 [[Malolos Constitution]] effectively proclaimed it as the official language of the [[First Philippine Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 93 of the [[Malolos Constitution]] reads, "Art. 93. The use of languages spoken in the Philippines shall be optional. This use cannot be regulated except by virtue of law, and solely for acts of public authority and in the courts. For these acts the Spanish language will be used in the meantime."&lt;/ref&gt; National hero [[José Rizal]] wrote most of his works in Spanish. Luciano de la Rosa established that Spanish was spoken by a total of 60% of the population in the early 20th century as a first, second or third language. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the use of Spanish declined gradually, especially after the 1940s.

Under the U.S. occupation and civil regime, [[English language|English]] began to be taught in schools. By 1901, public education used English as the medium of instruction. Around 600 educators (called "[[Thomasites]]") who arrived in that year aboard the [[USAT Thomas|USAT ''Thomas'']] replaced the soldiers who also functioned as teachers. The 1935 Constitution added English as an official language alongside Spanish. A provision in this constitution also called for Congress to "take steps toward the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages." On November 12, 1937, the First National Assembly created the National Language Institute. President [[Manuel L. Quezón]] appointed native [[Waray language|Waray]] speaker Jaime C. De Veyra to chair a committee of speakers of other [[Philippine languages|regional languages]]. Their aim was to select a national language among the other [[Philippine languages|regional languages]]. Ultimately, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] was chosen as the base language December 30, 1937, on the basis that it was the most widely spoken and developed local language.&lt;ref name="Quezón1937"&gt;{{Cite web |author=[[Manuel L. Quezon]] |date=December 1937 |title=Speech of His Excellency, Manuel L.

In 1939, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezón]] renamed the [[Tagalog language]] as ''Wikang Pambansa'' ("national language" in English translation).&lt;ref name=Gonzalez1998&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Andrew Gonzalez]] |year=1998 |month= |title=The Language Planning Situation in the Philippines |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development |volume=19 |issue=5, 6 |url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-24 |pages=487–525 |doi=10.1080/01434639808666365 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616101625/http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was further renamed in 1959 as ''Pilipino'' by Secretary of
Education Jose Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Pilipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a [[national language]], to be known as ''[[Filipino language|Filipino]]''. &lt;!--

The present constitution, ratified in 1987, designates Filipino and English as joint official languages. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be "developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages." Although not explicitly stated in the constitution, Filipino is in practice almost completely composed of the Tagalog language as spoken in the capital, Manila; however, organizations such as the [[University of the Philippines]] began publishing dictionaries such as the ''[[UP Diksyonaryong Filipino]]'' in which words from various Philippine languages were also included. The present constitution is also the first to give recognition to other regional languages. The constitution also made mention of Spanish and [[Arabic]], both of which are to be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.

[[File:Major Philippine languages.png|Language map of the 12 recognized auxiliary languages based on [[Ethnologue]] maps.|thumb|upright=0.9]]

Filipino is an official language of education and also the major language of the broadcast [[Mass media|media]] and [[film|cinema]], but less important than English as a language of publication (except in some domains, like [[comic book]]s) and less important for academic-scientific-technological discourse. Filipino is used as a [[lingua franca]] in all regions of the Philippines as well as within [[overseas Filipino]] communities, and is the dominant language of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|armed forces]] (except perhaps for the small part of the commissioned [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] corps from wealthy or upper-middle-class families) and of a large part of the [[civil service]], most of whom are non-Tagalogs.

There are different forms of [[diglossia]] that exist in the case of [[Philippine languages|regional languages]]. Locals may use their mother tongue or the regional [[lingua franca]] to communicate amongst themselves, but sometimes switch to foreign languages when addressing outsiders. Another is the prevalence of [[code-switching]] to English when speaking in both their first language and Tagalog.

The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] provides for the use of the vernacular languages as official [[Minority language|auxiliary language]]s in provinces where Filipino is not the [[lingua franca]]. Filipinos at large are [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]]s; In the case where the vernacular language is a regional language, Filipinos would speak in Filipino when speaking in formal situations while the [[Philippine languages|regional languages]] are spoken in non-formal settings. This is evident in major urban areas outside Metro Manila like [[Camarines Norte]] in the [[Bikol language|Bikol]]-speaking area, and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-speaking area. {{as of|2017}}, the case of Ilocano and Cebuano are becoming more of bilingualism than diglossia due to the publication of materials written in these languages.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The diglossia is more evident in the case of other languages such as [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Bikol languages|Bikol]], [[Waray language|Waray]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Sambal language|Sambal]], and [[Maranao language|Maranao]], where the written variant of the language is becoming less and less popular to give way to the use of Filipino. Although Philippine laws consider some of these languages as "major languages" there is little, if any, support coming from the government to preserve these languages. This may be bound to change, however, given current policy trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Maraming+Wika,+Matatag+na+Bansa+-+Chairman+Nolasco |language=Filipino |title=Maraming Wika, Matatag na Bansa - Chairman Nolasco |author=Ricardo Ma. Nolasco |publisher=[[Commission on the Filipino Language]] |accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There still exists another type of diglossia, which is between the regional languages and the minority languages. Here, we label the regional languages as acrolects while the minority languages as the basilect. In this case, the minority language is spoken only in very intimate circles, like the family or the tribe one belongs to. Outside this circle, one would speak in the prevalent regional language, while maintaining an adequate command of Filipino for formal situations. Unlike the case of the regional languages, these minority languages are always in danger of becoming extinct because of speakers favoring the more prevalent regional language. Moreover, most of the users of these languages are illiterate{{specify|date=November 2011}} and as expected, there is a chance that these languages will no longer be revived due to lack of written records.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Aside from the two official nationwide languages used in the Philippines, namely, [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]], other languages have been proposed as additional nationwide languages. Among the most prominent proposals are [[Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/26500370/NIHONGO_NO_BENKYOU_WHY_AND_HOW_FILIPINOS_LEARN_JAPANESE_LANGUAGE|title=NIHONGO NO BENKYOU: WHY AND HOW FILIPINOS LEARN JAPANESE LANGUAGE|first=Richard DLC|last=Gonzales|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/animation0118/similarities-and-differences-between-japan-and-philippine-cultures|title=Similarities and Differences between Japan and Philippine Cultures|website=www.slideshare.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/philippines/arroyo-wants-spanish-language-in-schools-1.217121 |title=Arroyo wants Spanish language in schools |last=Felongco |first=Gilbert |date=2007-12-05 |work=GulfNews |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous languages==
[[File:Philippine languages per region.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Major languages by region. Regions marked with black diamonds denote the language comprises only a substantial minority of the populace.]]

According to [[Ethnologue]], a total of 182 native languages are spoken in the nation and four languages have been classified as extinct: Dicamay Agta, Katabaga, [[Tayabas Ayta language|Tayabas Ayta]] and Villaviciosa Agta.&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;{{cite web |editor-last1=Lewis |editor-first1=M. Paul |editor-last2=Simons |editor-first2=Gary F. |last3=Fennig |first3=Charles D. |date=2015 |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/PH |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition=18 |location=Dallas, Texas |publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chavacano]] and [[varieties of Chinese]] ([[Philippine Hokkien|Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin dialects|Mandarin]]), all of the languages belong to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family.

There are 12 indigenous languages with at least one million native speakers:

* [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]
* [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]
* [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]]
* [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]
* [[Waray language|Waray]]
* [[Central Bikol language|Bikol]]
* [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]
* [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]]
* [[Maranao language|Maranao]]
* [[Tausug language|Tausug]]
* [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]]
* [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]]

One or more of these is spoken natively by more than 90% of the population.

A [[Philippine languages|Philippine language sub-family]] identified by [[Robert Blust]] includes languages of north [[Sulawesi]] and the [[Yami language]] of [[Taiwan]], but excludes the [[Sama–Bajaw languages]] of the [[Tawi-Tawi]] islands, as well as a couple of [[North Bornean languages]] spoken in southern [[Palawan]].

[[Eskayan language|Eskayan]] is an artificial auxiliary language created as the embodiment of a [[Bohol]] nation in the aftermath of the [[Philippine–American War]]. It is used by about 500 people.

===Mutual intelligibility===
Philippine languages are often referred to by Filipinos as [[dialect]]s, partly as a relic of the inaccurate vocabulary used in literature during the American period (1898–1946).&lt;ref name=Gonzalez1998/&gt; While there are indeed many hundreds of dialects in the Philippines, they represent variations of no fewer than 120 distinct languages, and many of these languages maintain greater differences than those between established European languages like French and Spanish.

The vast differences between the languages can be seen in the following translations of what has been asserted to be the Philippine national proverb:&lt;ref&gt;[http://iloko.tripod.com/philproverb.html The Philippine National Proverb]{{vc|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dialectal variation====
The amount of dialectal variation varies from language to language. Languages like Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are known to have very moderate dialectal variation.

The languages of the [[Bicol Region]], however, there is great dialectal variation. There are cities and towns which have their own dialects and varieties. Below is the sentence "Were you there at the market for a long time?" translated into certain varieties of Bikol. The translation is followed by dialect and corresponding [[Bikol languages|language]], and a city/town in Bicol where they are spoken. The final translation is in Tagalog.

* Haloy ka duman sa saodan? (Standard Coastal Bikol, a dialect of [[Central Bikol]]; [[Canaman, Camarines Sur]])
* Aloy ka duman sa saodan? (Magarao, a variety of Coastal Bikol; [[Magarao, Camarines Sur]])
* Huray ka doon sa saodan? ([[Pandan Bikol|Northern Catanduanes Bicolano or ''Pandan Bikol'']]; [[Pandan, Catanduanes]])
* Naawat ka duman sa saod? ([[Southern Catanduanes Bikol]] or ''Virac Bikol'', a dialect of [[Coastal Bikol]]; [[Virac, Catanduanes]])
* Naәban ikā sadtō sāran? ([[Rinconada Bikol]]; [[Iriga City]])
* Nauban ikā sadtō sāran? ([[Rinconada Bikol]]; [[Nabua, Camarines Sur]])
* Uban ika adto sa saod? (Libon, [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]]; [[Libon, Albay]])
* Naәgәy ika adto sa saran? (Buhinon, [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]]; [[Buhi, Camarines Sur]])
* Eley ka idto sa sed? (West Miraya Bikol, [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]]; [[Oas, Albay]])
* Na-alõy ika idto sa sâran/mercado?(West Miraya Bikol, [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]]; [[Polangui, Albay]])
* Naulay ka didto sa saran? (East Miraya Bikol, [[Albay Bikol language|Albay Bikol]]; [[Daraga, Albay]])
* Dugay ka didto sa mercado? (Ticao, [[Masbateño language|Masbateño]]; [[Monreal, Masbate]])
* Awat ka didto sa plasa? (Gubat, [[Sorsoganon language|Southern Sorsogon]]; [[Gubat, Sorsogon]])
* Matagal ka ba roon sa pamilihan? ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]])

====Comparison chart====
Below is a chart of Philippine languages. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as ''[[language]]'' and which ones should be classified as ''[[dialect]]'', the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the regions they are natively spoken (from north to south, then east to west).

===2010 UNESCO designation===
Endangered and extinct languages in the Philippines are based on the 3rd world volume released by UNESCO in 2010.

Degree of endangerment (UNESCO standard)
* ''Safe'': language is spoken by all generations; intergenerational transmission is uninterrupted
* ''Vulnerable'': most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)
* ''Definitely endangered'': children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home
* ''Severely endangered'': language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves
* ''Critically endangered'': the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently
* ''Extinct'': there are no speakers left &gt;&gt; included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s

===Proposals to Conserve Philippine Languages===
There have been numerous proposals to conserve the many languages of the Philippines. According to the [[Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino]], there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups in the country, each having their own distinct Philippine language.

Among the proposals include (1) ''"establishing a dictionary &amp; sentence construction manual"'' for each of the 135 living languages in the country, (2) ''"video documentation"'' of all Philippine languages, (3) ''"revival of the ancient scripts of the Philippines"'' where each ethnic group's own script shall be revived and used in schools along with the currently-used Roman script in communities where those script/s used to be known, (4) ''"teaching of ethnic mother languages first"'' in homes and schools before the teaching of Filipino and foreign languages (English or Arabic), and (5) ''"using the ethnic mother language and script first in public signs"'' followed by Filipino and foreign languages (English and/or Arabic) and scripts, for example, using Sebwano first followed by Filipino and English underneath the sign.

Currently, only the fourth proposal has been made by the national government of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deped.gov.ph/press-releases/mother-tongue-based-learning-makes-lessons-more-interactive-and-easier-students&lt;/ref&gt; A National Script bill has been filed in Congress in support of the third and fifth proposal, however, the bill only mandates the usage of the ancient script compatible with the national language, which is Filipino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/ |title=A primer on Baybayin |last=See |first=Stanley Baldwin |date= August 15, 2016 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2018-08-06 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Major immigrant languages==
===Arabic===
Arabic is used by some [[Filipino Muslim]]s in both a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and instructional capacity since the arrival of [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] and establishment of several Sultanates in the 14th century. Along with [[Malay language|Malay]], Arabic was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Malay Archipelago]] among Muslim traders and the Malay [[aristocracy]].

The [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] mandates that Arabic (along with Spanish) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. {{as of|2015}} Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines. It is used primarily in religious activities and education (such as in a ''[[madrasa]]'' or Islamic school) and rarely for official events or daily conversation. In this respect, its function and use is somewhat like the traditional roles of [[Latin]] and Spanish in [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholicism]] ''vis-à-vis'' other currently spoken languages.

===English===
{{Main article|Philippine English|Taglish|Bislish}}

The first significant exposure of Filipinos to the [[English language]] occurred in 1762 when the [[British Occupation of Manila|British invaded Manila]], but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American rule]] between 1898 and 1946, and remains an [[official language]] of the Philippines.

English is used in official documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}} However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the past 4 sentences|date=October 2013}} A percentage of the media such as cable television and newspapers are also in English; major television networks such as [[ABS-CBN]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino. However, a 2009 article by a [[UNICEF]] worker reported that the level of spoken English language in the Philippines was poor. The article reported that aspiring Filipino teachers score the lowest in English out of all of the subjects on their licensing exams.&lt;ref name="SDO2009-01-21"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adriano|first1=Joel|title=The Philippines: still grappling with English|url=http://english.safe-democracy.org/2009/01/21/the-philippines-still-grappling-with-english/|website=Safe-democracy.org|publisher=Forum for a safer democracy|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large influx of English (American English) words has been assimilated into Tagalog and the other native languages called [[Taglish]] or [[Bislish]]. There is a debate, however, on whether there is diglossia or bilingualism, between Filipino and English. Filipino is also used both in formal and informal situations. Though the masses would prefer to speak in Filipino, government officials tend to speak in English when performing government functions.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}} There is still resistance to the use of Filipino in courts and the drafting of national statutes.

On August 22, 2007, three [[Malolos City]] regional trial courts in [[Bulacan]] decided to use Filipino, instead of [[Philippine English|English]], in order to promote the national language. Twelve [[stenographers]] from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of [[Bulacan State University]] College of Law following a directive from the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. De la Rama said it was the dream of former Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]] to implement the program in other areas such as [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Cavite]], [[Quezon|Quezón]], [[Nueva Écija]], [[Batangas]], [[Rizal]], and Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=84080|title=Inquirer.net, 3 Bulacan courts to use Filipino in judicial proceedings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hokkien===
{{Main article|Philippine Hokkien}}

Diplomatic ties with the Ming dynasty among some established states or kingdoms in Luzon and direct interactions and trade overall within the archipelago as a whole may go as far back as the early 10th century. [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] is the medium of instruction in Chinese schools and the lingua franca of mainland and overseas Chinese. However, the Lan-nang variant of [[Hokkien]] [[Min Chinese|Chinese]] is the majority language the Chinese in the Philippines, who immigrated from the [[Fujian]] (pronounced locally as Fukkien or Hokkien) province in China. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] such as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese]] (especially [[Cantonese]]) are spoken among a few Chinese in the Philippines whose ancestral roots trace all the way back from the [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces in Southern China.

As with Spanish, many native languages have co-opted numerous [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Chinese|loanwords from Chinese]], in particular words that refer to [[Philippine cuisine|cuisine]], household objects, and [[Philippine kinship]] [[kinship terminology|terminology]].

===Japanese===
The Japanese first came to the Philippines around the 11th century CE, the first country they emigrated to, as well as in waves from the 15th century, 17th century, late 19th century, 1900s, 1930s, and the 1940s.&lt;ref name="almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=Philippinealmanac.com |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archivedate= 1 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sambali.blogspot.com/2006/09/luzon-jars-glossary.html|title=Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan|author=Paul Kekai Manansala|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/10434/ancient-japanese-pottery-in-boljoon-town|title=Ancient Japanese pottery in Boljoon town|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacificuniverse.com/pkm/tech.htm|title=Philippines History, Culture, Civilization and Technology, Filipino|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small Japanese community and a school for Japanese in Metro Manila due to the number of Japanese companies. Also there is a large community of Japanese and Japanese descendants in [[Laguna province]], [[Baguio City]], and in the [[Davao Region]]. Davao City is a home to a large population of Japanese descendants. Japanese laborers were hired by American companies like the National Fiber Company (NAFCO) in the first decades of the 20th century to work in abaca plantations. Japanese were known for their hard work and industry. During World War II, Japanese schools were present in Davao City.

===Malay===
{{Main article|Malay language in the Philippines}}

Malay is spoken as a lingua franca in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, from [[Zamboanga Peninsula (geographical region)|Zamboanga]] down to [[Tawi-Tawi]] among a minority of the [[Tausūg people|Tausug]], [[Sama-Bajau]], and [[Yakan]] peoples. It is also spoken as a daily language by the [[Malaysians]] and [[Indonesians]] who have settled, or do business in the Philippines. It is also spoken in southern [[Palawan]] to some extent. It is not spoken among the [[Maranao people|Maranao]] and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]] peoples. Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philippines are largely Islamic and the liturgical language of Islam is [[Arabic]], but the vast majority of Muslims in the Philippines have little practical knowledge of Arabic beyond limited religious terminology.

Ancient [[Malaysian culture|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian culture|Indonesian]] cultures and civilizations in ancient Malaya, Sumatra and Java influenced the history, lifestyles, and culture of the Filipino peoples. The [[Malay language]], along with Philippine languages belonging to the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] language family, has also had an immense influence on many languages spoken in the Philippines. This is because Old Malay used to be the lingua franca throughout the archipelago, a good example of this is Magellan's translator Enrique using Malay to converse with the native ''Sugbuanon'' ([[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]) during this time period.

An example of [[Old Malay language|Old Malay]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] languages spoken in Philippine history can be seen in the language of the 10th century [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]].

When the Spanish had first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, Old Malay was spoken among the [[aristocracy]].

It is believed that [[Ferdinand Magellan]]’s Moluccan slave [[Henry the Black|Enrique]] could converse with the local leaders in [[Cebu Island]], confirming to Magellan his arrival in Southeast Asia.

Today, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is taught as a foreign language in the Department of Linguistics and Asian Languages in the [[University of the Philippines]]. Also, the Indonesian School in [[Davao City]] teaches the language to preserve the culture of Indonesian immigrants there. The Indonesian Embassy in Manila also offers occasional classes for Filipinos and foreigners.

Since 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language training to members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/wordpress/?page_id=1105 |title=Indonesian Language Club - Embassy of Indonesia - Washington D.C. |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430171832/http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/wordpress/?page_id=1105 |archivedate=2016-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] Secretary [[Armin Luistro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rainier Alain|first=Ronda|title=Bahasa in schools? DepEd eyes 2nd foreign language|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/03/22/922576/bahasa-schools-deped-eyes-2nd-foreign-language|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the country's government should promote [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], which are both related to Filipino and other Philippine languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.

===South Asian languages===
Since pre-Spanish times, there have been small Indian communities in the Philippines. Indians tend to be able to speak Tagalog and the other native languages, and are often fluent in English. Among themselves, [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are used. [[Urdu language|Urdu]] is spoken among the [[Pakistan]]i community. Only few South Asians, such as Pakistani, as well as the recent newcomers like speakers of [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] retain their own respective languages.&lt;ref name="almanac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thephilippines.ph/philippine-culture/going-banana/|title=Going Banana|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabacofamily.com/jtabaco/india.asp|title=KINDING SINDAW|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |title=The Indian in the Filipino - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621051322/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39lJz_L4MdUC&amp;pg=PA537&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Rising India and Indian Communities in East Asia|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeExjdWUmJYC&amp;pg=PA707&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Indian Communities in Southeast Asia (First Reprint 2006)|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish===
{{Main article|Spanish language in the Philippines}}

[[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] was introduced in the islands after 1565, when the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] set sail from [[Mexico]] and founded the first Spanish settlement on [[Cebú]]. Though its usage is not as widespread as before, Spanish has had a significant influence in the various local Philippine languages such as providing numerous loan words.&lt;ref name="SDO2009-01-21"/&gt; Several Spanish-based [[creole language]] varieties collectively known as [[Chabacano]] have also emerged. The current 1987 constitution makes mention of Spanish in which it provides that Spanish (along with Arabic) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.

In 1593, the first printing press in the Philippine islands was founded and it released the first (albeit polyglot) book, the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' that same year. In the 17th century, Spanish religious orders founded the first universities in the Philippines, some of which are considered the oldest in Asia. During colonial rule through [[Mexico]], Spanish was the language of education, trade, politics, and religion, and by the 19th century, became the colony's [[lingua franca]] although it was mainly used by the educated Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscoenlaces.es/kaibigankastila/rivera4.html|title=Estadisticas: El idioma español en Filipinas|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced a system of public education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. In the 1890s, the Philippines had a prominent group of Spanish-speaking scholars called the [[Ilustrados]], such as [[José Rizal]]. Some of these scholars participated in the [[Philippine Revolution]] and later in the struggle against American occupation. Both the [[Malolos Constitution]] and the ''[[Lupang Hinirang]]'' ([[national anthem]]) were written in Spanish.

Under U.S. rule, the [[English language]] began to be promoted instead of Spanish. The use of Spanish began to decline as a result of the introduction of English into the public schools as a language of instruction.&lt;ref name=PhilCS-Edu /&gt; The 1935 constitution establishing the Philippine Commonwelath designated both English and Spanish as official languages. The 1950 census stated that Filipinos who spoke Spanish as a first or second language made up only 6% of the population. In 1990, the census reported that the number had dwindled to just 2,500. A 2012 survey estimates that while around 1 million people can speak Spanish with varying degrees of competency, only around 439,000 people can speak the language at a native level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eldiae.es/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012_el_espanol_en_el_mundo.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018144439/http://eldiae.es/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2012_el_espanol_en_el_mundo.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-18 |title=El español, una lengua viva: Informe 2012 |pages=6 and 10 |accessdate=2015-03-15 |language=Spanish }} (439,000 native speakers + 2,557,773 limited competency + 20,492 students.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish briefly lost its status as an official language upon promulgation of the 1973 constitution but regained official status two months later when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155.&lt;ref name="PD No. 155"/&gt; In the 1987 constitution, Spanish is designated as an "optional and voluntary language" but does not mention it as an "official language". Spanish was dropped as a college requirement during [[Corazón Aquino]]'s administration. Former president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], a third-language Spanish speaker, introduced legislation to re-establish the instruction of Spanish in 2009 in the state education system. Today, the language is still spoken by Filipino-Spanish mestizos and Spanish families who are mainly concentrated in Metro Manila, [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]] and [[Cebu City|Cebu]]. It remains an optional subject in some academic institutions, such as the [[University of Santo Tomás]] in Manila and the [[University of San Carlos]] in Cebu. 

Many historical documents, land titles, and works of literature are written in Spanish and are still not translated into Filipino languages, despite the fact that some such as land titles have legal value. Spanish, through colonization has contributed the largest number of [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Spanish|loanwords and expressions]] in Tagalog, Cebuano, and other Philippine languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spanish language in Philippines|url=http://www.spanish-in-the-world.net/Spanish/philippines.php|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]]'' (Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language), established in 1924, is a founding member of the [[Association of Academies of the Spanish Language]]; an association of the various Spanish academies of the world which cooperate in the standardizing and promotion of the Spanish language. Among its past and present academics are former President Arroyo, former Foreign Affairs Secretary [[Alberto Romulo]], and Archbishop of Cebú Cardinal [[Ricardo Vidal]].

====Spanish creoles====
{{Main article|Chavacano}}

There are several [[Spanish-based creole languages]] in the Philippines, collectively called [[Chavacano]]. These may be split into two major geographical groups:

* In Luzon:
**  ''[[Chavacano#Caviteño / Ternateño|Caviteño]]'' (Chabacano de Cavite), spoken in [[Cavite City]], [[Cavite]].
**  ''[[Chavacano#Caviteño / Ternateño|Ternateño]]'' (Chabacano de Barra), spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]], [[Cavite]].
**  ''[[Chavacano#Ermitaño|Ermitaño]]'' (Chabacano de Ermita), formerly spoken in [[Ermita, Manila]] but is now [[language extinction|extinct]]. The last reported speakers were a woman and her grandson during the 1980s and 1990s.
* In Mindanao:
** ''[[Chavacano|Zamboangueño Chavacano]]'' (Chabacano de Zamboanga / Zamboangueño Chavacano), spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]] and [[Semporna]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] (360,000 native speakers-Zamboanga City alone as per 2000 census, making it the most spoken form and known form of Chavacano)
** ''[[Chavacano|Cotabateño]]'' (Chabacano de Cotabato), spoken in [[Cotabato]]
** ''[[Chavacano|Davaoeño Abakay]]'' (Chabacano de Davao), spoken in [[Davao City]]

A '''nasal voice''' is a type of speaking [[voice]] characterized by speech with a "nasal" quality.{{clarification needed|what characterizes "nasal quality"--the combination of pitches, or what?|date=February 2017}} It can also occur naturally because of genetic variation.  

Nasal speech can be divided into hypo-nasal and hyper-nasal.

==Hyponasal speech==
Hyponasal speech, [[denasalization]] or [[rhinolalia clausa]] is a lack of appropriate nasal airflow during speech,&lt;ref name="JoinerKogel2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael C. Joiner|author2=Albert van der Kogel|title=Basic Clinical Radiobiology, Fifth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp4YtqM7Ef8C&amp;pg=PA993|date=15 June 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-340-80893-1|pages=993–}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when a person has [[nasal congestion]].

Some causes of hyponasal speech are [[adenoid hypertrophy]], [[allergic rhinitis]], [[deviated septum]], [[sinusitis]], [[myasthenia gravis]] and [[turbinate]] [[hypertrophy]].

==Hypernasal speech==
[[Hypernasal speech]] or [[hyperrhinolalia]] or [[rhinolalia aperta]] is inappropriate increased airflow through the nose during speech, especially with [[syllables]] beginning with [[plosive]] and [[fricative]] [[consonant]]s. 

Examples of [[hypernasal speech]] include [[cleft palate]] and [[velopharyngeal insufficiency]].

[[Rao Bahadur]] '''Oyyarathu Chandu Menon''' (also known as '''O. Chandu Menon''') (1847–1899) was a [[Malayalam language]] novelist from [[Kerala state]], India. He is the author of ''[[Indulekha (novel)|Indulekha]]'', the first major novel in Malayalam published in 1889.

==Life==
Chandu Menon was born on 9 January 1847 in Oyyarath house near [[Naduvannur]] in the present day Kozhikode District.  His family moved to Thalassery when he was an infant.

Chandu Menon got his first lessons from Koran Gurukkal, one of his neighbors. He learnt Sanskrit poetry, drama and grammar from Pandit Kunjanbu Nambiar. About the same time, he received English lessons from a local school and later from K. Kunjan Menon. He had higher school education in the [[Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School]] in [[Thalassery]]. While studying there he is reported to have qualified for the uncovenanted Civil Service by securing a high rank in the test for that Service. In 1864 his mother died when he was in the [[matriculation]] class and he was forced to abandon studies.&lt;ref name=prezi&gt;[http://prezi.com/ilfhd6o8bju1/the-life-of-oyyarathu-chandu-menon/ Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandu Menon got married to Lakshmikutty Amma in 1872. The couple had six children.

Chandu Menon started his career as a clerk in the government service. [[William Logan (Malabar Manual)|William Logan]], author of the [[William Logan (Malabar Manual)|Malabar Manual]] appointed him as a clerk at Sub-Collector's office. After working in various offices in [[Malabar region|Malabar]], he slowly rose to the position of a ''Munsiff'', and in 1892 became the sub-judge of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].As per a record available ,he was also District judge of Mangalore in 1895.
&lt;ref name=prezi/&gt; Chandu Menon reportedly assisted Willam Logan in the preparation of Malabar Manual.&lt;ref name=genealogy&gt;[http://www.geni.com/people/Chandu-Menon/6000000021314380330 Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandu Menon was also a social reformer. He was a member of the committee constituted to inquire on [[Marumakkathayam]] and report on the Malabar Marriages Bill.  His observations on matrimony among Nairs and polyandrous matrimony of Nair women that prevailed during the time are of historical importance.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt; He was given the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] in 1898 for excellent service.
Chandu Menon died on 7 September 1899 at his ''Oyyarath'' residence in [[Thalassery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sreekeshu.xp3.biz/Thalassery%20Online/pride%20of%20tly.html |title=Important Personalities |publisher=Sreekeshu.xp3.biz |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to cardiac failure.

==Literary career==
He was inspired by his wife to write his first novel ''[[Indulekha (novel)|Indulekha]]''. He attempted to fashion the work after the English novels popular during those days&lt;ref name=dailynews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2001/pix/PrintPage.asp?REF=/2012/07/04/fea24.asp |title=&amp;#124;&amp;#124; Daily News Online Edition - Sri lanka :: Print Page |publisher=Archives.dailynews.lk |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depicted the love and lives life of an upper caste woman and her sad destiny. The novel attempted to discuss the topics of feudalism, polygamy and caste oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700011403.htm |title=Voice of rebellion |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-09-07 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1889 work, ''[[Indulekha (novel)|Indulekha]]'', was the first Malayalam fictional work which met with all the requisite characteristics of a novel according to widely accepted Malayalam literary convention.  It is not the first novel per se, as ''[[Kundalatha]]'' (a much inferior work) by [[Appu Nedungadi]] pre-dates it by a year. ''Indulekha'' throws light on the [[Nair]] community during the second half of the nineteenth century when it was undergoing a transformation following western influences and English education. It exalts education and satirizes the orthodox practices of temporary marital alliances between Nair women and [[Namboodiri]] men. ''Indulekha'' was translated into English 1891 by the-then [[District collector|Collector]] of [[Malabar district]]. Indulekha is claimed to be the only Malayalam novel to be reprinted every year for over hundred years.&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;

He began a second novel named ''[[Sarada (novel)|Sarada]]'', the first part of which appeared in 1892. This novel was meant to be in two parts. However, he was unable to complete the sequel, which never got published.

Two English speeches made by Chandu Menon, one on ''Administration of Justice in Ancient Times'' and another under the auspices of the Sir T.Muthuswamy Iyer Memorial Committee have been published in book form.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;

==Major awards and recognitions==
* He reportedly received a letter from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[W. E. Gladstone]], passing on [[Queen Victoria]]'s appreciation of Chandu Menon's services to Malayalam literature in 1892.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;
* The Government of India conferred on him the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] in 1897.
* [[Madras University]] recognised his merits, appointed him as Examiner for the Law Degrees in 1898.
* He was also honoured by [[Madras University]] by nominating him as a Fellow of the University.

'''Per Ragnar''', ''Per-Erik Ragnar'' (born 29 May 1941), is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] actor, director and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?type=PERSON&amp;itemid=68214 |publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]] |title=Per Ragnar |accessdate=18 March 2010 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ragnar was born in [[Kalmar]], Sweden and is the son of district manager Hans Ragnar and the postal clerk Karin, née Pettersson.&lt;ref name="Uddling &amp; Paabo (1992), p. 903"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Uddling |editor1-first=Hans |editor2-last=Paabo |editor2-first=Katrin |date=1992 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1993 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |isbn=91-1-914072-X |language=Swedish |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1993/0903.html |page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragnar trained at [[Dramatens elevskola]] (The Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school) in 1962-65. The following year he got a job as director's assistant to [[Ingmar Bergman]] (on his stage production of [[Peter Weiss]]' play ''[[The Investigation (play)|The Investigation]]''), where Ragnar states he learned a lot on the art of acting and directing from "the master", just by watching and listening when Bergman worked with his actors and the script. In 1968 Per Ragnar had his breakthrough as an actor, earning much critical acclaim and audience praise for his performances in the [[Arnold Wesker]] "trilogy" staged that year in Sweden: ''Hönssoppa med korngryn ([[Chicken Soup with Barley]])'', ''Rötter ([[Roots (play)|Roots]])'' and ''Jag talar om Jerusalem (I'm talking about Jerusalem)''. The same year he also made his film-breakthrough with ''[[Korridoren]] (The Corridor)'', [[Jan Haldoff]]'s social commenting film on hospitals and the health care system in Sweden, where Ragnar plays a young doctor, new on the job, facing the dilemmas of prioritizing patients.

In the 1970s his collaborating with TV director [[Bengt Lagerkvist]] led to notable performances on TV, first as [[Arvid Falk]] in Lagerkvist's TV adaption of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s play ''[[The Red Room (Strindberg)|The Red Room]])'' (''Röda rummet''), and in the popular Swedish TV-series ''Någonstans i Sverige (~Somewhere In Sweden)'', a series covering the years in Sweden during the time of [[World War II]] in Europe, where Ragnar played the character of [[fänrik]] Ancker.

For a young audience today, in Sweden, he became unforgettable when playing the religious psycho Sten Frisk in the popular and long-running 1990s TV series ''Tre Kronor'' (1994) on Swedish channel [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], a role that followed him for long and for more than a decade led to him often being typecast as evil characters and crazy psychos in various roles on film and TV. Even though being cast in a Swedish vampire film, his character of Håkan was this time a bit more complex then just "evil"; in director [[Tomas Alfredson]]'s popular success feature ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Låt den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In)]]'' in 2008. Previously he had worked with Tomas Alfredson and his "Killinggänget" group in their film ''En liten film.. (A Little Film..)'' in 1999, where he had a small key part as an absent-minded boss.

Being versatile in the entertainment field, Per Ragnar has also worked as a TV presenter and host for the Swedish morning show ''Gomorron Sverige!'' (''Good Morning Sweden!''). He has also written a number of books, including a book on [[Hitler]] and his closed community of friends and party members, and one on [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophy. His most recent book is called ''Om bland tusen stjärnor: en tankebok om döden (~Among Thousand Stars: A Book On Death)'', which deals with how differently all of us deals with – and approaches – the subject of death; children and adults, different [[religion]]s; scientifically, spiritually and logically.

Per Ragnar is also an appreciated lecturer and gives many lectures and public readings around Sweden, in various assembly halls; both on acting and around the subjects from his books and research. He is a longtime vegetarian and an outspoken pacifist, inspired by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]'s non-violence philosophy.

From his 15th until his 30th (1970), Pohl was part of the schools summer camp at [[Värmdö (island)|Värmdö]] and later at [[Blidö]].
This period of his life is described in the books that form the [[Rainbow Series (Peter Pohl)|Rainbow Series]] and are of particular influence of his other books.

He studied mathematics and [[physics]] and was a [[research assistant]] at the [[Swedish National Defence Research Institute]] for several years, starting in 1963.

== Author ==
Pohl has published a total number of 35 books: 9 textbooks and 26 works of fiction. He is primarily known for his works of fiction.

His fiction is mostly drama, but also includes two works of poetry, a book with fairy tales and a "picture book without pictures" that defies categorisation.
In most of his books, children and teenagers are the main characters.
He considers this to be the most important period of a life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/ansqu4.html#Val|title=Svar på fragor – 4|author=Peter Pohl|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Typical themes are loneliness, betrayal, lies, a longing for friendship, death.
On his website, he writes that he does so because it is reality for many adults, youths and kids, and it would be a shame to be silent about that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/ansqu4.html#Tungt|title=Svar på fragor – 4|author=Peter Pohl|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his drama, two books were translated into English: [[Johnny, My Friend]] about a mysterious new boy in the neighborhood, and [[I miss you, I miss you!]] about the loss of a twin sister.
In total, 13 of his books have been translated into 13 languages, mostly in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[German language|German]], but more recently also in languages such as [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].

Among the books he published in the first four years of his writer career are three of the autobiographical books that form the rainbow series.
Those are true and about his own life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/texter/PPsvar.html|title=Peter Pohl svarar|author=Peter Pohl|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those start with [[Regnbågen har bara åtta färger]] (''The rainbow has only eight colours'').
In this book, Pohl described his early childhood, starting immediately after he moved to Sweden, until he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="rainbow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/Trilogi.html|title=Henrik, Micke...|author=Peter Pohl|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The story takes place between 1945 and 1948.
It is followed by [[Medan regnbågen bleknar]] (''While the rainbow is fading''), covering the period 1949 – 1952.
[[Vilja växa]] (''Want to grow up'') described the period 1952 – 1958.
The fourth book, [[Vi kallar honom Anna]], he describes one year, particularly one summer, where he, part of the summercamp organisation, observes how a teenage boy is severely bullied.
This book was published before ''Medan regnbågen bleknar'' and ''Vilja växa'', just shortly after ''Regnbågen har bara åtta färger'', and received a lot of attention and prizes.
The final book in the series is [[Klara papper är ett måste]], which starts in 1966.
Additionally, the book [[De Stora Penslarnas lek]], which Pohl describes as a starting point for his writing, contains fairy tales, based on the fairy tales from the grandfather in ''Regnbågen har bara åtta färger''.

Other books, such as [[I miss you, I miss you!]] and [[Sekten]] are based on true stories that came to him directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/Saknar.html|title=Jag saknar dig!|author=Peter Pohl|accessdate=2008-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423063330/http://www.nada.kth.se/~pohl/Saknar.html|archivedate=23 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his books were originally published as adult literature, but later recategorised as books for youth.&lt;ref name="rainbow" /&gt;
Pohl does not consider himself an author of primarily youth literature.
However, some books were written for children.
Examples are [[Glittras uppdrag]], a fairy tale about an angel that protects a six-year-old boy, and [[Malins kung Gurra]], written for a contest organised by publisher [[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]].

The '''Proclamation to the People of South Carolina''' was written by [[Edward Livingston]] and issued by [[Andrew Jackson]] on December 10, 1832. Written at the height of the [[Nullification Crisis]], the proclamation directly responds to the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] passed by the [[South Carolina]] legislature in November 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Northrup and Turney 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to subdue the Nullification Crisis created by South Carolina's ordinance and to denounce the doctrine of nullification.

The proclamation outlines the actions taken by the South Carolina legislature and rejects the insistence on state sovereignty, focusing on the preservation of the Union as the primary issue. It declares nullification to be "incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation also appeals to citizens to resist the violation of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Northrup and Turney 2003, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jackson's Proclamation to the People of South Carolina was written in response to the growing opposition to the [[Tariff of 1828]], which was perceived to affect heavily in the economy of the [[antebellum South]], and the [[Tariff of 1832]], which cut overall revenues of the previous tariff by half but was still regarded as unconstitutional by South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman and Urofsky 2002, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Carolina legislature declared these tariffs to be null and void within their Ordinance of Nullification.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings 1926, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides nullifying the tariffs, it also forbade the appeal of the ordinance to the Supreme Court and prohibited the federal government from collecting duties in South Carolina after February 1, 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman and Urofsky 2002, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate response to the Ordinance of Nullification was to substantially reduce the tariffs imposed on South Carolina and other colonies in the South. Jackson proposed this approach in his annual message to Congress on December 4, 1832, shortly before the creation of the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman and Urofsky 2002, p. 280-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After issuing the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina,  Jackson received reports in January 1833 that the legislature had not only persisted in the nullification of the Tariff of 1828 and 1832, but also rescinded all other tariff laws passed by the federal government for revenue purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Northrup and Turney 2003, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; This action continued South Carolina's efforts to assert state sovereignty, as the state refused to financially contribute to any part of the federal financial burden.  Following this, [[Henry Clay]] proposed the [[Compromise Tariff of 1833]], which was later signed into law alongside the [[Force Bill]] by Jackson on March 2, 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings 1926, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The Compromise Tariff of 1833 called for a series of reductions at two-year intervals, culminating in the same rates as the Tariff of 1816, and was supported primarily by the South and West. The Force Bill, however, authorized the US president to employ military forces to uphold federal law.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery 1984, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Although South Carolina nullified the Force Bill, it did rescind its earlier ordinance regarding nullification. The combination of the two bills allowed the federal government to assert its authority, while also permitting South Carolina to accept the reduced tariffs without diminishing its own stance.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1934, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Slavic dialects historically formed a [[dialect continuum|continuum]]. The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]], resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, [[Shtokavian]] became the most widespread dialect in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by [[Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian]] (which further blend into [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] in the northwest). [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as "Slavic", "Illyrian", or according to region, "Bosnian", "Serbian" and "Croatian", the latter often in combination with "Slavonian" or "Dalmatian".

Serbo-Croatian was [[standard language|standardized]] in the mid-19th-century [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established.{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 130–132}} From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]]. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (when it was called "Serbo-Croato-Slovenian"),&lt;ref name="Busch2004" /&gt; and later as one of the official languages of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] affected language attitudes, so that [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|social conceptions of the language separated]] on ethnic and political lines. Since the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the names [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and sometimes [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]].&lt;ref&gt;"The same language [Croatian] is referred to by different names, Serbian (srpski), Serbo-Croat (in Croatia: hrvatsko-srpski), Bosnian (bosanski), based on political and ethnic grounds. […] the names Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian are politically determined and refer to the same language with possible slight variations." ({{Harvnb | Brown | Anderson | 2006 | p = 294}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has a simple [[Serbo-Croatian phonology|phonology]], with the common five-vowel system and twenty-five consonants. Its [[Serbo-Croatian grammar|grammar]] evolved from [[History of the Slavic languages|Common Slavic]], with complex [[inflection]], preserving seven [[grammatical case]]s in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Verbs exhibit [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or [[perfective aspect]], with a moderately complex tense system. Serbo-Croatian is a [[pro-drop language]] with flexible word order, [[subject–verb–object]] being the default. It can be written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], whose thirty letters mutually map one-to-one, and the [[orthography]] is highly [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] in all standards.

== Name ==
Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called "Illyric", "Slavic", "Slavonian", "Bosnian", "Dalmatian", "Serbian" or "Croatian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Moderne Nationalbezeichnungen und Texte aus vergangenen Jahrhunderten |trans-title=Modern nation names and texts in the past |url=http://www.zeitschrift-fuer-balkanologie.de/index.php/zfb/article/view/222/222 |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=40–41 |year=2010 |issn=0044-2356 |id={{ZDB|201058-6}} |archivedate=23 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A7zcF9G9?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/495349.MODERNE_NATIONALBEZEICHNUNGEN.PDF |accessdate=11 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the XIX century the term ''Illyrian'' or ''Illyric'' was used quite often (thus creating confusion with the [[Illyrian language]]). Although the word ''Illyrian'' was used on a few occasions before, the widespread usage of the term began after [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and several other prominent linguists met at [[Ljudevit Vukotinović]]'s house to discuss the issue in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Despalatović |first=Elinor Murray |title=Ljudevit Gaj and the Illyrian Movement |publisher=East European Quarterly; [[Columbia University Press]] |page=64 |location= New York and London |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-914710-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Serbo-Croatian'' was first used by [[Jacob Grimm]] in 1824,{{Sfn | Lencek | 1976 | p = 46}}{{Sfn | Pohl | 1996 | pp = 209–210}} popularized by the Viennese philologist [[Jernej Kopitar]] in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian [[Zagreb]] grammarians in 1854 and 1859.{{Sfn | Lencek | 1976 | p = 49}} At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austrian Empire]]s. Officially, the language was called variously ''Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian.'' &lt;!-- more data needed: in which periods and where? --&gt; Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language "Serbian" or "Croatian", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two,{{Sfn | Brown | Anderson | 2006 | p = 259}} and again in independent [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], "Bosnian", "Croatian", and "Serbian" were considered to be three names of a single official language.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1993 the authorities in Sarajevo adopted a new language law (Službeni list Republike Bosne i Hercegovine, 18/93): In the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Ijekavian standard literary language of the three constitutive nations is officially used, designated by one of the three terms: Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian." ({{Harvnb | Bugarski | Hawkesworth | 2006 | p = 142}})&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian linguist [[Dalibor Brozović]] advocated the term ''Serbo-Croatian'' as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brozović |first=Dalibor |authorlink=Dalibor Brozović |title=Jezik, srpskohrvatski/hrvatskosrpski, hrvatski ili srpski : izvadak iz II izdanja Enciklopedije Jugoslavije |publisher=Jugoslavenski Leksikografski zavod "Miroslav Krleža" |page=4 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Jezik, srpskohrvatski/hrvatskosrpski, hrvatski ili srpski |trans-chapter=Language, Serbo-Croatian/Croato-Serbian, Croatian or Serbian : Extract From the Second Edition of the Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia |location=Zagreb |year=1988 |isbn=978-86-7053-014-0 |oclc=645757653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, use of the term "Serbo-Croatian" is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richter Malabotta |first=Melita |editor1-last=Busch |editor1-first=Brigitta |editor2-last=Kelly-Holmes |editor2-first=Helen |title=Language, Discourse and Borders in the Yugoslav Successor States |publisher=Multilingual Matters |page=81 |chapter=Semantics of War in Former Yugoslavia |location=Clevedon |year=2004 |oclc=803615012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mappes-Niediek | 2005 | p = 30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Ajdačić |editor1-first=Dejan |editor2-last=Lazarević Di Đakomo |editor2-first=Persida |title=U čast Pera Jakobsena: zbornik radova |publisher=SlovoSlavia |pages=225–239 |language=Serbo-Croatian |chapter=Ideologija nacionalnog identiteta i nacionalne kulture |trans-chapter=The ideology of national identity and culture |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/522531.Ideologija_nacionalnog.PDF |series=Studia in honorem ; vol. 1 |location=Beograd |year=2010 |isbn=978-86-87807-02-0 |oclc=723062357 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A7zYF94N?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/522531.Ideologija_nacionalnog.PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obst |first=Ulrich |editor1-last=Okuka |editor1-first=Miloš |editor2-last=Schweier |editor2-first=Ulrich |title=Festschrift für Peter Rehder zum 65.

[[Old Church Slavonic]] was adopted as the language of the [[liturgy]]. This language was gradually adapted to non-liturgical purposes and became known as the Croatian version of Old Slavonic. The two variants of the language, liturgical and non-liturgical, continued to be a part of the [[Glagolitic]] service as late as the middle of the 19th century.

The beginning of written Serbo-Croatian can be traced from the 10th century and on when Serbo-Croatian medieval texts were written in five scripts: [[Latin script|Latin]], [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]], [[Early Cyrillic]], [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] (''bosančica/bosanica''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kapetanovic |first=Amir |title=HRVATSKA SREDNJOVJEKOVNA LATINICA |journal=Hrvatska Srednjovjekovna Latinica |year=2005 |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-FfopGzc4sYJ:www.ihjj.hr/images/Izdanja/Rasprave/31_23_susret_Kapetanovic.pdf+amir+kapetanovic+hrvatska+srednjovjekovna+latinica&amp;hl=hr&amp;gl=hr&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgQtRoCdABc_WUuJP8hR8BPDF7rKm5524iRm7SQ_9NveXR7vd5BLh0Rid3WZJPhnMsIF5E6_9CCZRBjLJTQLfeAdaIyHbrKDTblw4i1J_SKf4qOwi0f5mD4zr6mLIB_Nnhh_1WT&amp;sig=AHIEtbQAFkElGfn2sHCefPWxrMFWYSUbDw}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arebica]], the last principally by Bosniak nobility. Serbo-Croatian competed with the more established literary languages of [[Latin]] and Old Slavonic in the west and Persian and Arabic in the east.

Old Slavonic developed into the Serbo-Croatian variant of [[Church Slavonic]] between the 12th and 16th centuries.

Among the earliest attestations of Serbo-Croatian are the [[Humac tablet]], dating from the 10th or 11th century, written in Bosnian Cyrillic and Glagolitic; the [[Plomin tablet]], dating from the same era, written in Glagolitic; the [[Valun tablet]], dated to the 11th century, written in Glagolitic and Latin; and the [[Inscription of Župa Dubrovačka]], a Glagolitic tablet dated to the 11th century.

The [[Baška tablet]] from the late 11th century was written in Glagolitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=21348 | first = Branko | last = Fučić | authorlink = Branko Fučić |title=Najstariji hrvatski glagoljski natpisi |journal=[[Slovo (journal)|Slovo]] |volume=21 |date=September 1971 |language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large stone tablet found in the small [[Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor]] on the Croatian island of [[Krk]] that contains text written mostly in [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] in the Croatian [[commons:Category:Angular Glagolitic letters|angular Glagolitic]] script. It is also important in the history of the nation as it mentions [[Zvonimir]], the king of Croatia at the time.

The [[Charter of Ban Kulin]] of 1189, written by [[Ban Kulin]] of Bosnia, was an early Shtokavian text, written in Bosnian Cyrillic.

The luxurious and ornate representative texts of Serbo-Croatian Church Slavonic belong to the later era, when they coexisted with the Serbo-Croatian vernacular literature. The most notable are the "[[Missal]] of Duke Novak" from the Lika region in northwestern Croatia (1368), "Evangel from Reims" (1395, named after the town of its final destination), [[Hrvoje's Missal]] from Bosnia and Split in Dalmatia (1404),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danstopicals.com/hvalovzbornik.htm |title=Hrvoje's Missal ~ 1403–1404  |accessdate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first printed book in Serbo-Croatian, the Glagolitic [[Missale Romanum Glagolitice]] (1483).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

During the 13th century Serbo-Croatian vernacular texts began to appear, the most important among them being the "Istrian land survey" of 1275 and the "[[Vinodol Codex]]" of 1288, both written in the Chakavian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihjj.hr/oHrJeziku-vinodol-zakon.html |title=VINODOLSKI ZAKON (1288) |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120314161751/http://www.ihjj.hr/oHrJeziku-vinodol-zakon.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihjj.hr/oHrJeziku-Istarski-razvod.html |title=Istarski Razvod |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707211237/http://www.ihjj.hr/oHrJeziku-Istarski-razvod.html |archivedate=7 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shtokavian dialect]] literature, based almost exclusively{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} on Chakavian original texts of religious provenance ([[missal]]s, [[breviary|breviaries]], [[Breviary|prayer books]]) appeared almost a century later. The most important purely Shtokavian vernacular text is the [[Vatican Croatian Prayer Book]] (c. 1400).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zupa-svetoga-antuna-bj.hr/duhovna_misao.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1151333873&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=2&amp; |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171011114124/http://zupa-svetoga-antuna-bj.hr/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 October 2017 |title=Vatikanski hrvatski molitvenik |accessdate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the language used in legal texts and that used in Glagolitic literature gradually came under the influence of the vernacular, which considerably affected its [[phonology|phonological]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[lexicology|lexical]] systems. From the 14th and the 15th centuries, both secular and religious songs at church festivals were composed in the vernacular.

Writers of early Serbo-Croatian [[religious]] [[poetry]] (''začinjavci'') gradually introduced the vernacular into their works. These ''začinjavci'' were the forerunners of the rich literary production of the 16th-century literature, which, depending on the area, was Chakavian-, Kajkavian-, or Shtokavian-based.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; The language of religious poems, translations, [[miracle play|miracle]] and [[morality play]]s contributed to the popular character of medieval Serbo-Croatian literature.

One of the earliest dictionaries, also in the Slavic languages as a whole, was the ''Bosnian–Turkish Dictionary'' of 1631 authored by [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi]] and was written in the [[Arebica]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gammel ordbok i ny drakt |date = 2012-04-10 | publisher = [[University of Oslo]] | language = Norwegian | url = http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/for-ansatte/aktuelt/saker/2012/bosnisk-ordbok.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Testimony of a Bosnian |last=Tanović-Miller|first=Naza|year=2001|publisher= [[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|page=209; ''"Turkish–Bosnian" dictionary, one of the first Slavic dictionaries in Europe, was written by a Bosnian ethnographer and poet, Muhamed Hevai Uskufi, from Tuzla in 1631.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rjecnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Đuro Daničić]], ''Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'' (Croatian or Serbian Dictionary), 1882]]
[[File:Gramatika bosanskog jezika.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gramatika bosanskoga jezika'' (Grammar of the Bosnian Language), 1890]]

In the mid-19th century, Serbian (led by self-taught writer and folklorist [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]]) and most Croatian writers and linguists (represented by the [[Illyrian movement]] and led by [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and [[Đuro Daničić]]), proposed the use of the most widespread dialect, [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]], as the base for their common standard language. Karadžić standardised the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]], and Gaj and Daničić standardized the [[Gaj's Latin Alphabet|Croatian Latin alphabet]], on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling. In 1850 Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists signed the [[Vienna Literary Agreement]], declaring their intention to create a unified standard.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 2004 | p = 24}} Thus a complex bi-variant language appeared, which the Serbs officially called "Serbo-Croatian" or "Serbian or Croatian" and the Croats "Croato-Serbian", or "Croatian or Serbian". Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices. The common phrase describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian or "Croatian or Serbian" was a single language. During the [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the language of all three nations was called "Bosnian" until the death of administrator [[Benjamin von Kállay|von Kállay]] in 1907, at which point the name was changed to "Serbo-Croatian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Industrialization of Bosnia-Hercegovina: 1878–1918 |last=Sugar |first=Peter F. |year=1963 |publisher=University of Washington Press |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia at Peace and at War: Selected Writings, 1983–2007 |last=Ramet |first=Sabrina P. |year=2008 |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |chapter=Nationalism and the 'Idiocy' of the Countryside: The Case of Serbia |pages=74–76 |isbn=978-3-03735-912-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=velikonja&gt;{{cite book |title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina |last=Velikonja |first=Mitja |year=1992 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |isbn=978-1-58544-226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With unification of the first the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] – the approach of Karadžić and the Illyrians became dominant. The official language was called "Serbo-Croato-Slovenian" (''srpsko-hrvatsko-slovenački'') in the 1921 constitution.&lt;ref name="Busch2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Busch|first1=Birgitta|last2=Kelly-Holmes|first2=Helen|title=Language, Discourse and Borders in the Yugoslav Successor States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlXQ5zKb_VQC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2004|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-732-9|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the constitution was suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomasevich|first=Jozo|title=Contemporary Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a--6hauBIb4C&amp;pg=PA8|year=1969|publisher=University of California Press|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the country was renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], while the official language of Serbo-Croato-Slovene was reinstated in the 1931 constitution.&lt;ref name="Busch2004" /&gt;

In June 1941, the Nazi puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]] began to rid the language of "Eastern" (Serbian) words, and shut down Serbian schools.&lt;ref name="Crowe2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=David M. Crowe|title=Crimes of State Past and Present: Government-Sponsored Atrocities and International Legal Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRTdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-98682-9|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1944, the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia ([[AVNOJ]]) declared Croatian, Serbian, Slovene, and Macedonian to be equal in the entire territory of Yugoslavia.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 2004 | p = 115}} In 1945 the decision to recognize Croatian and Serbian as separate languages was reversed in favor of a single Serbo-Croatian or Croato-Serbian language.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 2004 | p = 115}} In the [[Communist]]-dominated [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], ethnic issues eased to an extent, but the matter of language remained blurred and unresolved.

In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by [[Matica srpska]] and [[Matica hrvatska]] signed the [[Novi Sad Agreement]], which in its [[The Novi Sad Agreement#The text of the Novi Sad Agreement|first conclusion]] stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the [[The Novi Sad Agreement#The text of the Novi Sad Agreement|equal status]] of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations.&lt;ref name=JonkeRazvoj&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jonke, Ljudevit |authorlink=Ljudevit Jonke |title=Razvoj hrvatskoga književnog jezika u 20. stoljeću |trans-title=The Development of the Croatian language in the 20th century |journal=[[Jezik]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=18 |year=1968 |language=Serbo-Croatian  |issn=0021-6925}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also specified that ''Serbo-Croatian'' should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional ''Serbian'' and ''Croatian'' were to be retained.&lt;ref name=JonkeRazvoj /&gt; Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a ''pravopis''. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad.{{Sfn | Kordić | 2010 | pp = 303–304}} Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet&lt;ref name=BabHh&gt;{{cite book|last=Babić |first=Stjepan| authorlink=Stjepan Babić |year=2004 |language=Serbo-Croatian |title=Hrvanja hrvatskoga |trans-title=Croatian Language Quarrels |location=Zagreb |publisher=Školska knjiga |page=36 |isbn=978-953-0-61428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed,&lt;ref name=BabHh /&gt; which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milutinović, Zoran |title=Review of the Book ''Jezik i nacionalizam'' |journal=[[The Slavonic and East European Review]] |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=522–523 |year=2011 |url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Rec_SEER.pdf |issn=0037-6795 |oclc=744233642 |id={{ZDB|209925-1}} |archivedate=2012-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yTd2jaR?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Rec_SEER.pdf# |accessdate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the ''Pravopisni rječnik'' came from the Croatian Philological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jonke, Ljudevit |authorlink=Ljudevit Jonke |title=Drugi i treći sastanak Pravopisne komisije |trans-title=The second and third meeting of The Orthographic Commission |journal=Jezik |volume=4 |issue=2 |page=59 |year=1955 |language=Serbo-Croatian |issn=0021-6925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jonke, Ljudevit |authorlink=Ljudevit Jonke |title=Pravopis hrvatskosrpskoga književnog jezika |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Spelling-Book |journal=Jezik |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=57–59 |year=1961 |language=Serbo-Croatian |issn=0021-6925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language]] in 1967.

West European scientists judge the Yugoslav language policy as an exemplary one:{{Sfn | Gröschel | 2009 | p = 72}}{{Sfn | Mappes-Niediek | 2005 | pp = 18, 64}} although three-quarters of the population spoke one language, no single language was official on a federal level.{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 41–42}} Official languages were declared only at the level of constituent republics and provinces,&lt;ref name=Gak&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gak, Vladimir G. |authorlink= |title=K tipologii form jazykovoj politiki |trans-title=Towards a typology of language policy |journal=Voprosy Jazykoznanija |volume=5 |issue= |pages=122–123 |year=1989 |url= |doi= |language=Russian |issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 47–48}}{{Sfn | Gröschel | 2003 | pp = 160–161}} and very generously: Vojvodina had five (among them Slovak and Romanian, spoken by 0.5 per cent of the population), and Kosovo four (Albanian, Turkish, Romany and Serbo-Croatian).&lt;ref name=Gak /&gt;{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | p = 65}} Newspapers, radio and television studios used sixteen languages,{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | p = 81}} fourteen were used as languages of tuition in schools, and nine at universities.&lt;ref name=Gak /&gt;{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 73–79}} Only the Yugoslav Army used Serbo-Croatian as the sole language of command, with all other languages represented in the army’s other activities—however, this is not different from other armies of multilingual states,{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 69–80}} or in other specific institutions, such as international air traffic control where English is used worldwide. All variants of Serbo-Croatian were used in state administration and republican and federal institutions.&lt;ref name=Gak /&gt; Both Serbian and Croatian variants were represented in respectively different grammar books, dictionaries, school textbooks and in books known as pravopis (which detail spelling rules).{{Sfn | Kordić | 2010 | pp = 291–292}} Serbo-Croatian was a kind of soft standardisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Busch |editor1-first=Brigitta |editor2-last=Kelly-Holmes |editor2-first=Helen |title=Language, Discourse and Borders in the Yugoslav Successor States |publisher=Multilingual Matters |pages=51, 54 |chapter=Semantics of War in Former Yugoslavia |location=Clevedon |year=2004 |oclc=803615012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal equality could not dampen the prestige Serbo-Croatian had: since it was the language of three quarters of the population, it functioned as an unofficial lingua franca.{{Sfn | Kordić | 2010 | pp = 294–295}} And within Serbo-Croatian, the Serbian variant, with twice as many speakers as the Croatian,{{Sfn | Gröschel | 2009 | p = 38}} enjoyed greater prestige, reinforced by the fact that Slovene and Macedonian speakers preferred it to the Croatian variant because their languages are also Ekavian.{{Sfn | Kordić | 2010 | p = 299}} This is a common situation in other pluricentric languages, e.g. the variants of German differ according to their prestige, the variants of Portuguese too.{{Sfn | Ammon | 1995 | pp = 484, 494–497}} Moreover, all languages differ in terms of prestige: "the fact is that languages (in terms of prestige, learnability etc.) are not equal, and the law cannot make them equal".&lt;ref&gt;"die Tatsache, dass Sprachen (in ihrem Prestige, ihrer Erlernbarkeit etc.) nicht gleich sind und auch per Gesetz nicht gleich gemacht werden können" ({{Harvnb | Blum | 2002 | p = 170}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the "Declaration of the Common Language" (''Deklaracija o zajedničkom jeziku''), signed by a group of NGOs and linguists from former Yugoslavia, argues that all variants belong to a common polycentric language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-Yugoslav 'Common Language' Declaration Challenges Nationalism|publisher=Balkan Insight|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/post-yugoslav-common-language-declaration-challenges-nationalism-03-29-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Serbo-Croatian a language?|journal=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/04/economist-explains-4|date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of persons who declared their native language as either 'Bosnian', 'Croatian', 'Serbian', 'Montenegrin', or 'Serbo-Croatian' in countries of the region is about 16 million.

Serbian is spoken by about 9.5 million, mostly in Serbia (6.7m), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1.4m), and Montenegro (0.4m). Serbian minorities are found in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and in [[Romania]]. In Serbia, there are about 760,000 second-language speakers of Serbian, including Hungarians in [[Vojvodina]] and the 400,000 estimated Roma. Familiarity of [[Kosovo Albanians]] with Serbian in [[Kosovo]] varies depending on age and education, and exact numbers are not available.

Croatian is spoken by roughly 4.8 million, including some 575,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A small Croatian minority that lives in Italy, known as [[Molise Croats]], have somewhat preserved traces of the Croatian language. In Croatia, 170,000, mostly [[Italians]] and [[Hungarians]], use it as a [[second language]].

Bosnian is spoken by 2.2 million people, chiefly [[Bosniaks]], including about 220,000 in Serbia and Montenegro.

The notion of Montenegrin as a separate standard from Serbian is relatively recent. In the 2003 census, around 150,000 Montenegrins, of the country's 620,000, declared Montenegrin as their native language. That figure is likely to increase, due to the country's independence and strong institutional backing of Montenegrin language.

Serbo-Croatian is also a [[second language]] of many [[Slovenians]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], especially those born during the time of Yugoslavia. According to the 2002 Census, Serbo-Croatian and its variants have the largest number of speakers of the minority languages in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inv.si/DocDir/Publikacije-PDF/Raziskovalna%20porocila/Raziskava_Polozaj_in_status_pripadnikov_narodov_nekdanje_Jugoslavije_v_RS.pdf| title=Raziskava Položaj in status pripadnikov narodov nekdanje Jugoslavije vRS.pdf| format=PDF |language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Balkans, there are over 2 million native speakers of the language(s), especially in countries which are frequent targets of immigration, such as [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]].

== Grammar ==
[[File:Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga knjizevnoga jezika.JPG|thumb|[[Tomislav Maretić]]'s 1899 Grammar of Croatian or Serbian.]]
{{Further|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}

Serbo-Croatian is a highly [[inflected language]]. Traditional grammars list seven [[Grammatical case|cases]] for [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Locative case|locative]], and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], reflecting the original seven cases of [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], and indeed older forms of Serbo-Croatian itself. However, in modern [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] the locative has almost merged into dative (the only difference is based on accent in some cases), and the other cases can be shown declining; namely:
* For all nouns and adjectives, instrumental = dative = locative (at least orthographically) in the plural: ''ženama'', ''ženama'', ''ženama''; ''očima'', ''očima'', ''očima''; ''riječima'', ''riječima'', ''riječima''.
* There is an accentual difference between the genitive [[singular (grammatical number)|singular]] and genitive [[plural]] of masculine and neuter nouns, which are otherwise homonyms (''seljaka'', ''seljaka'') except that on occasion an "a" (which might or might not appear in the singular) is filled between the last letter of the root and the genitive plural ending (''kapitalizma'', ''kapitalizama'').
* The old instrumental ending "ju" of the feminine consonant stems and in some cases the "a" of the genitive plural of certain other sorts of feminine nouns is fast yielding to "i": ''noći'' instead of ''noćju'', ''borbi'' instead of ''boraba'' and so forth.
* Almost every Shtokavian number is indeclinable, and numbers after prepositions have not been declined for a long time.

Like most Slavic languages, there are mostly three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike [[Russian language|Russian]] and, in part, the [[Chakavian dialect|Čakavian dialect]]). They also have two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural. However, some consider there to be three numbers ([[paucal]] or ''dual,'' too), since (still preserved in closely related [[Slovene language|Slovene]]) after two (''dva'', ''dvije''/''dve''), three (''tri'') and four (''četiri''), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (''pet'') and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number one [''jedan''] is treated as an adjective.) Adjectives are placed in front of the noun they modify and must agree in both case and number with it.

There are seven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] for verbs: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], exact future, [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[pluperfect]]; and three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]: [[indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. However, the latter three tenses are typically used only in Shtokavian writing, and the time sequence of the exact future is more commonly formed through an alternative construction.

In addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs come in pairs, with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] or making a stem change. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. Some Štokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in Čakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects "compensate" for the relative lack of tenses, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|Serbo-Croatian phonology}}

=== Vowels ===
The Serbo-Croatian [[vowel]] system is simple, with only five vowels in Shtokavian. All vowels are [[monophthong]]s. The oral vowels are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

| [[Close back rounded vowel|close back rounded]]
| ''p'''oo'''l''
|}

The vowels can be short or long, but the phonetic quality does not change depending on the length. In a word, vowels can be long in the stressed syllable and the syllables following it, never in the ones preceding it.

=== Consonants ===
The [[consonant]] system is more complicated, and its characteristic features are series of [[affricate]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants. As in English, [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] is [[phoneme|phonemic]], but [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] is not.

In [[consonant cluster]]s all consonants are either voiced or voiceless. All the consonants are voiced if the last consonant is normally voiced or voiceless if the last consonant is normally voiceless. This rule does not apply to [[approximant]]s{{spaced ndash}}a consonant cluster may contain voiced approximants and voiceless consonants; as well as to foreign words (''Washington'' would be transcribed as ''VašinGton''), personal names and when consonants are not inside of one syllable.

{{IPA|/r/}} can be syllabic, playing the role of the syllable nucleus in certain words (occasionally, it can even have a long accent). For example, the [[tongue-twister]] ''navrh brda vrba mrda'' involves four words with syllabic {{IPA|/r/}}. A similar feature exists in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. Very rarely other sonorants can be syllabic, like {{IPA|/l/}} (in ''bicikl''), {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (surname ''Štarklj''), {{IPA|/n/}} (unit ''njutn''), as well as {{IPA|/m/}}  and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} in [[slang]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Pitch accent ===
{{Further|Pitch accent#Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian phonology#Pitch accent}}

Apart from [[Slovene language|Slovene]], Serbo-Croatian is the only Slavic language with a [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] (simple [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]) system. This feature is present in some other [[Indo-European languages]], such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Ancient Greek]]. Neo-Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, which is used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian, has four "accents", which involve either a [[Tone contour|rising or falling tone]] on either long or short vowels, with optional post-tonic lengths:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Serbo-Croatian accent system
|-
!Slavicist&lt;br /&gt;symbol!![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]&lt;br /&gt;symbol!!Description
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''e'''||{{IPA|[e]}}||align="left"|non-tonic short vowel
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''ē'''||{{IPA|[eː]}}||align="left"|non-tonic long vowel
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''è'''||{{IPA|[ě]}}||align="left"|short vowel with rising tone
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''é'''||{{IPA|[ěː]}}||align="left"|long vowel with rising tone
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''ȅ'''||{{IPA|[ê]}}||align="left"|short vowel with falling tone
|- style="text-align:center;"
|'''ȇ'''||{{IPA|[êː]}}||align="left"|long vowel with falling tone
|}

The tone stressed vowels can be approximated in English with ''set'' vs. ''setting?'' said in isolation for a short tonic ''e,'' or ''leave'' vs. ''leaving?'' for a long tonic ''i,'' due to the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of final stressed syllables in English.

General accent rules in the standard language:

# Monosyllabic words may have only a falling tone (or no accent at all – [[enclitic]]s);
# Falling tone may occur only on the first syllable of polysyllabic words;
# Accent can never occur on the last syllable of polysyllabic words.

There are no other rules for accent placement, thus the accent of every word must be learned individually; furthermore, in inflection, accent shifts are common, both in type and position (the so-called "[[mobile paradigm]]s"). The second rule is not strictly obeyed, especially in borrowed words.

Comparative and historical linguistics offers some clues for memorising the accent position: If one compares many standard Serbo-Croatian words to e.g. [[cognate]] Russian words, the accent in the Serbo-Croatian word will be one syllable before the one in the Russian word, with the rising tone. Historically, the rising tone appeared when the place of the accent shifted to the preceding syllable (the so-called "Neoshtokavian retraction"), but the quality of this new accent was different – its melody still "gravitated" towards the original syllable. Most Shtokavian dialects (Neoshtokavian) dialects underwent this shift, but Chakavian, Kajkavian and the Old Shtokavian dialects did not.

Accent diacritics are not used in the ordinary orthography, but only in the linguistic or language-learning literature (e.g. dictionaries, orthography and grammar books). However, there are very few [[minimal pair]]s where an error in accent can lead to misunderstanding.

== Orthography ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Serbo-Croatian orthography is almost entirely phonetic. Thus, most words should be spelled as they are pronounced. In practice, the writing system does not take into account [[allophone]]s which occur as a result of interaction between words:
* bit će{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''biće'' (and only written separately in Bosnian and Croatian)
* od toga{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''otoga'' (in many vernaculars)
* iz čega{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''iščega'' (in many vernaculars)

Also, there are some exceptions, mostly applied to foreign words and compounds, that favor morphological/etymological over phonetic spelling:
* postdiplomski (postgraduate){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''pozdiplomski''

One systemic exception is that the consonant clusters '''ds''' and '''dš''' do not change into '''ts''' and '''tš''' (although ''d'' tends to be unvoiced in normal speech in such clusters):
* predstava (show)
* odšteta (damages)

Only a few words are intentionally "misspelled", mostly in order to resolve ambiguity:
* šeststo (six hundred){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''šesto'' (to avoid confusion with "šesto" [sixth])
* prstni (adj., finger){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''prsni'' (to avoid confusion with "prsni" [adj., chest])

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main|Gaj's Latin alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Yugoslav Braille}}
Through history, this language has been written in a number of writing systems:
* [[Glagolitic alphabet]], chiefly in [[Croatia]].
* [[Arabic alphabet]] (mostly in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]).
* [[Cyrillic script]].
* various modifications of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets.

The oldest texts since the 11th century are in [[Glagolitic]], and the oldest preserved text written completely in the Latin alphabet is "Red i zakon sestara reda Svetog Dominika", from 1345. The Arabic alphabet had been used by [[Bosniaks]]; Greek writing is out of use there, and Arabic and Glagolitic persisted so far partly in religious liturgies.

Today, it is written in both the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] scripts. Serbian and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] variants use both alphabets, while Croatian uses the Latin only.

Latin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easy to input on phones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crosby |first1=Alan |last2=Martinovic |first2=Iva |title=In The Age Of The Internet, Serbia Aims To Keep Its Cyrillic Alive |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/in-the-age-of-the-internet-serbia-aims-to-keep-its-cyrillic-alive/29458055.html |accessdate=5 September 2018 |agency=RFE/RL |date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was revised by [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] in the 19th century.

The Croatian Latin alphabet (''[[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Gajica]]'') followed suit shortly afterwards, when [[Ljudevit Gaj]] defined it as standard [[Latin]] with five extra letters that had [[diacritic]]s, apparently borrowing much from [[Czech language|Czech]], but also from [[Polish language|Polish]], and inventing the unique [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] "lj", "nj" and "dž". These digraphs are represented as "ļ, ń and ǵ" respectively in the "Rječnik hrvatskog ili srpskog jezika", published by the former [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hbs icon}} Gramatika hrvatskosrpskoga jezika, Group of Authors (Ivan Brabec, Mate Hraste and Sreten Živković), Zagreb, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter digraphs, however, are unused in the literary standard of the language. All in all, this makes Serbo-Croatian the only Slavic language to officially use both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, albeit the Latin version is more commonly used.

In both cases, spelling is phonetic and spellings in the two alphabets map to each other one-to-one:

The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''Lj'', ''Nj'' and ''Dž'' represent distinct [[phoneme]]s and are considered to be single letters. In crosswords, they are put into a single square, and in [[sorting]], lj follows l and nj follows n, except in a few words where the individual letters are pronounced separately. For instance, ''nadživ(j)eti'' "to outlive" is composed of the prefix ''nad-'' "out, over" and the verb ''živ(j)eti'' "to live". The Cyrillic alphabet avoids such ambiguity by providing a single letter for each phoneme.

''Đ'' used to be commonly written as ''Dj'' on typewriters, but that practice led to too many ambiguities. It is also used on car [[license plate]]s. Today ''Dj'' is often used again in place of ''Đ'' on the Internet as a replacement due to the lack of installed Serbo-Croat keyboard layouts.

[[Unicode]] has separate characters for the digraphs lj (Ǉ, ǈ, ǉ), nj (Ǌ, ǋ, ǌ) and dž (Ǆ, ǅ, ǆ).

== Dialects ==
{{Main|Dialects of Serbo-Croatian}}
:''See also:'' [[Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|''South Slavic dialect continuum'']]
South Slavic historically formed a [[Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|dialect continuum]], i.e. each dialect has some similarities with the neighboring one, and differences grow with distance. However, migrations from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of [[Ottoman Empire]] on the Balkans have caused large-scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets. Migrations in the 20th century, primarily caused by [[urbanization]] and wars, also contributed to the reduction of dialectal differences.

The primary dialects are named after the most common question word for ''what'': [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] uses the pronoun ''što'' or ''šta'', [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] uses ''ča'' or ''ca'', [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian (''kajkavski'')]], ''kaj'' or ''kej''. In native terminology they are referred to as ''nar(j)ečje'', which would be equivalent of "group of dialects", whereas their many subdialects are referred to as ''dijalekti ''"dialects" or ''govori ''"speeches".

The pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants [[Ausbausprache#Interrelation of the abstand and ausbau statuses|are based]] on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian. Other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The [[Torlakian dialect]] is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects.

{|

|[[File:Shtokavian subdialects1988 incl Slovenia.png|thumb|Shtokavian subdialects (Pavle Ivić, 1988). Yellow is the widespread Eastern Herzegovinian subdialect that forms the basis of all national standards, though it is not spoken natively in any of the capital cities.]]
|[[File:Croatian dialects.PNG|thumb|Mid-20th-century distribution of dialects in Croatia]]
|}

The Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by Štokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koinéisation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, Štokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., big coastal Croatian cities [[Rijeka]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] together with their hinterland become basically completely Štokavianised during the 20th century, which had been Čakavian-speaking urban centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of [[Schleicher's fable]]. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.

: The Sheep and the Horses

:[On a hill,] a sheep that had no wool saw horses, one of them pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly.

: The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses".

: The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool".

: Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.

=== Division by ''jat'' reflex ===
{{Main|yat}}

A basic distinction among the dialects is in the reflex of the long [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavic]] vowel ''[[yat|jat]]'', usually transcribed as *ě. Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of ''jat'' being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short ''jat'' is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a ''ije''/''je'' alternation to retain a distinction.

Standard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Bosnian Serbs, Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.

The jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short ''jat'' is preceded by ''r'', in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix ''prě-'' ("trans-, over-") when long became ''pre-'' in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to ''prije-'' in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into ''pre-'' or ''prije-'' due to potential ambiguity with ''pri-'' ("approach, come close to"). For verbs that had ''-ěti '' in their infinitive, the past participle ending ''-ěl'' evolved into ''-io'' in Ijekavian Neoštokavian.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has specified different [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC) numbers for Croatian ''(UDC 862,'' abbreviation '''hr''') and Serbian ''(UDC 861'', abbreviation '''sr'''), while the cover term ''Serbo-Croatian'' is used to refer to the combination of original signs (''UDC 861/862,'' abbreviation '''sh'''). Furthermore, the ''[[ISO 639]]'' standard designates the Bosnian language with the abbreviations '''bos''' and '''bs'''.

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] considers what it calls ''BCS'' (Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian) to be the main language of all Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian defendants. The indictments, documents, and verdicts of the ICTY are not written with any regard for consistently following the grammatical prescriptions of any of the three standards{{spaced ndash}}be they Serbian, Croatian, or Bosnian.

For utilitarian purposes, the Serbo-Croatian language is often called "''naš jezik''" ("our language") or "''naški''" (sic. "Ourish" or "Ourian") by native speakers. This [[political correctness|politically correct]] term is frequently used to describe the Serbo-Croatian language by those who wish to avoid nationalistic and linguistic discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Štiks |first=Igor |title=Brothers United: The Making of Yugoslavs. |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=27 |language=English |url=http://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&amp;docid=642971 |year=2015 |isbn=9781474221542 |accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Roland |editor1-first=Vogt |last=Đorđe |first=Tomić | title=European National Identities: Elements, Transitions, Conflicts | chapter=From "Yugoslavism" to (Post-)Yugoslav Nationalisms: Understanding Yugoslav Identities |publisher=Routledge |pages=287 |language=English |year=2017 |isbn=9781351296465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views of linguists in the former Yugoslavia ===

==== Serbian linguists ====
The majority of mainstream Serbian linguists consider Serbian and Croatian to be one language, that is called Serbo-Croatian (''srpskohrvatski'') or Croato-Serbian (''hrvatskosrpski'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} A minority of Serbian linguists are of the opinion that Serbo-Croatian did exist, but has, in the meantime, dissolved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==== Croatian linguists ====
The opinion of the majority of Croatian linguists{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} is that there has never been a Serbo-Croatian language, but two different standard languages that overlapped sometime in the course of history. However, Croatian linguist [[Snježana Kordić]] has been leading an academic discussion on this issue in the Croatian journal ''Književna republika''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bib.irb.hr/lista-radova?autor=173535#zncasopis |title=Kordić's publications in ''Književna republika'' |publisher=Bib.irb.hr |accessdate=2013-09-01}} {{ZDB|2122129-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from 2001 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikola |last=Petković |title=Mrsko zrcalo pred licima jezikoslovaca |trans-title=A nasty mirror reflects back at linguists |url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Prikaz_Petkovic_tekst.doc |publisher=''[[Novi list]]'' |location=Rijeka |issn=1334-1545 |date=5 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |page=7 in the arts section ''Mediteran'' |language=Serbo-Croatian |archivedate=5 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68vQ62W6U?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Prikaz_Petkovic_tekst.doc |accessdate=18 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Slobodan |last=Šnajder |authorlink=Slobodan Šnajder |title=Lingvistička bojna |trans-title=Linguistic battle |url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Prikaz_Snajder.doc |publisher=''[[Novi list]]'' |location=Rijeka |issn=1334-1545 |date=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |page=6 in the arts section ''Mediteran'' |language=Serbo-Croatian |archivedate=5 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68vxKkaex?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Prikaz_Snajder.doc |accessdate=6 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the discussion, she shows that linguistic criteria such as mutual intelligibility, the huge overlap in the linguistic system, and the same dialect basis of the standard language are evidence that Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin are four national variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Demagogija umjesto znanosti (odgovor Daliboru Brozoviću) |trans-title=Demagogy instead of science (response to Dalibor Brozović) |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430252.DEMAGOGIJA_UMJESTO_ZNANOSTI.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Književna Republika |volume=1 |issue=7–8 |pages=176–202 |year=2003 |deadurl=no |issn=1334-1057 |archivedate=23 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A7zQNqNr?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430252.DEMAGOGIJA_UMJESTO_ZNANOSTI.PDF |accessdate=8 April 2014 |df= }} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1440910057 (CROLIB)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Autizam hrvatske filologije (odgovor Ivi Pranjkoviću) |trans-title=The autism of Croatian philology (response to Ivo Pranjković) |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430121.AUTIZAM_HRVATSKE_FILOLOGIJE.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Književna Republika |volume=2 |issue=7–8 |pages=254–280 |year=2004 |deadurl=no |issn=1334-1057 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5u0YEK?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/430121.AUTIZAM_HRVATSKE_FILOLOGIJE.PDF |accessdate=1 March 2015 |df= }} [http://katalog.nsk.hr/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000572375 (NSK)].&lt;/ref&gt; Igor Mandić states: "During the last ten years, it has been the longest, the most serious and most acrid discussion (…) in 21st-century Croatian culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Igor |last=Mandić |authorlink=Igor Mandić |title=Svojom polemikom možda pokušava izbrisati naš identitet...

A more detailed overview, incorporating arguments from Croatian philology and contemporary linguistics, would be as follows:

:''Serbo-Croatian is a language''
:One still finds many references to Serbo-Croatian, and proponents of Serbo-Croatian who deny that Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins speak different languages. The usual argument generally goes along the following lines:
:*Standard Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin are completely mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trudgill |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=A glossary of sociolinguistics |location=Oxford &amp; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=119 |oclc=50768041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |page=74 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=The Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin Language |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they use two alphabets that perfectly match each other ([[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]]), thanks to Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadžić. Croats exclusively use Latin script and Serbs equally use both Cyrillic and Latin. Although Cyrillic is taught in Bosnia, most Bosnians, especially non-Serbs ([[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]]), favor Latin.

:*Phonology, morphology, and syntax are not the only dimensions of a language: other fields (semantics, pragmatics, stylistics, [[lexicology]], etc.) also differ slightly. However, it is the case with other pluricentric languages.{{Sfn | Ammon | 1995 | pp = 154–174}} A comparison is made to the closely related [[North Germanic languages]] (or dialects, if one prefers), though these are not fully mutually intelligible as the Serbo-Croatian standards are. A closer comparison may be [[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] in English, which are closer to each other than the latter is to other dialects which are subsumed under "British English".
:*Since the Croatian language as recorded in [[Marin Držić|Držić]] and [[Ivan Gundulić|Gundulić]]'s works (16th and 17th centuries) is virtually the same as the contemporary standard Croatian (understandable archaisms apart), it is evident that the 19th-century formal standardization was just the final touch in the process that, as far as the Croatian language is concerned, had lasted more than three centuries. The radical break with the past, characteristic of modern Serbian (whose vernacular was likely not as similar to Croatian as it is today), is a trait completely at variance with Croatian linguistic history. In short, formal standardization processes for Croatian and Serbian had coincided chronologically (and, one could add, ideologically), but they haven't produced a unified standard language. [[Ivan Gundulić|Gundulić]] did not write in "Serbo-Croatian", nor did [[August Šenoa]]. [[Marko Marulić]] and [[Marin Držić]] wrote in a sophisticated idiom of the Croatian language some 300–350 years before "Serbo-Croatian" ideology appeared. Marulić explicitly called his Čakavian-written ''Judita'' as ''u uerish haruacchi slosena'' ("arranged in Croatian stanzas") in 1501, and the Štokavian grammar and dictionary of [[Bartol Kašić]] written in 1604 unambiguously identifies the ethnonyms ''Slavic'' and ''Illyrian'' with ''Croatian''.

The linguistic debate in this region is more about politics than about linguistics per se.

The topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic, since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time. Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then, as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers. This has been used as an argument to state that Croatian literature Croatian per se, but also includes Serbian and other languages that are part of Serbo-Croatian, These facts undermine the Croatian language proponents' argument that modern-day Croatian is based on a language called Old Croatian.

However, most intellectuals and writers from Dalmatia who used the Štokavian dialect and practiced the Catholic faith saw themselves as part of a Croatian nation as far back as the mid-16th to 17th centuries, some 300 years before Serbo-Croatian ideology appeared. Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as "Slovin" and "Illyrian" (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque [[pan-Slavism]]) '''and''' [[Croats|Croat]]{{spaced ndash}}these 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karadžić, [[Ivan Broz]], noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. [[Vatroslav Jagić]] pointed out in 1864:

: "As I have mentioned in the preface, history knows only two national names in these parts—Croatian and Serbian. As far as Dubrovnik is concerned, the Serbian name was never in use; on the contrary, the Croatian name was frequently used and gladly referred to"
: "At the end of the 15th century [in Dubrovnik and Dalmatia], sermons and poems were exquisitely crafted in the Croatian language by those men whose names are widely renowned by deep learning and piety."

(From ''The History of the Croatian language'', [[Zagreb]], 1864.)

On the other hand, the opinion of Jagić from 1864 is argued not to have firm grounds. When Jagić says "Croatian", he refers to a few cases referring to the Dubrovnik vernacular as ''ilirski'' (Illyrian). This was a common name for all Slavic vernaculars in Dalmatian cities among the Roman inhabitants. In the meantime, other written monuments are found that mention ''srpski'', ''lingua serviana'' (= Serbian), and some that mention Croatian.&lt;ref name="Mladenovic 2004"&gt;Mladenovic. Kratka istorija srpskog književnog jezika. Beograd 2004, 67&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most competent Serbian scientist on the Dubrovnik language issue, [[Milan Rešetar]], who was born in Dubrovnik himself, wrote behalf of language characteristics: "The one who thinks that Croatian and Serbian are two separate languages must confess that Dubrovnik always (linguistically) used to be Serbian."&lt;ref name="Mladenovic 2004" /&gt;

Finally, the former ''medieval'' texts from Dubrovnik and Montenegro dating before the 16th century were neither true Štokavian nor Serbian, but mostly specific a Jekavian-[[Chakavian dialect|Čakavian]] that was nearer to actual [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] islanders in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zekovic &amp; B. Cimeša: Elementa montenegrina, Chrestomatia 1/90. CIP, Zagreb 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political connotations ===
Nationalists have conflicting views about the language(s). The nationalists among the Croats conflictingly claim either that they speak an entirely separate language from Serbs and Bosniaks or that these two peoples have, due to the longer lexicographic tradition among Croats, somehow "borrowed" their standard languages from them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Bosniak nationalists claim that both Croats and Serbs have "appropriated" the [[Bosnian language]], since [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and [[Vuk Karadžić]] preferred the Neoštokavian-Ijekavian dialect, widely spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as the basis for language standardization, whereas the nationalists among the Serbs claim either that any divergence in the language is artificial, or claim that the [[Shtokavian dialect|Štokavian dialect]] is theirs and the [[Chakavian dialect|Čakavian]] Croats'— in more extreme formulations Croats have "taken" or "stolen" their language from the Serbs. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Proponents of unity among Southern Slavs claim that there is a single language with normal dialectal variations. The term "Serbo-Croatian" (or synonyms) is not officially used in any of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.

In Serbia, the Serbian standard has an official status countrywide, while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of [[Vojvodina]]. A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of [[Sandžak]], but the "official recognition" of Bosnian language is moot.&lt;ref&gt;Official communique, 27 December 2004, Serbian Ministry of Education {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school, while it is also in official use in the municipality of [[Novi Pazar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.novipazar.org.rs/sl/gl_06_2002.pdf |title= Opštinski službeni glasnik opštine Novi Pazar }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(65.8&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, 30 April 2002, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; However, its nomenclature is controversial, as there is incentive that it is referred to as "Bosniak" (''bošnjački'') rather than "Bosnian" (''bosanski'') (see [[Bosnian language#Controversy and recognition]] for details).

Croatian is the official language of Croatia, while Serbian is also official in municipalities with significant Serb population.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, all three standard languages are recorded as official but in practice and media, mostly Bosnian and Serbian are applied. Confrontations have on occasion been absurd. The academic [[Muhamed Filipović]], in an interview to Slovenian television, told of a local court in a Croatian district requesting a paid translator to translate from Bosnian to Croatian before the trial could proceed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

'''Shortwave radio''' is [[radio]] transmission using shortwave [[radio frequencies]]. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the [[High frequency|high frequency band (HF)]], and generally extends from {{convert|1.7|–|30|MHz|m|abbr=on}}; from the high end of the [[Medium frequency|medium frequency band (MF)]] just above the [[mediumwave]] AM broadcast band, to the end of the [[High frequency|HF band]].

Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]]. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon.  This is called [[skywave]] or "skip" [[radio propagation|propagation]].  Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ([[line-of-sight propagation]]) and are limited by the visual horizon, about {{convert|40|miles|km}}.  Shortwave radio is used for [[broadcasting]] of voice and music to [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]] over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military [[over-the-horizon radar]], diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.

==Frequency classifications==
The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1 (EU+Africa+Russia...)]] definition, and is the span 1.6–30&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]], just above the [[medium wave]] band, which ends approximately at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz.

There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:
* 1.71&amp;nbsp;to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[ITU Region 2|ITU Region 2 (North and South America...)]]
* 1.8&amp;nbsp;(160&amp;nbsp;meter radio amateur band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 26.1&amp;nbsp;MHz (11&amp;nbsp;meter band end)&lt;ref&gt;Inconsistent article: [http://www.itwissen.info/definition/lexikon/Kurzwelle-SW-short-wave-KW.html itwissen.info: KW (Kurzwelle) SW (short wave)] Quote: "... Der KW-Frequenzbereich (SW) liegt zwischen 3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 30&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-1.&amp;nbsp;definition] ... Kurzwelle ist auch eine sendetechnische Bezeichnung für Rundfunk im Frequenzbereich zwischen 2,3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 26,1&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-2.&amp;nbsp;definition] ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtimeradio.de/lexikon.php oldtimeradio.de: Kleines Radio-Lexikon] Quote: "...

* In [[Germany]] and perhaps [[Austria]] the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1]] shortwave radio frequency interval can be subdivided in:
** ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' ("border waves"): 1.605–3.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darc.de/distrikte/k/35/afu-frequenzen/ darc.de: Amateurfunk Frequenzen] Quote: "... Grenzwelle (Kurzwelle) ...", ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' Quote: "... Als Grenzwelle wird der Frequenzbereich zwischen 1605&amp;nbsp;kHz und 3800&amp;nbsp;kHz bezeichnet, weil er auf der „Grenze" zwischen Mittelwelle und Kurzwelle liegt ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Germany these shortwave radio frequency intervals have also been seen used:

In the schematic it is written that the first shortwave band starts at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (just after the band end of MW/AM): "KW1-SW1-OC1 1,6 .... 5,0&amp;nbsp;MHz"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|right|Radio amateurs carried out the first shortwave transmissions over a long distance before [[Guglielmo Marconi]]]]

The name "shortwave" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the [[radio spectrum]] was considered divided into [[long wave]] (LW), [[medium wave]] (MW) and short wave bands based on the [[wavelength]] of the [[radio wave]]s. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;m (1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the [[medium frequency]] band [[History of radio|first used]] for radio communications. The broadcast [[medium wave]] band now extends above the 200&amp;nbsp;m/1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz limit, and the [[amateur radio]] 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;– 2.0&amp;nbsp;MHz band (known as the "[[top band]]") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'. 

Early long distance [[radio telegraphy]] used [[long wave]]s, below 300&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] (kHz).  The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication, and the very expensive [[transmitter]]s, receivers and gigantic antennas that were required. It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances.  Prior to the 1920s, the shortwave frequencies above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use.&lt;ref name="Nebeker2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederik|last=Nebeker|title=Dawn of the Electronic Age: Electrical Technologies in the Shaping of the Modern World, 1914 to 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwmH6-q5O5AC&amp;pg=PA157|date=6 May 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40974-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]], pioneer of radio, commissioned his assistant [[Charles Samuel Franklin]] to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions. Franklin rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|first=John|last=Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75|isbn=9780852962183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission, by inventing the [[curtain array]] aerial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ni7lDl3k5LwC&amp;dq=%22charles+samuel+franklin%22&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;q=charles+samuel+franklin|title=History of Telegraphy|first=K.

W.|last=Burns|year=1986|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=IET|isbn=0-86341-079-0|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1924, Marconi entered into contracts with the British [[General Post Office]] (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]]. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/beyondionosphere00unitrich/beyondionosphere00unitrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Beyond the ionosphere : fifty years of satellite communication" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from [[Submarine communications cable|transoceanic cables]] and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations,&lt;ref name="Hugill1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Hugill|title=Global Communications Since 1844: Geopolitics and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjfBkup-ccMC&amp;pg=PA129|date=4 March 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6074-4|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s. Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables, although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@carcbradio/cable-companies-595de8871f6b Cable and Wireless Plc History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320053915/http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 |date=2015-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless Ltd.]] in 1934.

Long-distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT-1 across the Atlantic Ocean, the first voice frequency cable on this route. This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world. These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications.

===Amateur use of shortwave propagation===
[[File:Dial.png|thumb|right|[[Hallicrafters SX-28]] shortwave receiver analog tuning dial, circa 1944]]
[[Amateur radio|Amateur radio operators]] also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used [[surface wave]] propagation at [[Very low frequency|very low frequencies]],&lt;ref&gt;Stormfax. [http://www.stormfax.com/wireless.htm Marconi Wireless on Cape Cod]&lt;/ref&gt; which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000&amp;nbsp;meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-club-of-america.org/history.php?page=1921.html |title=1921 – Club Station 1BCG and the Transatlantic Tests |accessdate=2009-09-05 |publisher=Radio Club of America }}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the 200&amp;nbsp;meter [[mediumwave]] band (near 1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz in the modern AM broadcast band) – the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200&amp;nbsp;meters and at least 20&amp;nbsp;North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200&amp;nbsp;meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available [[vacuum tube]]s shortly after World War&amp;nbsp;I.

Extreme interference at the longer edge of the 150–200&amp;nbsp;meter band – the official wavelengths allocated to [[amateur radio operators|amateurs]] by the Second National Radio Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106763342;view=1up;seq=63 |title=Radio Service Bulletin No.&amp;nbsp;72, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–13 |accessdate=2009-09-05 |date=1923-04-02 |publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923 – forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150&amp;nbsp;meters (2&amp;nbsp;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150&amp;nbsp;meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100&amp;nbsp;meters (3&amp;nbsp;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130112737/http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 |date=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000&amp;nbsp;miles (9,600&amp;nbsp;km) and more. On 21&amp;nbsp;September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two-way contacts with an amateur in [[New Zealand]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90&amp;nbsp;minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On 10&amp;nbsp;October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924conf.htm |title=Recommendations for Regulation of Radio: October&amp;nbsp;6–10, 1924 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[80-meter band|80&amp;nbsp;meters]] (3.75&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[40-meter band|40&amp;nbsp;meters]] (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[20-meter band|20&amp;nbsp;meters]] (14&amp;nbsp;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the [[10-meter band|10&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (28&amp;nbsp;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twiar.org/aaarchives/WB008.txt&lt;/ref&gt; on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1927. The [[15-meter band|15&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (21&amp;nbsp;MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1952.

==Propagation characteristics==
[[Image:Skip Zone Example.gif|thumb|right|Formation of a [[skip zone]]]]
Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by [[ionospheric reflection]] back to the earth by the [[ionosphere]], (a phenomenon known as "[[skywave]] propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a [[skip zone]] where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.

As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere, propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths,
[[Scattering|scattered]] by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops, a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques. Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band, absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer, the D layer, may impose a serious limit. This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules, absorbing some of a [[radio frequency]]'s energy and converting it to heat.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Rawer:"Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere". Kluwer, Dordrecht 1993 {{ISBN|0-7923-0775-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions of skywave propagation depend on:
* The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver.
* Time of day.  During the day, frequencies higher than approximately 12&amp;nbsp;MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones. At night, this property is reversed.
* With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer, the [[D layer|D Layer]], forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons.
* Season. During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres, the AM/MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness.
* [[Solar flare]]s produce a large increase in D region ionization so high, sometimes for periods of several minutes, all skywave propagation is nonexistent.

==Types of modulation==
{{Further|Modulation}}
[[Image:Shortwave Radio.jpg|thumb|right|National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver, circa 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shortwaveradio.ch/radio-e/panasonic-e.htm Panasonic/National] ShortwaveRadio.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several different types of [[Modulation|modulation]] are used to incorporate information in a short-wave signal.

===Audio modes===
;AM
[[Amplitude modulation]] is the simplest type and the most commonly used for [[International broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple [[detector (radio)|detector]] recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.

;SSB
[[Single sideband]] transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the [[carrier frequency]]. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly {{frac|2|3}} of the energy sent by an AM signal is in the “carrier”, which is not needed to recover the information contained in the signal. It also reduces signal bandwidth, enabling less than one-half the AM signal bandwidth to be used.

The drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, [[Citizen's Band]], and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is customarilly used below 9&amp;nbsp;MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9&amp;nbsp;MHz.

;VSB
[[Vestigal sideband]] transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio [[time signal]] stations. [[Single sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|Vestigial sideband]] is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and [[8VSB|digital]].

;NFM
Narrow-band [[frequency modulation]] (NBFM or NFM) is used typically above 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. Because of the larger [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] required, NBFM is commonly used for [[VHF]] communication. Regulations limit the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian Robertson |last=Sinclair |title=Audio and Hi-Fi Handbook |publisher=Newnes |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7506-4975-5 |pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;DRM
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. It is a digital signal, like the data modes, below, but is for transmitting audio, like the analog modes above.

===Data modes===
;CW
[[Continuous wave]] (CW) is [[on-off keying|on-and-off keying]] of a carrier, used for [[Morse code]] communications and [[Hellschreiber]] [[facsimile]]-based [[teleprinter]] transmissions. It is a data mode, although often listed separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feld Hell Club |url=https://sites.google.com/site/feldhellclub/Home/feld-hell-faq |website=Google Sites |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;RTTY, FAX, SSTV
[[Radioteletype]], fax, digital, [[slow-scan television]], and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.

Note that on modern computer-driven systems, digital modes are typically sent by coupling a computer's sound output to the SSB input of a radio.

==Users==
[[File:Shortwave_Radio_Dial.jpg|thumb|right|Portable shortwave receiver's digital display tuned to the [[80-meter band|75 meter band]]]]
Some established users of the shortwave radio bands may include:
* [[International broadcasting]] primarily by government-sponsored [[propaganda]], international news (for example, the [[BBC World Service]]) or cultural stations to foreign audiences: the most common use of all.
* Domestic broadcasting: to widely dispersed populations with few [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]] and FM stations serving them; or for specialty political, religious and [[alternative media]] networks; or of individual commercial and non-commercial paid broadcasts.
* Oceanic [[air traffic control]] uses the HF/shortwave band for long distance communication to aircraft over the oceans and poles, which are far beyond the range of traditional [[VHF]] frequencies. Modern systems also include satellite communications, such as ADS-C/[[CPDLC]]
* [[Utility station|"Utility" stations]] transmitting messages not intended for the general public, such as merchant shipping, marine weather, and ship-to-shore stations; for aviation weather and air-to-ground communications; for military communications; for long-distance governmental purposes, and for other non-broadcast communications.
* [[Amateur radio]] operators at the [[80-meter band|80/75]], [[60-meter band|60]], [[40-meter band|40]], [[30-meter band|30]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[17-meter band|17]], [[15-meter band|15]], [[12-meter band|12]], and [[10-meter band|10-meter]] bands. Licenses are granted by authorized government agencies.
* [[Time signal]] and [[radio clock]] stations: In North America, [[WWV (radio station)|WWV radio]] and [[WWVH|WWVH radio]] transmit at these frequencies: 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz; and WWV also transmits on 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[CHU (radio station)|CHU radio station]] in Canada transmits on the following frequencies: 3.33&amp;nbsp;MHz, 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz. Other similar [[radio clock]] stations transmit on various shortwave and longwave frequencies around the world. The shortwave transmissions are primarily intended for human reception, while the longwave stations are generally used for automatic synchronization of watches and clocks.

Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include:
* [[Clandestine radio|Clandestine stations]]. These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces. They may advocate civil war, insurrection, rebellion against the government-in-charge of the country to which they are directed. Clandestine broadcasts may emanate from transmitters located in rebel-controlled territory or from outside the country entirely, using another country's transmission facilities.&lt;ref name="Sterling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H. Sterling|title=Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA538|date=March 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45649-8|pages=538–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Numbers Station]]s. These stations regularly appear and disappear all over the shortwave radio band but are unlicensed and untraceable. It is believed that Numbers Stations are operated by government agencies and are used to communicate with clandestine operatives working within foreign countries. However, no definitive proof of such use has emerged. Because the vast majority of these broadcasts contain nothing but the recitation of blocks of numbers, in various languages, with occasional bursts of music, they have become known colloquially as "Number Stations". Perhaps the most noted Number Station is the [[Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station)|"Lincolnshire Poacher"]], named after the 18th century English folk song, which is transmitted just before the sequences of numbers.
* Unlicensed [[two way radio]] activity by individuals such as taxi drivers, bus drivers and fishermen in various countries can be heard on various shortwave frequencies. Such unlicensed transmissions by "pirate" or "bootleg" two way radio operators&lt;ref name="Magazines1940"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=January 1940|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; can often cause [[Co-channel interference|signal interference]] to licensed stations.&lt;ref name="IARU"&gt;{{cite web|title=IARU Monitoring System|url=http://www.iaru.org/monitoring-system.html|website=iaru.org|publisher=International Amateur Radio Union (IARU)|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pirate radio]] broadcasters who feature programming such as music, talk and other entertainment, can be heard sporadically and in various modes on the shortwave bands.&lt;ref name="Yoder2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R.

* [[Over-the-horizon radar]]: From 1976 to 1989, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Russian Woodpecker]] over-the-horizon radar system blotted out numerous shortwave broadcasts daily.

The [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC), organized under the auspices of the [[International Telecommunication Union]], allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The last WRC took place in 2007.

At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for [[international broadcasting]]. AM shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz separation for traditional analog audio broadcasting.

Although countries generally follow the table above, there may be small differences between countries or regions. For example, in the official bandplan of the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/frequentiebeleid/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2007/01/18/nationaal-frequentieplan-nfp.html|title=Nationaal Frequentieplan|author=|date=|website=rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 49 m band starts at 5.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 41 m band ends at 7.45&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 11 m band starts at 25.67&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the 120, 90 and 60 m bands are absent altogether. Additionally, international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies. This is done for practical reasons, or to attract attention in crowded bands (60m, 49m, 40m, 41m, 31m, 25m).

The new [[digital audio broadcasting]] format for shortwave [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] operates 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz format.

The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and [[over-the-horizon radar]]. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] designs (like the [[ALLISS]] antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.

===Advantages===
[[File:Soviet SWL URS3-108-B.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Soviet union|Soviet]] shortwave listener in [[Borisoglebsk]], 1941]]
Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:
* Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries: unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet, government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations (sites) are being listened to (accessed). For example, during the attempted coup against Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], when his access to communications was limited (e.g. his phones were cut off, etc.), Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the [[BBC World Service]] on shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld7078.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low-cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world. Simple shortwave [[regenerative receiver]]s can be easily built with a few parts.
* In many countries (particularly in most developing nations and in the [[Eastern bloc]] during the [[Cold War]] era) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Habrat| first = Marek| title = Odbiornik "Roksana" (Radio constructor's recollections)| url=http://oldradio.pl/karta_odb.php?nrmod=471| accessdate = 2008-08-05| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave).
* Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery-operated, making them useful in difficult circumstances. Newer technology includes [[hand-cranked radio]]s which provide power without batteries.
* Shortwave radios can be used in situations where [[Internet]] or [[satellite communications]] service is temporarily or long-term unavailable (or unaffordable).
* Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM (88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz). Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers, including from one continent to another.
* Particularly in tropical regions, SW is somewhat less prone to interference from [[thunderstorms]] than [[medium wave|medium wave radio]], and is able to cover a large geographic area with relatively low power (and hence cost). Therefore, in many of these countries it is widely used for domestic broadcasting.
* Very little infrastructure is required for long-distance two-way communications using shortwave radio. All one needs is a pair of transceivers, each with an antenna, and a source of energy (such as a battery, a portable generator, or the electrical grid). This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications, which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions. Modern digital transmission modes such as [[MFSK]] and [[Olivia MFSK|Olivia]] are even more robust, allowing successful reception of signals well below the [[noise floor]] of a conventional receiver.

===Disadvantages===
Shortwave radio's benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks, including:
* In most Western countries, shortwave radio ownership is usually limited to true enthusiasts, since most new standard radios do not receive the shortwave band. Therefore, Western audiences are limited.
* In the developed world, shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode]] power adapters, fluorescent or LED light sources, internet modems and routers, computers and many other sources of [[radio interference]].

==Shortwave listening==

{{Main|Shortwave listening}}

The Asia-Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600 million [[Shortwave receiver|shortwave broadcast-radio receivers]] in use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210001613/http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc |date=February 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WWCR]] claims that there are 1.5 billion shortwave receivers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Arlyn T. Anderson.

Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters. In some cases, the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible ''([[DXing]])''; others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or "ute", transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals from [[numbers stations]], stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations, or the two way communications by amateur radio operators. Some short wave listeners behave analogously to "lurkers" on the Internet, in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals.  Other listeners participate in clubs, or actively send and receive QSL cards, or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own.

Many listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience (such as [[Radio Taiwan International]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio France Internationale]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Voice of Korea]], [[Radio Free Sarawak]] etc.). Today, through the evolution of the Internet, the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world, even without owning a shortwave radio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dxing.com/webclink.htm Web-Controlled Radios] DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely, or severely curtailed it, in favour of internet transmission.

Shortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain [[QSL card]]s from broadcasters, utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby. Some stations even give out special certificates, pennants, stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners.

==Shortwave broadcasts and music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1994 WDR.jpg|thumb|right|Composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]]]
Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which—due to the nature of amplitude modulation, varying propagation conditions, and the presence of interference—generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts (particularly via FM stations). Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion, and "hollow" sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies, altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange "spacey" quality due to echoes and phase distortion.  Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions, by means of delays or feedback loops, equalizers, or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments.  Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments, by means of analogue [[tape loop]]s or [[digital sampler|digital samples]].  Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing, with various distortions added, to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception.&lt;ref name="Wörner1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Heinrich Wörner|title=Stockhausen; Life and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqmMPnlXZOMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02143-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sheppard|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZluAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-107-2|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wire&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB5MAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=C. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician [[Léon Theremin]],&lt;ref name=Wire /&gt; who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 ([[regenerative circuit]]s in radios of the time were prone to breaking into [[oscillation]], adding various tonal [[harmonics]] to music and speech); and in the same year, the development of a French instrument called the [[Ondes Martenot]] by its inventor [[Maurice Martenot]], a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] used shortwave radio and effects in works including ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67), ''[[Kurzwellen]]'' (1968)—adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in ''Opus 1970'' with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces—''[[Spiral (Stockhausen)|Spiral]]'' (1968), ''[[Pole (Stockhausen)|Pole]]'', ''[[Expo (Stockhausen)|Expo]]'' (both 1969–70), and ''[[Licht#Wednesday|Michaelion]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Wörner1973" /&gt;

[[Cyprus|Cypriot]] composer [[Yannis Kyriakides]] incorporated shortwave [[numbers station]] transmissions in his 1999 ''ConSPIracy cantata''.&lt;ref name="Dolp2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Dolp|title=Arvo Pärt's White Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=13 July 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-18289-9|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holger Czukay]], a student of Stockhausen, was one of the first to use shortwave in a [[rock music]] context.&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009" /&gt; In 1975, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] recorded a full length [[concept album]] around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds, entitled ''[[Radioactivity (album)|Radio-Activity]]''.&lt;ref name="Barr2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Barr|title=Kraftwerk: from Dusseldorf to the Future With Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mcj4h2qEhQC&amp;pg=PT98|date=31 August 2013|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-7776-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The The]]'s Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php Radio Cineola] www.thethe.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218173001/http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php |date=December 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortwave's future==
[[File:Penny Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|PC spectrum display of a modern [[software defined radio|software defined]] shortwave receiver]]
{{Further|Shortwave listening#Future of shortwave listening}}

The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new [[digital radio]] technology, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of [[power line communication]] (PLC), also known as [[Broadband over Power Lines]] (BPL), which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands, severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="HrasnicaHaidine2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halid Hrasnica|author2=Abdelfatteh Haidine|author3=Ralf Lehnert|title=Broadband Powerline Communications: Network Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d270N6yvWCoC&amp;pg=PA34|date=14 January 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85742-7|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts disagree on the future of shortwave. According to Andy Sennitt, former editor of the [[World Radio TV Handbook]], “shortwave is a legacy technology, which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly. A few countries are hanging on to it, but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone. Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures".&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt;

However Thomas Witherspoon, editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that “shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity". According to Nigel Fry, head of Distribution for the [[BBC World Service]] Group, “I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century, especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure".&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Careless|first1=James|title=The Evolution of Shortwave Radio|url=http://www.radioworld.com/digital-radio/0014/the-evolution-of-shortwave-radio/338422|website=Radio World|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7144">'''Spam poetry''', sometimes called '''spoetry''', is poetic verse composed primarily from the subject lines or content of [[E-mail spam|spam]] e-mail messages.

==History==
Several writers have claimed to have created spam poetry, and consensus has not emerged about a single origin. Some early examples come from a spam poetry competition held in 2000 by the website ''Satire Wire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heatherhaley.com/hh2/?tag=spoetry|title=spoetry {{!}} Heather Haley|website=heatherhaley.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satirewire.com/features/poetry_spam/spam_winner.shtml|title=SatireWire - Strictly Spam Category Winner|website=www.satirewire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] began writing spam poems in his production journal in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/forum.html|title=don hertzfeldt :: alone in a taxicab in a snowing foreign country at 3 in the morning|website=www.bitterfilms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translator Jorge Candeias wrote Portuguese "spoems" daily, between 5 May 2003 and 5 May 2004, using spam subject lines as title and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lampadamagica.blogspot.com/2007/05/spamesia-aqui-est-uma-das-tais-postas.html|title=A Lâmpada Mágica: Spamesia|first=Jorge|last=Candeias|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''Machine Language'' by [[endwar (concrete poet)|endwar]] was published in 2005 by IZEN and was followed by ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'' also by endwar in 2006. The latter edition includes a CD of spoetry read by [[Microsoft Sam]] and set to ambient musical sounds by Michael Truman who also tweaked the automated readings.  Each edition indicates endwar as editor, but in the second edition he has admitted to using [[cut-up technique]] and having combined shorter pieces from the first edition, which lends more authorship to him in his creation.  These pieces were also read at the opening of ''Blends &amp; Bridges'', a concrete and visual poetry show at Gallery 324 in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 1, 2006, by endwar with the sounds by Truman backing.  The experimental poet, endwar, cites his own collaboration with Ficus Strangulensis, the experimental poet, in 1995, ''The Further Last Words of Dutch Schultz'' published by IZEN as an earlier experiment in generating random text poetry, in this case, the software altered text of the bizarre last words of [[Dutch Schultz]] as published in [[The New York Times]] in 1935, as well as the cut-up influences of [[Brion Gysin]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] and even the musicians [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language, Version 2.1'', endwar, IZEN, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful bits of spam for purposes of endwar's variation of spoetry, i.e., the part that is not the advertisement, but the random words assigned to trick spam filters, endwar calls "paratext".  Endwar indicates that, in his view, "the effect of the evolution of paratext is that computers are learning to talk to each other by in some sense imitating human texts."  &lt;ref&gt;[intro to ''Machine Language'', endwar, IZEN, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertisements are the human-to-human conversation in the same email sources.

A book entitled 'Spam: E-mail Inspired Poems' by [[Ben Myers]] was published in 2008 by Blackheath Books [http://www.blackheathbooks.org.uk/2.html] Myers claims to have been writing spam poems since 1999.

The creation of spoetry is similar to Gysin and Burroughs's cut-up technique in that individual subject lines of messages are pieced together in poetic form; making the creation of spoetry an exercise not in creativity as much as in having an eye for the unexpected.

The end result can be crafted into any literary form the author desires: [[haiku]], [[concrete poetry]], [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]], [[dada]], and so on.  Thus, spoetry is not a literary form but rather a means of creating poetry.

A related concept is spam lit, where snippets of nonsensical verse and prose are embedded in [[spam (electronic)|spam]] e-mail messages. Some of the snippets are original content, others are passages or conglomerations from [[public domain|public-domain]] works. The term was coined by a member of the Poetics [[listserv]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&amp;L=poetics&amp;D=1&amp;H=1&amp;O=D&amp;P=60037|title=Listserv 16.0 - Archives - Error|website=listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, [[David Kestenbaum]] of NPR's ''[[Morning Edition]]'' broadcast a story on "Literary Spam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5624749|title=Spam Goes Literary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kestenbaum notes that [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], a programmer, "wrote a program to find out how to best separate spam from real e-mail. To train it, he fed it a good helping of spam and a separate sample of real e-mail." Soon, spammers discovered the works of long-dead poets and writers as one way to circumvent Graham's [[anti-spam]] code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5592">[[File:Machined Holes.svg|thumb|Spotfacer is marked '''F'''. Similar to an endmill but with flat-bottom plunging ability. The tool at '''E''', a [[counterbore]], is also often used for spotfacing in manual machining (not so much in CNC machining).]]

A '''spotface''' or '''spot face''' is a [[machining|machined]] feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is [[facing (machining)|faced]], providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces [[casting|cast]] or [[forging|forged]], where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[flatness (manufacturing)|flatness]], and location are subject to wider [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of '''spotfacing''' ('''spot facing''') is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow [[counterbore]], just deep enough "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a [[boss (engineering)|boss]], creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, without the need for finishing all over (FAO). 

The cutters most often used to cut spotfaces are [[counterbore]] cutters and [[endmill]]s. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in [[numerical control|CNC]] machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs [[milling cutter#Face mill |face mills]]. 

'''Backspotfacing''' ('''back spot facing''') is analogous to backboring, meaning that the tool manages to reach to the far side of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with [[boring bar]]s reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut (for example, in the [[G-code#G76_bore_on_mill|G76 fine boring cycle]]), or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion. Such back-cutting operations can obviate second operations,&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Hider |editor-first=Julia |date=2018-03-15 |title=Back-spotfacing tool frees production from costly bottlenecks |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=https://www.mmsonline.com/blog/post/back-spotfacing-tool-frees-production-from-costly-bottlenecks |accessdate=2018-03-16 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their attendant setup time and part rehandling time. Sometimes the limiting factor in applying this advantage is the difficulty of [[swarf|chip]] clearance; the operator needs to intervene because chip nests prevent the tool from passing freely and opening and closing freely.&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; In such cases, improved chipbreaking via different [[tipped tool|inserts]] in the main operation may help, and backspotfacing tools powered by [[cutting fluid|coolant pressure]] and using through-tool coolant feed may succeed where others cannot (opening, cutting, and retracting despite some chips),&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; not only obviating a second operation but also making the main operation less reliant on operator intervention and program stops ([[G-code#M00|M00 or M01]]) than a lesser backspotfacing tool would.&lt;ref name="Hider_2018-03-15"/&gt; 

Some fastener designs can obviate spotfacing for some applications. For example, a [[self-aligning nut]] allows the nut to find its own perpendicularity to the thread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup arrangement). 

[[Technical standard|Standards]] exist for the sizes of spotfaces, especially for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between [[standards organization]]s. For example, in [[Boeing]] Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spot-faced surface is the same as the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the [[ASME]] Y14.5-2009 definition of a spotface, which is equal to the flat seat diameter.

In [[Scottish English]], a '''stickit minister''' is a candidate for [[holy orders]] who either fails to pass the church's examination, or who gives an unsatisfactory [[sermon]] during his probationary period. ''Stickit minister'' is a [[colloquial]] [[idiom]] that connotes disgrace or dishonour. The [[Scottish Gaelic]] equivalent is '''''ministear-maide'''''.

There are two possible origins: One is, as the Scottish Gaelic version ''maide'' implies, that the minister is "wooden" and stick like, or alternatively that it refers to hesitancy, or "sticking". (''stickit'' is the [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] for stuck). [[John Jamieson]] quotes an example: "Puir lad! The first time he tried to preach, he stickit his sermon", and further glosses: "A speech is stickit when the speaker hesitates and is unable to proceed".{{Cite quote|date=March 2016}}

The stickit minister was a recurring theme in [[Scottish literature]] during the 18th and 19th centuries; the most notable example is [[S. R. Crockett]]'s short story "The Stickit Minister" (1893). A theme of this work is the humanity of Christianity. The stories offer examples of good ministerial behaviour and bad, and they theorise the role of faith in confronting hypocrisy, whether in others or in oneself.

The term is not related to the [[Religion of the Yellow Stick]].

{{Language_word_order_frequency}}
In [[linguistic typology]], '''subject–verb–object''' ('''SVO''') is a sentence structure where the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] comes first, the [[verb]] second, and the [[object (grammar)|object]] third. Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). The label is often used for [[ergative language]]s that do not have subjects, but have an '''[[agent (grammar)|agent]]–verb–object''' order.

SVO is used in the active voice. SVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]. Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 75% of the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Crystal| first = David| authorlink = David Crystal| title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language | edition = 2nd| year = 1997| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 0-521-55967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most common order developed in [[Creole language]]s, suggesting that it may be somehow more initially 'obvious' to human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]. ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee]]''. p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages regarded as SVO include: [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (but see below), [[French language|French]], [[Luganda|Ganda]], [[Modern Greek grammar#Syntax|Greek]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (with the [[V2 word order|V2]] restriction), [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Modern Hebrew]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Quiché language|Quiche]], [[Rapa language|Reo Rapa]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]], [[Russian language|Russian]] (but see below), [[Serbo-Croatian grammar|Serbian, Croatian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (but see below), [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

[[Ancient Greek]] has free syntactic order, though [[Classical Greece|Classical Greeks]] tended to favor SOV. Many famous phrases are SVO, however.

==Properties==
Subject–verb–object languages almost always place [[relative clause]]s after the nouns they modify and [[adverbial subordinator]]s before the clause modified, with [[varieties of Chinese]] being notable exceptions.

Although some subject–verb–object languages in [[West Africa]], the best known being [[Ewe language|Ewe]], use [[postposition]]s in noun phrases, the vast majority of them, such as English, have [[preposition]]s. Most subject–verb–object languages place genitives after the noun, but a significant minority, including the postpositional SVO languages of West Africa, the [[Hmong–Mien languages]], some [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], and European languages like Swedish, Danish, Lithuanian and Latvian have ''prenominal'' genitives&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/feature/description/86 Order of Genitive and Noun]&lt;/ref&gt; (as would be expected in an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV language]]).

Non-European languages, usually subject–verb–object languages, have a strong tendency to place [[adjective]]s, [[demonstrative]]s and [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] after nouns that they modify, but Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian place numerals before nouns, as in English. Some linguists have come to view the numeral as the head in the
E relationship to fit the rigid right-branching of these languages.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark; "Word order in Austronesian from north to south and west to east" in ''Linguistic Typology'' 11 (2007); p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong tendency, as in English, for main verbs to be preceded by auxiliaries: ''I '''am''' thinking. He '''should''' reconsider.''

==Sample sentences==
An example of SVO order in English is:
:''Andy ate cereal.''
In [[analytic language]]s such as English, subject-verb-object order is relatively inflexible because it identifies which part of the sentence is the subject and which one is the object. ("The dog bit Andy" and "Andy bit the dog" mean two completely different things, while, in case of "Bit Andy the dog", it may be difficult to determine whether it's a complete sentence or a fragment, with "Andy the dog" the object and an omitted/implied subject.) The situation is more complex in languages that have no word order imposed by their grammar; example: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] have both the [[VO language|VO]] and [[OV language|OV]] constructs in their common word order uses.

In some languages, some word orders are considered more "natural" than others. In some, the order is the matter of emphasis. For example, [[Russian language|Russian]] allows the use of subject-verb-object in any order and "shuffles" parts to bring up a slightly different contextual meaning each time. E.g. "любит она его" (loves she him) may be used to point out "she acts this way because she LOVES him", or "его она любит" (him she loves) is used in the context "if you pay attention, you'll see that HE is the one she truly loves", or "его любит она" (him loves she) may appear along the lines "I agree that cat is a disaster, but since my wife adores it and I adore her...". Regardless of order, it is clear that "его" is the object because it is in the [[accusative case]]. In [[Polish language|Polish]], SVO order is basic in an affirmative sentence, and a different order is used to either emphasize some part of it or to adapt it to a broader context logic. For example, "''Roweru'' ci nie kupię" (I won't buy you ''a bicycle''), "''Od piątej'' czekam" (I've been waiting ''since five'').&lt;ref&gt;''Polish, An Essential Grammar'' by Dana Bielec (Routledge, 2007), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], it is normal to use [[subject-object-verb|SOV]], but SVO may be used sometimes to emphasize the verb. For example, "John terketti Mary'yi" (Lit. ''John/left/Mary'': John left Mary) is the answer to the question "What did John do with Mary?" instead of the regular [SOV] sentence "John Mary'yi terketti" (Lit. ''John/Mary/left'').

In [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], SOV with [[V2 word order]] in main clauses coexists with SOV in subordinate clauses, as given in Example 1 below; and a change in syntax, such as by bringing an adpositional phrase to the front of the sentence for emphasis, may also dictate the use of VSO, as in Example 2. In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3. 
#"Er weiß, dass ich jeden Sonntag das Auto wasche" (German: "He knows that I wash the car every Sunday", lit. "He knows, that I every Sunday the car wash"). Cf. the simple sentence "Ich wasche das Auto jeden Sonntag", "I wash the car every Sunday".
#"Elke zondag was ik de auto" (Dutch: "Every Sunday I wash the car", lit. "Every Sunday wash I the car"). "Ik was de auto elke zondag" translates perfectly into English "I wash the car every Sunday", but as a result of changing the syntax, [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] SV-&gt;VS takes place. 
#"mye ees phyikyir yithi.ni tsi temyis ciThy '''dyikh'''" (Kashmiri: "I was afraid you might give him the letter", lit. "to.me was worry lest you to.him letter '''will.give'''"). If the embedded clause is introduced by the transparent conjunction ''zyi'' the SOV order changes to SVO. "mye ees phyikyir (zyi) tsi maa '''dyikh''' temyis ciThy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hook, P.E. |author2=O.N. Koul. |lastauthoramp=yes |year= 1996|title= Kashmiri as a V-2 language |editors= In V.S. Lakshmi and A. Mukherjee |work= Word order in Indian languages |publisher= Centre of Advanced Study in Linguistics| location = Osmania University| page = 102| ISBN = 81-85194-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English developed from such a reordering language and still bears traces of this word order, for example in locative inversion ("In the garden '''sat''' a cat.") and some clauses beginning with negative expressions: "only" ("Only then '''do''' we find X."), "not only" ("Not only '''did''' he storm away but also slammed the door."), "under no circumstances" ("under no circumstances '''are''' the students allowed to use a mobile phone"), "never" ("Never '''have''' I done that."), "on no account" and the like. In such cases, [[Do-support|''do''-support]] is sometimes required, depending on the construction.

{{main|Kinship}}

'''Sudanese kinship''', also referred to as the '''descriptive system''', is a [[Kinship and descent|kinship]] system used to define [[family]]. Identified by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in his 1871 work ''Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family'', the Sudanese system is one of the six major kinship systems ([[Eskimo kinship|Eskimo]], [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian]], [[Iroquois kinship|Iroquois]], [[Crow kinship|Crow]], [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]] and Sudanese).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/kinterms/termsys.html|title=Systematic Kinship Terminologies|first=Brian|last=Schwimmer|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sudanese kinship system is the most complicated of all kinship systems.  It maintains a separate designation for almost every one of Ego's kin, based on their distance from Ego, their relation, and their gender. Ego's father is distinguished from Ego's father's brother and from Ego's mother's brother. Ego's mother is similarly distinguished from Ego's mother's sister and from Ego's father's sister.  For cousins, there are eight possible terms.

==Usage==
The system is named for the peoples of [[South Sudan]], [[Africa]].  The Sudanese kinship system also existed in ancient Latin-speaking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/kinterms/latin.html|title=Latin Kin Terms|first=Brian|last=Schwimmer|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anglo-Saxon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/kinterms/oldenglish.html|title=Old English Kinterms|first=Brian|last=Schwimmer|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; cultures.  It exists today among present day-[[Arab]] and Turkish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/case_studies/turkish/turkterm.html "Turkish Kinship Terms"], University of Manitoba&lt;/ref&gt; cultures. It tends to co-occur with [[patrilineal]] descent, and it is often said to be common in complex and stratified cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthro.palomar.edu/kinship/kinship_5.htm "Nature of Kinship"], University of Palomar&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variants'''

Balkan kinships such as [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], and [[Bosniak]] follow this system for different [[patrilinear]] and [[matrilinear]] uncles but collapse mother's sister and father's sister into the same term of "aunt" and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] further collapse the offspring of the uncles into one term.

On the opposite side, [[Chinese kinship|Chinese]] system often makes a distinction between older and younger sibling of the parent (it is impossible to just say e.g. "father's brother" unless with circumlocution, it is either "father's older brother" or "father's younger brother"), as well as of the subject. This applies to both uncles and aunts, both patrilinear and matrilinear.

'''Thai Song''', or '''Lao Song''', is a [[Tai languages|Tai language]] of [[Thailand]]. The Tai Song originally settled in [[Phetchaburi Province]], and from there went to settle in various provinces such as Kanchanaburi, Ratchaburi, Suphanburi, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, Nakhon Sawan, and Phitsanulok (Somsonge 2012).

"'''The Russians are coming'''" is a phrase attributed to [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1949. In full, Forrestal said "The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They're right around. I've seen Russian soldiers."&lt;ref name="Carroll2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Carroll|title=House of War: The Pentagon and the Disastrous Rise of American Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yAxVS2R0WUC&amp;pg=PA152|date=June 2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-87201-9|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrestal allegedly uttered those words while suffering from mental illness, not long before purportedly committing suicide.  The allegation originated with Forrestal's bitter political enemy, columnist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], and has been verified by no other person.  This is what Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley have to say about the episode in their 1992 book, ''Driven Patriot, the Life and Times of James Forrestal'':

{{quote|Pearson had, in fact, decided to fire his heaviest ammunition in a radio broadcast on April 9. He charged that Forrestal, awakened by the sound of a fire siren (on the night of April 1 at Hobe Sound), had rushed out of his cottage screaming, "The Russians are attacking." He defined Forrestal's condition as "temporary insanity." In subsequent newspaper columns he asserted that Forrestal made three suicide attempts while in Florida – by drug overdose, by hanging, and by slashing his wrists. According to a later statement by [Navy psychiatrist Captain George] Raines, all of these assertions were lies.|pp. 455–456.}}

Since then the phrase has been [[The Russians are coming (disambiguation)|used in various contexts]].

'''Theming''' refers to "the use of an overarching theme...to create a holistic and integrated spatial organization of a consumer venue.”&lt;ref name="Lukas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lukas|first=Scott A.|date=2007|title=The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation and Self|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theme is “a unifying or dominant idea or motif”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theming|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/theming|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so theming is the process of designing and constructing an object or space so that “the particular subject or idea on which the style of something is based”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made clear through the “synthesis of recognizable symbols with spatial forms.”&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt;

Theming is applied to an environment in order to create a memorable and meaningful experience for individuals or groups that visit the space, and can be expressed through the use of architecture, decor, signage, music and sound design, costuming, integrated technology, special effects, and other techniques.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Theming is increasingly used to create physical spaces for "[[experiential marketing]],” in which consumers can connect and interact with a brand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/experiential-marketing-definition-ds00/ Experiential Marketing, Defined — and Examples to Inspire You]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most large-scale themed environments were primarily designed for entertainment, so the industry that creates these venues is known as themed entertainment. Examples include [[theme parks]], water parks, museums, zoos, visitor centers, casinos, [[theme restaurants]], and resorts.&lt;ref name="TEA"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/About-us/About-us/ About Us]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Theming is also increasingly used on smaller scale projects, including parties and product launches, to make these events more impactful.&lt;ref name="Quainton"&gt;{{cite article|last=Quainton|first=David|date=August 2009|title=Prepare for Impact (Advice Bureau Theming)|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43616310/prepare-impact|publisher=Event Magazine (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common themes include holidays (such as [[Christmas]] and [[Valentine’s Day]]), historical eras (such as the [[Medieval Period]] and the [[American frontier]]), cultures (such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Polynesian culture]]), and literary genres (such as [[Fantasy]] and [[Science fiction]]).

==History==

Theming has been used in public spaces at least as far back as the [[World's fair|World’s Fairs]] of the Nineteenth Century. Professor Susan Ingram argues that the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London was, in effect, the world’s first theme park, utilizing theming to further its pro-industrial message, and reproducing foreign lands as spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-historical-development-of-themed.html The Historical Development of Themed Space: Susan Ingram on Industrial Europe and the Commodification of Leisure]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] in Chicago introduced a separate [[Midway (fair)|midway]], filled not only with attractions like the first [[Ferris Wheel]], but also exhibits of cultures from around the world, including reproductions of villages from many nations. Themed simulations, including the Italian Capri Grotto and a Hawaiian volcano, were made possible for the first time by combining electricity, theatrical displays, and mechanical devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4955/3787 Chicago World’s Fair of 1893: Marketing the modern imaginary of the city and urban everyday life through representation]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themed dining can also trace its roots to the late 1800s. In the 1890s, at least three different elaborately themed nightclubs were operating Paris, using themes of death, hell, and heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5910963/the-awesomely-insane-heaven-and-hell-nightclubs-of-1800s-paris The awesomely insane Heaven and Hell nightclubs of 1890s Paris]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in response to the growing popularity of the automobile, theming was applied to roadside architecture in the United States, and buildings themselves became advertisements aimed at passing motorists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://la.curbed.com/maps/roadside-architecture-programmatic-mimetic The weird roadside architecture of Los Angeles]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, a number of [[novelty architecture]] buildings were constructed in and around Hollywood, including the famous [[Brown Derby]] restaurants and Bulldog Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://martinturnbull.com/2015/03/10/bulldog-cafe-1153-west-washington-blvd-opened-1928/ Bulldog Café, 1153 West Washington Blvd, opened 1928]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the popular Egyptian Revival movement saw a range of buildings themed to [[Ancient Egypt]], including everything from apartments to [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]]. Dozens of so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures were built in the Los Angeles area in the interwar years of 1918-1941, many of them restaurants, including buildings shaped like animals, food, and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterandpower.org/museum/Programmatic_Style_Architecture.html Early Los Angeles Programmatic-Style Buildings]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunners to today’s themed mega-resorts were the [[El Rancho Vegas]], opened in 1941, and the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Last Frontier]], opened in 1942, the first two properties on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], both with Wild West themes. They were followed by even more elaborately themed hotels, including [[Caesars Palace]] in 1966 and [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] in 1968.

The term “[[theme park]]” came into use circa 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/theme-park|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theme park|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme%20park|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following the successful opening of [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Though arguably not the first theme park, Disneyland was the first amusement park to combine multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes. Theme parks have followed this pattern ever since, including some that have explicitly copied Disneyland’s design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bathroomreader.com/2013/11/5-disneyland-knockoffs-around-world/ 5 Disneyland Knockoffs From Around the World]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theming has also been applied to retail environments. The advent of mass production led to the creation of large department stores in Europe in the late Nineteenth Century, and in an early example of theming, many used elaborate displays and windows to attract shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/origin-and-development-of-markets.pdf The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Banana Republic]] reinforced its brand as a travel and safari clothing company by theming its stores with Jeeps and jungle foliage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/banana-republic-was-mainstream-fashion-it-was-weirdly-wonderful-safari-brand-170059/ Before Banana Republic Was Mainstream Fashion, It Was a Weirdly Wonderful Safari Brand].

==Scholarship==

In 1997, urbanist [[Mark Gottdiener]]’s ''The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces'' was published. It is considered by many to be the first serious work to explore the origins, nature, and future of themed environments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/727592/the-theming-of-america-dreams-visions-and-commercial The Theming of America: Dreams, Visions, and Commercial Spaces]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised second edition was published in 2001.

Also in 1997, the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal presented ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks'', the first exhibition of some 350 objects from the archives of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], including plans, drawings, paintings and models for the Disney theme parks and their attractions. Professor Karal Ann Marling curated the exhibit and wrote the principal essay for the accompanying 224 page book, which also included essays by Disney Imagineer [[Marty Sklar]], historian Neil Harris, art historian Erika Doss, geographer [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], and critic [[Greil Marcus]], as well as an interview with architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cca.qc.ca/cca.media/files/9013/7952/CUTdisney_pressrelease.pdf CCA to Examine the Building of a Modern Myth, in ''The Architecture of Reassurance: Designing the Disney Theme Parks''].

Author Scott A. Lukas has written and edited numerous books and articles on themed entertainment, including his first, ''The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self'', published in 2007. He teaches on the subject of theme parks and themed spaces, video games, popular film, and various forms of popular culture and remaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottlukas.com/page12/index.html Bio].

In 2010, Dean Peter Weishar and Professor George Head began work on a themed entertainment design program at [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia. In the fall of 2012, the SCAD School of Film, Digital Media and Performing Arts separated into two schools: the School of Digital Media and the School of Entertainment Arts, which began offering the nation’s first M.F.A. in themed entertainment design. Peter Weishar went on to create the Themed Experience Institute program at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/TEA-blog-post/TEA-Advantage:-Peter-Weishar-themed-entertainment-academic-pioneer/6516 TEA Advantage: Peter Weishar, themed entertainment academic pioneer].

==Criticism==

As perhaps the best known example of theming, the theme park Disneyland has often been a target for criticism. In his overwhelmingly negative review, ''Disneyland and Las Vegas'', published in ''[[The Nation (United States)|The Nation]]'' upon the opening of the park, writer Julian Halevy lamented: {{Quote
|text=“As in the Disney movies, the whole world, the universe, and all man’s striving for dominion over self and nature, have been reduced to a sickening blend of cheap formulas packaged to sell…It’s dangerous and offensive.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/271509661/July-17-1955 Julian Halevy, “Disneyland and Las Vegas,” Nation, July 17, 1955]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noted author [[Ray Bradbury]] responded with a letter to the editor, published three years later, titled ''Not Child Enough'': {{Quote
|text=“The world is full of people who, for intellectual reasons, steadfastly refuse to let go and enjoy themselves…I have a sneaking suspicion, after all is said and done, that Mr. Halevy truly loved Disneyland but is not man enough, or child enough, to admit it. I feel sorry for him.”&lt;ref&gt;Ray Bradbury, "Not Child Enough," Nation, June 28, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another notable criticism of theming, again targeting Disneyland and its guests, can be found in French sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]]’s 1981 treatise ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'': {{Quote
|text=“Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that surrounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation…The imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false, it is a deterrence machine.”}}

Along with Baudrillard, the Italian writer [[Umberto Eco]] helped develop the idea of “[[hyperreality]],” or the world of "the Absolute Fake," in which imitations don't merely reproduce reality, but try to improve on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparencynow.com/eco.htm Traveling Through Hyperreality With Umberto Eco]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Eco traveled to tourist attractions across the United States and wrote frequently about "America's obsession with simulacra and counterfeit reality.”

More recently, concerns have been raised about theming’s role in influencing consumers, sometimes subconsciously, as part of experiential retailing or “shoppertainment.” Kim Einhorm, director of Theme Traders, points out that “theming becomes an invisible form of branding.”&lt;ref name="Quainton" /&gt; Indeed, because theming has become such a commonplace aspect of so many people’s everyday lives, the public is often unwilling or unable to effectively understand its consequences.&lt;ref name="Lukas" /&gt; Some have even argued that the growth of experiential marketing is contributing to a degraded quality of life by eliminating “contemplative time.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mngt.waikato.ac.nz/ejrot/cmsconference/2003/proceedings/criticalmarketing/Caru.pdf Antonella Carù and Bernard Cova, “A Critical Approach To Experiential Consumption: Fighting Against The Disappearance Of The Contemplative Time”]. Retrieved 2018-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==

In 1920, following the dissolution of several earlier organizations, the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP) was formed. In 1934 it merged with the American Association of Pools and Beaches (AAPB) to form the National Association of Amusement Parks, Pools, and Beaches (NAAPPB). After several name changes, it became the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa100years.org/timeline6 IAAPA Timeline]. Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, IAAPA represents more than 5,300 members from more than 100 countries, including many companies and individuals in the themed entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaapa.org/about-iaapa About IAAPA] Retrieved 2018-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Themed Entertainment Association]] was founded in 1991 to organize small businesses in the industry. Today it has some 1,300 members, and divisions around the world. It hosts annual conferences and presents awards to individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences.&lt;ref name="TEA" /&gt;

A number of former employees of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], Disney’s in-house design and construction subsidiary, went on to form their own themed entertainment companies, some of which later collaborated with Disney on theme park projects. [[Gary Goddard]] left Imagineering to start what became the Goddard Group, now known as Legacy | GGE. [[Bill Novey]] oversaw the special effects for Epcot Center and Tokyo Disneyland before leaving to start Art &amp; Technology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |publisher=BloopLoop.com |title=Bill Novey and the Business of Theme Park Special Effects |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822175056/http://www.blooloop.com/Article/Art-Technology-Bill-Novey-and-the-Business-of-Theme-Park-Special-Effects/190 |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Rogers (designer)| Bob Rogers]] left to found BRC Imagination Arts. [[Bran Ferren]] founded Associates &amp; Ferren, which was acquired by Disney in 1993. Ferren eventually left Disney to start another company, Applied Minds, LLC. [[Phil Hettema]] worked for both Disney and [[Universal Creative]] before starting [[Phil_Hettema#The_Hettema_Group|The Hettema Group]].

Other companies serve organizations and individuals looking to incorporate theming into offices, product launch events, and even parties. [https://www.themetraders.com/ Theme Traders] is a London-based event theming company that serves this niche.

The '''Udege language''' (also '''Udihe language''', '''Udekhe language''', '''Udeghe language''') is the language of the [[Udege people]]. It is a member of the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic family]].

==Vocabulary==
Udege contains a variety of loanwords from the closely related [[Nanai language]], which have supplanted some older Udege vocabulary, such as:
&lt;!-- these seem to violate the rules of Nanai vowel harmony which An observed --&gt;
* [banixe] (thank you), from Nanai [banixa], instead of Udege [usasa]
* {{IPA|[dœlbo]}} (work), from Nanai {{IPA|[dœbo]}}, instead of Udege {{IPA|[etete]}}
* {{IPA|[daŋsa]}} (book) from Nanai {{IPA|[daŋsa]}}, itself a loanword from Chinese 檔子 ([[Pinyin]]: ''dāngzi''), which actually means "file, records, archives"
In general, a large degree of mutual assimilation of the two languages has been observed in the [[Bikin]] region. Udege has also exerted phonological influence on the [[Bikin]] dialect of Nanai, including monopthongisation of diphthongs, denasalisation of [[nasal vowels]], deletion of reduced final vowels, [[epenthetic vowel]] preventing consonant final words, and the deletion of intervocalic [w].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nikolaeva|Tolskaya|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Word Lens''' was an [[augmented reality]] translation application from [[Quest Visual]].&lt;ref name="Reuters, Apr 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/19/us-entrepreneur-wordlens-idUSTRE73I63P20110419?type=smallBusinessNews|last=Armstrong|first=Natalie|title=Word Lens app developer builds on social media buzz|agency=Reuters|date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word Lens used the built-in cameras on smartphones and similar devices to quickly scan and identify foreign text (such as that found in a sign or a menu), and then translate and display the words in another language on the device's display. The words were displayed in the original context on the original background, and the translation was performed in real-time without connection to the internet.  For example, using the viewfinder of a camera to show a shop sign on a smartphone's display would result in a real-time image of the shop sign being displayed, but the words shown on the sign would be the translated words instead of the original foreign words.

Until early 2015, the application was available for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]], [[iPod]], and [[iPad]],&lt;ref name = iTunes /&gt; as well as for a selection of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones.&lt;ref name = GooglePlay /&gt; The application was free on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], but an in-app purchase was necessary to enable translation capabilities.&lt;ref name = iTunes /&gt; On [[Google Play]], there were both the free demo and the full translation-enabled versions of the application.&lt;ref name = GooglePlay /&gt; At [[Google]]'s unveiling of its Glass Development Kit in November 2013, translation capabilities of Word Lens were also demonstrated on [[Google Glass]].&lt;ref name="AllThingsD, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20131119/new-google-glass-apps-will-translate-the-world-from-your-eyes-and-other-tricks|last=Gannes|first=Liz|title=Next Google Glass Tricks Include Translating the World From Your Eyes|work=[[All Things Digital]]|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/11/google-glass-sdk|last=Honan|first=Mat|title=Google’s New Tools Show How Deep Glass Will Embed in Our Lives|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]: Gadget Lab|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57613010-93/google-glass-throws-open-its-doors-to-developers|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=Google Glass throws open its doors to developers|work=[[CNET]]|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch, Nov 24"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/glass-just-got-way-more-interesting|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Glass Just Got Way More Interesting|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the January 2014 [[The New York Times|New York Times]] article, Word Lens was free for Google Glass.&lt;ref name="NYT, Jan 23"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/travel/google-tools-for-globetrotters.html?_r=1|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|title=Google Tools for Globetrotters|work=[[The New York Times]]: Travel|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word Lens is an [[augmented reality]] application that recognizes printed words using its [[optical character recognition]] capabilities and instantly translates these words into the desired language.&lt;ref name = iTunes&gt;{{cite web |url= https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8 |title=Word Lens on the iTunes App Store |work=itunes.apple.com |year=2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = GooglePlay&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.questvisual.wordlens&amp;feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEwMiwiY29tLnF1ZXN0dmlzdWFsLndvcmRsZW5zIl0.|title=Word Lens on the Google Play Store |publisher=Google |year=2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This application does not require connection to the internet. In its default mode, Word Lens performs real-time translation, but can be paused to display a single frame or to look up alternative translations of each specific word in that frame. It is also possible to use the built-in dictionary to manually type in words that need to be translated.

== Supported devices ==

Word Lens requires [[iPhone]] 3GS+, [[iPod Touch]] with a video camera, [[iPad 2]]+, or any [[iPad Mini]] .&lt;ref name = iTunes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Signal Scape, Dec 21" /&gt; In 2012, Word Lens was released for a selection of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones.&lt;ref name = GooglePlay /&gt; In 2013, Word Lens became available for [[Google Glass]],&lt;ref name="Wired, Nov 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch, Nov 24" /&gt; even though Google Glass itself is not yet freely available.&lt;ref name="NYT, Jan 23" /&gt;

== Accuracy ==
According to its description, Word Lens is best used on clearly printed text and was not designed to translate handwritten or stylized fonts. This application was created to help tourists understand signs and menus, and it is not 100% accurate. The developer Otavio Good commented: "I will be the first to say that it’s not perfect, but perfect was not the goal". However, testers who took the app to other countries said it had been useful.&lt;ref name="Forbes, Dec 22" /&gt; Further, even though the application was not designed to read books, the [[Wall Street Journal]] journalist [[Ben Rooney]] managed to understand a page from ''Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban''.&lt;ref name="WSJ, Dec 29" /&gt;

== Developers ==
[[File:WordLens Screenshot French.jpg|360px|thumb|right|Example of a French-to-English translation by Word Lens]]

Word Lens has been developed by [[Otavio Good]], a former video game developer and the founder of [[Quest Visual]],&lt;ref name="Reuters, Apr 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch, Dec 16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN, Dec 20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes, Dec 22" /&gt; John DeWeese, who previously worked on the [[Electronic Arts]] game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'',&lt;ref name="TechCrunch, Dec 16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN, Dec 20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes, Dec 22" /&gt; and programmers Maia Good,&lt;ref name="Forbes, Dec 22" /&gt; Bryan Lin, and Eric Park.

== Competition ==

"[[Google Goggles]] application for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iPhone]] has the capability to translate text or identify objects in an image, but it requires users to take a picture with their phones, and an active internet connection. Word Lens does it on the fly, meaning it's interpreting frames in video, almost in real time. A similar app called [[LookTel]], designed to help blind people, scans print on objects such as packages of food and reads them aloud."&lt;ref name="CNN, Dec 20" /&gt;

== Reviews ==

Articles in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Tom's Guide]]'' cited [[Clarke's third law]] describing Word Lens: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".&lt;ref name="Tom's, Dec 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ, Dec 29" /&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' journalist [[David Pogue]] included Word Lens in his '''list of "the best tech ideas of the year" 2010''' (10 ideas total).&lt;ref name="NY Times, Dec 29" /&gt; See [http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/12/30/business/1248069505070/2010-pogie-awards.html 2010 Pogie Awards video].

In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article by [[Ben Rooney]], Word Lens received a '''rating of 4/5''' and was described as "a sort of magic".&lt;ref name="WSJ, Dec 29" /&gt;

Word Lens was chosen as a finalist for the 2010 [[Crunchies]] [http://crunchies2010.techcrunch.com/vote '''Best Technology Achievement''' award].

Ellen of ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' demo'ed Word Lens and referred to it as 'amazing' in her segment [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkRC-B3dfmU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=148s Ellen Found the Best Apps!]

Otavio Good won the '''[http://en.www.netexplo.org/laureat/wordlens 2012] [[Netexplo]] award''' in the category ''Innovation &amp; Technology'' presented at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters for the creation of Word Lens.&lt;ref name="MDE23, Mar 16, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themyndset.com/2012/03/mde23-interview-with-word-lens-founder-otavio-good-at-netexplo|title=MDE23: Interview with Word Lens founder, Otavio Good at Netexplo|last=Dial|first=Minter|publisher=''[[The Myndset]]: MDE23''|date=March 16, 2012|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
