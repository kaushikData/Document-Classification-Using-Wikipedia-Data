The '''AN/AAQ-26''' is a second generation infrared detection set manufactured by [[Raytheon]].  The infrared detecting set is a high-performance multipurpose [[Thermography|thermal imaging]] sensor, providing long-range navigation, surveillance, and fire control capabilities.

The AAQ-26 features a second-generation [[Staring array|focal plane array]], electronic [[image stabilization]], local area processing, and an adaptable interface. Additional features include a dual mode video tracker, a [[MIL-STD-1553|1553 data bus]] or discrete controls, and multiple fields of view.  Because the system passively detects energy in the [[far infrared]] (heat) [[wavelength]]s, it avoids the disadvantages of active sensors, such as [[night vision]] or [[radar]], minimizing the amount of detectable energy emitted by the aircraft.

The system replaced the [[AN/AAQ-17]] and is deployed on the [[AC-130H]] and the [[AC-130U]] [[gunship]]s; it is designed to support a wide variety of platforms and missions.

[[File:4X-UHJ Agridrones d.jpg|250px|thumb|An agricultural drone by Agridrones that can carry up to 25[[Kg]]. Certified by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Israel]].]]
An '''agricultural drone''' is an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] applied to [[farming]] in order to help increase [[crop production]] and monitor crop growth.  [[Sensor]]s and [[digital imaging]] capabilities can give farmers a richer picture of their fields.  This information may prove useful in improving [[crop yield]]s and farm efficiency.

Agricultural drones let farmers see their fields from the sky.  This [[bird's-eye view]] can reveal many issues such as [[irrigation]] problems, soil variation, and [[pest (agriculture)|pest]] and [[fungal]] infestations.  [[Multispectral image]]s show a [[near-infrared]] view as well as a visual spectrum view.  The combination shows the farmer the differences between healthy and unhealthy plants, a difference not always clearly visible to the naked eye.  Thus, these views can assist in assessing crop growth and production. 

Additionally, the drone can survey the crops for the farmer periodically to their liking.  Weekly, daily, or even hourly, pictures can show the changes in the crops over time, thus showing possible “trouble spots”.  Having identified these trouble spots, the farmer can attempt to improve crop management and production.

==Legality==
{{Main|Regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles}}
As drones entered use in agriculture, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) encouraged farmers to use this new technology to monitor their fields. However, with the unexpected boom of agricultural drones, the FAA quickly retracted such encouragement, pending new rules and regulations.  With incidents such as drones crashing into [[crop duster]]s, it was vital for the FAA and the AFBF ([[American Farm Bureau Federation]]) to agree on regulations that would allow the beneficial use of such drones in a safe and efficient manner.  Although the American Farm Bureau Federation would like small adjustments to some of the restrictions that have been implemented, they are happy that the agricultural industry can actually use this new machinery without the worry of facing any legal issues.  

==Security and ethics==
{{Further|Unmanned aerial vehicle#Safety}}
Other companies might start flying their drones in unregulated areas to survey their competition and get to know the condition of crops and agricultural yield. Such a scenario could lead to compromising vital company [[Secrecy|secrets]].  People want to know that they are safe and protected, so the burden doesn’t just fall on the farmer, but on many of those around the farmer, too.

The use of agricultural drones has ethical and social implications.  One benefit is that they are able to monitor and control the use of pesticides properly.  This allows minimizing the [[environmental impact of pesticides]].  However, drones don't need access authority to flying overs someone's property at under 400 feet (130 m) altitude.  They may have microphones and cameras attached, and the resulting concern for potential [[privacy]] violation has caused some opposition towards drones.

==Future use==
There is a lot of room for growth with agricultural drones.  With technology constantly improving, imaging of the crops will need to improve as well.  With the data that drones record from the crops the farmers are able to analyze their crops and make educated decisions on how to proceed given the accurate crop information. [[Software program]]s for analyzing and correcting crop production have the potential to grow in this market.  Farmers will fly a drone over their crops, accurately identify an issue in a specific area, and take the necessary actions to correct the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.droneaddicts.net/africa-farming-problems-aided-with-drone-technology/|title=Africa Farming Problems Aided With Drone Technology - Drone Addicts|date=2018-03-12|work=Drone Addicts|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives the farmer time to focus on the big picture of production instead of spending time surveying their crops.

'''Akoma Ntoso''' (''A''rchitecture for ''K''nowledge-''O''riented ''M''anagement of ''A''frican ''N''ormative ''T''exts using ''O''pen ''S''tandards and ''O''ntologies) is an international [[technical standard]] for representing [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary]] documents in a structured manner. It is a legal XML vocabulary and it suggests also a naming convention for providing unique identifier to legal sources based on [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records|FRBR]] model.

The term ''akoma ntoso'' means "linked hearts" in the [[Akan language]] of [[West Africa]] and for this reason it was selected for nominating this legal XML standard. The usual acronym is '''AKN''', to designate the ''XML AKN format''.

== History ==
Akoma Ntoso started as an [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UNDESA]] project within the [[Parliamentary informatics#Africa|“Strengthening Parliaments’ Information Systems in Africa”]] and the core vocabulary was created mostly by two professors from [http://www.unibo.it/en University of Bologna]. Later it became the main work package of the activities of the [https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legaldocml/ LegalDocML Technical Committee within OASIS]. The ''Akoma Ntoso [[XML schema]] standard'' ''“defines a ‘machine readable’ set of simple technology-neutral electronic representations (in XML format) of parliamentary, legislative and judiciary documents”''.

Akoma Ntoso is constituted by an [[XML]] document schema&lt;ref name="AKN XSD-Schema"&gt;{{cite web|title=Akoma Ntoso Github official repository - LegalDocML OASIS| work=github.com/oasis-open/legaldocml-akomantoso
| url=https://github.com/oasis-open/legaldocml-akomantoso|website=|publisher=OASIS - LegalDocML|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing sophisticated description possibilities for several parliamentary, legislative and judiciary document types (including bills, acts and parliamentary records, judgments, gazette, etc.). The work provided the basis for the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] [[Legal XML]] LegalDocumentML project.&lt;ref name=oasis-akoma-ntoso&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Puts Akoma Ntoso on the Standards Track|first=Tina|last=Gheen|date=23 April 2012|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2012/04/oasis-puts-akoma-ntoso-on-the-standards-track/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 European Parliament developed an open source tool ([http://www.at4am.org/ AT4AM]) based on Akoma Ntoso for facilitating the production and the management of amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AT4AM Video|url=https://vimeo.com/17598642|publisher=EU Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AT4AM world|url=https://vimeo.com/7837751|publisher=EU Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this project EU Parliament extended the application to Akoma Ntoso to other documents (e.g., proposal, transcript) and to other scenarios (e.g., translation process).

The "United States Legislative Markup" (USLM) schema for the [[United States Code]] (the US codified laws), developed in 2013, and the [[LexML Brasil]] XML schema for Brazilian [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary]] documents, developed in 2008, were designed to be consistent with Akoma Ntoso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Library of Congress|United States Library of Congress]] created the Markup of US Legislation in Akoma Ntoso challenge in July 2013 to create representations of selected US bills using the most recent Akoma Ntoso standard within a couple months for a $5000 prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress Announces First Legislative Data Challenge|first=Tina|last=Gheen|date=16 July 2013|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/07/library-of-congress-announces-first-legislative-data-challenge/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Legislative XML Data Mapping challenge in September 2013 to produce a data map for US bill XML and UK bill XML to the most recent Akoma Ntoso schema within a couple months for a $10000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Library of Congress Legislative Data Challenge Launched|first=Tina|last=Gheen|date=10 September 2013|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/09/second-library-of-congress-legislative-data-challenge-launched/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Archives of UK converted all the legislation in AKN in 2014 and the availability of [http://leggovuk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/texts/enacted-epublished/akn/ukpga/index.htm bulk] "moved the UK's ranking from fourth to first, in the 2014 [http://index.okfn.org/place/united-kingdom/legislation/ Global Open Data Index], for legislation". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OGP UK National Action Plan 2013-15|date=30 June 2015|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/UKNAPupdate_June2015_Legislation.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate of Italian Republic provides, since July 2016, all the bills in Akoma Ntoso as [https://github.com/SenatoDellaRepubblica/AkomaNtosoBulkData bulk] in open data repository &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate of Italian Republic - AkomaNtosoBulkData|date=24 July 2016|publisher=[[Senate of the Republic (Italy)]]|url=https://github.com/SenatoDellaRepubblica/AkomaNtosoBulkData}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The High-Level Committee on Management (HLCM),part of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, set up a Working Group on Document Standards that approved on April 2017 to adopt Akoma Ntoso as standard for modeling its [https://unsceb-hlcm.github.io/ documentation].

== Definition and aims ==
As official self-description, the standard

{{quote
|(...) defines a set of simple, technology-neutral electronic representations of parliamentary, legislative and judiciary documents for e-services in a worldwide context and provides an enabling framework for the effective exchange of “machine readable” parliamentary, legislative and judiciary documents such as legislation, debate record, minutes, judgements, etc.
&lt;br/&gt;Providing access to primary legal materials, parliamentary works and judiciaries documents is not just a matter of giving physical or on-line access to them. “Open access” requires the information to be described and classified in a uniform and organized way so that content is structured into meaningful elements that can be read and understood by software applications, so that the content is made “machine readable” and more sophisticated applications than on-screen display are made possible.

The '''angle of list''' is the degree to which a [[Watercraft|vessel]] heels (leans or tilts) to either [[Port and starboard|port]] or [[starboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|isbn=0192115537|year=1976|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A listing vessel is stable and at equilibrium, but the distribution of weight aboard (often caused by uneven loading or flooding) causes it to heel to one side.

By contrast, roll is the dynamic movement from side to side caused by waves.

If a listing ship goes beyond the point where a righting moment will keep it afloat, it will [[capsize]] and potentially sink.

==Composition==
Bang snaps consist of a small amount of [[gravel]] or coarse [[sand]] impregnated with a minute quantity (~0.2 [[milligrams]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cody'sLab|title=Precious Metal Refining &amp; Recovery, Episode 11: Silver From Bang Snaps|date=2016-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vltBwXncjCI&amp;t=343s|accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[silver fulminate]] [[high explosive]] and twisted in a [[cigarette paper]] to produce a shape resembling a [[cherry]]. The friction-sensitive silver fulminate [[detonation|detonates]] when stepped on, ignited, or thrown on a hard surface, producing a sharp [[salute (pyrotechnics)|salute]] similar to a [[cap gun]]'s.

Despite producing a legitimate (albeit tiny) high-explosive detonation, the extremely high mass ratio of gravel to explosive acts as a buffer to ensure that they produce only the audible "crack" of the supersonic shockwave; they are incapable  of producing physical damage, even when discharged in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, David A. "Chemistry in the Toy Store". 6th ed, 2002. [http://www.chymist.com/Toystore%20part3.pdf Chymist.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion is unable to propel the gravel any distance, which usually falls to the ground, making them safe for use as a children's toy, for which purpose they have been widely sold around the world since the 1950s. They are also a common part of [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations.

==Production==
Bang snaps are primarily produced alongside other export fireworks in [[Brazil]], [[Korea]] and [[China]] and are widely available over the counter at small [[toy stores]] and shops specializing in jokes, novelties and magic tricks. The snaps are typically packed in [[sawdust]] to prevent them from discharging due to rough handling while in transit.

Some states impose the same age restrictions on purchasing bang snaps as that of permitted fireworks, usually 17 or 18.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the UK advertised as fun snaps is sold to people 16 or above.

A '''battery electric vehicle''' ('''BEV'''), '''pure electric vehicle''' or '''all-electric vehicle''' is a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV) that uses [[chemical energy]] stored in [[rechargeable battery]] [[battery pack|packs]]. BEVs use [[electric motor]]s and [[motor controller]]s instead of [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [[fuel cell]], or [[fuel tank]]. BEVs include - but are not limited to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/|title=FAQ|website=The Boring Company|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"literally hundreds of electric thrusters now operating in orbit on communications satellites, and ion and Hall thrusters both having  been  successfully  used..." -https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series1/Goebel__cmprsd_opt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, rail cars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hybrid electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged (operate in charge-sustaining mode) and instead they are continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicle]]s with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and [[gasoline]] fuel are called [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs with a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Series hybrid|series]] [[powertrain]] are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Fisker Karma]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) are a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B. Sandalow]]|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1|edition=1st.|url=http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/2009/pluginelectricvehicles.aspx|pages=2–5}}''See definition on pp. 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/transportation/electric-vehicles|title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs)|publisher=Center for Sustainable Energy, California|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011|accessdate=2012-02-29}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72&amp;nbsp;km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48&amp;nbsp;km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/greenlings-what-is-a-neighborhood-electric-vehicle-nev/|title=What is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)?|date=2009-02-06|publisher= AutoblogGreen| accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles by type==
The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged [[electric vehicle battery|batteries]] on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology ([[Lithium Ion]]) that have higher power and [[energy density]] (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries) and higher oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|title=-|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205073246/http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Fast-Charge, Battery-Electric Transit Bus====
[[Proterra, Inc.|Proterra]]'s EcoRide BE35 transit bus, called the Ecoliner by Foothill Transit in West Covina, California, is a heavy duty, fast charge, battery-electric bus. Proterra's ProDrive drive-system uses a [[UQM]] motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the TerraVolt energy storage system, which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31–35 percent. It can travel 30–40 miles on a single charge, is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or CNG bus, and produces 44 percent less carbon than CNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proterra.com/index.php/mediacenter/companynews/proterra_launches_first_deployment_of_all-electric_zero-emission_buses/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830021744/http://www.proterra.com/index.php/mediacenter/companynews/proterra_launches_first_deployment_of_all-electric_zero-emission_buses/ |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of production battery electric vehicles|electric car use by country}}

A battery-powered [[electric car]] is an [[automobile]] which is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by [[electric motor]]s.

Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower [[specific energy]] of production batteries available in 2015 compared with [[carbon-based fuel]]s means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.

[[Formula E]] is a fully electric international single seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.

The Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;km (1.2 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

===Environmental benefits of the use of electric vehicles===
Electric vehicles produce no [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, at the tailpipe.
So they are considered 'green' because they have no emissions in the place where they are used.
However, battery electric vehicles can be considered [[Zero emission engines]] only locally, because they generally produce GHG in the power plants where electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two factors driving these GHG emissions of Battery Electric Vehicles are:
* the Carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh)
* the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh)
The Carbon Intensity of electricity can largely vary, depending on the electricity mix of the geographic region where electricity is consumed (a Country with high shares of renewables in his electricity mix will have a low C.I.).
In the European Union, in 2013, the Carbon Intensity had a strong geographic variability, but in almost all the Member States Electric vehicles were "greener" than conventional ones. On average, Electric car saved 50%-60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. 
Moreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of Electric Vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction of the electricity Carbon Intensity of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research part D, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Life-cycle assessment]] perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special-purpose vehicles===
[[File:Special people Electric Vehicle.jpg|thumb|Electric vehicles for disabled people in [[Årdalstangen]], Norway|alt=Electric vehicles for the disabled, in Årdalstangen, Norway]]
{{See also|Electrathon}}
[[Special-purpose vehicle]]s come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as [[golf cart]]s, things like [[electric golf trolley]]s, [[milk float]]s, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered "in plant" work machines.

===Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws===
{{main|Electric motorcycles and scooters}}
Three-wheeled vehicles include [[electric rickshaw]]s, a powered variant of the [[cycle rickshaw]].
The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of the existing urban infrastructure and safety regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiss M|last2=Dekker P|last3=Moro A|last4=Scholz H|last5=Martin P|title=On the electrification of road transportation – A review of the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment|volume= 41, December 2015, Pages 348-366|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2015.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has experienced an explosive growth of sales of non-assisted e-bikes including scooter type, with annual sales jumping from 56,000 units in 1998 to over 21&amp;nbsp;million in 2008,&lt;ref name=Chi-Taiw&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.duke.edu/~cy42/EV.pdf|title=Launching strategy for electric vehicles: Lessons from China and Taiwan|author=Chi-Jen Yang|year=2010|pages=831–834|issue=77|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331153729/http://www.duke.edu/~cy42/EV.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching an estimated 120&amp;nbsp;million e-bikes on the road in early 2010. China is the world's leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009. Some of the biggest manufacturers of E-bikes in the world are [[BYD Company|BYD]], Geoby.

===Personal transporters===
An increasing variety of [[personal transporter]]s are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled [[self-balancing unicycle]]s, [[self-balancing scooter]]s, [[electric kick scooter]]s, and [[electric skateboard]]s.

===Electric boats===
{{main|Electric boat}}
Several battery electric ships operate throughout the world, some for business. Electric [[ferry|ferries]] are being operated and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/batterifergen-har-mattet-sta-over-avganger-na-er-losningen-klar/364633 |title=Batterifergen har måttet stå over avganger.

==Technology==
{{Electric vehicle}}

===Motor controllers===
{{Main|Motor controller}}
The motor controller receives a signal from [[potentiometers]] linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Exactly Do Electric Cars Work? |url=https://www.greencarfuture.com/electric/2018/11/11/how-exactly-do-electric-cars-work.html|website=Green Car Future |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This [[DC power]] is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles [[regenerative braking]], whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics&lt;ref name="HitachiReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Components and Systems for Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs) |url=http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2018/r2018_01/10b02/index.html|website=Hitachi Review |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Battery Pack===
{{main|Battery (electricity)}}

Most electric vehicles today use an [[electric battery]], consisting of [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=battRef2000&gt;
{{cite book |title=Battery Reference Book |edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T. R. |date=2000-03-20 |publisher=Newnes |page=Glossary 3 |isbn=0080499953 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QmVR7qiB5AUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=ckHhIPVdcC&amp;dq=battery%20one%20or%20more%20cells&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Battery technology for EVs has developed from early [[lead-acid batteries]] used in the late 19th Century to the 2010s, to [[lithium-ion batteries]] which are found in most EVs today&lt;ref name="HitachiReview" /&gt;. The overall battery is referred to as a [[battery pack]], which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. The battery pack powering modern EVs can have as little as 96 battery cells to as many as 2,976 cells&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

===Motors===
{{Main|Traction motor}}
Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of [[brushed DC electric motor]]. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of [[AC motor]] types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually [[induction motor]]s or [[brushless AC electric motor]]s which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the [[brushless DC electric motor]].

Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the [[drive shaft]] and ultimately the vehicle's wheels&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

{{chemical engineering}}
In the field of engineering, a '''chemical engineer''' is a professional, who is equipped with the knowledge of [[chemical engineering]], works principally in the [[chemical industry]] to convert basic raw materials into a variety of  products, and deals with the design and operation of plants and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;MobyDick ''Dictionary of Engineering", McGraw-Hill, 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a chemical engineer is one who applies and uses principles of [[chemical engineering]] in any of its various practical applications; these often include 1) design, manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery in industrial chemical and related processes ("chemical process engineers"); 2) development of new or adapted substances for products ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics to cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many other products ("chemical product engineers"); and 3) development of new technologies such as [[fuel cells]], [[hydrogen power]] and [[nanotechnology]], as well as working in fields wholly or partially derived from chemical engineering such as [[materials science]], [[polymer engineering]], and [[biomedical engineering]].

==History==

[[File:Glauber.png|thumb|200px|left|Portrait of [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]].]]

The president of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] said in his presidential address "I believe most of us would be willing to regard [[Edward Charles Howard]] (1774–1816) as the first chemical engineer of any eminence".&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the IChemE'' (1951) Volume 29 page 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have suggested [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] (1604–1670) for his development of processes for the manufacture of the major industrial acids.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Skolnik ''in'' W. F. Furter (ed) (1982) ''A Century of Chemical Engineering'' {{ISBN|0-306-40895-3}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared in print in 1839, though from the context it suggests a person with [[mechanical engineering]] knowledge working in the [[chemical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Ure|Ure, Andrew]] (1839) ''A Dictionary of Arts Manufactures and Mines'', London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman, page 1220&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1880, [[George E. Davis]] wrote in a letter to ''Chemical News'' "A Chemical Engineer is a person who possesses chemical and mechanical knowledge, and who applies that knowledge to the utilisation, on a manufacturing scale, of chemical action."  He proposed the name Society of Chemical Engineers, for what was in fact constituted as the [[Society of Chemical Industry]]. At the first General Meeting of the Society in 1882, some 15 of the 300 members described themselves as chemical engineers, but the Society's formation of a Chemical Engineering Group in 1918 attracted about 400 members.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Duvall and Sean F, Johnston (2000) ''Scaling Up: The Institution of Chemical Engineers and the Rise of a New Profession'' Kluwer Academic Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 a publication called ''The Chemical Engineer'' was founded in the US,&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;[http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19041026.2.25 The Cornell daily Sun] Volume XXV, Number 25, 26 October 1904&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1908 the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] was established.&lt;ref name=AIChEEarly&gt;[http://www.aiche.org/uploadedFiles/About/Centennial/CE_Profession-A.pdf John C. Olsen (December 1932), ''Chemical Engineering As A Profession: Origin and Early Growth of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813180349/http://www.aiche.org/uploadedFiles/About/Centennial/CE_Profession-A.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] adopted the following definition: "A chemical engineer is a professional man experienced in the design, construction and operation of plant and works in which matter undergoes a change of state and composition."&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers'' volume 2 page 23 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

As can be seen from the later definition, the occupation is not limited to the [[chemical industry]], but more generally the process industries, or other situations in which complex physical and/or chemical processes are to be managed.

The UK journal ''[[The Chemical Engineer]]'' (began 1956) has a series of biographies available online entitled “Chemical Engineers who Changed the World”,&lt;ref name=CECW&gt;[http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/chemical-engineers-who-changed-the-world.aspx  www.thechemicalengineer.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080528/http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/chemical-engineers-who-changed-the-world.aspx# |date=2017-02-11 }} Chemical engineers who changed the world&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical engineers use computers to manage automated systems in production plants]]
Historically, the chemical engineer has been primarily concerned with [[process engineering]], which can generally be divided into two complementary areas: [[chemical reaction engineering]] and [[separation process]]es. The modern discipline of chemical engineering, however, encompasses much more than just process engineering.  Chemical engineers are now engaged in the development and production of a diverse range of products, as well as in commodity and specialty [[chemical]]s. These products include high-performance materials needed for [[aerospace]], [[automotive engineering|automotive]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], [[electronics|electronic]], [[environmental engineering|environmental]] and [[military]] applications. Examples include ultra-strong fibers, [[Cloth|fabrics]], [[adhesives]] and composites for vehicles, [[Biocompatibility|bio-compatible materials]] for implants and prosthetics, [[gel]]s for medical applications, [[pharmaceuticals]], and films with special dielectric, optical or [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] properties for opto-electronic devices. Additionally, chemical engineering is often intertwined with [[biology]] and [[biomedical engineering]].  Many chemical engineers work on biological projects such as understanding biopolymers ([[proteins]]) and [[human genome project|mapping the human genome]].

== Employment and salaries==
According to a 2015 salary survey by the AIChE, the median annual salary for a chemical engineer was approximately $127,000.&lt;ref name=AIChEsalary&gt;Chemical Engineering Progress June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], the IChemE 2016 Salary Survey reported a median salary of approximately £57,000, with a starting salary for a graduate averaging £28,350.&lt;ref&gt;Institution of Chemical Engineers Annual Review 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical engineering in the USA is one of the engineering disciplines with the highest participation of women, with 35% of students compared with 20% in engineering.&lt;ref name=Brawner&gt;Brawner, C. E., Lord, S. M., Layton, R. A., Ohland, M. W., &amp; Long, R. A., (2015) ''International Journal of Engineering Education'' Vol. 31, No. 6(A), 1431, "Factors Affecting Women’s Persistence in Chemical Engineering"&lt;/ref&gt;   In the UK in 2014, students starting degrees were 25% female, compared with 15% in engineering.&lt;ref name=TCE2014&gt;''The Chemical Engineer'', March 2015 p 20&lt;/ref&gt; US graduates who responded to a 2015 salary survey were 18.8% female.&lt;ref name=AIChEsalary/&gt;

'''Coat rack''', '''coat stand''' or a '''hatstand''' is an item of furniture on which clothes may be hung. A coat rack often refers to a set of hooks that are attached to a wall and is mainly used to hang coats and jackets. In a kitchen or bathroom environment the coat rack is often used to hang towels. In some cases, a coat rack refers to a self-standing piece of furniture. The self-standing variant is more often referred to as an [[hatstand]] and is mostly used to hang coats, jackets, umbrellas and hats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">'''Computer-aided maintenance''' (not to be confused with CAM which usually stands for [[Computer Aided Manufacturing]]) refers to systems that utilize [[software]] to organize planning, scheduling and support of maintenance and repair.  A common application of such systems is the maintenance of computers, either hardware or software, themselves.  It can also apply to the maintenance of other complex systems that require periodic maintenance, such as reminding operators that preventive maintenance is due or even predicting when such maintenance should be performed based on recorded past experience.

The first computer-aided maintenance software came from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] in the 1980s to configure [[VAX]] computers. The software was built using the techniques of [[artificial intelligence]] [[expert system]]s, because the problem of configuring a VAX required expert knowledge. During the research, the software was called ''R1'' and was renamed ''[[XCON]]'' when placed in service.  Fundamentally, ''XCON'' was a rule-based ''configuration [[database]]'' written as an expert system using [[forward chaining]] rules.  As one of the first expert systems to be pressed into commercial service it created high expectations, which did not materialize, as DEC lost commercial pre-eminence. &lt;ref&gt;Virginia E. Barker and Dennis E. O'Connor. Expert systems for configuration at Digital: XCON and beyond. Communications of the ACM, 32(3):298--318, March 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Help Desk software==
[[Help desk]]s frequently use help desk [[software]] that captures [[symptom]]s of a [[Computer bug|bug]] and relates them to fixes, in a ''fix database''. One of the problems with this approach is that the understanding of the problem is embodied in a non-human way, so that solutions are not unified.

==Strategies for finding fixes==
#The ''bubble-up'' strategy simply records pairs of symptoms and fixes. The most frequent set of pairs is then presented as a tentative solution, which is then attempted. If the fix works, that fact is further recorded, along with the configuration of the presenting system, into a ''solutions database''.
#Oddly enough, shutting down and [[booting]] up again manages to 'fix,' or at least 'mask,' a [[computer bug|bug]] in many computer-based systems; thus ''reboot'' is the remedy for distressingly many symptoms in a 'fix database.' The reason a reboot often works is that it causes the [[RAM]] to be flushed. However, typically the same set of actions are likely to create the same result demonstrating a need to refine the "startup" applications (which launch into memory) or install the latest fix/patch of the offending application.
#Currently, most expertise in finding fixes lies in human domain experts, who simply sit at a replica of the computer-based system, and who then 'talk through' the problem with the client to duplicate the problem, and then relate the fix.

'''Copper(II) azide''' is a medium density [[explosive]] with the [[molecular formula]] [[Copper|Cu]]([[Nitrogen|N]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Uses==
Copper azide is very [[explosive]] and is too sensitive for any practical use unless handled in solution.

==Preparation==
Copper azide can be prepared by a [[metathesis reaction]] between water-soluble sources of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[azide]] ions. ([[Spectator ions]] omitted in reaction below).

:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Cu(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It can be destroyed by concentrated nitric acid to form non-explosive products, being nitrogen, nitrogen oxides and copper(II) nitrate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3983">'''Cosmetovigilance''' is the ongoing and systematic monitoring of the safety of [[cosmetics]] in terms of human health. The aim is to detect adverse effects of cosmetic products, and to prevent adverse effects by taking appropriate measures. Regulations for cosmetic products primarily address the safety of products that may be used by large populations of healthy consumers. The identification and analysis of adverse effects related to cosmetic products is a process that is currently still, to a large extent, industry driven. It is the responsibility of manufacturers to determine that products and ingredients are safe before they are marketed, and then to collect reports of adverse reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18422387 | volume=31 | title=Cosmetovigilance: the 'beautiful' risk | year=2008 | journal=Drug Saf | pages=437–9 | last1 = Moretti | first1 = U | last2 = Velo | first2 = G | doi=10.2165/00002018-200831050-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal basis for monitoring cosmetics in the U.S.A. is The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), which defines cosmetics by their intended use, as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance”. Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes, and deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iris-vigilance.com/en/cosmetovigilance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, state regulation applies in addition to federal regulation. For example, California's governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed off fiercely contested toxics legislation that requires cosmetic producers to report use of ingredients classified as carcinogenic or toxic to reproduction, a measure primarily aimed at [[phthalates]].&lt;ref name="rsc"&gt;http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2006/November/14110601.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The legal basis for monitoring cosmetics in the European Union is derived from [[Cosmetics Directive]] 76/768/EEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/cosmetics/documents/directive/index_en.htm EU Cosmetics Directive]&lt;/ref&gt;  This 1976 directive requires that cosmetic products 'must not cause damage to human health when applied under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use'.&lt;ref name="rsc" /&gt; The safety officer of a company with marketed cosmetics files product information, including a safety report, in electronic or other format to the competent authority of the Member State. This takes place after placing cosmetic products on the market, with updates by state requirement.

The practical consequence of cosmetics legislation is a requirement for continuous observation of cosmetic products after marketing. This applies particularly to "adverse effects" and "serious adverse effects". The European legislation defines "adverse effect" as a negative impact on human health, which is attributable to the normal or reasonably foreseeable use of a cosmetic product. A "serious adverse effect" resulting in temporary or permanent functional incapacity, disability, hospitalization, congenital anomalies or an immediate danger to life or death.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9141">'''Cultural probes''' (or '''design probes''') is a technique used to inspire ideas in a design process. It serves as a means of gathering inspirational data about people's lives, values and thoughts. The probes are small packages that can include any sort of artifact (like a map, postcard, camera or diary) along with evocative tasks, which are given to participants to allow them to record specific events, feelings or interactions. The aim is to elicit inspirational responses from people, in order to understand their culture, thoughts and values better, and thus stimulate designer's imaginations.Probes is one of the prominent approaches in the practice of co-designing. It is design-led approaches as described by the landscape of design research and practice. probes are usually used in the early front end of the design process. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Elizabeth B.-N.|date=2014|title=Probes, toolkits and prototypes: three approaches to making in codesigning|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/15710882.2014.888183?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=CoDesign|volume=10:1|pages=5-14|via=DOI}}&lt;/ref&gt;The probes were not designed to be analyzed, nor did we summarize what they revealed about the sites as an explicit stage in the process. Rather, the design proposals we produced reflected what we learned from the materials.&lt;ref name="Gaver"&gt;Gaver, W, Dunne, A., &amp; Pacenti, E,. Design: Cultural probes, Interactions, Vol 6, Issue 1, Jan/Feb 1999&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, probes were born to gather “fragmentary clues” about people’s “lives and thoughts” which means they are tools to inspire - others argue that they can be used to, provide relevant information and gather empathetic data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LOI|first=DARIA|title=Reflective probes, primitive probes and playful triggers|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1559-8918.2007.tb00079.x|journal=Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings|volume=2007|issue=1|pages=232–245|doi=10.1111/j.1559-8918.2007.tb00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Cultural Probes was developed by Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti in 1999. They were inspired by the art movement [[Situationist International]]. 
This technique does not follow the scientific approach. It follows the artistic approach, which is characterized by being irrational, uncontrolled, getting inspiration, and cannot be analysed systematically. As Gaver pointed out , the conceptual concerns and specific techniques of various arts movements also influenced their probes design.&lt;ref name="Gaver" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Cultural probes can be used for idea generation, inspiration, values and dreams in a design process. 
The technique is about opening up the design space, instead of narrowing it. Cultural probes aim to seek out subjective thoughts, values and dreams and surprise and uncertainty is a key value.
The probes provoke inspirational responses by using a creative approach in questions instead of analytical and descriptive question usually asked in [[User Experience]] Research.&lt;ref name="Gaver_a"&gt;Gaver, W. W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S., and Walker, B. 2004. Cultural probes and the value of uncertainty. interactions 11, 5 (Sep. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;Cultural Probe kit is a vehicle for self-reporting by asking participants to observe, reflect upon and report their experiences which can lead to have better and deeper observation in a context where, due to privacy as well as time constraints, it is not possible to conduct full participant observations&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Since the initial publication in 1999 of cultural probes in interactions, the use of probes has been interpreted broadly and used in a wide variety of projects within user experience. Some cases are grounded very much in the original cultural probes work, while, in other cases, ‘probes’ has become an umbrella term covering everything from [[Diary Studies]] to longitudinal user studies to field trips.&lt;ref&gt;Boehner, K., Vertesi, J., Sengers, P., and Dourish, P. 2007. How HCI interprets the probes. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. CHI ‘07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional design process, designers usually engage in making after the design opportunity has already been identified. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the focus shift to more varied forms and formats of making in the front end of the process. Today making has become an activity that both designers and co-designers can engage in during all phases of the process. Cultural probe is one of these making approaches, which is used in the very earliest phase of the design process, the focus is on using making activities for making sense of the future. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Probes' family ==
Since Bill Gaver and his colleagues developed ‘Cultural Probes’, they have been adopted and adapted. Here are some probes which are derived from Cultural Probes; Informational Probes, Technology Probes, Mobile Probes, Empathy Probes, Domestic Probes, Urban Probes, Reflective Probes, Primitive Probes. Each kinds of Probes bring users to account to members differently: for example, probes that log everyday actions do this quite differently from those that require describing dreams. Each makes different forms of action and interaction visible and in different ways. Most forms of Probes involve investigative participation. Participants engage in reflective participation – both in the standard sociological sense of becoming aware of actions and interactions and describing them in some way, and in the methodological sense of making actions accountable. However, there is also evidence of different forms of participation. Cultural Probes emphasis imaginative and playful participation, engaging participants in activities that promote the use of aspects of their lives that are more “ludic’ and less goal-driven. Empathy Probes emphasis emotional participation, seeking out participants’ effective responses both to things in their everyday lives and new technologies. Both Technology Probes and Mobile Probes emphasis reactive participation and, to some extent, a change in participation or disruptive participation. Participants have to react to these new technologies placed in their lives and to the disruption to their existing routines that they enforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Connor|last2=Rouncefield|first2=Mark|date=2008-10-01|title=Probes and participation|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1795234.1795272|publisher=Indiana University|pages=194–197|isbn=9780981856100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== After Probing ==
Probing will add strong element of making to the research which is based on literature and practical work. It is difficult to create a precise pattern of the design process for probes. "The problem and the solution go hand in hand, and there is no single answer or method for analyses the probe materials. An inspiring idea about things such as the overall appearance of the probe, a single probe article or a visual detail can tune up the probe design along with a consistent approach to the problem. Although the methodological instructions can in principle be taken to the extreme, the outcome finally depends on the agents, i.e., researchers, designers and even users in the case of probes. Practical instructions are helpful, but somebody conducting research must personally be tuned-in to receive signals, interpret them and be surprised at them, as well as tolerate the ambiguous nature of the probing process (and design)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Design_Probes.html?id=nCsmMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Design Probes|last=Mattelmäki|first=Tuuli|date=2006|publisher=University of Art and Design|isbn=9789515582119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==

* It is hard to get scientifically valid information from data that is so subjective.
* The data generated it not suitable for deep analysis and requirements list.
* Participants are supposed to reflect upon and be inspired by the probes, but it can be hard to motivate participants doing it, as well as to get them to send the probes back.
* There is a risk of few returns.
* The wide variety of applications of and scientific approach to the probes has been criticized by Gaver and his colleagues as a misunderstood desire to rationalize and analyze the probe[s2.]

'''Cutting ring fittings''' are flareless fittings used for connections in fluid applications. They are widely used worldwide in hydraulic systems.

The '''cutting ring fitting''' consists of the body, the cutting ring and the nut. On assembly, the two cutting edges of the cutting ring carves into the outer surface of the tube hence ensuring the necessary holding power and sealing for high operating pressures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parker.com/literature/Tube%20Fittings%20Division/EO%20and%20EO-2%20Metric%20Bite%20Type%20Fittings.pdf Parker Hannafin Catalog&lt;/ref&gt; The tubes have usually metric dimensions.

The cutting ring fitting was invented by Ermeto in Germany in the early 1930s. Later [[Parker Hannifin]] acquired Ermeto and introduced the fittings to the US. Today they are standardized in ISO 8434.

The '''digital television transition''', also called the '''digital switchover''', the '''analog switch-off''' ('''ASO'''), or the '''analog shutdown''', is the process in which older [[Analog TV|analog television]] [[broadcasting]] is converted to and replaced by [[digital television]].  This primarily involves the conversion of [[Analog television|analog terrestrial television]] to [[digital terrestrial]]. However, it also involves [[analog cable]] conversion to [[digital cable]] or [[internet protocol television]], as well as analog to digital [[satellite television]]. Begun by some countries around 2000, this is an involved process because the existing analog [[television receiver]]s owned by viewers cannot receive digital broadcasts; viewers must either purchase new digital TVs, or converter boxes which change the digital signal to an analog signal which can be viewed on the old TV.

In many countries, a [[simulcast]] service is operated where a broadcast is made available to viewers in both analog and digital at the same time. As digital becomes more popular, it is likely that the existing analog services will be removed. In some cases this has already happened, where a broadcaster has offered incentives to viewers to encourage them to switch to digital. In other cases government policies have been introduced to encourage or force the switchover process, especially with regard to terrestrial broadcasts. Government intervention usually involves providing some funding for broadcasters and, in some cases, monetary relief to viewers, to enable a switchover to happen by a given deadline.

The switchover process is being accomplished on different schedules in different countries; in some countries it is being implemented in stages as in Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, where each region has a separate date to switch off. In others, the whole country switches on one date, such as the Netherlands, which switched off its analog terrestrial services on 11 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16154569/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/dutch-pull-plug-free-analog-tv/&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August 2003, [[Berlin]] became the world's first city to switch off terrestrial analogue signals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/03/business/technology-german-way-to-go-digital-no-dawdling.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxembourg]] was the first country to complete its terrestrial switchover, in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/mapping-digital-media-how-television-went-digital-netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; Technically the United Kingdom and Ireland were the first countries that turned off analogue signals - in the form of satellite television on 28 September 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1566785.stm&lt;/ref&gt; - but terrestrial signals in the two countries were not switched until 2012.

The [[Regional Radiocommunication Conference#RRC-04.2F06|Geneva 2006 Agreement]] set 17 June 2015 as the date after which countries may use frequencies currently assigned for analog television transmission for digital services, without being required to protect the analog services of neighbouring countries against interference. This date was generally viewed as an internationally mandated analog switch-off date, at least along national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.digitag.org/ASO/ASOHandbook.pdf |title = DigiTAG Analog Switch Off Handbook | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has '''recommended''' that digital switchover should be completed by 1 January 2012 - Commission Recommendation 2009/848/EC, of 28 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:308:0024:0026:EN:PDF |title=Official Journal of the European Union |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Belgium}}: Media regulations are under regional legislation. [[Flanders]] switched off analog television on Monday 3 November 2008, while in [[Wallonia]], all analog services were switched off on Monday, 1 March 2010, making the country completely serviced by digital signal. However, analog cable is still used by many cable subscribers, so therefore a cable switchover is unlikely to happen in the near future.

This was controversial, as the cost of a digital TV set in Finland at the time was heavily criticised and saw a substantial decrease in how much the [[television license]] cost. Cable TV viewers continued to receive analog broadcasts until the end of February 2008.
* {{flag|France}} switched off all analog services (terrestrial, satellite and cable) on Tuesday, 29 November 2011. This included overseas departments and territories such as [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], [[Réunion]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Saint Barthelemy]], [[Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]].
* {{flag|Germany}} started the switch-off in the Berlin area, beginning on Friday, 1 November 2002 and completing on Monday 4 August 2003. "[[Simulcast]]" digital transmissions started in other parts of the country in an effort to prepare for a full switchover. The switch-off of terrestrial analog transmitters was completed on Tuesday 25 November 2007, except one main transmitter in [[Bad Mergentheim]], which was shut down in June 2009. Analog satellite receivers were still used by 6% of households in 2010 - the highest in Europe. The analog satellite transmissions were switched off on Monday 30 April 2012, being the last in Europe. However, analog cable is still used by about 30% of the population and 55% of all cable broadcasts, so therefore a cable switchover is unlikely to happen in the near future. The cable TV provider Unitymedia switched off analog cable on 27 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.entertaintv.de/magazin/inhalte/kabelfernsehen-analog-abschaltung&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Georgia}}: Analog broadcasts should have been switched off 17 June 2015, but due to the flooding in Tbilisi, which occurred on the night of 13 to 14 June 2015 analogue switch-off happened on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediasat.info/2015/06/17/georgia-dtv/]&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Netherlands}} moved to digital-only terrestrial broadcasting on Monday, 11 December 2006, being the second country to do so. The switch-off was noticed by few, since the overwhelming majority receive TV via cable and only around 74,000 households relied on terrestrial over-the-air broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16154569/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/dutch-pull-plug-free-analog-tv/&lt;/ref&gt; The switch-off was helped greatly as cable continued to use analog distribution, and thus consumers' old tuners continued to be useful. In March 2018, major cable provider [[Ziggo]] has announced that it will gradually phase out analogue cable TV transmissions in the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ziggo stopt met analoge tv en gaat volledig digitaal|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2221192-ziggo-stopt-met-analoge-tv-en-gaat-volledig-digitaal.html|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=NOS|date=8 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308230622/https://nos.nl/artikel/2221192-ziggo-stopt-met-analoge-tv-en-gaat-volledig-digitaal.html|archivedate=8 March 2018|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Poland}}: The switch-off of the analog terrestrial transmissions was completed on Tuesday, 23 July 2013. {{further information|Digital terrestrial television in Poland}}
* {{flag|Portugal}}: Digital terrestrial broadcasts started on Wednesday 29 April 2009. Portugal's government hoped to cover 80% of the territory with digital terrestrial TV by the end of 2009, and simulcasts remained until Thursday 26 April 2012, when the analog broadcasting ended. This switchover began on Thursday 12 January 2012. Analog cable is still available from all pay-TV providers (including fiber), for homes with multiple televisions. There are no plans in place to switch-off analog cable. The digital versions of all channels have traditionally been encrypted and could only be accessed with a proprietary set-top-box, which subscribers had to pay for with a monthly fee. Starting in October 2017, cable provider NOS unencrypted the digital versions of its base channels, enabling them to be tuned directly by televisions with support for MPEG-4 (or digital terrestrial) or any freely available digital tuner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dinheirovivo.pt/empresas/750-mil-clientes-nos-com-tv-sem-box-terao-acesso-a-110-canais-sem-mais-custos-2/|title=750 mil clientes NOS com TV sem box terão acesso a 110 canais sem mais custos|date=2017-10-10|work=Dinheiro Vivo|access-date=2018-07-31|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channels belonging to subscription packs, as well as premium channels, still require a proprietary set top box to be viewed. Other pay-TV providers - Vodafone, NOWO and Meo - similarly no longer encrypt the digital versions of their base channels.
* {{flag|Romania}} has one of the highest pay-TV penetration rates in Europe, with over 98% of homes receiving cable or satellite TV services. Also over 90% of population is covered with [[DVB-T2]] digital terestrial television signal. The last analog transmittors were switched off on 1 May 2018 when [[Romanian Television|TVR]] decided to order the shut down due to low demand and high operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvr.ro/trecerea-completa-la-emisia-digital-terestra-a-tvr-este-legala_21922.html#view&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apagon analogico.jpg|thumb|Analog closedown warning broadcast in Spain]] 
* {{flag|Spain}}: The switch-off of the analog terrestrial transmissions was completed on Saturday 3 April 2010. The switch-off was successful, as about 70% of Spanish television transmissions are terrestrial, so it was easy for people to just switch to the digital signal. Spain started its DTT service on Wednesday 30 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} ''Disposición adicional primera del Real Decreto 944/2005, de 29 de julio'', published in ''[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2005/07/30/pdfs/A27006-27014.pdf BOE del 30 de julio]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Sweden}}: The switch-off of the analog terrestrial network progressed region–by–region. It started on the island of [[Gotland]] on Monday, 19 September 2005, and was completed on Monday 15 October 2007, when the last analog [[SVT1]] transmitters in [[Blekinge]] and western [[Scania]] were shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/sista-analoga-tv-natet-slackt/|title=Sista analoga TV-nätet släckt|publisher=Sydsvenskan|language=Swedish|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Netherlands, Germany and Japan, cable distributors continued broadcasting analog television. Cable broadcasters continue to broadcast in analog (like the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]), so therefore a cable switchover is unlikely to happen in the near future.
* {{flag|Switzerland}} began with the switch-off on Monday 24 July 2006 in [[Ticino]] and continued with [[Engadin]] on Monday 13 November 2006. The switch-off was completed on Monday 26 November 2007. A very high percentage of Swiss viewers receive their signals via cable distributors. By 2012 40% of cable viewers had switched to digital. Analog cable was switched off on 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blick.ch/news/wirtschaft/analog-tv-noch-bis-2017-preisueberwacher-haelt-analoges-tv-am-leben-id2147549.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|United Kingdom}}: Digital terrestrial broadcasting began in the UK on Sunday 15 November 1998 with the launch of the ONdigital, later renamed [[ITV Digital]] and now [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. The transition from analogue and digital to digital-only terrestrial signals started on Wednesday 17 October 2007 with the [[Whitehaven]] transmitter in [[Cumberland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6453087.stm|title=First digital TV switch date set|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 April 2007|date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed a [[Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom|transmitter switchover timetable]], implemented by region. The first [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] to switch off all its analogue signals was [[Wales]] on Wednesday 31 March 2010&lt;ref name="digitaluk1"/&gt; and the last region to switch off its analogue signals was [[Northern Ireland]] on Wednesday 24 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/when_do_i_switch/northernireland |title=Northern Ireland |website=digitaluk.co.uk |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogue cable broadcasts eventually ended and fully ceased, on November 28th 2013, when [[Milton Keynes]] finally saw their service terminate, after a settling of a cable ownership dispute between [[BT Group]] and [[Virgin Media]]. Analogue satellite was discontinued on Thursday 27 September 2001, making the UK and Ireland the first countries in Europe with digital-only satellite.

====Oceania====

* {{flag|Australia}}: Digital television commenced in Australia's five most populous cities on Monday 1 January 2001. The [[Mildura]] region was the first to terminate its analog network, on Wednesday 30 June 2010. Digital switchover was originally expected to be complete by Tuesday 31 December 2013, however the last regions to switch over (Melbourne and Remote Eastern/Central Australia) did so slightly earlier, on Tuesday 10 December 2013 at 9:00 am.&lt;ref name="digitalready.gov.au"/&gt; Until the switch-off in the respective areas, free-to-air stations were [[simulcast]], along with digital-only channels like [[ABC2]]. Cable television networks began simulcasting in 2004 and analog cable services were switched off in April 2007. The switchover was co-ordinated by the Digital Switchover Taskforce operating under the federal Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.

==Digital-to-analog converters==
{{Main article|Digital television adapter}}

After the switch from analog to digital broadcasts is complete, analog TVs will be incapable of receiving over-the-air broadcasts without the addition of a set-top converter box. Consequently, a digital converter box – an electronic device that connects to an [[analog television]] – must be used in order to allow the television to receive [[Digital data|digital]] broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtvfacts.com/58/what-is-a-set-top-box/ |title=What is a set-top converter box? |publisher=Digital TV Facts |accessdate=23 March 2008 |year=2007}}(dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the government subsidized the purchase of such boxes for consumers via their [[coupon-eligible converter box]] program in 2009, funded by a small part of the billions of dollars brought in by a [[spectrum auction]].  The program was managed by the Department of Commerce through its [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]].

The '''Dry Creek explosives depot''' was a secure storage facility near [[Port Adelaide]] from 1906 to 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.slsa.sa.gov.au/find/explosives+depot|title=explosives depot • Find • State Library of South Australia|work=slsa.sa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving the construction, mining and quarrying industries of [[South Australia]], as well as the mines of [[Broken Hill]] in New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Jolly"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bridget |last1=Jolly |url=http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/bm.doc/high-and-dry-by-the-mangroves-.pdf |title=High And Dry By The Mangroves?

== Construction ==
[[File:The old explosives depot at the North Arm, Port Adelaide, South Australia, PRG-280-1-12-32.jpg|thumb|The old [[North Arm Powder Magazine]] at Magazine Creek south of the North Arm of the Port River, Port Adelaide]]

The ten magazines of the Dry Creek explosives depot were built in 1906 at the expenditure of [[Pounds sterling|£]]6,000 or £7,000 at Broad Creek, a tidal distributary channel on the eastern side of the [[Barker Inlet]] of the [[Port River|Port River Estuary]], which runs in the direction of the suburb of [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]]. The Broad Creek site, located on the landward side of intertidal [[Avicennia marina|mangroves]] and supratidal saltmarshes, was chosen as a more isolated location from Port Adelaide, replacing an earlier explosives depot called [[North Arm Powder Magazine]] at Magazine Creek at [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]], south of the North Arm of the Port River.

== Horse tram ==
[[File:Horse-drawn explosives carrying wagons in the Dry Creek Explosive Magazine in South Australia.jpg|thumb|Horse-drawn explosives carrying wagons in the Dry Creek explosives depot in South Australia]]

A [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge tramway]] with a track gauge of {{Track gauge|2 ft 6 in}} was constructed in 1906. It ran along the magazines and connected the depot via a length of 2 km (1¼ miles) to the landing [[jetty]] and on the other side via 800 m (½ mile) to the [[Dry Creek railway station]]. Six bespoke wagons were used for the transport of explosives such as [[dynamite]] to the magazines - each held 1¼ tons. The wagons were drawn by horses. Previously, explosives had to be transported by road from the North Arm to the magazines, and this both dangerous and expensive.&lt;ref name="Advertiser"&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5083277 The Dry Creek Explosives Depot. An official visit.] ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', 20 June 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; The wagons were donated in 1978 to the [[Illawarra Light Railway Museum]], where they are now exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilrms.com.au/explosive_horse_wagons.htm|publisher=Illawarra Light Railway Museum Society, ilrms.com.au |title=Explosive Horse Drawn Wagons |work=Rolling Stock |year=2006 |accessdate= 10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inspection ==
The president of the Marine Board, [[Arthur Searcy]], and four wardens officially inspected the Dry Creek explosives depot on Tuesday, 19 June 1906. They were conveyed to the Broad Creek jetty in the [[motor launch]] ''Warden''. The party travelled on one of the horse-drawn wagons to the magazines, which were found in perfect order. Each magazine was capable of storing 40 tons of explosives, but 20 tons were at that time fixed as the maximum quantity to be stored in them. Every precaution was taken to guard against explosion, and printed regulations were exhibited on each of the magazine doors. Mounds had been built between each magazine, so that should one of the magazines explode no injury would result to the others. The party was quite satisfied that the system for the handling and storage of explosives was superior in every respect to the one formerly in use. The magazine reserve, which consisted of about 307 acres, was being improved, by the planting of [[tamarisk]] and other trees to provide shadow and explosion breaks.&lt;ref name="Advertiser"/&gt;

== Operation ==
[[File:Premises of the powder magazine office at Dry Creek, South Australia, SLSA, PRG-280-1-12-133.jpeg|thumb|Premises of the powder magazine office at Dry Creek]]

[[Limewash]] was normally applied to magazines' exterior walls. Care was taken to minimise and isolate the explosives from damp, heat and grit. The magazine structures incorporated insulated walls and were designed to create a naturally and reasonably cooled and ventilated environment. Their ventilation shafts were covered by metal [[louver|ventilation louvers]], coupled with [[spark arrestor]]s and dust deflectors.

The [[King tide|king tides]] regularly flooded the [[Estuary#Lagoon-type or bar-built|estuarine plain]]. Consequently, the [[tramway track|tramline]] along the mangroves from the magazines to the jetty at Broad Creek was frequently damaged. In July, 1917, the jetty was inundated by the highest tide on record up to that date, 3.6 m above low water, and was washed away. The following August an unusually high tide washed away the gear of the levee workmen, including planks, barrels, barricades and bags of silt, which disappeared without a trace.&lt;ref name="Jolly" /&gt;

== Decline ==
By 1925 explosives were delivered from [[Deer Park, Victoria|Deer Park]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] less frequently but in larger batches. Therefore, less explosives were delivered via the jetty, the number of daily paid stevedores declined and the turnover was reduced.

[[File:Broad Creek jetty and lighters in February 1912. Hargreaves, 'Photos Miscellaneous Explosives 230 to 360'. WSDS.jpg|thumb|Jetty at Broad Creek&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Jolly: ''A Significant Site: the Former Dry Creek Explosives Reserve''. In: ''Journal of the Historical Society of South Australia,'' No. 29, 2001, pp. 70&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By 1934, [[shipworm]] and lack of preventive maintenance had materially weakened the wooden structures. From 1934 explosives were railed from Victoria directly to the Dry Creek explosives depot. By 1947 all explosives were delivered this way. In 1950 urgent safety relevant repairs were ordered, but were not conducted until September 1952. Decreasing revenue from the port trade led to lessened maintenance and dredging of the Broad Creek landing. The jetty was last used in February 1970 and demolished about 1976.

As waterborne trade decreased, land transport of explosives was coupled to technological progress in the explosive usage. From early 1978 [[ammonium nitrate]] came into fashion as an ingredient of explosives mixtures that could be prepared on-site. This resulted in further safety refinements, and diffusion of responsibility for explosive storage. This eliminated much of the previously needed inspection, sampling and storage.&lt;ref name="Jolly"/&gt;

== Closure ==
The operation of the site ceased in October 1995. Eleven of the historic buildings at Dry Creek, which were built from 1903 to 1907, are still in place and were listed on the [[South Australian Heritage Register]] on 15 December 1994 as No. 14521.&lt;ref name="SAHR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dry Creek Explosive Magazines and Earth Mounds|url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/heritagesearch/HeritageItem.aspx?p_heritageno=13625|website=South Australian Heritage Places Database|publisher=South Australian Government|accessdate=26 April 2018|date=15 December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their condition was generally sound as of the year 2000, but the reinforcement bars of hollow concrete piles, which were installed instead of [[jarrah]] piles in the 1960s, are so corroded by the saline soil that the long term stability is under threat.&lt;ref name="Jolly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/22303/metro_report_1962_chapter15.pdf ''Chapter 15: Public Service Facilities.'']{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} In: Metro Report 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of the wharf once used to unload explosives and the narrow gauge railway line are still visible on the seawards side of the salt pans, if Broad Creek is entered by a [[canoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carter: [http://www.users.on.net/~pcarter/canoe_sa/maps/ti_notes.html Notes on the Torrens Island and Environs map.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ejection charge''', also called '''expelling charge''', is a [[pyrotechnic composition]], a type of a pyrotechnic [[gas generator]] designed to produce a small short-term amount of thrust to burst open a container and eject its content. 

In [[model rocketry]], ejection charges are used to deploy a recovery system (usually [[parachute]] or streamer). The ejection charge is ignited through a layer of [[delay composition]], to fire shortly after the main engine burns out. Ejection charges can be also triggered by a timer or an [[altimeter]]. A small amount of [[black powder]] is usually used, but [[smokeless powder]] and other compositions are possible.

Ejection charges are also used in some [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] to eject the light or smoke producing components out of the flare casing. In [[flare (countermeasure)|countermeasure flares]], ejection charges are used to propel the flares out of their casing, or to eject [[pyrophoric]] fluids from their containers.

In [[cluster bomb]]s, ejection charges are used to disperse the submunitions.

Burst charges are also used to dispense leaflets from [[leaflet bomb]]s.

In [[chemical weapon]]s, ejection charges are used to disperse the [[chemical agent]] from the bomb, submunition, grenade, or warhead.

'''Electronic or scripless trading''', sometimes called '''e-trading or paperless trading''' is a method of trading [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[stock]]s, and [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s), [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] or [[derivative (finance)|financial derivatives]] electronically. [[Information technology]] is used to bring together buyers and sellers through an [[electronic trading platform]] and network to create virtual market places. They can include various exchange-based systems, such as [[NASDAQ]], [[NYSE Arca]] and [[Globex]], as well as other types of trading platforms, such as electronic communication networks (ECNs), alternative trading systems, crossing networks and "dark pools".&lt;ref&gt;Lemke &amp; Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', Chapter 2 (Thomson West, 2015-2016 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jya|first1=Wak|title=Different Types of Forex Trading Platforms, Which the Best ?|url=http://fxdailyreport.com/forex-trading-platforms/|website=FXdailyReport.Com|accessdate=29 October 2016|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electronic trading is rapidly replacing human trading in global securities markets.
Electronic trading is in contrast to older [[floor trading]] and phone trading and has a number of advantages, but glitches and cancelled trades do still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

For many years [[stock exchange]]s were physical locations where buyers and sellers met and negotiated.  Exchange trading would typically happen on the floor of an exchange, where traders in brightly colored jackets (to identify which firm they worked for) would shout and gesticulate at one another – a process known as [[open outcry]] or pit trading (the exchange floors were often pit-shaped – circular, sloping downwards to the centre, so that the traders could see one another). With the improvement in [[telecommunication|communications]] technology in the late 20th century, the need for a physical location became less important and traders started to transact from remote locations in what became known as electronic trading.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/business/02speed.html?pagewanted=all |title=The New Speed of Money, Reshaping Markets |author=Graham Bowley |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic trading made transactions easier to complete, monitor, clear, and settle and this helped spur on its development.

One of the earliest examples of widespread electronic trading was on Globex, the [[CME Group]]’s [[electronic trading platform]] conceived in 1987 and launched fully in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cmegroup.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=114&amp;item=119 |title=Growth of CME Globex Platform: A Retrospective |publisher=CME Group |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed access to a variety of financial markets such as [[United States Treasury security|treasuries]], foreign exchange and commodities.  The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT) produced a rival system that was based on Oak Trading Systems’ Oak platform branded ‘E Open Outcry,’ an electronic trading platform that allowed for trading to take place alongside that took place in the CBOT pits.

Set up in 1971, [[NASDAQ]] was the world's first electronic stock market, though it originally operated as an electronic bulletin board{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}, rather than offering [[straight-through processing]] (STP).

By 2011 investment firms on both the [[buy side]] and [[sell side]] were increasing their spending on technology for electronic trading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isitc.org/pressroom/documents/Member%20Survey%20031111.pdf ISITC 2011 Member Survey], March 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the result that many floor traders and brokers were removed from the trading process. Traders also increasingly started to rely on [[algorithmic trading|algorithms]] to analyze market conditions and then execute their orders automatically.

The move to electronic trading compared to floor trading continued to increase with many of the major exchanges around the world moving from floor trading to completely electronic trading.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, Pankaj K., 2005, “Financial market design and the equity premium: Electronic vs. floor trading,” Journal of Finance volume 60, issue 6, pp. 2955–2985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading in the financial markets can broadly be split into two groups:
* [[Business-to-business]] (B2B) trading, often conducted on exchanges, where large [[investment banks]] and [[securities lending|broker]]s trade directly with one another, transacting large amounts of securities, and
* [[Business-to-consumer]] (B2C) trading, where retail (e.g. individuals buying and selling relatively small amounts of stocks and shares) and institutional clients (e.g. hedge funds, fund managers or insurance companies, trading far larger amounts of securities) buy and sell from brokers or "dealers", who act as middle-men between the clients and the B2B markets.

While the majority of retail trading in the United States happens over the Internet, retail trading volumes are dwarfed by institutional, inter-dealer and exchange trading. However, in developing economies, especially in Asia, retail trading constitutes a significant portion of overall trading volume&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://brokernotes.co/modern-trader/|title=The Modern Trader: A Report on the 9.6 Million Online Traders – BrokerNotes|date=2017-08-17|work=BrokerNotes|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For instruments which are not exchange-traded (e.g. [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bond|US treasury bonds]]), the inter-dealer market substitutes for the exchange. This is where dealers trade directly with one another or through [[inter-dealer broker]]s (i.e. companies like [[GFI Group]], [[ICAP (company)|ICAP]] and [[BGC Partners]].  They acted as middle-men between dealers such as investment banks). This type of trading traditionally took place over the phone but brokers moved to offering electronic trading services instead.

Similarly, B2C trading traditionally happened over the phone and, while some still does, more brokers are allowing their clients to place orders using electronic systems. Many retail (or "discount") brokers (e.g. [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], [[E-Trade]]) went online during the late 1990s and most retail stock-broking probably takes place over the web now.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Larger institutional clients, however, will generally place electronic orders via proprietary [[electronic trading platform]]s such as [[Bloomberg Terminal]], [[Reuters 3000 Xtra]], [[Thomson Reuters Eikon]], BondsPro, [[Thomson Financial|Thomson TradeWeb]] or [[CanDeal]] (which connect institutional clients to several dealers), or using their brokers' proprietary software.

For stock trading, the process of connecting counterparties through electronic trading is supported by the [[Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) Protocol. Used by the vast majority of exchanges and traders, the FIX Protocol is the industry standard for pre-trade messaging and trade execution. While the FIX Protocol was developed for trading stocks, it has been further developed to accommodate commodities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/commodities-trading-with-fix/| title=Commodities Trading with FIX| publisher=Global Trading| date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; foreign exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/fix-in-fx/ |title=FIX in FX |publisher=Global Trading|date= December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; derivatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/global-derivatives-analysing-the-key-developments-and-accelerators-for-fix-2/ |title=Global Derivatives - Analysing the key developments and accelerators for FIX |publisher=Global Trading |date=September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025522/http://fixglobal.com/home/global-derivatives-analysing-the-key-developments-and-accelerators-for-fix-2/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fixed income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/fixing-fixed-income/|author= Sassan Danesh|title=FIXing Fixed Income|publisher=Global Trading| date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; trading.

==Impact==
The increase of electronic trading has had some important implications:
* Reduced cost of transactions – By automating as much of the process as possible (often referred to as "[[straight-through processing]]" or STP), costs are brought down. The goal is to reduce the incremental cost of trades as close to zero as possible, so that increased trading volumes don't lead to significantly increased costs. This has translated to lower costs for investors.
* Greater liquidity – electronic systems make it easier to allow different companies to trade with one another, no matter where they are located. This leads to greater liquidity (i.e. there are more buyers and sellers) which increases the efficiency of the markets.
* Greater competition – While electronic trading hasn't necessarily lowered the cost of entry to the financial services industry, it has removed barriers within the industry and had a globalisation-style competition effect. For example, a trader can trade futures on [[Eurex]], [[Globex]] or [[LIFFE]] at the click of a button – he or she doesn't need to go through a broker or pass orders to a trader on the exchange floor.
* Increased transparency – Electronic trading has meant that the markets are less opaque. It's easier to find out the price of securities when that information is flowing around the world electronically.
* Tighter spreads – The "spread" on an instrument is the difference between the best buying and selling prices being quoted; it represents the profit being made by the [[market maker]]s. The increased liquidity, competition and transparency means that spreads have tightened, especially for commoditised, exchange-traded instruments.
*'Arms race' in pursuit of 'speed' – Several academics have argued that the continuous nature of electronic markets has incentivized a 'wasteful' technology race in pursuit of speed, where each market participant seeks to be faster than other participants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Larry|date=March 2013|title=What to Do about High-Frequency Trading|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|language=EN|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.2469/faj.v69.n2.6|issn=0015-198X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Budish|first=Eric|last2=Cramton|first2=Peter|last3=Shim|first3=John|date=2015-11-01|title=The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as a Market Design Response|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/4/1547/1916146|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=130|issue=4|pages=1547–1621|doi=10.1093/qje/qjv027|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some trading platforms have attempted to curb this wasteful arms race among participants by altering the process by which orders are matched, so orders that are received earlier are not always processed before those that are received later&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.automatedtrader.net/articles/exchange-views/144193/life-in-the-slow-lane|title=Life in the slow lane {{!}} Algorithmic Trading Articles &amp; Financial Insight {{!}} Automated Trader|website=www.automatedtrader.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melton|first=Hayden|date=2017-09-25|title=Market mechanism refinement on a continuous limit order book venue: a case study|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3144722.3144729|journal=ACM SIGecom Exchanges|volume=16|issue=1|pages=72–77|doi=10.1145/3144722.3144729}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

For retail investors, financial services on the web offer great benefits. The primary benefit is the reduced cost of transactions for all concerned as well as the ease and the convenience. [[World Wide Web|Web]]driven financial transactions bypass traditional hurdles such as [[logistics]]. Conversely there is concern about the impact of speculation through trading, considered negatively and of potential significant damage to the real economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2376347|title = The Ethics of Speculation|journal = International Journal of Ethics|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 335–347|last1 = Ryan|first1 = John A|year = 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Technology and systems==
{{anchor|Platforms}} &lt;!-- maybe 'the Platforms' anchor – an incoming redirect from [[eTrading Platforms]] – has potential to grow into a section in itself --&gt;
Electronic trading systems are typically proprietary software (''etrading platforms'' or [[electronic trading platform]]s), running on [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] hardware and operating systems, often using common underlying protocols, such as [[TCP/IP]].

Exchanges typically develop their own systems (sometimes referred to as matching engines), although sometimes an exchange will use another exchange's technology (e.g. e-cbot, the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]'s electronic trading platform, uses [[LIFFE]]'s Connect system), and some newer electronic exchanges use 3rd-party specialist software providers (e.g. the [[Budapest Stock Exchange|Budapest stock exchange]] and the [[Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange]] use [[automated trading system]] originally written and implemented by FMSC, an Australian technology company that was acquired by Computershare, and whose intellectual property rights are now owned by [[OMX]]).

[[Exchange (organized market)|Exchanges]] and ECNs generally offer two methods of accessing their systems –
* an exchange-provided [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], which the trader runs on his or her desktop and connects directly to the exchange/ECN, and
* an [[Application programming interface|API]] which allows dealers to plug their own in-house systems directly into the exchange/ECN's.

From an infrastructure point of view, most exchanges will provide "gateways" which sit on a company's network, acting in a manner similar to a [[Proxy server|proxy]], connecting back to the exchange's central system.

ECNs will generally forego the gateway/proxy, and their GUI or the API will connect directly to a central system, across a leased line.

Many [[brokerage firm|broker]]s develop their own systems, although there are some third-party solutions providers specializing in this area. Like ECNs, brokers will often offer both a GUI and an API (although it's likely that a slightly smaller proportion of brokers offer an API, as compared with ECNs), and connectivity is typically direct to the broker's systems, rather than through a gateway.

Investment banks and other dealers have far more complex technology requirements, as they have to interface with multiple exchanges, brokers and multi-dealer platforms, as well as their own pricing, P&amp;L, trade processing and position-keeping systems. Some banks will develop their own electronic trading systems in-house, but this can be costly, especially when they need to connect to many exchanges, ECNs and brokers. There are a number of companies offering solutions in this area.

==Algorithmic trading==
{{Main article|Algorithmic trading}}
Some electronic trades are not planned or executed by human traders, but by complex algorithms.

Many types of algorithmic or automated trading activities can be described as [[high-frequency trading]] (HFT), which is a specialized form of algorithmic trading characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios

'''GeoRSS''' is a specification for encoding location as part of a [[Web feed]]. ''(Web feeds are used to describe feeds ("channels") of content, such as news articles, [[MP3 blog|Audio blogs]], [[Vlog|video blogs]] and text [[blog]] entries. These [[web feed]]s are rendered by programs such as [[feed aggregator|aggregator]]s and [[web browser]]s.)'' The name "GeoRSS" is derived from [[RSS]], the most known [[Web feed]] and syndication format.

In GeoRSS, location content consists of geographical points, lines, and polygons of interest and related feature descriptions. GeoRSS feeds are designed to be consumed by geographic software such as map generators. By building these encodings on a common information model, the GeoRSS collaboration is promoting interoperability and "upwards-compatibility" across encodings.

At this point, the GeoRSS collaboration has completed work on two primary encodings that are called GeoRSS [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML) and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS-Simple is a very lightweight format that supports basic geometries (point, line, box, polygon) and covers the typical use cases when encoding locations. GeoRSS GML is a formal [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) GML Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than GeoRSS Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] latitude/longitude. There is also a [[Geography Markup Language|W3C]] GeoRSS serialization, which is older and partly deprecated but still the most widely used.

GeoRSS can be used to extend both RSS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]'s latest standard for feeds.

==Examples==
Here's a GeoRSS Simple example using Atom.

'''Guastavino tile''' is a version of [[Catalan vault]] introduced to the United States in 1885 by [[Valencian people|Valencian]] (Spanish) architect and builder [[Rafael Guastavino]] (1842&amp;ndash;1908).&lt;ref&gt;Ochsendorf, John; Freeman, Michael (Photographer), ''Guastavino Vaulting: The Art of Structural Tile'', Princeton Architectural Press; 1st edition (September 22, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1568987415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
Guastavino vaulting is a technique for constructing robust, self-supporting [[arch]]es and [[Vault (architecture)|architectural vaults]] using interlocking [[terracotta]] [[tile]]s and layers of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to form a thin skin, with the tiles following the curve of the roof as opposed to horizontally ([[Corbel arch|corbelling]]), or perpendicular to the curve (as in Roman vaulting). This is known as [[timbrel vault]]ing, because of supposed likeness to the skin of a [[timbrel]] or [[tambourine]]. It is also called "[[Catalan vault]]ing" and "compression-only thin-tile vaulting".&lt;ref name=Ammidown&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ammidown|first1=Margot|title=Geometry and its Complexity: The Art of Structural Tile Lives On|journal=Modern Magazine|date=Summer 2014|pages=114-119|url=http://modernmag.com|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guastavino tile is found in some of New York’s most prominent [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts landmarks]] and in major buildings across the United States.

==Construction==
The Guastavino terracotta tiles are standardized, less than an inch (25 mm) thick, and approximately {{convert|6|in|mm}} by {{convert|12|in|mm}} across. They are usually set in three herringbone-pattern courses with a sandwich of thin layers of [[Portland cement]]. Unlike heavier stone construction, these tile domes could be built without [[centering]]. Each tile was [[cantilever]]ed out over the open space, relying only on the quick drying cements developed by the company. [[Akoustolith]], a special sound absorbing tile, was one of several trade names used by Guastavino.

==Significance==
Guastavino tile has both structural and aesthetic significance.  

Structurally, the timbrel vault was based on traditional vernacular vaulting techniques already very familiar to Mediterranean architects, but not well known in America. Terracotta free-span timbrel vaults were far more economical and structurally resilient than the ancient Roman vaulting alternatives.  

Guastavino wrote extensively about his system of "Cohesive Construction".  As the name suggests, he believed that these timbrel vaults represented an innovation in [[structural engineering]]. The tile system provided solutions that were impossible with traditional masonry arches and vaults. Subsequent research has shown the timbrel vault is simply a masonry vault, much less thick than traditional arches, that produces less horizontal thrust due to its lighter weight. This permits flatter arch profiles, which would produce unacceptable horizontal thrust if constructed in thicker, heavier masonry.&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Tarrago, ''Guastavino Co. (1885–1962): Catalogue of Works in Catalonia and America'' ({{ISBN|84-88258-65-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 2012, a group of students under supervision of [[MIT]] professor [[John Ochsendorf]] built a full-scale reproduction of a small Guastavino vault.  The resulting structure was exhibited, as well as a [[time lapse video]] documenting the construction process.&lt;ref name=Gnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Ochsendorf|first=John|title=Construction of a vault|url=http://architecture.mit.edu/class/guastavino/features/ramage/index-ramage.htm|work=Guastavino.net|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420015933/http://architecture.mit.edu/class/guastavino/features/ramage/index-ramage.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochsendorf also curated an exhibition ''Palaces for the People'', featuring the history and legacy of Guastavino, which premiered in September 2012 at the [[Boston Public Library]], Rafael Guastavino's first major architectural work in America.  The exhibition then traveled to the [[National Building Museum]] in Washington DC, and an expanded version appeared at the [[Museum of the City of New York]].  Ochsendorf, a winner of the [[Macarthur Foundation]] "genius grant", also wrote the book-length color-illustrated monograph ''Guastavino vaulting : the art of structural tile'',&lt;ref name=Ochsendorf&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochsendorf|first1=John|last2=Freeman|first2=Michael (photographs)|title=Guastavino vaulting : the art of structural tile|date=2010|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1568987415}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online exhibition coordinated with the traveling exhibits.&lt;ref name=PFPOnline&gt;{{cite web|title=(Homepage)|url=http://palacesforthepeople.com|website=Palaces for the People: Guastavino and America's Great Public Spaces|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ochsendorf directs the Guastavino Project at MIT, which researches and maintains the Guastavino.net online archive of related materials.&lt;ref name=GuastNet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochsendorf|first1=John|title=(Homepage)|url=http://www.guastavino.net|website=Guastavino.net|publisher=John Ochsendorf|accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archival sources==
The Guastavino company was headquartered in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]], in a building of their own design which still stands. The records and drawings of the Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company are now preserved by the Department of Drawings &amp; Archives in the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.

The '''gun data computer''' was a series of [[artillery computer]]s used by the [[U.S. Army]] for [[coastal artillery]], [[field artillery]] and [[antiaircraft artillery]] applications. In antiaircraft applications they were used in conjunction with a [[director (military)|director]].

[[File:FADAC gun computer.jpg|right|thumb|FADAC M18]]
* M1: This was used by seacoast artillery for major-caliber seacoast guns. It computed continuous firing data for a battery of two guns that were separated by not more than 1000 feet. It utilised the same type of input data furnished by a range section with the then-current (1940) types of position-finding and fire-control equipment.
* M3: This was used in conjunction with the M9 and M10 directors to compute all required firing data, i.e. [[azimuth]], [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] and fuze time. The computations were made continuously, so that the gun was at all times correctly pointed and the fuze correctly timed for firing at any instant. The computer was mounted in the M13 or M14 director trailer.
* M4: This was identical to the M3 except for some mechanisms and parts which were altered to allow for different ammunition being used.
* M8: This was an electronic computer (using vacuum tube technology) built by [[Bell Labs]] and used by coast artillery with medium-caliber guns (up to 8-inches). It made the following corrections: wind, drift, earth's rotation, muzzle velocity, air density, height of site and spot corrections.
* M9: This was identical to the M8 except for some mechanisms and parts which were altered to accommodate anti-aircraft ammunition and guns.
* M10: A ballistics computer, part of the M38 fire control system, for the [[Skysweeper]].
* M13: A ballistics computer for the [[M48 tank]].
* M14: A ballistics computer for the [[M103 heavy tank]].
* M15: A part of the M35 field artillery fire-control system, which included the M1 gunnery officer console and M27 power supply.

==Systems==
[[File:TACFIRE firing computer.jpg|right|thumb|AN/GSG-10 TACFIRE]]
* The '''Battery Computer System (BCS)''' AN/GYK-29 was a computer used by the [[United States Army]] for computing [[artillery]] [[fire mission]] data. It replaced the Field Artillery Digital Automatic Computer (FADAC) and was small enough to fit aboard the [[HMMWV]] combat platform.
* The AN/GSG-10 '''TACFIRE''' system automated [[Field Artillery]] command and control functions. It was composed of computers and remote devices such as the Variable Format Message Entry Device (VFMED), the [[Digital Message Device]] (DMD) and the [[AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar|Firefinder]] Field Artillery target acquisition [[radar]] system linked by digital communications using existing radio and wire communications equipment. Later in its service life, it also linked with the Battery Computer System (BCS) which had more advanced targeting algorithms.

The last TACFIRE fielding was completed in 1987. Replacement of TACFIRE equipment began in 1994.

TACFIRE used the [[AN/GYK-12]], a second-generation mainframe computer developed primarily by [[Litton Industries]] for Army Divisional Field Artillery (DIVARTY) units. It had two configurations, division and battalion level, housed in mobile command shelters. Field Artillery Brigades also use the division configuration.

Components of the system were identified using acronyms:
* CPU ([[central processing unit]])
* IOU (input/output unit)
* MCMU (mass [[core memory]] unit)
* DDT (digital data terminal)
* MTU (magnetic tape unit)
* PCG (power converter group)
* ELP (electronic line printer)
* DPM( digital plotter map)
* ACC (artillery control console)
* RCMU (remote control monitoring unit)

The successor to the TACFIRE system is the [[Project Manager Battle Command#Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System .28AFATDS.29|Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System]] (AFATDS).

* The AFATDS is the "Fires XXI" computer system for both tactical and technical fire control.  It replaced both BCS (for technical fire solutions) and IFSAS/L-TACFIRE (for tactical fire control) systems in U.S. Field Artillery organizations, as well as in maneuver fire support elements at the battalion level and higher. As of 2009, the U.S. Army was transitioning from a version based on a [[Sun Microsystems]] [[SPARC]] computer running the [[Linux kernel]] to a version based on laptop computers running the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

===Surviving examples===
One reason for a lack of surviving examples of early units was the use of [[radium]] on the dials, which officially made them [[hazardous waste]], and as such were disposed of by the [[United States Department of Energy]]. Currently there is one surviving example of FADAC at the [[Fort Sill]] artillery museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/famuseum/|title=U.S. Army Field Artillery Museum - Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''handbag''', also called '''purse''' in [[North American English]], is a [[Handle (grip)|handle]]d medium-to-large [[bag]] used to carry personal items.

==Purse, handbag or pouch==
The term "purse" originally referred to a small bag for holding coins. In many English-speaking countries it is still used to refer a small money bag. A "handbag" is a larger accessory that holds objects beyond currency, such as personal items. American English typically uses the terms purse and handbag interchangeably. The term handbag began appearing in the early 1900s. Initially, it was most often used to refer men's hand-luggage. Women's bags grew larger and more complex during this period, and the term was attached to the accessory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Marie|title=Purse Pizzazz|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing|isbn=978-1-4027-4065-7|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern origin ==

Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose: to carry coins. Purses were made of soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often as ladies; the Scottish [[sporran]] is a survival of this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very beautiful handbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://henriettashandbags.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=4|title=History of Handbags- From the 14th Century to Present Day Handbag Designers|last=Timmons|first=Henrietta|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape for these accessories, inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses that would not be bulky or untidy in appearance, so ''reticules'' were designed. Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, carried with wrist straps. First becoming popular in France, they crossed over into Britain, where they became known as "indispensables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara G. S.|title=Handbags: a peek inside a woman's most trusted accessory|year=2002|publisher=Running Press Book Publishers|isbn=0-7624-1330-1|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, however, did not adopt the trend. They used purses and [[pocket]]s, which became popular in men's trousers.&lt;ref name="burman83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burman, Barbara and Carole Turbin, eds.|title=Material Strategies: Dress and Gender in Historical Perspective|year=2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0906-2|pages=83–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern purse, clutch, pouch or handbag came about in England during the [[Industrial Revolution]], in part due to the increase in travel by railway. In 1841 the [[Doncaster]] industrialist and confectionery entrepreneur Samuel Parkinson (of [[butterscotch]] fame) ordered a set of travelling cases and trunks and insisted on a travelling case or bag for his wife's particulars after noticing that her purse was too small and made from material that would not withstand the journey. He stipulated that he wanted various handbags for his wife, varying in size for different occasions and asked that they be made from the same leather that was being used for his cases and trunks to distinguish them from the then-familiar [[carpetbag]] and other travellers' cloth bags used by members of the popular classes. [[H.J. Cave &amp; Sons|H. J. Cave]] (London) obliged and produced the first modern set of luxury handbags, as we would recognize them today, including a clutch and a tote (named as 'ladies travelling case'). These are now on display in the [[Museum of Bags and Purses]] in Amsterdam.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} H. J. Cave did continue to sell and advertise the handbags, but many critics said that women did not need them and that bags of such size and heavy material would 'break the backs of ladies.'  H. J. Cave ceased to promote the bags after 1865, concentrating on trunks instead, although they continued to make the odd handbag for royalty, celebrities or to celebrate special occasions, the Queen's 2012 Diamond Jubilee being the most recent. However, H.J. Cave resumed handbag production in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philippa |last=Stockley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/philippa-stockley-yes-the-contents-mean-a-lot-but-its-the-bag-that-matters-most-8100587.html |title=Yes, the contents mean a lot, but it's the bag that matters most |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{expand section|date=November 2011}}
During the 1940s, the rationing of textiles for World War II led to the manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia&lt;ref name="pederson8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pederson|first=Stephanie|title=Handbags: What Every Woman Should Know|year=2006|publisher=David &amp; Charles|isbn=9780715324950|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or crocheted from yarn. Some women crocheted their own small handbags from commercial patterns during this period.

== Men's bags {{anchor|Man bag}} ==
[[File:FreitagBag.jpg|thumb|A casual men's messenger bag.]]
The oldest known purse dates back more than 5000 years, and was a pouch worn by a man, [[Ötzi the Iceman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerval|first=Olivier|title=Studies in Fashion: Fashion Accessories|year=2009|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-1058-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men once carried coin purses. In early Modern Europe, when women's fashions moved in the direction of using small ornamental purses, which evolved into handbags, men's fashions were moving in another direction. Men's trousers replaced men's [[breeches]] during the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, and pockets were incorporated in the loose, heavy material. This enabled men to continue carrying coins, and then paper currency, in small leather wallets. Men's pockets were plentiful in 19th century and 20th century trousers and coats, to carry possessions, such as pipes, matches and knives, and they were an item frequently mended by their wives.&lt;ref name="burman83"/&gt;

Men's purses were revived by designers in the 1970s in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarti|first=Giorgio|title=Vespa: 1946-2006: 60 Years of the Vespa|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7603-2577-3|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, designers have marketed a more diverse range of accessory bags for men. The names '''man bag''', '''man-purse''' and '''murse''' have been used. The designs are typically variations on backpacks or messenger bags, and have either a masculine or a more unisex appearance, although they are often more streamlined than a backpack and less bulky than a briefcase. These bags are often called [[messenger bag]]s or organizer bags. The leather [[satchel]] is also common. Men's designer bags are produced by well-known companies such as [[Prada]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Coach, Inc.|Coach]], and [[Bottega Veneta]] in a variety of shapes and sizes. The global men's bag and small leather goods trade is a $4-billion-a-year industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Standard &amp; Poor's|title=Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Guide|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location="Coach Inc."|isbn=978-0-07-175491-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales of men's accessories including "holdall" bags are increasing in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clifford |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/business/men-are-buying-fashion-accessories-after-slow-recession-sales.html |title=Men Step Out of the Recession, Bag on Hip, Bracelet on Wrist |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==
[[File:Woman%27s_Handbag_LACMA_M.85.85.27.jpg|thumb|1860 Woman's handbag with frame and kissing lock (LACMA).]]
A distinction can also be made between soft-body handbags or frame handbags, where a metal frame supports the textile or leather of the bag. Frame bags often use a [[kissing lock]] closure, with two interlocking metal beads set on the top of the frame. Kissing locks were popular on handbags during the early- to mid-20th century, and remain popular with vintage collectors and in "retro" designs. These locks are still seen on smaller [[change purse]]s.

== Coinage as a verb ==
The verb "to handbag"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/handbag&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired in the 1980s by UK prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] having “weaponized” the handbag in the opinion of British biographer and historian [[Sir David Cannadine|David Cannadine]].&lt;ref name="CannadineProps"&gt;{{cite web| first=David |last=Cannadine |title=''Prime Ministers’ Props, Series 2, Margaret Thatcher's Handbag''|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bgg1d0 |publisher=BBC Radio 4, 2018-08-29 |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As “her most visible symbol of her power to command” the bag became an emphatic prop that she produced at meetings to show she meant business. She would invariably bring out of the bag a crucial document from which she would quote, her speech notes often being cut to size to fit inside. Because Thatcher was Britain’s first female prime minister, former [[Daily Telegraph]] editor [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] wrote in his authorised biography of 2013, “her handbag became the sceptre of her rule”.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore (2013). ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One: Not For Turning''. Allen Lane: London. {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9288-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The verb's more general meaning of "treating ruthlessly" came to symbolize Thatcher's whole style of government. Victims of her handbaggings, from political leaders to journalists, have testified&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''I was handbagged by Mrs Thatcher'' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11518330 |publisher=BBC News. Ollie Stone-Lee, 9 April 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to what the German chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] perceived as her “ice-cold pursuit of her interests”. US secretary of state [[James Baker]] recalled her standby ploy: “When negotiations stall, get out the handbag! The solution is always there.”

[[Julian Critchley]], one of her biggest [[Tory]] backbench critics, once said, "Margaret Thatcher and her handbag is the same as [[Winston Churchill]] and his cigar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/8521433/Margaret-Thatcher-style-Aquascutum-and-the-original-power-dresser.html | work=Daily Telegraph | first=Hilary | last= Alexander | title=''Margaret Thatcher: style, Aquascutum and the original power dresser''| date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher's bag was almost as newsworthy an item as she was herself and on the day she died, one of her handbag-makers saw a sharp rise in sales of her favorite structured design. The original bag Thatcher asserts on a signed card was the one “used every day in my time at Downing Street”&lt;ref name="CannadineProps"/&gt; is archived at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]]. Made of dark blue leather “in mock-croc style”, it was a gift from friends on her birthday in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">'''Hybrid positioning systems''' are systems for finding the location of a mobile device using several different [[positioning technologies]]. Usually GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]) is one major component of such systems, combined with cell tower signals, wireless internet signals, [[Bluetooth]] sensors, [[IP address]]es and network environment data.&lt;ref&gt;AlterGeo: About us http://platform.altergeo.ru/index.php?mode=about&lt;/ref&gt;

These systems are specifically designed to overcome the limitations of GPS, which is very exact in open areas, but works poorly indoors or between tall buildings (the [[urban canyon]] effect). By comparison, cell tower signals are not hindered by buildings or bad weather, but usually provide less precise positioning. [[Wi-Fi positioning system]]s may give very exact positioning, in urban areas with high Wi-Fi density - and depend on a comprehensive database of Wi-Fi access points.

Hybrid positioning systems are increasingly being explored for certain civilian and commercial [[location-based service]]s and [[location-based media]], which need to work well in urban areas in order to be commercially and practically viable.

Early works in this area include the Place Lab project, which started on 2003 and went inactive in 2006. Later methods let smartphones combine the accuracy of GPS with the low power consumption of cell-ID transition point finding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enl.usc.edu/papers/cache/Paek11b.pdf Energy-Efficient Positioning for Smartphones using Cell-ID Sequence Matching] by Jeongyeup Paek, Kyu-Han Kim, Jatinder P.

==Introduction==
An inclined elevator consists of one or two inclined tracks on a slope with a single car on each carrying payload. In the case of a two-track configuration each car operates in a ''shuttle principle'': it moves up and down on its own track independently of the other car. A car is either winched up to the station on the top of the incline where the cable is collected on a winch drum. Alternatively a car is balanced by a counterweight moving along the track in the opposite direction, quite similar to an ordinary lift.&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://caminos.udc.es/ferrotrans/orro/documentos/Transporte_por_cable.pdf |title=Transporte por cable |authors=Alfonso Orro Arcay; Margarita Novales Ordax; Miguel Rodríguez Bugarín |chapter=Capitulo III. descripcion de los distintos tipos de instalaciones |date=2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713041742/http://caminos.udc.es/ferrotrans/orro/documentos/Transporte_por_cable.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-13|publisher=Universidade da Coruña|isbn=84-688-3536-6|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a standard elevator, it can go up [[Grade (slope)|tilted grades]], and can be used for both residential and commercial purposes.  The purpose of inclined elevators is to provide accessibility to steep hillsides and inclines at minimal effort to the user. Inclined elevator is a form of [[cable railway]].

Users with mobility and disability challenges often use an [[stairlift|incline platform lift to climb staircases]] in their home with their [[mobility scooter]] or [[motorized wheelchair]]. Outdoor inclined elevators are used to access steep hillside property where stairs are not a preferred option. Inclined elevators can also be used to move equipment and materials to hard to reach elevated locations for industrial or construction purposes.

In [[European Union]] ''inclined lifts'' are subject to EU lift regulations part 22 [[List of EN standards|EN 81-22:2014]]&lt;ref name=EN-81-22 &gt;{{Cite book |title=EN 81-22:2014 Safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts - Lifts for the transport of persons and goods - Part 22: Electric lifts with inclined path |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines some standard limits for their implementations: track inclination is between 15° and 75°, maximum  cabin capacity is 100 people (7.500&amp;nbsp;kg), maximum speed — 4&amp;nbsp;m/s, the track is straight in the horizontal plane. These limits are not compulsory though and if not followed by an installation, for example, the path is curved, some unspecified additional risk analysis is required to be conducted.&lt;ref name=Petruccelli /&gt;

==Operation==

Inclined elevator's design is based on the same basic technology as conventional, vertical [[elevator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/products/inclined-elevators-29/ |title=Inclined elevators |date=2018-06-10 |website=[[Leitner Group|Leitner AG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general standard elevator's equipment can be adapted for systems with an inclines up 10[[Degree (angle)|°]] from vertical, while an incline with more than 20° from vertical will require some additional considerations.&lt;ref name=Strakosch /&gt;

For example, inclined elevators used in the [[Stockholm metro]] were using standard "vertical" elevator cabins mounted on wheeled platforms adapted to 30° incline. The cabin was balanced by a counterweight and it was moved by a conventional elevator's hoist and cables along the guide rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ien.35556021057427;view=1up;seq=31 |title=Assessment of the inclined elevator and its use in Stockholm |authors=De Leuw, Cather &amp; Company, United States. Urban Mass Transportation Administration. Office of Socio-Economic and Special Projects |page=19|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some inclined elevators are outdoor systems designed to move people and goods along steep gradients,&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis /&gt; the others are used in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings |authors= Walter T. Grondzik, Alison G. Kwok |publisher=Wiley |year=2014 |isbn=9781118867181 |pages=1460|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZIdvdyPMhI8C}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most common inclined elevators are constructed from steel or aluminum materials, are powered by electric motors, and operate with push button electronic controls. Common drive systems include cable winding drums and continuous loop traction drives.

Many inclined lifts were constructed along the pressure lines of storage power plants for transporting building materials. Examples are the ''Gelmerbahn'' leading to the [[Gelmersee]] and the ''Funicolare Piora–Ritom'' leading to [[Lago Ritom]], both in Switzerland.{{citation needed |reason=To justify this particular way of distinguishing between a funicular and an inclined lift - see talk|date=February 2018}}

Modern versions resembling an [[elevator]] are used in some installations, such as at the [[Cityplace (DART station)|Cityplace Station]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], the [[Huntington (WMATA station)|Huntington Metro Station]] in [[Huntington, Virginia]], the [[San Diego Convention Center]] in San Diego, the [[Luxor Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris. The [[London Millennium Funicular]] provides an alternative to staircase access to London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]].&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunbarandboardman.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/the-millennium-bridge-inclined-lift.html|title=The Millennium Bridge Inclined Lift|date=18 October 2012|publisher=Dunbar and Boardman|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/rail/lon.htm |title=London Millennium Funicular |publisher=Hows.org.uk |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture between an inclined lift and a funicular with two cars was the second [[Angels Flight]] in Los Angeles, which ran from 1996 to 2001. The original funicular closed in 1969 and was reinstalled in 1996 using separate cables for each car, which were winched on separate winch drums in the station at the top. The winch drums were connected to the drive motor and the service brake by a gear train. The system failed because of gear train breakage, causing a fatal accident in 2001. The railway reopened as a true funicular, with a single main haulage cable with one car attached to each end, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher = Angels Flight Railway Foundation |date = March 15, 2010 |title = Historic Angels Flight Railway Reopens |url = http://www.lunaglushon.com/files/Docs/press_release.pdf |access-date = June 21, 2012 |dead-url = yes |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120304125743/http://www.lunaglushon.com/files/Docs/press_release.pdf |archive-date = March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has closed and reopened several times since, last re-opening on 31 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/angels-flight-to-reopen-thursday/article_e7b6683a-8929-11e7-acdf-13e2ebe31837.html|work=LA Downtown News|date=25 August 2017|title=Angels Flight to Reopen Thursday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinction from funicular ===
[[File:Paris furnicular both.jpeg|thumb|Montmartre Funicular in Paris is a ''double track inclined elevator'']]
An inclined elevator differs from a [[funicular]] in that the latter has a cable attached to a pair of vehicles, the ascending and descending vehicles counterbalancing each other. In the inclined elevator one car is either winched up to the station at the top of the incline where the cable is collected on a winch drum, or the single car is balanced by a counterweight.&lt;ref name=Pyrgidis /&gt; Some scholars though consider an inclined elevator as a descendant of a funicular.&lt;ref name=Strakosch /&gt;

European Union legislation separates inclined elevators and funiculars by putting them in different regulations: inclined lift installations are regulated by EN 81-22:2014&lt;ref name=EN-81-22 /&gt; while funicular installations are regulated by [[EU directive]] 2000/9/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |title=DIRECTIVE 2000/9/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 March 2000 relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0009 |journal=Official Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, despite its name the [[Montmartre Funicular]] in [[Paris]] after a reconstruction in 1991 is technically a ''double  inclined elevator''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/7Line-Inclined-Elevators.pdf |title=7 Line Extension Inclined Elevators  |date=April 28, 2014 |website=MTA Capital Construction |access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; since each of its two cabins have its own cable traction with own counterweight and they operate independently from each other.&lt;ref name="Pyrgidis" /&gt;

'''Multiple-valued current mode logic''' (MVCML) or current mode multiple-valued logic (CM-MVL) is a method of representing electronic logic levels in [[analog circuit|analog]] [[CMOS]] [[Electrical network|circuit]]s.  In MVCML, logic levels are represented by multiples of a base [[Current (electricity)|current]], I&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;, set to a certain value, x.  Thus, level 0 is associated with the value of [[Null character|null]], level 1 is associated with I&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; = x, level 2 is represented by I&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; = 2x, and so on.

'''Nanoprobing''' is method of extracting device [[Current–voltage characteristic|electrical parameters]] through the use of nanoscale tungsten wires, used primarily in the semiconductor industry. The characterization of individual devices is instrumental to engineers and [[integrated circuit]] designers during initial product development and debug. It is commonly utilized in device [[failure analysis]] laboratories to aid with yield enhancement, quality and reliability issues and customer returns. Commercially available nanoprobing systems are integrated into either a vacuum-based [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM). Nanoprobing systems that are based on AFM technology are referred to as Atomic Force nanoProbers (AFP).

== Principles and operation ==
AFM based nanoprobers, enable up to eight probe tips to be scanned to generate high resolution AFM topography images, as well as Conductive AFM, Scanning Capacitance, and Electrostatic Force Microscopy images. Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.

[[File:Nanoprobes Over SRAM devices.jpg|thumb|right|A high magnification image of tungsten nanoprobes landed on a [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] device.]]
For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the probe tips with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time. Existing nanoprobe needles or “probe tips” have a typical end-point radius ranging from 5 to 35&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toh | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Tan | first2 = P.

Navigation of the probe tips in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision [[piezoelectric]] manipulators. Typical systems have anywhere from 2 to 8 probe manipulators with high end tools having better than 5&amp;nbsp;nm of placement resolution in the X, Y &amp; Z axes and a high accuracy sample stage for navigation of the sample under test.

'''Negative imprinting''' is a feature of some film [[camera]]s, in which the date, [[shutter speed]] and [[aperture]] setting are recorded on the [[Photographic film|negative]] directly as the film is [[Exposure (photography)|exposed]].

The oldest patent on this is [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F3882512  US patent #3,882,512], which uses [[mirror|half-silvered mirrors]] to direct the readout of a digital clock and mix it with the [[light|light rays]] coming through the main [[camera lens]].

The type of imprinter used in modern SLR cameras is of the type described in [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F4001846|US patent #4,001,846]. This imprinter is fixed to the back of the camera on the film backing plate. It uses a small [[LED]] display for illumination and optics to focus the light onto a specific part of the film. The LED display is exposed on the negative at the same time the picture is taken. 

The imprinter superimposes the date and other information on the image and this can be distracting. [[Digital camera]]s can often encode all the information in the image file itself. The [[Exif]] format is the most commonly used format.

In [[information technology]], the '''observer effect''' is the impact on the behaviour of a computer process caused by the act of observing the process while it is running.

For example: if a process uses a log file to record its progress, the process could slow down. Furthermore, the act of viewing the file while the process is running could cause an I/O error in the process, which could, in turn, cause it to stop. Another example would be observing the performance of a CPU by running both the observed and observing programs on the same CPU,&lt;ref name="Mytkowicz"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Mytkowicz|first1=Todd|last2=Sweeny|first2=Peter|last3=Hauswirth|first3=Matthias|last4=Diwan|first4=Amer|title=Observer Effect and Measurement Bias in Performance Analysis|journal=Computer Science Technical Reports|year=2008|url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/csci_techreports/972}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will lead to inaccurate results because the observer program itself affects the CPU performance (modern, heavily cached and pipelined CPUs are particularly affected by this kind of observation).

The observer effect could either have a positive or negative impact on the computer process behaviour. A positive impact can be [[Software bug|software bugs]], also known as [[Heisenbug|Heisenbugs]], which diminish or change their negative behavior when observation mechanisms, such as [[debugging]], are enabled. Such bugs usually create extra difficulties in being isolated.

PAREXEL was founded in 1982 by Josef von Rickenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=209362&amp;ticker=PRXL|title=List of Public Companies Worldwide, Letter – Businessweek – Businessweek|work=Businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organic chemist Anne B. Sayigh&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/9750/title/Entrepreneur-Briefs/&lt;/ref&gt; initially to advise Japanese and German firms on how to navigate the [[FDA]] approval process.&lt;ref name="bilanz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilanz.ch/people/josef-von-rickenbach-parexel|title=Josef von Rickenbach – Parexel|work=Bilanz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has grown organically over the years and through 40 acquisitions. Josef von Rickenbach is credited with establishing PAREXEL’s culture and practices based on the principles he experienced as a researcher at [[Schering-Plough]] in [[Lucerne, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="bilanz.ch" /&gt;

In 1990, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. By 1999 it had a staff of 4,500 and 45 offices.&lt;ref name="bilanz.ch" /&gt;  In the 2000s, it grew to over 18,000 employees. PAREXEL’s consulting and clinical trial work has helped establish many household drug brands and contributed to numerous successes in modern [[pharmacology]].

The company was acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5.0 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-pamplona-capital-management-comple/brief-pamplona-capital-management-completes-acquisition-of-parexel-idUSFWN1MA0SJ&lt;/ref&gt; The deal closed in September of 2017.

== TGN1412 clinical trial ==
{{Main|TGN1412}}
{{POV section|date=August 2015}}

In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of [[TeGenero]], the now bankrupt German [[biotechnology]] firm, on its [[anti-inflammatory drug]] [[TGN1412]] to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[leukaemia]], caused severe inflammation and [[multiple organ failure]] in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Drugs trial men 'seriously ill' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=  March 15, 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4808836.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug had been tested on animals but this was the [[First-in-man study|first test on humans]].

PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation.

A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist [[Brian Deer]] as part of [[Channel 4]]'s Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood [[in vitro]]. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;useSecondary=true&amp;ssDocName=CON2023822&amp;ssTargetNodeId=389 Clinical trial final report, MHRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206104242/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;useSecondary=true&amp;ssDocName=CON2023822&amp;ssTargetNodeId=389 |date=2006-12-06 }}, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group''' ('''PICMG''') is a [[consortium]] of over 150 companies.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to PICMG website metadata and [http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/membership.htm#memberlists Member Lists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922173051/http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/membership.htm#memberlists |date=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, the group was originally formed to adapt  [[Conventional PCI|PCI technology]] for use in high-performance [[telecommunication]]s, military, and industrial computing applications, but its work has now grown to include newer technologies. PICMG is distinct from the similarly named and adjacently-focused [[PCI-SIG|PCI Special Interest Group]] (PCI-SIG).

PICMG currently focuses on developing and implementing specifications and guidelines for [[open standard]]s-based computer architectures from a wide variety of interconnects.

==Background==
PICMG is a leading standards development organization in the embedded computing industry.  Members work collaboratively to develop new specifications and enhancements to existing ones.  The members benefit from participating in standards development, gain early access to leading-edge technology, and forging relationships with thought leaders and suppliers in the industry.  

The original PICMG mission was to provide extensions to the PCI standard developed by PCI-SIG for a range of applications. The organization's collaborations eventually expanded to include a variety of interconnect technologies for industrial computing and telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PICMG|publisher=PICMG|date=2001–2013|url=http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/aboutus.htm|accessdate=2013-06-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109180438/http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/aboutus.htm|archivedate=2007-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PICMG's specifications are used in a wide variety of industries including industrial automation, military, aerospace, telecommunications, medical, gaming, transportation, physics/research, test &amp; measurement, energy, drone/robotics, and general embedded computing. 

In 2011, PICMG completed its transfer of assets from the '''Communications Platforms Trade Association''' ('''CP-TA'''). Since 2006, CP-TA had been a collaboration of communications vendors, developing [[interoperability]] testing requirements, methodologies, and procedures based on open specifications from PICMG, [[The Linux Foundation]], and the [[Service Availability Forum]]. PICMG has continued the educational and marketing outreach formerly conducted by members of the CP-TA marketing work group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlat|first=Joe|title=PICMG Completes Asset Transfer with CP-TA|publisher=PICMG|date=2011-10-25|url=http://www.picmg.org/officersadmin/NewsPDFs/PICMG_PR_CPTA_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-20}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open specifications and standards provide several benefits including multiple sources, scalability and upgrades, a large ecosystem of interoperable products, proven and tested designs, and much more.  But they should not be confused with [[Open-source_model|open source]].  The open source groups tend to focus on specific product designs where even the Gerber files, schematics, and mechanical drawings are included.  This lends itself to monochrome, commodity products with little differentiation.   Open specification/open standard groups on the other hand define focus on common interfaces for interoperable products rather than finished products.   Multiple vendors contribute to the base definitions and interfaces, but the implementation can vary greatly.  The result is a rich and diverse set of interoperable products geared for a wide range of applications.

==Specification naming convention==
For many years, PICMG used a numerical naming convention with specification being referred to as “PICMG X.YY”. Where X was used denoted differing form factors (“1” for [[Single-board computer|slot card based single board computers]], “2” for [[CompactPCI]] and “3” for [[AdvancedTCA]]) while YY was used to indicate incremental changes, option definitions or slight variation of a specification form its core specification. In 2003, PICMG added an acronym-based naming convention for its specifications to yield better results from internet search engines. Specifications are now often named ABCD.X  where ABCD is an acronym of the specification. In this naming convention, base or main specification are denote with X=0 (i.e. ABCD.0) and PICMG subsidiary specifications are denoted X&gt;0. PICMG subsidiary specifications represent how various options or variations of a based specification should be handled.

A '''rat-tail splice''', also known as a '''twist splice''' or a '''pig-tail splice''', is a very basic electrical splice that can be done with both [[solid wire|solid]] and [[stranded wire]]. It is made by taking two or more bare wires and wrapping them together [[symmetry|symmetrically]] around the common axis of both wires. The bare splice can be insulated with electrical tape or other means.

This common and simple splice is not very strong mechanically. It can be made stronger by coating it with [[solder]], or it can be twisted and then held in place by the internal metal spring or threads of a [[twist-on wire connector]], also called a wire nut. Because it is not very strong, the splice is not meant to connect wires that will be pulled or stressed. Rather, it is intended for wires that are protected inside an enclosure or [[junction box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=John MacLaren|title=Practical Electric Wiring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i41RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1916|publisher=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6893">'''Scaffolding''', as used in computing, refers to one of two techniques: The first is a code generation technique related to database access in some [[model–view–controller]] [[software framework|framework]]s; the second is a project generation technique supported by various tools.

==Code generation==
Scaffolding is a technique supported by some [[model–view–controller]] [[software framework|framework]]s, in which the programmer can specify how the application database may be used. The [[compiler]] or framework uses this specification, together with pre-defined code templates, to generate the final code that the application can use to [[create, read, update and delete]] database entries, effectively treating the templates as a "[[scaffolding|scaffold]]" on which to build a more powerful application.

Scaffolding is an evolution of database code generators from earlier development environments, such as Oracle's CASE Generator, and many other [[fourth-generation programming language|4GL]] client-server software development products.

Scaffolding was made popular by the [[Ruby on Rails]] framework. It has been adapted to other software frameworks, including [[OutSystems|OutSystems Platform]], [[Express.js|Express Framework]], [[Play framework]], [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[web2py]], [[MonoRail (software)|MonoRail]], Brail, [[Symfony]], [[Laravel]], [[CodeIgniter]], [[Yii]], [[CakePHP]], [[Phalcon (framework)|Phalcon PHP]], [[Model-Glue]], [[PRADO (framework)|PRADO]], [[Grails (framework)|Grails]], [[Catalyst (software)|Catalyst]], [[Mojolicious]], [[JBoss Seam|Seam Framework]], [[Spring Roo]], [[JHipster]], [[ASP.NET Dynamic Data]], KumbiaPHP and [[ASP.NET MVC]] framework's Metadata Template Helpers.

===Run time vs Design time Scaffolding===
Scaffolding can occur at two different phases of the [[Program lifecycle phase|program lifecycle]]: [[design time]] and [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. Design time scaffolding produces files of code that can later be modified by the programmer to customize the way the application database is used. However, for [[Programming in the large|large-scale applications]] this approach may be difficult to maintain due to the sheer number of files produced, and the fact that the design of the files was largely fixed when they were [[Copy and paste programming|generated or copied]] from the original templates.  Alternatively, run time scaffolding produces code on the fly.  It allows changes to the design of the templates to be immediately reflected throughout the application.  But modifying the design of the templates may be more difficult or impractical in the case of run time scaffolding.

===Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails===
When the line &lt;code&gt;scaffold :''model_name''&lt;/code&gt; is added to a [[Ruby on Rails#Controller|controller]], Rails will automatically generate all of the appropriate data interfaces at run time.  Since the API is generated on the fly, the programmer cannot easily modify the interfaces generated this way.  Such a simple scaffold is often used for [[prototyping]] applications and entering test data into a database.

The programmer may also run an external command to generate Ruby code for the scaffold in advance: &lt;code&gt;rails generate scaffold ''model_name''&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; script will produce files of Ruby code that the application can use to interact with the database.  It is somewhat less convenient than dynamic scaffolding, but gives the programmer the flexibility of modifying and customizing the generated APIs.

'''Note:''' As of Rails 2.0, dynamic scaffolding is no longer stored.

===Server side vs Client side Scaffolding===
Scaffolding techniques based on the application database typically involve [[Web development#Server side coding|Server side]] frameworks. Server side web frameworks commonly perform operations directly against database entries, and code generation for these operations may be considered '''Server side Scaffolding'''. Alternatively, [[Web development#Client side coding|Client side]] development often uses [[Single-page application#JavaScript Frameworks|frameworks]] that perform [[Single-page application#Data transport .28XML.2C JSON and AJAX.29|data transport]] operations instead of directly accessing the database. The focus of '''Client side Scaffolding''' is thus more on [[Yeoman (computing)|generating a starter template]] for the application as a whole, rather than generating code to access a database.

Some Client side web frameworks, such as [[Meteor (web framework)|Meteor]], allow the client to perform database operations in a manner similar to Server side frameworks. In this case, Scaffolding techniques can go beyond merely generating a starter template. They can perform [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]] scaffolding of web forms on the [[Web development#Client side coding|Client side]] to [[create, read, update and delete]] database entries. One example of this is provided by an add-on to [[Meteor (web framework)|Meteor]] called aldeed:autoform [https://atmospherejs.com/aldeed/autoform].

==Project generation==
Complicated software projects often share certain conventions on project structure and requirements. For example, they often have separate folders for [[source code]], [[binary files|binaries]] and [[software testing|code tests]], as well as files containing [[license agreement]]s, [[release note]]s and contact information. To simplify the creation of projects following those conventions, "scaffolding" tools can automatically generate them at the beginning of each project. Such tools include [[Yeoman (computing)|Yeoman]] and [[Rust (programming language)|Cargo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4298">[[File:US Army spike strip.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldier deploying a stinger at a vehicle checkpoint in [[Iraq]]]]
A '''spike strip''' (also known as '''traffic spikes''', '''tire shredders''', '''[[one-way traffic]] treadles''', '''stingers''', '''stop sticks''', a '''stinger''' in police slang, and formally known as a '''tire deflation device''') is a device or [[weapon]] used to impede or stop the movement of wheeled vehicles by puncturing their [[tire]]s. Generally, the strip is composed of a collection of 35 to 75&amp;nbsp;mm (1.5 to 3 inches) long metal [[wikt:barb|barbs]], teeth or spikes pointing upward. The spikes are designed to puncture and flatten tires when a vehicle is driven over them; they may be detachable, with new spikes fitted to the strip after use. The spikes may be hollow or solid; hollow ones are designed to detach and become embedded in the tires, allowing air to escape at a steady rate to reduce the risk of the driver losing control and crashing. One type was co-invented by Donald Kilgrow, a retired [[Utah Highway Patrol]] trooper, along with a design engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jonathan|last=Beard|title=Technology: Spikes end chases with a hiss not a bang|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13117833.700-technology-spikes-end-chases-with-a-hiss-not-a-bang.html|newspaper=New scientist|publisher= |date=24 August 1991|issue=1783|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are historically a development of the [[caltrop]], anti-cavalry and anti-personnel versions being used as early as 331 BC by Darius III against Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela in Persia.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the United States, five officers were killed deploying spike strips in 2011 alone. [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] police are among those banned from using them, in response to the hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20120607-dallas-police-ban-use-of-spike-strips-that-can-halt-fleeing-vehicles.ece Dallas police ban use of spike strips that can halt fleeing vehicles | Dallas Morning News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Remotely deployable spike strips have been invented to reduce the danger to police officers deploying them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynaspike.com/ DynaSpike Remote Control Spike System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Spike strips are also built into some parking barriers to control traffic flow.

Private possession of spike strips was banned in [[New South Wales]], Australia in 2003 after  a strip cheaply constructed from a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|steel pipe]] studded with [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] was used against a police vehicle. [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]], a member of New South Wales Legislative Assembly, stated they would be added to the New South Wales prohibited weapons list.&lt;ref name=banned&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/09/1070732212520.html?from=storyrhs Ban on home-made road spikes after car chase], The Sydney Morning Herald, December 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rise in [[Vehicle-ramming attack|terrorist vehicle attacks]] whereby a vehicle is driven at speed into pedestrians, a net with steel spikes that can be deployed by two people in less than a minute, reported able to stop a vehicle of up to 17 tonnes, was developed for preventive use at public events in the UK, with the name "Talon" (also referred to as X-Net(R), manufactured by british defence company [[QinetiQ]]). It has steel spikes to puncture tyres, and becomes entangled around the front wheels, halting the vehicle. It is designed to reduce risk to crowds by making the vehicle skid in a straight line without veering unpredictably. It was first deployed to protect a parade on 11 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-41225442 |title=Steel spiked net to tackle London vehicle terror attacks|website=BBC News|date=11 September 2017  |author= |accessdate= 11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former student Mike Ross makes a living illegally taking the [[Law School Admission Test]] for others. To pay for his grandmother's care, he agrees to deliver a case of [[marijuana]] for his best friend Trevor, a drug dealer. Mike astutely avoids being arrested in a sting, only to stumble into a job interview with Harvey Specter, called the best closer in the city.

Together they try cases for the firm while maintaining the secret that Mike is a fraud.

Jessica Pearson, managing partner, learns Mike's secret, but other issues take precedence when co-founding partner Daniel Hardman returns to the firm, pressuring Jessica and Harvey. Mike begins to foster a relationship with paralegal Rachel Zane, but finds himself pursuing other romantic entanglements after his grandmother's sudden death. Harvey and his secretary Donna face accusations of burying evidence and must discover the truth while keeping incriminating evidence from Hardman, who would use it to leverage a managing partner position. The intensifying threat from Hardman forces Jessica into a merger with a British firm headed by Edward Darby. And Mike reveals he's a fraud to Rachel.

===Season 3 (2013–14)===

Darby's presence in the firm gives Harvey leverage to seek a position as a named partner. Meanwhile, the merger causes Louis Litt to clash with his British counterpart. Darby International client Ava Hessington draws Harvey into a lengthy trial against his former mentor and, when the lawsuit turns into a murder charge, the arrest of Darby's "fixer" Stephen Huntley becomes grounds for a messy dissolution of the merger. Rachel gets accepted into law school at Columbia, and she and Mike move in together. Realizing that his fraud can't continue forever, Mike leaves newly renamed Pearson Specter to take a position as an investment banker.

When Mike is fired, Louis goes to extreme lengths to persuade Mike to come back to Pearson Specter, which put him in debt to shady billionaire investor Charles Forstman. Louis demands a name partner position, competing with Harvey, but his wrongdoings get him fired instead. When he realizes Mike never went to Harvard, he blackmails Jessica into rehiring him with the promotion he desired. Mike proposes to Rachel; Donna leaves Harvey to work for Louis.

{{main|Suits (season 5)}}
&lt;!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. --&gt;
Harvey struggles with losing Donna and begins to open up to a therapist about his broken relationship with his mother. Louis' insecurity, however, and desire to undermine Harvey create an opening for Jack Soloff, an ambitious partner who is being manipulated by Hardman. Rachel's wedding plans and her relationship with her parents are both overshadowed by Mike's secret. Mike and Harvey both resign to protect their future, but Mike is abruptly arrested for fraud. More and more people involved realize the allegations are true, and facing a tenacious Anita Gibbs, Mike accepts a plea bargain, pleads guilty, and turns himself in so that no one else will go to jail. At the wedding, Mike tells Rachel that he will not marry her now but if she still wants him in two years then he will marry her after getting out of prison. Harvey escorts him to prison making their last few goodbyes.

===Season 6 (2016–17)===
{{main|Suits (season 6)}}
&lt;!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP: TVPLOT. --&gt;

Rachel works an [[Innocence Project]] case for her law professor; Jessica assists pro bono but is distracted from matters at the firm, and chooses to leave her position to pursue her own life. Mike's cellmate proves pivotal in a deal for Mike's freedom. He struggles with his fraud being public knowledge but obtains a job at a legal clinic.

''Suits'' first appeared on USA network's development slate under the title ''A Legal Mind'' in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/04/05/usa-network-announces-slate-of-character-driven-projects-for-2010-2011-35192/20100405usa01/|title=USA Network Announces Slate of "Character" Driven Projects for 2010-2011|date=April 5, 2010|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2010, USA announced that it was developing seven new pilots for its 2010–2011 television season, including ''A Legal Mind'', which would later become ''Suits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: More USA Summer Premieres: "Burn Notice," "Suits" on Thursday, June 23; "Royal Pains," "Necessary Roughness" on Wednesday, June 29|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/04/08/exclusive-more-usa-summer-premieres-burn-notice-suits-on-thursday-june-23-royal-pains-necessary-roughness-on-wednesday-june-29-379314/9215/|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=August 9, 2012|date=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate Announcement Futon Critic"/&gt;  The premiere was written by [[Aaron Korsh]], and David Bartis and Gene Klein served as executive producers.&lt;ref name="Slate Announcement Futon Critic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/04/05/usa-network-announces-slate-of-character-driven-projects-for-2010-2011-35192/20100405usa01/|title=USA Network Announces Slate of "Character" Driven Projects for 2010-2011| publisher=The Futon Critic | date=April 5, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate Announcement TV Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/USA-Networks-Fall-1016948.aspx |title=USA Network's Fall Slate Includes Modern-Day Robin Hood, Steve Carell-Produced Dramedy | publisher=[[TV Guide]] | date=April 5, 2010| accessdate=August 7, 2012 |author=Abrams, Natalie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later announced on May 17, 2010, that USA ordered a ninety-minute cast-contingent pilot for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development Update: Monday, May 17|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/05/17/development-update-monday-may-17-35749/8687/|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=August 9, 2012|date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The network later picked up ''A Legal Mind'' on January 19, 2011, and ordered eleven one-hour episodes in addition to the 90-minute pilot.&lt;ref name="Picked Up Deadline.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/usa-picks-up-two-new-series/ |title=USA Network Picks Up Two New Series |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=January 19, 2011 | accessdate=August 7, 2012 |author=Andreeva, Nellie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/01/19/usa-flexes-programming-muscle-with-new-original-scripted-series-a-legal-mind-and-necessary-roughness-943213/20110119usa02/|title=USA Flexes Programming Muscle With New Original Scripted Series "A Legal Mind" and "Necessary Roughness"| publisher=The Futon Critic| date=January 19, 2011 | accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creator [[Aaron Korsh]], whose ''[[Notes from the Underbelly]]'' sitcom was canceled during the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–2008 Writers' strike]], wrote a [[spec script]] intended to be a "half-hour ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''-type based on my experiences working on [[Wall Street]]." He later realized that the project should have hour-long episodes.  Korsh and his agent took the script to several production companies and wanted to give the script to [[Universal Media Studios]].  However, Korsh found it odd that the studio did not want to sell the script to [[NBC]], the network the studio typically worked with.  Korsh's agent convinced USA Network executive Alex Sepiol that although the series was neither a [[Procedural (genre)|procedural]] nor what the network typically did, he would like the characters.  Sepiol approved of the script, and by then, Hypnotic Films &amp; Television signed on to the project.  The team pitched the script to USA network, which bought the script after the pitch. Korsh did not pitch it to anyone else.  When rewriting the script, Korsh made only small changes to the first half-hour, up to when Mike is hired.  Originally, Mike did not take [[LSAT]]s for others and only pretends to have attended Harvard, as opposed to pretending he attended Harvard and has a law degree.  Korsh noted that there is no degree or test needed, to work on Wall Street and be a mathematical genius, unlike the [[bar examination]] in law.  He decided to "embrace" this difference and change the premise.&lt;ref name="Korsh Interview THR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title='Suits' Originally Set on Wall Street Before Getting Retooled for USA, Says Creator|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/suits-originally-set-wall-street-205066|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 9, 2012|date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deleted scene leaked onto YouTube shows [[Victor Garber]] as Phillip Hardman, originally part of the pilot, but was ultimately cut during script rewrites. It shows that Hardman had retired from the firm on his own accord. Despite being cut for American audiences, the scene was left in for British viewers when it was first aired, and the scene continues to be included in re-runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PycZiDc9WKQ|title=Suits Deleted Scene - Jessica Pearson and Phillip Hardman |publisher=YouTube |date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Superior multimineral process''' (also known as the '''McDowell–Wellman process''' or '''circular grate process''') is an above ground [[shale oil extraction]] technology designed for production of [[shale oil]], a type of [[synthetic crude]] oil. The process heats [[oil shale]] in a sealed horizontal segmented vessel ([[retort]]) causing its decomposition into shale oil, [[oil shale gas]] and [[Spent shale|spent residue]]. The particularities of this process is a recovery of saline [[mineral]]s from the oil shale, and a doughnut-shape of the retort.  The process is suitable for processing of mineral-rich oil shales, such as in the [[Piceance Basin]]. It has a relatively high reliability and high oil yield. The technology was developed by the American oil company [[Superior Oil]].

==History==
The multimineral process was developed by [[Superior Oil Company]], now part of [[ExxonMobil]], for processing of the [[Piceance Basin]]'s oil shale.&lt;ref name=lee3&gt;

The process was developed to combine the shale oil production with production of [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[sodium carbonate]], and [[aluminum]] from [[nahcolite]] and [[dawsonite]], occurring in oil shales of the Piceance Basin.&lt;ref name=lee3/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  In this process, the nahcolite is recovered from the raw oil shale by crushing it to lumps smaller than  {{convert|8|in|mm}}. As a result, most of the nahcolite in the oil shale becomes a fine powder what could screened out.  Screened oil shale lumps are further crushed to particles smaller than {{convert|3|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;   Oil shale particles are further processed in a horizontal segmented doughnut-shaped traveling-grate retort in the direct or indirect heating mode.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=synthetic2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix/&gt;  The retort was originally designed by Davy McKee Corporation for [[iron ore]] [[pelletizing]] and it also known as the '''[[Dravo Corporation|Dravo]] retort'''.  In the direct retort, oil shale moves past [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] through which are provided hot inert gas for heating the raw oil shale, air for combustion of carbon residue (char or semi-coke) in the [[spent oil shale]], and cold inert gas for cooling the spent oil shale.&lt;ref name=synthetic2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   The oil pyrolysis takes place in the heating section. To minimize solubility of aluminium compounds in the oil shale, the heat control is a crucial factor. Necessary heat for pyrolysis is generated in the carbon recovery section by combustion of carbon residue (char or semi-coke) remained in the spent oil shale. While blowing inert gases through the spent oil shale, the spent oil shale is cooled and gases are heated to cause pyrolysis. The indirect mode is similar; the difference is that combustion of carbonaceous residue takes place in separate vessel.  The last section is for discharging of oil shale ash. [[Aluminium oxide]] and [[sodium carbonate]] are recovered from calcined dawsonite and calcined nahcolite in the oil shale ash.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

==Advantages==
The traveling-grate retort allows close temperature control, and therefore better control of dawsonite's solubility during the burning stage.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  During retorting, there is no relative movement of oil shale, which avoids dust creation, and therefore increase the quality of generated products.&lt;ref name=synthetic2/&gt;  The [[Petroleum extraction|oil recovery]] yields greater than 98% [[Fischer Assay]].  The technology has also a relatively high reliability. The sealed system of this process has environmental advantage as it prevents gas and mist leakage.&lt;ref name=BLM2008appendix&gt;

The following tables outline the '''[[utilization]] of [[biogas]] in the [[European Union]]''' as of 2006. This table is likely to change due to the increasing interest in biogas use as a [[Renewable fuels|renewable fuel]] and the [[tax]] penalties being imposed on [[energy]] or utility [[companies]] that waste biogas by burning it off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22876">The '''technological innovation system''' is a concept developed within the scientific field of [[innovation]] studies which serves to explain the nature and rate of [[technological change]].&lt;ref&gt;R.E.H.M. Smits, Innovation studies in the 21st century, Technological Forecasting and Social Change 69 (2002) 861-883.&lt;/ref&gt; A Technological Innovation System can be defined as ‘a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology’.&lt;ref&gt;B. Carlsson, R. Stankiewicz, On the Nature, Function, and Composition of Technological systems, Journal of Evolutionary Economics 1 (1991) 93-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach may be applied to at least three levels of analysis: to a '''[[technology]]''' in the sense of a knowledge field, to a '''[[Product (business)|product]] '''or an artifact, or to a set of related products and '''artifacts aimed at satisfying a particular (societal) function'''’.&lt;ref&gt;S. Jacobsson, A. Johnson, The Diffusion of Renewable Energy Technology: An Analytical Framework and Key Issues for Research, Energy Policy 28 (2000) 625-640.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the latter, the approach has especially proven itself in explaining why and how sustainable (energy) technologies have developed and diffused into a society, or have failed to do so.

== Background ==
The concept of a technological innovation system was introduced as part of a wider theoretical school, called the [[innovation system]] approach.The central idea behind this approach is that determinants of technological change are not (only) to be found in individual firms or in research institutes, but (also) in a broad societal structure in which firms, as well as knowledge institutes, are embedded.&lt;ref&gt;C. Freeman, The 'National System of Innovation' in historical perspective, Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (1995) 5-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.-Å. Lundvall, [http://www.oapen.org/download?type=document&amp;docid=626406#page=78 Innovation as an interactive process: from user-producer interaction to the national system of innovation], in: G. Dosi, C. Freeman, R. Nelson, G. Silverberg, and L. Soete (Eds.), Technical Change and Economic Theory Innovation as an interactive process: from user-producer interaction to the national system of innovation, Pinter, London, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, innovation system studies have pointed out the influence of societal structures on technological change, and indirectly on long-term economic growth, within nations, sectors or technological fields.

The purpose of analyzing a Technolo is to analyze and evaluate the development of a particular technological field in terms of the structures and processes that support or hamper it. Besides its particular focus, there are two, more analytical, features that set the Technological Innovation System approach apart from other innovation system approaches.

Firstly, the technological innovaion to be built up over time. This was already put forward by Carlsson and Stankiewicz:&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘[T]echnological Innovation Systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordinary goods and services. They consist of dynamic knowledge and competence networks. In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass, such networks can be transformed into development blocks, i.e. synergistic clusters of firms and technologies within an industry or a group of industries.’&lt;ref&gt;B. Carlsson, R. Stankiewicz, On the Nature, Function, and Composition of Technological systems, Journal of Evolutionary Economics 1 (1991) 93-118; page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This means that a Technological Innovation System may be analyzed in terms of its system components and/or in terms of its dynamics. Both perspectives will be explained below.

== Structures ==
The system components of a Technological Innovation System are called structures. These represent the static aspect of the system, as they are relatively stable over time. Three basic categories are distinguished:

* '''[[Actor (policy debate)|Actors]]: ''' Actors involve organizations contributing to a technology, as a developer or adopter, or indirectly as a regulator, financier, etc. It is the actors of a Technological Innovation System that, through choices and actions, actually generate, diffuse and utilize technologies. The potential variety of relevant actors is enormous, ranging from private actors to public actors, and from technology developers to technology adopters. The development of a Technological Innovation System will depend on the interrelations between all these actors. For example, entrepreneurs are unlikely to start investing in their businesses if governments are unwilling to support them financially. Visa-verse, governments have no clue where financial support is necessary if entrepreneurs do not provide them with the information and the arguments they need to legitimate policy support.
* '''[[Institution]]s: ''' Institutional structures are at the core of the innovation system concept.&lt;ref&gt;C. Edquist, B. Johnson, Institutions and organizations in systems of innovation, in: C. Edquist (Eds.), Systems of Innovation - Technologies, Institutions and Organizations Institutions and organizations in systems of innovation, Pinter, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to consider institutions as ‘the rules of the game in a society, or, more formally, (...) the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction’.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. North, Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance, Cambridge University Press, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can be made between formal institutions and informal institutions, with formal institutions being the rules that are codified and enforced by some authority, and informal institutions being more tacit and organically shaped by the collective interaction of actors. Informal institutions can be normative or cognitive. The normative rules are social norms and values with moral significance, whereas cognitive rules can be regarded as collective mind frames, or social paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Scott, Institutions and Organizations, Sage Publications, London, UK, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formal institutions are government laws and policy decisions; firm directives or contracts also belong to this category. An example of a normative rule is the responsibility felt by a company to prevent or clean up waste. Examples of cognitive rules are search heuristics or problem-solving routines. They also involve dominant visions and expectations held by the actors.&lt;ref&gt;H. Van Lente, Promising Technology - Dynamics of Expectations in Technological Developments (Thesis), Twente University, Enschede, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Van Lente, A. Rip, Expectations in Technological Developments: An Example of Prospective Structures to be Filled in by Agency, in: C. Disco and B. van der Meulen (Eds.), Getting New Technologies Together Expectations in Technological Developments: An Example of Prospective Structures to be Filled in by Agency, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin - New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Technological factors: ''' Technological structures consist of artefacts and the technological infrastructures in which they are integrated. They also involve the techno-economic workings of such artefacts, including costs, safety, reliability. These features are crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms between technological change and institutional change. For example, if R&amp;D subsidy schemes supporting technology development should result in improvements with regard to the safety and reliability of applications, this would pave the way for more elaborate support schemes, including practical demonstrations. These may, in turn, benefit technological improvements even more. It should, however, be noted here that the importance of technological features has often been neglected by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;R.A.A. Suurs, Motors of sustainable innovation. Towards a theory on the dynamics of technological innovation systems (Thesis), Utrecht University, Utrecht, 2009 p. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structural factors are merely the elements that make up the system. In an actual system, these factors are all linked to each other. If they form dense configurations they are called networks. An example would be a coalition of firms jointly working on the application of a fuel cell, guided by a set of problem-solving routines and supported by a subsidy program. Likewise, industry associations, research communities, policy networks, user-supplier relations etc. are all examples of networks.

An analysis of structures typically yields insight into systemic features - complementarities and conflicts - that constitute drivers and barriers for technology diffusion at a certain moment or within a given period in time.

== Dynamics ==
Structures involve elements that are relatively stable over time. Nevertheless, for many technologies, especially newly emerging ones, these structures are not yet (fully) in place. For this reason, mostly, the scholars have recently enriched the literature on Technological Innovation Systems with studies that focus on the build-up of structures over time. The central idea of this approach is to consider all activities that contribute to the development, diffusion, and use of innovations as system functions.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bergek, Shaping and Exploiting Technological Opportunities: The Case of Renewable Energy Technology in Sweden (Thesis), Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg, Sweden, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These system functions are to be understood as types of activities that influence the build-up of a Technological Innovation System. Each system function may be ‘fulfilled’ in a variety of ways. The premise is that, in order to properly develop, the system should positively fulfil all system functions. Various ‘lists’ of system functions have been constructed. Authors like Bergek et al.,&lt;ref&gt;A. Bergek, S. Jacobsson, B. Carlsson, S. Lindmark, A. Rickne, Analyzing the functional dynamics of technological innovation systems: A scheme of analysis, Research Policy 37 (2008) 407-429.&lt;/ref&gt; Hekkert et al.,&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Hekkert, R.A.A. Suurs, S.O. Negro, S. Kuhlmann, R.E.H.M. Smits, Functions of Innovation systems: A new approach for analyzing technological change, Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 74 (2007) 413-432.&lt;/ref&gt; Negro&lt;ref&gt;S.O. Negro, Dynamics of Technological Innovation Systems - The case of biomass energy (Thesis), Utrecht University, Utrecht, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Suurs&lt;ref&gt;R.A.A. Suurs, Motors of sustainable innovation. Towards a theory on the dynamics of technological innovation systems (Thesis), Utrecht University, Utrecht, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; give useful overviews. These lists show much overlap and differences reside mostly in the particular way of clustering activities. An example of such a list is provided below.

Note that it is also possible that activities negatively contribute to a system function. These negative contributions imply a (partial) breakdown of the system. In particular, domestic instability has been shown to exert downward pressure on innovation systems, while international threats and national security alliances have a significantly positive effect on national innovative performance.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmid, M. Brummer, MZ Taylor, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ropr.12244/full Innovation and Alliances], Review of Policy Research (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seven system functions ===
As an example, the seven system functions defined by Hekkert are explained here:

* '''F1. Entrepreneurial activities: ''' The classic role of the entrepreneur is to translate knowledge into business opportunities, and eventually innovations. The entrepreneur does this by performing market-oriented experiments that establish change, both to the emerging technology and to the institutions that surround it. The Entrepreneurial Activities involve projects aimed to prove the usefulness of the emerging technology in a practical and/or commercial environment. Such projects typically take the form of experiments and demonstrations.
* '''F2. Knowledge development: ''' The Knowledge Development function involves learning activities, mostly on the emerging technology, but also on markets, networks, users etc. There are various types of learning activities, the most important categories being learning-by-searching and learning-by-doing. The former concerns [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] activities in basic science, whereas the latter involves learning activities in a practical context, for example in the form of laboratory experiments or adoption trials.
* '''F3. Knowledge diffusion / knowledge exchange through networks: ''' The characteristic organization structure of a Technological Innovation System is that of the network. The primary function of networks is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between all the actors involved in it. Knowledge Diffusion activities involve partnerships between actors, for example technology developers, but also meetings like workshops and conferences. The important role of Knowledge Diffusion stems from Lundvall’s notion of interactive learning as the raison-d’être of any innovation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lundvall | first = Bengt-Åke | contribution = Innovation as an interactive process: from user-producer interaction to the national system of innovation | editor-last1 = Dosi | editor-first1 = Giovanni | editor-last2 = Freeman | editor-first2 = Christopher | editor-last3 = Nelson | editor-first3 = Richard R. | editor-last4 = Silverberg | editor-first4 = Gerald | editor-last5 = Soete | editor-first5 = Luc  | title = Technical change and economic theory | pages = 349–369 | publisher = Pinter Publishers | location = London New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780861878949 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The innovation system approach stresses that innovation happens only where actors of different backgrounds interact. A special form of interactive learning is learning-by-using, which involves learning activities based on the experience of users of technological innovations, for example through user-producer interactions.
* '''F4. Guidance of the search: ''' The Guidance of the Search function refers to activities that shape the needs, requirements and expectations of actors with respect to their (further) support of the emerging technology. Guidance of the Search refers to individual choices related to the technology but it may also take the form of hard institutions, for example policy targets. It also refers to promises and expectations as expressed by various actors in the community. Guidance of the Search can be positive or negative. A positive Guidance of the Search means a convergence of positive signals - expectations, promises, policy directives - in a particular direction of technology development. If negative, there will be a digression, or, even worse, a rejection of development altogether. This convergence is important since, usually, various technological options exist within an emerging technological field, all of which require investments in order to develop further. Since resources are usually limited, it is important that specific foci are chosen. After all, without any focus there will be a dilution of resources, preventing all options from prospering. On the other hand, too much focus may result in the loss of variety. A healthy Technological Innovation System will strike a balance between creating and reducing variety.
* '''F5. Market formation: ''' Emerging technologies cannot be expected to compete with incumbent technologies. In order to stimulate innovation, it is usually necessary to create artificial (niche) markets. The Market Formation function involves activities that contribute to the creation of a demand for the emerging technology, for example by financially supporting the use of the emerging technology, or by taxing the use of competing technologies. Market Formation is especially important in the field of sustainable energy technologies, since, in this case, there usually is a strong normative legitimation for the intervention in market dynamics.
* '''F6. Resource mobilization: ''' Resource Mobilization refers to the allocation of financial, material and human capital. The access to such capital factors is necessary for all other developments. Typical activities involved in this system function are investments and subsidies. They can also involve the deployment of generic infrastructures such as educational systems, large R&amp;D facilities or refueling infrastructures. In some cases, the mobilization of natural resources, such as biomass, oil or natural gas is important as well. The Resource Mobilization function represents a basic economic variable. Its importance is obvious: an emerging technology cannot be supported in any way if there are no financial or natural means, or if there are no actors present with the right skills and competences.
* '''F7. Support from advocacy coalitions: ''' The rise of an emerging technology often leads to resistance from actors with interests in the incumbent energy system. In order for a Technological Innovation System to develop, other actors must counteract this inertia. This can be done by urging authorities to reorganize the institutional configuration of the system. The Support from Advocacy Coalitions function involves political lobbies and advice activities on behalf of interest groups. This system function may be regarded as a special form of Guidance of the Search. After all, lobbies and advices are pleas in favor of particular technologies. The essential feature which sets this category apart is that advocacy coalitions do not have the power, like for example governments, to change formal institutions directly. Instead, they employ the power of persuasion. The notion of the advocacy coalition is based on the work of Sabatier, who introduced the idea within the context of political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sabatier | first = Paul A. | title = The advocacy coalition framework: revisions and relevance for Europe | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–130 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501768880000051 | date = March 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501768880000051 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept stresses the idea that structural change within a system is the outcome of competing interest groups, each representing a separate system of values and ideas. The outcome is determined by political power.

=== Cumulative causation ===
Since Carlsson and Stankiewicz introduced the concept of a Technological Innovation System, an increasing number of scholars have started focusing on dynamics. A recurring theme within their studies has been the notion of cumulative causation, closely related to the idea of a [[virtuous circle]] or [[vicious circle]], by [[Gunnar Myrdal]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Myrdal, Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions, Methuen &amp; Co LTD, London, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, cumulative causation is the phenomenon that the build-up of a Technological Innovation System accelerates due to system functions interacting and reinforcing each other over time. For example, the successful realization of a research project, contributing to Knowledge Development, may result in high expectations, contributing to Guidance of the Search, among policy makers, which may, subsequently, trigger the start-up of a subsidy program, contributing to Resource Mobilization, which induces even more research activities: Knowledge Development, Guidance of the Search, etc. System functions may also reinforce each other ‘downwards’. In that case interactions result in conflicting developments or a vicious circle! Recently scholars have increasingly paid attention to the question of how cumulative causation may be established, often with a particular focus on the development of sustainable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;R.A.A. Suurs, Motors of sustainable innovation. Towards a theory on the dynamics of technological innovation systems (Thesis), Utrecht University, Utrecht, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquiring new technologies and capabilities ===

To improve competitiveness and retain sustainability, firms require new technologies and capabilities. In this age of rapid innovation and complexity, it is challenging for the firms to develop internally and remain competitive at the same time. Merger, acquisition and alliance are some of the ways to achieve this, but the primary driver is the desire to obtain valuable resources. Many acquisitions failed to achieve their objectives and resulted in poor performance because of improper implementation.

1.	Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition.

2.	For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence.

3.	Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing.

4.	Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise.

5.	Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation. The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition.

Preservation of tacit knowledge, employees and literature are always delicate during and after acquisition. Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisition.

Increase in acquisitions in our global business environment has pushed us to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation. It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage. Retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence.

Template-guided self-assembly is a versatile fabrication process that can arrange various micrometer to nanometer sized particles into lithographically created template with defined patterns. The process contain the following four steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|last5=|first5=|date=2013-07-03|title=Tailoring Plasmon Coupling in Self-Assembled One-Dimensional Au Nanoparticle Chains through Simultaneous Control of Size and Gap Separation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jz401066g|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters|volume=4|issue=13|pages=2147–2152|doi=10.1021/jz401066g|issn=1948-7185|pmc=3766581|pmid=24027605|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=2016-05-01|title=Assembling Color on the Nanoscale: Multichromatic Switchable Pixels from Plasmonic Atoms and Molecules|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201506179/abstract|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=18|pages=3522–3527|doi=10.1002/adma.201506179|issn=1521-4095|pmc=4939277|pmid=26990416|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Create Template ==
The "template" can be created by either [[photolithography]] or [[Electron-beam lithography|e-beam lithography]] to define binding sites for various building blocks. The binding sites should reflect the foot print of the building blocks or clusters to be bound.

== Surface Treatment ==
After film development, the created pattern is treated with charged polymers in order to “stick” the particles. Take poly-lysine as an example, the poly-lysine will cover the negatively charged glass surface and turn the charge to be positive; it thus can non-specifically bind negatively charged metallic nanoparticles.

== Particle Assembly ==
To do particle assembly, treated pattern is submerged in a small amount of aqueous solution of particles. A few approaches can be used to facilitate the binding efficiency. One of them is to use capillary force at the edge of the aqueous droplet to “push” the particles into the binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2014-02-01|title=Rational Assembly of Optoplasmonic Hetero-nanoparticle Arrays with Tunable Photonic–Plasmonic Resonances|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201301837/abstract|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=739–746|doi=10.1002/adfm.201301837|issn=1616-3028|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If assembling multiple types of particles, the particles should be assembled in the order of decreasing sizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, if assembling both 60&amp;nbsp;nm gold nanoparticles as well as 40&amp;nbsp;nm silver nanoparticles, 60&amp;nbsp;nm gold nanoparticles should be applied first because it is too big to enter binding sites tailored for 40&amp;nbsp;nm particles. Rationally design the binding sequence as well as the binding site sizes can minimize the binding errors from occurring.

== Remove Template ==
After binding of all building blocks, the template can be removed by either dissolving in an organic solvent, or stripped off by a scotch tape.

'''Transient photocurrent''' (TPC) is a measurement technique, typically employed in the [[physics]] of [[thin film]] [[semiconductors]]. TPC allows to study the time-dependent (on a [[microsecond]] time scale) extraction of [[Carrier generation and recombination|charges]] generated by [[photovoltaic effect]] in [[semiconductor]] devices, such as [[solar cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=Christopher|last2=Inchan|first2=Hwang|last3=Neil|first3=Greenham|title=Photocurrent transients in all-polymer solar cells: Trapping and detrapping effects|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=106|page=024507|doi=10.1063/1.3177337|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/106/2/10.1063/1.3177337|bibcode = 2009JAP...106b4507M }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:TPC light off.jpg|thumb|TPC plot in light off position]]

A [[semiconductor]] is sandwiched between two extracting [[electrodes]]. When it is excited with a short pulse of [[light]] (as short as 100 [[femtoseconds]]), the photogenerated charges are extracted on the electrodes, resulting in a current, which is detected by an [[oscilloscope]] in form of [[voltage]] across a [[resistor]]. Since the excitation pulse is square, there are two ways to measure TPC: in a “light on” and a “light off” positions. In a “Light on”, the signal is recorded as soon as the excitation pulse is switched on, allowing to observe the build-up of charges on the electrode after the start of excitation. “Light off” measurements show how the charges decay after the pulse is switched off.

In contrast to [[transient photovoltage]], TPC measurements are conducted under [[short circuit]] condition and yield information about extractable charges, charge [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] and [[density of states]]. Quite often, TPC measurements help to build “[[Convection–diffusion equation|drift-diffusion]]” model which reflects trapping and detrapping of the photogenerated charges and the quality of contact between different layers.

TPC allows varying different measurement parameters, such as intensity or length of the light pulse, applied voltage, etc.

Silky Curler '''Twink''' by Elida was a popular brand of [[Permanent wave|home perm kit]] that was available in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the late 1960s and 1970s, retailing for about 37 pence. It was promoted using full-page advertisements in women's magazines, such as the leading title ''Woman'', and became a household name. Like some other such kits, its use could produce a strong odour of chemicals in the hair that some found unpleasant. The fashion for home perming subsequently ended and the brand has long since ceased being produced. However, the brand still evokes a sense of nostalgia in some who remember it from their youth and examples of its packaging can be collectors items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The British musician and actor [[Twink (musician)|Twink]], born John Charles Alder, is said to have taken his stage name from the product.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Vapor-compression refrigeration''' or '''vapor-compression refrigeration system''' ('''VCRS'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Y.V.C. Rao|title=An Introduction to Thermodynamics|edition=2nd|publisher=Universities Press|year=2003|isbn=978-81-7371-461-0|url=http://universitiespress.com/display.asp?categoryID=0&amp;isbn=978-81-7371-461-0&amp;detail=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[refrigerant]] undergoes [[Phase transition|phase change]]s, is one of the many [[refrigeration cycle]]s and is the most widely used method for [[air conditioning|air-conditioning]] of buildings and automobiles. It is also used in domestic and commercial refrigerators, large-scale warehouses for chilled or frozen storage of foods and meats, refrigerated trucks and railroad cars, and a host of other commercial and industrial services. [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[Chemical plant|chemical]] processing plants, and [[natural gas processing]] plants are among the many types of industrial plants that often utilize large vapor-compression refrigeration systems.

Refrigeration may be defined as lowering the temperature of an enclosed space by removing heat from that space and transferring it elsewhere.  A device that performs this function may also be called an [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]], [[refrigerator]], [[air source heat pump]], [[geothermal heat pump]] or chiller ([[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|heat pump]]).

==Description of the vapor-compression refrigeration system==
[[Image:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor compression refrigeration]]

The vapor-compression uses a circulating liquid [[refrigerant]] as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere.  Figure 1 depicts a typical, single-stage vapor-compression system.  All such systems have four components: a [[gas compressor|compressor]], a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], a [[thermal expansion valve]] (also called a [[throttle]] valve or metering device), and an evaporator. Circulating refrigerant enters the compressor in the thermodynamic state known as a [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated vapor]]&lt;ref&gt;Saturated vapors and saturated liquids are vapors and liquids at their [[saturation temperature]] and [[saturation pressure]].HELL YEAH PEOPLE A superheated vapor is at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature corresponding to its pressure.&lt;/ref&gt; and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well.  The hot, compressed vapor is then in the thermodynamic state known as a superheated vapor and it is at a temperature and pressure at which it can be [[Condensation|condensed]] with either cooling water or cooling air flowing across the coil or tubes. This is where the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the rejected heat is carried away by either the water or the air (whichever may be the case).

[[File:refrigeration PV diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A fictitious pressure-volume diagram for a typical refrigeration cycle]]

The condensed liquid refrigerant, in the thermodynamic state known as a [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated liquid]], is next routed through an expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure.  That pressure reduction results in the adiabatic [[flash evaporation]] of a part of the liquid refrigerant. The auto-refrigeration effect of the adiabatic flash evaporation lowers the temperature of the liquid and vapor refrigerant mixture to where it is colder than the temperature of the enclosed space to be refrigerated.

The cold mixture is then routed through the coil or tubes in the evaporator.  A fan circulates the warm air in the enclosed space across the coil or tubes carrying the cold refrigerant liquid and vapor mixture.  That warm air [[evaporates]] the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture. At the same time, the circulating air is cooled and thus lowers the temperature of the enclosed space to the desired temperature.  The evaporator is where the circulating refrigerant absorbs and removes heat which is subsequently rejected in the condenser and transferred elsewhere by the water or air used in the condenser.

To complete the [[refrigeration cycle]], the refrigerant vapor from the evaporator is again a saturated vapor and is routed back into the compressor.

===Refrigerants===
The selection of [[working fluids]] has a significant impact on the performance of the refrigeration cycles and as such it plays a key role when it comes to designing or simply choosing an ideal machine for a certain task. One of the most widespread refrigerant is "[[Haloalkane|Freon]]". Freon is a trade name for a family of [[haloalkane]] [[refrigerants]] manufactured by [[DuPont]] and other companies. These refrigerants were commonly used due to their superior stability and safety properties: they were not flammable at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, nor obviously toxic as were the fluids they replaced, such as [[sulfur dioxide]]. Haloalkanes are also an order(s) of magnitude more expensive than petroleum derived flammable alkanes of similar or better cooling performance. 

Unfortunately, chlorine- and fluorine-bearing refrigerants reach the upper atmosphere when they escape. In the [[stratosphere]], CFCs break up due to [[UV]] radiation, releasing their chlorine free radicals. These chlorine free radicals act as [[catalyst]]s in the breakdown of ozone through chain reactions. One CFC molecule can cause thousands of ozone molecules to break down. This causes severe damage to the [[ozone layer]] that shields the Earth's surface from the Sun's strong UV radiation, and has been shown to lead to increased rates of skin cancer. The chlorine will remain active as a catalyst until and unless it binds with another particle, forming a stable molecule. CFC refrigerants in common but receding usage include R-11 and R-12. 

Newer refrigerants with reduced [[ozone depletion]] effect such as [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], used in most homes today) and [[Hydrofluorocarbon|HFC]]s ([[R-134a]], used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs in turn are being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), such as [[R-410A]], which lack [[chlorine]].  However, CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs all have large [[global warming potential]].

More benign refrigerants are currently the subject of research, such as [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] [[carbon dioxide]], known as [[R-744]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/knowledge/faq r744.com – Everything R744], The Natural Refrigerant R744 (CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2006–2012&lt;/ref&gt; These have similar efficiencies{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} compared to existing CFC and HFC based compounds, and have many orders of magnitude lower global warming potential.

==Thermodynamic analysis of the system==
[[Image:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Temperature–Entropy diagram]]

The [[thermodynamics]] of the vapor compression cycle can be analyzed on a temperature versus [[entropy]] diagram as depicted in Figure 2. At point 1 in the diagram, the circulating refrigerant enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a saturated vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is [[isentropic process|isentropically]] compressed (compressed at constant entropy) and exits the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a [[Superheating|superheated vapor]].

From point 2 to point 3, the vapor travels through part of the condenser which removes the superheat by cooling the vapor. Between point 3 and point 4, the vapor travels through the remainder of the condenser and is condensed into a saturated liquid. The condensation process occurs at essentially constant pressure.

Between points 4 and 5, the saturated liquid refrigerant passes through the expansion valve and undergoes an abrupt decrease of pressure. That process results in the adiabatic flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of a portion of the liquid (typically, less than half of the liquid flashes).  The adiabatic flash evaporation process is [[isenthalpic]] (occurs at constant [[enthalpy]]).

Between points 5 and 1, the cold and partially vaporized refrigerant travels through the coil or tubes in the evaporator where it is totally vaporized by the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) that a fan circulates across the coil or tubes in the
evaporator. The evaporator operates at essentially constant pressure and boils off all available liquid there after adding 4–8 [[kelvin]]s of superheat to the refrigerant as a safeguard for the compressor as it cannot pump liquid.
The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the [[gas compressor|compressor]] inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.

It should be noted that the above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle which does not take into account real world items like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight internal irreversibility during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or non-ideal gas behavior (if any).

==Types of gas compressors==
{{Main|Gas compressor}}

The most common compressors used in chillers are [[Reciprocating compressor|reciprocating]], [[Rotary screw compressor|rotary screw]], [[Centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]], and [[scroll compressor]]s. Each application prefers one or another due to size, noise, efficiency and pressure issues. Compressors are often described as being either open, [[hermetic seal|hermetic]], or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and/or motor is situated in relation to the refrigerant being compressed. Variations of motor/compressor types can lead to the following configurations:
* Hermetic motor, hermetic compressor
* Hermetic motor, semi-hermetic compressor
* Open motor (belt driven or close coupled), hermetic compressor
* Open motor (belt driven or close coupled), semi-hermetic compressor

Typically in hermetic, and most semi-hermetic compressors (sometimes known as accessible hermetic compressors), the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the refrigerant system. The motor is hermetic and is designed to operate, and be cooled by, the refrigerant being compressed. The obvious disadvantage of hermetic motor compressors is that the motor drive cannot be maintained in situ, and the entire compressor must be removed if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt out windings can contaminate whole refrigeration systems requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the refrigerant replaced.

An open compressor has a motor drive which is outside of the refrigeration system, and provides drive to the compressor by means of an input shaft with suitable gland seals. Open compressor motors are typically air-cooled and can be fairly easily exchanged or repaired without degassing of the refrigeration system. The disadvantage of this type of compressor is a failure of the shaft seals, leading to loss of refrigerant.

Open motor compressors are generally easier to cool (using ambient air) and therefore tend to be simpler in design and more reliable, especially in high pressure applications where compressed gas temperatures can be very high. However the use of liquid injection for additional cooling can generally overcome this issue in most hermetic motor compressors.

===Reciprocating compressors===
[[Image:Kompresors.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Reciprocating compressor]]
{{Main|Reciprocating compressor}}
Reciprocating compressors are piston-style, positive displacement compressors.

===Rotary screw compressors===
[[Image:Lysholm screw rotors.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.5|Lysholm&lt;br/&gt;screw compressor]]&lt;!--[[Image:Screw_compressors.JPG|thumb|right|Figure 3: Screw Compressors]]--&gt;
{{Main|Rotary screw compressor}}
Rotary screw compressors are also positive displacement compressors. Two meshing screw-rotors rotate in opposite directions, trapping refrigerant vapor, and reducing the volume of the refrigerant along the rotors to the discharge point.

===Centrifugal compressors===
[[Image:CentrifugalFan.png|right|thumb|upright=0.5|Centrifugal principle]]
{{Main|Centrifugal compressor}}

Centrifugal compressors are dynamic compressors. These compressors raise the pressure of the refrigerant by imparting velocity or dynamic energy, using a rotating impeller, and converting it to pressure energy.

===Scroll compressors===
[[Image:Scroll_scrollcrompressor.png|thumb|right|Figure 4: Operating principle of a Scroll Compressor]]
{{Main|Scroll compressor}}
Scroll compressors are also positive displacement compressors. The refrigerant is compressed when one spiral orbits around a second stationary spiral, creating smaller and smaller pockets and higher pressures. By the time the refrigerant is discharged, it is fully pressurized.

==Compressor lubrication==
In order to lubricate the moving parts of the compressor, oil is added to the refrigerant during installation or commissioning. The type of oil may be mineral or synthetic to suit the compressor type, and also chosen so as not to react with the refrigerant type and other components in the system. In small refrigeration systems the oil is allowed to circulate throughout the whole circuit, but care must be taken to design the pipework and components such that oil can drain back under gravity to the compressor. In larger more distributed systems, especially in retail refrigeration, the oil is normally captured at an oil separator immediately after the compressor, and is in turn re-delivered, by an oil level management system, back to the compressor(s). Oil separators are not 100% efficient so system pipework must still be designed so that oil can drain back by gravity to the oil separator or compressor.

Some newer compressor technologies use [[magnetic bearing]]s and require no lubrication, for example the [[Danfoss]] Turbocor range of centrifugal compressors. Avoiding the need for oil lubrication and the design requirements and ancillaries associated with it, simplifies the design of the refrigerant system and reduces maintenance requirements.

==Control==
In simple commercial refrigeration systems the compressor is normally controlled by a simple pressure switch, with the expansion performed by a capillary tube or simple thermostatic expansion valve. In more complex systems, including multiple compressor installations, the use of electronic controls is typical, with adjustable set points to control the pressure at which compressors cut in and cut out, and temperature control by the use of electronic expansion valves.

In addition to the operational controls, separate high pressure and low pressure switches are normally utilised to provide secondary protection to the compressors and other components of the system from operating outside of safe parameters.

In more advanced electronic control systems the use of floating head pressure, and proactive suction pressure, control routines allow the compressor operation to be adjusted to accurately meet differing cooling demands whilst reducing energy consumption.

==Other features and facts of interest==
The schematic diagram of a single-stage refrigeration system shown in Figure 1 does not include other equipment items that would be provided in a large commercial or industrial vapor compression refrigeration system, such as:

* A horizontal or vertical [[pressure vessel]], equipped internally with a [[demister (vapor)|demister]],  between the evaporator and the compressor inlet to capture and remove any residual, entrained liquid in the refrigerant vapor because liquid may damage the compressor.  Such [[vapor-liquid separator]]s are most often referred to as "suction line accumulators".  (In other industrial processes, they are called "compressor suction drums" or "knockout pots".)
* Large commercial or industrial refrigeration systems may have multiple expansion valves and multiple evaporators in order to refrigerate multiple enclosed spaces or rooms. In such systems, the condensed liquid refrigerant may be routed into a pressure vessel, called a receiver, from which liquid refrigerant is withdrawn and routed through multiple pipelines to the multiple expansion valves and evaporators.
* Filter Dryers, installed before the compressors to catch any moisture or contaminants in the system and thus protect the compressors from internal damage
* Some refrigeration units may have multiple stages which requires the use of multiple compressors in various arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.siu.edu/staff1/weston/thermo/Refrigeration/VCRefrigeration.html Vapor-compression refrigeration cycles], Schematic diagrams of multi-stage units, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, 1998-11-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cooling capacity]] of refrigeration systems is often defined in units called "tons of refrigeration".  The most common definition of that unit is: 1 [[ton]] of refrigeration is the rate of heat removal required to freeze a [[short ton]] (i.e., {{nowrap|2000 [[pound (mass)|pounds]]}}, {{nowrap|907.2 kg}}) of water at {{nowrap|32 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]}} ({{nowrap|0 ⁰C}}) in {{nowrap|24 hours}}.  Based on the [[heat of fusion]] for water being 144 [[Btu]] per pound, 1 ton of refrigeration = 12,000 Btu/h = 12,660 kJ/h = {{nowrap|3.517 kW}}. Most residential air conditioning units range in capacity from about 1 to 5 tons ({{nowrap|3.5–18 kW}}) of refrigeration.

A much less common definition is: 1 [[tonne]] of refrigeration is the rate of heat removal required to freeze a [[tonne|metric ton]] (i.e., {{nowrap|1000 kg}}) of water at {{nowrap|0 [[Celsius|°C]]}} in {{nowrap|24 hours}}.  Based on the [[heat of fusion]] being {{nowrap|334.9 kJ/kg}}, 1 tonne of refrigeration = 13,954 kJ/h = {{nowrap|3.876 kW}}. As can be seen, the definition of 1 tonne of refrigeration in metric units is 10 percent larger than 1 ton of refrigeration using imperial units.

==Economic analysis==

===Advantages===
* Very mature technology.
* Relatively inexpensive.
* Can be driven directly using mechanical energy (water, car/truck motor) or with electrical energy.
* Efficient up to 60% of [[Cycle efficiency|Carnot's]] theoretical limit (as evaluated in [[ASHRAE]] testing conditions: evaporation temperature of −23.3&amp;nbsp;°C, condensing temperature of 54.4&amp;nbsp;°C, and ambient temperature of 32&amp;nbsp;°C){{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} based on some of the best commercially available compressors, as produced by manufacturers [[Danfoss]], [[Panasonic Electric Works|Matsushita]], [http://www.copeland-corp.com/ Copeland], [[Embraco]], [http://www.bristolcompressors.com/ Bristol] and [[Tecumseh Products|Tecumseh]]. However, many refrigeration systems use compressors that have lower efficiencies of between 40–55%, since the 60% efficient ones cost almost twice as much as the lower efficiency ones.

===Disadvantages===
Many systems still use [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon|HCFC]] [[refrigerant]]s, which contribute to [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the Earth's ozone layer]].  In countries adhering to the [[Montreal Protocol]], HCFCs are due to be phased out and are largely being replaced by ozone-friendly [[Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]]s.  However, systems using HFC refrigerants tend to be slightly less efficient than systems using HCFCs.  HFCs also have an extremely large [[global warming potential]], because they remain in the atmosphere for many years and trap heat more effectively than [[carbon dioxide]].

With the ultimate phasing out of HCFCs already a certainty, alternative non-[[haloalkane]] refrigerants are gaining popularity.  In particular, once-abandoned refrigerants such as [[hydrocarbons]] ([[butane]] for example) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are coming back into more extensive use. For example, [[Coca-Cola]]'s vending machines at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany used refrigeration utilizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/environmental_report2006.pdf 2006 Environmental Performance, the Coca-Cola Company] (scroll down to pdf page 6 of 9 pdf pages).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the oldest refrigerants, with excellent performance and essentially no pollution problems. However, ammonia has two disadvantages: it is toxic and it is incompatible with copper tubing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/ammonia_refrigeration/ammonia/index.html osha.gov – Ammonia Refrigeration – Properties of Ammonia], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gorrie Ice Machine.png|180px|right|thumb|Schematic of Dr. John Gorrie's 1841 mechanical ice machine.]]
In 1805, the American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed vapor-compression refrigeration cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum. Heat would be removed from the environment by recycling vaporized refrigerant, where it would move through a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] and [[Heating coil|condenser]] and would eventually revert to a liquid form in order to repeat the refrigeration process over again. However, no such refrigeration unit was built by Evans.&lt;ref name=Hempstead&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Hempstead and William E. Worthington (Editors)|title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology, Volume 2|publisher=Taylor&amp; Francis|date=2005|isbn=1-57958-464-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, an American expatriate to Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert T. Balmer|title=Modern Engineering Thermodynamic|publisher=Academic Press|date=2011|isbn=978-0-12-374996-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VC-RuN6moREC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=Jacob+Perkins+refrigeration#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, as he described in his patent:
:I am enabled to use volatile fluids for the purpose of producing the cooling or freezing of fluids, and yet at the same time constantly condensing such volatile fluids, and bringing them again into operation without waste.

His prototype system worked although it did not succeed commercially.&lt;ref name=burstall&gt;{{cite book |last = Burstall |first = Aubrey F. |year = 1965 |title = A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher = The MIT Press |isbn = 0-262-52001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar attempt was made in 1842, by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00008080&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPALL%2526s1%3D0008080.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0008080%2526RS%3DPN%2F0008080&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Improved process for the artificial production of ice", U.S. Patent Office, Patent 8080, 1851]&lt;/ref&gt; who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure. American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapor compression system that used ether.

[[Image:AppareilCarré.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ferdinand Carré]]'s ice-making device.]]
The first practical vapor compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a British journalist who had emigrated to [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/scienceworks/whatson/event/?event=562783|title=Harrison Refrigerator Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1856 patent was for a vapor compression system using ether, alcohol or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapor-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation in Australia and England.

The first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as "aqua ammonia") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carré]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineering professor at the Technological University Munich in Germany, patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876. His new process made possible using gases such as [[ammonia]], [[sulfur dioxide]] {{SO2}} and [[methyl chloride]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.

'''Velke Kostolany transmitter''' is the main transmission facility of [[Television in Slovakia|Slovakian broadcasting company]], situated north of [[Velke Kostolany]] near [[Nitra]] and also known as ''Nitra transmitter''. It was inaugurated in 1949 and is used for [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]] broadcasting. For mediumwave broadcasting a 140 metres tall [[guyed mast]] is used. Until 2003 it transmitted in the mediumwave band on 1098&amp;nbsp;kHz with [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] radiation, today the radiated power may be only fifty kilowatts.

[[Image:DRIVER - CHOCK YOUR WHEELS Sign.jpg|thumb|A sign telling truck drivers to chock their wheels.]]
'''Wheel chocks''' (or '''chocks''') are wedges of sturdy material placed closely against a vehicle's [[wheel]]s to prevent accidental movement.  Chocks are placed for safety in addition to setting the [[brakes]].  The bottom surface is sometimes coated in rubber to enhance grip with the ground.  For ease of removal, a [[rope]] may be tied to the chock or a set of two chocks.  One edge of the wedge has a concave profile to contour to the wheel and increase the force necessary to overrun the chock. Most commonly, chocks are seen on [[aircraft]] and train cars.

Automobiles usually have [[parking brake]]s on the rear wheels.  If the rear axle is jacked off the ground with only the parking brake set, the vehicle may roll on the front wheels and fall.  Chocking the front wheels prevents this mishap. Regular trailers, except for motorhomes, normally do not have parking brakes, and there is no other factory mechanism that can control rear or front rocking movement, so it’s recommended by NHSA that wheel chocks be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trailer Chocks: Things to Know |url=https://www.toolsid.com/images/bal/items/pdf/faq.pdf |date= 2018 |publisher=BAL Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For tent trailers, it is enough to install one single-tire chock. Alternatively, a tire-locking chock can be installed for trailer stability. It is recommended to use dual or triple-axle locking chocks for travel or 5th-wheel trailers.

Motorcycle and bicycle chocks are bifurcated and fit around the wheel, supporting the bike and preventing its movement.

The mining industry uses wheel chocks to protect lubrication trucks and heavy maintenance vehicles from slipping on off-road terrain when placed in Park. The huge haul trucks, which can weigh up to 450 tonnes, require a much larger wheel chock that itself will weigh almost 40 kilograms. These circumstances will benefit from urethane wheel chocks that are lightweight enough to be maneuvered, yet can withstand the responsibility of holding a truck if a brake should fail. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has established standards that wheel chocks are used when a vehicle is parked on a grade, and OSHA has guidelines that require wheel chocks during loading or unloading of a heavy truck.

==How to use wheel chocks==

To use, wheel chocks must be selected to match the size of the [[tire]]s on the vehicle and used in pairs, as the size of the tire is designed to be proportional to the vehicle's weight and size. For a maximum slope of approximately 15.6 degrees, use a chock 1/4 height of the wheel as per [[SAE International|SAE]] J348. The maximum slope angle for any given chock is &lt;math&gt;\frac{chock\ height}{height\ of\ the\ wheel} \div 0.016&lt;/math&gt;. For example, for a chock 1/6 the height of the wheel, the maximum slope angle would be 10 degrees. Some manufacturers recommend wheel chocks that are slightly bigger than 1/4 the height of the wheel.

Three main factors affect the performance of wheel chocks:
# The angle of the road surface, called '''slope''' or [[Grade (slope)|grade]]. Parking on an angle greater than 10 degrees increases the risk of the car rolling off or over the chock.
# The '''size''' (height) of the wheel chock compared to the wheel height. Extra large wheel chocks are suitable for e.g. parked air craft where wind forces may come into effect.
# The surface '''slip''' or friction of the road surface, as the wheel chock may slide downhill due to wet grass or ice. Increasing the size of the wheel chock will not necessary allow the parking on inclines greater than 30% gradient (16.6 degrees).

Wheel chocks must be used on a level surface; some rubber wheel chocks have steel grates and ice cleat accessories. The vehicle is placed in park (on vehicles with [[Automatic transmission|automatic gearboxes]]) and the parking or [[Parking brake|emergency brake]] is applied. The wheel chocks are then snugly positioned against the center of the tires in the direction of the grade, on both the left and right side of the vehicle. On even surfaces, chocks are applied to the rear-facing as well as the front-facing side of each tire.

==Parking chocks==
A [[parking space]] commonly contains a parking chock, a barrier which is used to prevent cars from pulling too far into the space and obstructing an adjacent parking space, curb, or sidewalk.

This barrier, also called a parking stop or a turtarrier, is usually made of [[concrete]] or recycled plastic and will normally be a horizontal bar to prevent the tires from moving forward or a vertical bar that may cause damage to the vehicle if contact is made. In a parking garage, the barrier will often be a concrete wall. The recycled plastic parking stops are more lightweight than concrete and will not crack or chip. This lighter version can be installed by one person and will resist auto oils and fuels and will never need maintenance such as repainting.

'''White oil''' is a homemade insecticide spray used for controlling a wide range of insect pests in the garden.  The spray works by blocking the breathing pores of insects, causing suffocation and death. It is effective in the control of [[aphids]], [[Scale insect|scale]], [[mealybug]], [[mites]], citrus leaf miner and smooth skinned caterpillars.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

"White oil" is also an alternative name for [[mineral oil]].{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Recipe==
The quantities vary depending on the source, but a typical mixture is 4 parts of vegetable oil (a non-mineral oil) to one part of dish-washing detergent (for washing by hand). It may be blended in a mixer until [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogeneous]] to be stored. Diluting 1:50 with water may be used for spraying leaves from above and below.{{cn|date=November 2015}}
