      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1946">'''1642 års tiggareordning''' (English: ''Beggar regulation of 1642'') was a Swedish [[Poor Law]] which organized the public [[Poor relief]] in the Sweden. The regulations of the law, with some alterations, was in effect until the [[1847 års fattigvårdförordning]] (Poor relief regulation of 1847).

In the [[middle ages]], poor care in Sweden was traditionally handled through the [[rotegång]]system in the country side, and by the [[poor house]]s of the church in the cities, a system which was kept after the reformation, though the responsibility was formally (though not in practice) transferred from the church to the civil authorities. The regulation of 1642 stated that the every parish were responsible for their own paupers. Every parish should have a poor house for old and sick people, and an orphanage for children, financed by the parish church collection. If such facilities did not exist in the parish (and in rural communities, the seldom did, except for the occasional [[backstuga]]), then the paupers should either be housed with the parishioners in accordance with the established traditional [[rotegång]]system, or be given a [[beggar]] permit, legal only in their own parish: all other forms of beggary were banned.

The 1642 regulation were given some complements and smaller alterations, but it remained as the ground for the poor care system in Sweden until the [[1847 års fattigvårdförordning]] (Poor relief regulation of 1847).

The '''1866 [[Constitution of Romania]]''' was the fundamental law that capped a period of nation-building in the [[Danubian Principalities]], which had united in 1859. Drafted in a short time and using as its model the [[Constitution of Belgium|1831 Constitution of Belgium]], then considered Europe's most liberal, it was substantially modified by [[Domnitor|Prince]] (later King) [[Carol I of Romania|Carol]] and adopted by the Constituent Assembly. The newly installed Prince then promulgated it on July 1; this was done without input from the major powers, including the [[Ottoman Empire]], which still had formal sovereignty over Romania.

== Outline ==
The document proclaimed Romania a [[constitutional monarchy]], on the basis of [[separation of powers]] and on the principle of [[national sovereignty]].  The throne was a hereditary office of the male descendants of Carol, "[[salic law|perpetually excluding]] women and their descendants." The Prince's person was proclaimed "inviolable." He was the head of the army, he named and dismissed ministers, sanctioned and promulgated laws, named and confirmed men to all public functions, signed treaties and conventions on commerce and navigation with foreign countries, had the right to grant political amnesty, to pardon criminals or reduce their sentences, to confer military ranks and decorations, and coin money. At the same time, he opened and closed sessions of Parliament, which he could convoke in emergency session and which he could dissolve.  

Legislative power was exercised by the Prince and Parliament (composed of an Assembly of Deputies and a Senate), while executive power was entrusted to the Prince, who exercised it through his ministers. Following the Belgian model, the Prince's acts were only valid if countersigned by a minister, who then became politically responsible for the act in question. The political regime was liberal but not democratic; elections were held with a limited franchise (voters, all men, were divided into four colleges based on their wealth and social origins).

Citizens' rights and freedoms were of the most modern vintage: enshrined in the document were the freedom of conscience, of the press, of assembly, of religion; equality before the law, regardless of class; individual liberty; inviolability of the home. Capital punishment was abolished in peacetime, while property was considered sacred and inviolable. The [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] was accorded superior status ("the dominant religion of the Romanian state"), while article 7 provided that non-Christians could not become citizens (which chiefly affected [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]]).{{cn|date=October 2015}} The Constitution also did little to advance the position of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchins|2014|pp=115–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, under Western pressure, article 7 was ostensibly diluted but in fact it remained nearly impossible for Jews to gain citizenship. In 1881, the constitution was amended to proclaim Romania a kingdom, and the word "prince" was replaced by the word "king."  In 1884, the number of electoral colleges was reduced to three, thus expanding the franchise. In 1917, the Constitution underwent two major modifications in order to fulfill promised made to the soldiers then fighting [[World War I]]: the college-based electoral system was abolished, and the [[right to property]] weakened so that [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] could be carried out. It remained in effect until 1923, when a [[1923 Constitution of Romania|new constitution]] came into effect.

==Elections==
Although every adult male could vote, the value of their vote was strongly tilted towards the wealthiest.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"&gt;Eidelberg, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1909, the Chamber of Deputies was divided into three colleges, based on incomes and wealth:

* College I (comprising 41% of the deputies) was elected directly by 1.5% of the voters, property owners who had incomes of at least 1200 lei&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"/&gt;
* College II (comprising 38% of the deputies) was elected directly by 3.5% of the voters, city dwellers and professionals paying an annual tax of at least 20 lei&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"/&gt;
* College III (comprising 21% of the deputies) was elected directly by 4% of the voters, literate rural property owners who had incomes between 300 and 1200 lei, as well as teachers and priests&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"/&gt;
* in the College III, also voted indirectly the rest of 91% of the voters, through delegates who represented 50 voters.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"/&gt;

The Senate gave even more power to the large property owners, while 98% of the voters were not represented at all:&lt;ref name="Eidelberg16"/&gt;

* College I (comprising 55% of the senators) was elected by 1% of the voters, who had incomes of at least 2000 lei or were high-level functionaries or held advanced degrees and had a certain number of professional employment.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg15"/&gt;
* College II (comprising 45% of the senators) was elected by another 1% of the voters, who had incomes of at between 800 and 2000 lei or held advanced degrees or were professionals.&lt;ref name="Eidelberg16"&gt;Eidelberg, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1952 Arrest Convention''' (full title: '''International Convention for the unification of certain rules relating to Arrest of Sea-going Ships''') is a 1952 [[multilateral treaty]] whereby states agree to rules on the arrest of ships.

By the Convention, states agree to the following rule: a state agrees to allow a foreign jurisdiction to arrest a ship of its nationality that is present in the foreign jurisdiction's port. The arrest can be made only after a warrant of arrest is issued in the domestic jurisdiction of the port state. The rules of the Convention apply only if both the state of nationality and the state performing the arrest are state parties to the Convention.

The Convention was concluded and signed on 10 May 1952 in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]; it entered into force on 24 February 1956. It has been signed by 19 states and is in force in 71 jurisdictions. Spain, an original signatory of the Convention, denounced it in 2011. The depositary of the Convention is the government of Belgium.

(The French title is ''Convention internationale pour l'unification de certaines règles sur la saisie conservatoire des navires de mer''.)

==Arrest Convention 1999==

In 1999, the [[Arrest Convention 1999|International Convention on Arrest of Ships]] was concluded. The intent of the [[International Maritime Organization]] is that the 1999 Convention will come to replace the 1952 Convention, but as of 2014 the 1999 Convention has only 11 state parties. It entered into force on 14 September 2011.

"'''200'''" is the fifth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 200th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, [[Tom Cruise]] and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] to meet him.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] combined many of ''South Park''{{'}}s past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]", refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow [[Depictions of Muhammad|images of Muhammad]] to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005]] and [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy|2007]] of Muhammad in European newspapers.

"200" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, [[Rob Reiner]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Kanye West]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[George Lucas]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. The 1998 [[South Park (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]" claimed that Cartman's [[hermaphrodite]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] is his father, but the events of "200" and [[201 (South Park)|the subsequent episode]] reveal that this is not the case.

"200" received mostly positive reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both "200" and the sequel episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" were nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.&lt;ref name='2010emmy'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |title=Complete Emmy listings |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |last=Emmy Awards |format=PDF |publisher=Emmy Award |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65blzi3QZ?url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of "201" by removing references to Muhammad and the episode's closing speech.

While on a school [[field trip]] to a [[candy]] factory, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] spots actor [[Tom Cruise]] working there, packing fudge into boxes. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", accidentally insults him again by calling him a "[[:wikt:fudge packer|fudge packer]]", as Cruise claims to be [[fly fishing]]. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet [[Muhammad]]. This causes an uproar because [[depictions of Muhammad]] are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the [[Super Best Friends]], a squad of superhero-like religious figures ([[Jesus Christ]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Krishna]], [[Laozi]], [[Joseph Smith]]) of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his "goo", as [[Rob Reiner]], previously shown to be filled with "goo" in "[[Butt Out]]", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's "goo" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.

By this time, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] arrives with "Mitch Conner", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist act]]. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress [[Jennifer Lopez]] in "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a [[U-Haul]] truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the [[Ginger Kids]], a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance.  The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.

The people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt [[Mecha-Streisand]], a giant mechanical monster form of [[Barbra Streisand]], who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher [[Mr. Garrison]] and Garrison's old hand puppet [[Mr. Hat]], who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.

This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town.

Stone said in writing the episode, they were determined not to produce a [[clip show]], but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode.&lt;ref name="Boing" /&gt; Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just "rehashing a bunch of old stuff".&lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=South Park: "200" |work=[[The A.V.

==Theme==

===Muhammad subplot===
{{see also|South Park controversies#Censorship of the depiction of Muhammad}}
[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|An image of the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] was shown in the 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", but was later banned from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers. This contradiction is mocked in "200". In 2010, the episode which relates to this picture was removed by South Park Studios and is no longer available for viewing.]]

"200" features jokes and references to past ''South Park'' episodes, storylines, characters and controversies.&lt;ref name="Boing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite news |last=Isler |first=Ramsey |title=South Park: "200" Review |work=[[IGN]] |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1083959p1.html |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417142703/http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1083959p1.html| archivedate=April 17, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode revolves heavily around efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 ([[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]) and 2007 ([[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]]), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Park creators court fury after including Prophet Muhammad in no-holds-barred 200th episode |date=April 15, 2010 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1266228/South-Park-creators-court-fury-including-Prophet-Muhammad-holds-barred-200th-episode.html |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20100419173144/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1266228/South-Park-creators-court-fury-including-Prophet-Muhammad-holds-barred-200th-episode.html| archivedate=April 19, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EW0415"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |title='South Park' 200th episode review: Muhammad, Tom Cruise, and Cartman's daddy issues |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/15/south-park-200th-episode/ |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418022151/http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/04/15/south-park-200th-episode/| archivedate=April 18, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslims warn South Park after Mohammed joke |work=[[The First Post]] |date=April 21, 2010 |last=Edwards |first=Tim |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/62467,people,entertainment,muslims-warn-south-park-after-mohammed-appears-in-bear-suit-in-200th-episode |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424055642/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/62467%2Cpeople%2Centertainment%2Cmuslims-warn-south-park-after-mohammed-appears-in-bear-suit-in-200th-episode |archivedate=April 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]", during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] episode "[[Super Best Friends]]", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in "200".) The episode "Super Best Friends" aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in "200" by saying of Muhammad, "I saw him once...a while ago..."&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EW0414"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bierly |first=Mandi |title='South Park' gears up for 200th episode: Will we see Muhammad? |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 14, 2010 |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/04/14/south-park-200th-episode-muhammad/ |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417073539/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/04/14/south-park-200th-episode-muhammad/| archivedate=April 17, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, "Something that was OK is now not OK, and that's just fucked up."&lt;ref name="Boing" /&gt; The "Super Best Friends" episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.&lt;ref name="Boing" /&gt;

Additionally, Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy.&lt;ref name="EW0414" /&gt; When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might hurt us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [Muslims] because they might hurt us.'"&lt;ref name="Boing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EW0414" /&gt; The Muhammad subplot in "200", like the "Cartoon Wars" episodes, advocates for [[free speech]] and speaks out against [[censorship]], both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Murray |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Murray (author) |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 19, 2010 |title=South Park celebrates 200th episode with another attempt to show us...Mohammed! |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/douglasmurray/100035408/south-park-celebrates-200th-episode-with-another-attempt-to-show-us-mohammed/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423070958/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/douglasmurray/100035408/south-park-celebrates-200th-episode-with-another-attempt-to-show-us-mohammed/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "200" also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but [[Buddhism]] founder [[Gautama Buddha]] is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a [[stick figure]]-like drawing of him, which is not censored.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

"200" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt; One of the most prominently parodied is Tom Cruise, who was the center of the [[South Park (season 9)|ninth season]] episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]".

&lt;!-- NOTE: This list must be sourced, so if you add a celebrity, please also include a source that indicates they were in the episode "200", as well as a source indicating what previous South Park episode they appeared in. --&gt;

Near the end of "200", the celebrities seek assistance from singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who resembles a giant two-legged mechanical monster. This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first-season episode "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of [[Mechagodzilla]] from the [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]].&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt; The Mecha-Streisand featured in "200" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of ''South Park''.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in ''South Park'' are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Mecha-Streisand"|type=Audio commentary CD |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streisand, in turn, has been critical of ''South Park'' and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding "to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children".&lt;ref name="Mirabella"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Way She Is|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|authorlink=Claudia Dreifus|date=May 1998|work=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartman's father===
The episode ends with a [[cliffhanger]] involving Cartman's father.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WCAU" /&gt; The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point at the end of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]], culminating in the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, [[Liane Cartman]], is a [[hermaphrodite]] and, in fact, is Cartman's father. "200" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt; Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", resuming his role in pretending to be [[Jennifer Lopez]] and utilizing many offensive [[Hispanic]] stereotypes in his portrayal of her.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist [[Señor Wences]].&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt;

Several other references to previous ''South Park'' episodes are featured throughout "200". It marks the reappearance of [[Herbert Garrison#Mr. Hat|Mr. Hat]], a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early ''South Park'' seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt; During the second half of "200", an army of red-haired "ginger kids" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several ''South Park'' episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode "[[Ginger Kids]]", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |title=Celebrating South Park's 200 episode: Five of the best |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418210433/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best| archivedate=April 18, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
During one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an [[Jumping the couch|incident on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'']] in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress [[Katie Holmes]]. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior.&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt; In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor [[Harrison Ford]] leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the [[Indiana Jones]] films. This is a reference to the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode "[[The China Probrem]]", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt; A cartoon image of film director [[Tim Burton]] is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and for his tendency to feature film actor [[Johnny Depp]] in so many of his films that he should "just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain [[Taco Bell]], particularly [[enchirito]]s, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;  Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as "her," to which the discussion goes "her who?" "her" "oh...her."  This is slightly reminiscent of the movie [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]] when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks "what did I ever do to you" and Rick answers "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" Steve: "her? oh...her" {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html |title=Little Shop Of Horrors Script –  transcript from the screenplay and/or Rick Moranis and Steve Martin musical movie based on the play |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010042820/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html|archivedate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original American broadcast on April 14, 2010, "200" was watched by 3.33 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], making it the most watched cable television show of the night.&lt;ref name="TVNum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |title=Wednesday Cable Ratings: "''In Plain Sight''" Slips; "''South Park''" Up |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Gorman |first=Bill |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407191725/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It outperformed the previous week's episode, "[[You Have 0 Friends]]", which was seen by 3.07 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |title=Wednesday Finals: "''CSI: NY''" Dips Further + "''South Park''," "''In Plain Sight''" and More |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414163049/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was seen by roughly 177,000 more viewers than its closest competitor on April 14, [[USA Network]]'s ''[[In Plain Sight]]''.

===Reviews===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=200px |align=right | quote = This was South Park distilled to its essence: Cartman and his friends caught up in the stupidity all around them, created by absurd, neurotic, fearful, repressed adults.

}}
The episode received mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said he was surprised by the complexity of "200" and the amount of ''South Park'' references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman's father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, "With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves."&lt;ref name="EW0415" /&gt; Ramsey Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' said it was fun to identify all the references to past ''South Park'' moments, but felt "200" itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how ''South Park'' had been more original in early episodes, but now had "morph[ed] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;

[[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said of the episode, "I can't recommend it enough",&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, "They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amy Duncan of ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' said it "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said "develops with [''South Park''{{'s}}] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duncan |first=Amy |title=Tom Cruise called a 'fudge-packer' by South Park |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/821855-tom-cruise-called-a-fudge-packer-by-south-park |accessdate=April 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091548/http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/821855-tom-cruise-called-a-fudge-packer-by-south-park| archivedate=April 17, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Broderick of ''The Hofstra Chronicle'' said the episode "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story in addition to the throwback references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broderick |first=Ryan |title=TV RECAP: South Park's 200th |work=The Hofstra Chronicle |date=April 14, 2010 |url=http://www.hofstrachronicle.com/arts-entertainment/tv-recap-south-park-s-200th-1.1342736 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417202627/http://www.hofstrachronicle.com/arts-entertainment/tv-recap-south-park-s-200th-1.1342736 |archivedate=April 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Zaino of [[TV Squad]] said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't "pull any punches". Zaino said the episode has "a wonderful sense of the absurd", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.&lt;ref name="Zaino" /&gt;

The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in "200", but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show. The group's spokesman, [[Ibrahim Hooper]], said, "People are pretty tired of this whole 'Let's insult the prophet Muhammad thing.'"&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collins |first1=Scott |last2=Gold |first2=Matea |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 23, 2010 |title=Threat against 'South Park creators highlights dilemma for media companies |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-south-park-20100423,0,5940860.story |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425023818/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-south-park-20100423%2C0%2C5940860.story |archivedate=April 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It said that they "will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show." Filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] was murdered by an Islamist in 2004 for making a short documentary on the violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles.

CNN journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] said of the episode, "You might not like ''South Park'' the cartoon. You might think it's offensive.

The Dutch version of Comedy Central began airing commercials for "200" during the week of April 26, with the show scheduled to air on April 30. However, "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" was shown instead. When asked about this, a spokesperson for Comedy Central Netherlands said they had reluctantly decided the episode to be pulled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=CC International heeft er met grote tegenzinvoor gekozen om de 2 afl.van South Park niet uit te zenden. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the episode "201".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=de veiligheid van onze medewerkers is prioriteit nummer 1 en is er uit voorzorg besloten de 2 afleveringen niet uit te zenden. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website; the same applies to the German website as of May 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southpark.nl/episodes/1405/|title=South Park Episode Player – 200|accessdate=May 2, 2010|publisher=''South Park Studios Netherlands'' |language=Dutch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306070146/http://www.southpark.nl/episodes/1405/|archivedate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verver |first=Jody |title=Dit geldt helaas ook voor online.De US heeft deze voorzorgsmaatregel genomen om de veiligheid van haar medewerkers te garanderen. |date=April 30, 2010 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast "200" and "201" in Sweden:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Park Muhammad joke won't air in Sweden |work=[[The Local]] |date=April 29, 2010 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/26366/20100429/ |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503001847/http://www.thelocal.se/26366/20100429/ |archivedate=May 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number[-]one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gendar |first1=Alison |last2=Parascandola |first2=Rocco |last3=Kennedy |first3=Helen |title=Police eyeing link to South Park in Times Square car bomb |work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] |date=May 2, 2010 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/05/02/2010-05-02_cops_possible_suspects_in_times_square_car_bomb_include_group_behind_south_park_.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504084135/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/05/02/2010-05-02_cops_possible_suspects_in_times_square_car_bomb_include_group_behind_south_park_.html| archivedate=May 4, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Allen |first1=Nick |last2=Rayner |first2=Gordon |title=Times Square car bomb: police investigate South Park link |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=May 2, 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7668606/Times-Square-car-bomb-police-investigate-South-Park-link.html |accessdate=May 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100503222720/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7668606/Times-Square-car-bomb-police-investigate-South-Park-link.html| archivedate=May 3, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman [[Peter T.

===Sri Lanka ban===
The depiction of [[Buddha]] snorting [[cocaine]] in "200" and "201", prompted the government of [[Sri Lanka]] to ban the entire series outright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/04/25/american-television-depicts-buddha-snorting-cocaine/comment-page-1/ American Television Depicts Buddha Snorting Cocaine | The Sunday Leader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital censorship==
The day after the episode aired, the episode was available for streaming on the site. After a week, like the other Muhammad episodes, it was taken off due to copyright reasons. However, the message presented to the user for this episode is "We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream this episode."&lt;ref name="s14e05"&gt;[http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s14e05-200 200] South Park Studios Full Episode Player, Season 14 Episode 5. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122061336/http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s14e05-200 |date=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sequel episode, "201", also has not been made available for streaming, but a different message describes an intent to potentially post that episode. Similarly the episode and its sequel are not available to stream or buy on services [[Netflix]], [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], [[Hulu]], or [[Amazon on Demand]].  Furthermore, digital copies of these episodes that were purchased prior to their ban from digital distribution are no longer available for streaming or download.

==Home release==
Although "200" was not currently available on the internet legally, and had not re-aired since April 2010, it was confirmed on February 11, 2011 that "200" will be released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/374195 |title=Now that you've given us a date for Season 14's DVD release, here's something I'm betting a lot of people are itching to know: WILL EVERY EPISODE be included on the DVD/Bluray? – FAQ |publisher=South Park Studios |date= |accessdate=June 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829065111/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/374195|archivedate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "200" along with the thirteen other episodes from ''South Park''{{'s}} fourteenth season, was released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set and two-disc [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]] set in the United States on April 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/South-Park-Season-14/14998 |title=''South Park – 'The Complete 14th Season' Formally Announced; Seems it Really IS Complete! |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/677d2d6Z3?url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/South-Park-Season-14/14998 |archivedate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
Under certain historical circumstances, a major power's [[Consul (representative)|consular]] representation would take on various degrees of administrative roles, not unlike a colonial [[resident (title)|Resident Minister]]. This would often occur in territories without a formal state government (thus warranting a full diplomatic mission, such as an embassy) or in relatively insignificant "backwaters."

&lt;!-- The following case lists are probably not exhaustive --&gt;

==Protectorates==
When a state falls under the "amical" [[protectorate|protection]] of a stronger (often colonial) power, the latter is usually represented by a high ranking diplomatic and/or gubernatorial officer, such as a [[Resident general]], Resident Minister or [[High Commissioner]]. However, if there is no such representation (in modern terms often at ambassadorial level), the task may fall to the only available "diplomatic" alternative: consular representation.

===Africa===
In German [[Kamerun]], 6 July 1884 – 26 June 1885, provisional consul Heinrich Randad filled the void between the first [[Reichskommissar]] (titled—for West Africa, 5–6 July 1884 only) and the subsequent series of regular incumbents

In parts of present [[Nigeria]], British Consuls were in charge of the following West African protectorates:
*the [[Bight of Benin]] May 1852–6 August 1861
*the [[Bight of Biafra]] 30 June 1849 – 6 August 1861
*the [[Bights of Biafra and Benin]] after the merger of the two above on 6 August 1861; the last incumbent was promoted on 5 June 1885 to stay on as first [[Consul general]] (of two) of the Bight.

===Samoa===
From 7 November 1889, [[Samoa]], previously a Polynesian kingdom, was governed by the joint [[Germany|German]]-[[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States of America|U.S.]] [[Samoa Tripartite Convention]], which made Samoa a protectorate of those three powers.  On 10 June 1899, a provisional (colonial) government ''sui generis'' was formed, consisting of the consuls of the three protecting powers:
** Friedrich Rose (German Consul)  (b. 1855–d. 1922)
** [[Ernest George Berkeley Maxse]] (British Consul) (b. 1863–d. 1943): to 23 June 1899, succeeded by a Mister Nair (acting British consul)
** Luther Wood Osborn (U.S. Consul) (b. 1843–d. 1901).

This arrangement lasted until 1 March 1900, when most of the archipelago was annexed by [[Imperial Germany]]. The eastern islands remained under U.S. control and became the territory of [[American Samoa]].

===Tonga===
On [[Tonga]], a British protectorate from 1900, the British Empire was only represented by its consuls from 1901 until Tongan independence in 1970. From 1901 until 1952, the protectorate was also under the administrative authority of the [[High Commissioner]] of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]], who was always the British Governor of [[Fiji]].

==Occupied territories under similar control==
*In the [[Suez Canal Zone]], even before it was officially established under that name in 1936 (from then on with a formal Governor in charge), the British were represented since 1922 by [[Vice Consul]]s in [[Port Suez]], the last of which stayed on in 1941 as first of several Consuls till the 1956 Egyptian nationalisation.
*From December 1941 to August 1945, [[Japan]]ese troops invaded the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Macau]] several times, giving the Japanese control over the access of people and goods. This made it by 1943 a virtual protectorate, with Japanese consul [[Fukui Yasumitsu]] controlling all contact until 1945 with the Portuguese governor, [[Gabriel Maurício Teixeira]].

''Similar functions have been performed elsewhere by consular officers of other ranks: [[Consular Agent]], Honorary Consul and [[Consul general]].''

== U.S. military personnel ==
Certain U.S. military personnel also have statutory authority to act as consuls for its military administration purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Title 10 U.S.C. § 936&lt;/ref&gt; more broadly for its military personnel and dependents,&lt;ref&gt;Title 10 U.S.C. § 1044a&lt;/ref&gt; and for its merchant seamen in a port lacking an accredited U.S. consul.&lt;ref&gt;Title 10 U.S.C. § 5948&lt;/ref&gt;

The US assigns a military-equivalent rank to its Honorary (Vice) Consuls (General). Its honorary consular Officers rank immediately after Naval Lieutenants, Captains, and Flight Lieutenants; Honorary Vice Consuls after Lieutenant Commanders, Majors, and Squadron Leaders; Honorary Consuls after Naval Captains, Colonels, and Group Captains; and Honorary Consuls General after Rear Admirals, Major Generals and Air Vice Marshals. This is done in order to "cut to the chase", i.e. in a sensitive situation to get the Consul (of whatever rank) to someone with whom he/she can negotiate with confidence.

'''Ahl al-Hadith''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الحديث}}, "The people of [[hadith]]"; also ''Așḥāb al-ḥadīṯ''; {{lang|ar|أصحاب الحديث}}, "The adherents of [[hadith]]") first emerged in the 2nd/ 3rd Islamic centuries as a movement of [[hadith]] scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ahl al-Hadith|editor=John L.

In [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] Ahl al-Hadith opposed contemporary jurists who based their legal reasoning on informed opinion (''ra'y'') or living local practice, referred to as [[Ahl ar-Ra'y]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against the [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent leader of the movement was [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; Subsequently, all Sunni [[Madhhab|legal schools]] gradually came to accept the reliance on the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement,&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; while [[al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) used rationalistic argumentation favored by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Khalid |last=Blankinship| authorlink = Khalid Yahya Blankinship | year=2008 | title=The early creed |editor=Tim Winter|volume=The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition)|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries the term ''ahl al-hadith'' came to refer to the scholars, mostly of the [[Hanbali|Hanbali madhhab]], who rejected rationalistic theology (''[[kalam]]'') and held on to the early Sunni creed.&lt;ref name=Brown168&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan A.C. |last=Brown| year=2009 | title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|publisher=Oneworld Publications (Kindle edition)|page=168| quote=In the wake of the tenth-century Ash'ari synthesis, some Muslim theologians still maintained the strict details of the early Sunni creed.

== Origins and general characteristics ==

The Ahl al-Hadith movement emerged toward the end of the eighth century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles, but by the early ninth century they coalesced into a separate movement under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In legal matters, these scholars criticized the use of personal opinion (''ra'y'') common among the [[Hanafi]] jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by [[Malikite]] jurists of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They also rejected the use of ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; Ahl al-Hadith were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They attempted to follow the injunction of "[[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|commanding good and forbidding evil]]" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt;

== Convergence of legal schools ==
{{further|Fiqh|Madhhab}}

The next two centuries witnessed a broad convergence of legal methodologies which gave rise to the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence (''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]''). Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; This "traditionalizing" of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]]'s student [[Al-Shafi‘i]], which laid the foundation of the [[Shafi'i]] legal school.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt;

== Creed ==
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

Ahl al-Hadith believed that the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'' (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of faith and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, accepting them without asking "how" (''[[bi-la kaifa]]''), and asserted that their realities should be consigned to God alone (''[[tafwid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that every part of the Qur'an is uncreated (''ghayr makhluq'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agwan|first1=A. R.|last2=Singh|first2=N.

In 833 the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (''[[mihna]]'') which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made is subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated and hence coeternal with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|pages=49, 51}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy persisted until [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged  from the work of [[al-Maturidi]] (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni [[madhhab]]s, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who ostensibly persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the scholars who rejected the [[Ash'ari]]/[[Maturidi]] synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|page=2081–2091 (Kindle locations)}}; {{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni "orthodoxy", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.&lt;ref name="Brown 2009 page=180"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brown|2009|page=180}}: "The Ash‘ari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‘orthodoxy.’ But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‘arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‘orthodoxy’ as well."&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by [[Wahhabi]] and other traditionalist [[Salafi]] currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hoover|2014|page=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6267">The [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] applicable in England and Wales, and to a lesser extent Scotland and Northern Ireland, implemented fundamental changes to the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of [[evidence]] relating to character, in respect to [[defendant]]s and others. The Act is far-reaching, providing for the admissibility of previous [[conviction]]s in support of a [[wikt:propensity|propensity]] to commit like-offences and untruthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 103 |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003+&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903058&amp;filesize=3527 |work=Criminal Justice Act |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930083245/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003+&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903058&amp;filesize=3527 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common law rules in relation to the admissibility of '''bad character evidence''' have been abolished, with the existence of one exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 99(2) |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003+&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903052&amp;filesize=802 |work=Criminal Justice Act 2003 |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930083608/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Criminal+Justice+Act+2003+&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=902928&amp;ActiveTextDocId=903052&amp;filesize=802 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation draws heavily on the Law Commission Paper No. 273.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Commission Paper No. 273 |url=http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc273sum(1).pdf |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105181121/http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc273sum%281%29.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Bad character evidence is evidence of, or a [[disposition]] towards [[misconduct]]; other than evidence which has to do with the alleged facts of the offence with which the defendant is charged or is evidence of misconduct in connection with the investigation or [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] of that offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 98 |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_12#pt11-ch1-pb1-l1g98 |work=Criminal Justice Act 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023033318/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_12 |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Misconduct is defined as "the commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 112(1) |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--l.htm#112 |work=Criminal Justice Act 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502212803/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--l.htm |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bad character in relation to the alleged facts offence itself has always been admissible for obvious reasons. The Act provides for different rules in relation to the bad character of defendants, and that of non-defendants. In assessing the probative value of evidence it is assumed to be true, unless there is material to suggest the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 109 |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--l.htm#109 |work=Criminal Justice Act 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502212803/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--l.htm |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from evidence of previous convictions, other evidence, amounting to "reprehensible behaviour" is admissible. The Government stated the following during debate:
:"Examples of where it might be appropriate to admit such evidence include circumstances where evidence on a number of charges being tried concurrently is cross-admissible in respect of the other charges.

:It might also be appropriate to admit evidence relating to charges on which the defendant was acquitted, as I have already cited in the example of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R v Z|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000622/z-1.htm|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be unfortunate if an argument were to be accepted that, because a person has not actually been convicted of the offence, it cannot be said that the evidence shows that he has indeed committed such an offence and it is therefore excluded".&lt;ref name="Drop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to CrimeLine Resources|url=https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nsbw9hjin377k52/d3RujSYekO|work=CrimeLine Resources|publisher=CrimeLine Training Limited|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=CrimeLine Training Limited|format=PDF|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusion of bad character evidence==
In addition to the statutory tests for exclusion of bad character evidence the power to exclude evidence under section 78 PACE 1984 [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] is not affected by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] provisions ([https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-17.htm#31119-17_time0 House of Lords, Hansard, 19 November 2003, Col. 1988]). Bad Character evidence may be excluded on the grounds of unfairness.&lt;ref name="Drop" /&gt;

'''Buckfast Tonic Wine''' is a [[caffeine|caffeinated]] [[fortified wine]] originally made by monks at [[Buckfast Abbey]] in [[Devon]], [[England]], now made under a licence granted by the monastery, and distributed by  J. Chandler &amp; Company in the [[United Kingdom]] and Richmond Marketing Ltd in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is based on a traditional recipe from France. The wine's distributor reported record sales of £43.2 million as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2018/01/buckfast-tonic-wine-hits-record-43-2m-sales-high/|title=Buckfast tonic wine hits record £43.2m sales high|publisher=www.thedrinksbusiness.com|date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being marketed as a [[herbal tonic|tonic]], Buckfast has become notorious in [[Scotland]] for its association with the loutish [[Ned (Scottish)|ned culture]] and antisocial behaviour.&lt;ref name="health"/&gt; High retail sales are recorded throughout the [[Central Lowlands]] including [[Glasgow]] and the surrounding areas of [[East Kilbride]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[Blantyre, South Lanarkshire]], [[Cambuslang]], and [[Coatbridge]].

==History==
[[File:Buckfast tanker lorry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Buckfast Wine tanker on the [[A38 road|A38]] in [[Devon]]]]
The wine, which is still manufactured using many of the same ingredients, is based on a traditional recipe from France. The [[Benedictine]] monks at Buckfast Abbey first made the tonic wine in the 1890s. It was originally sold in small quantities as a medicine using the slogan "Three small glasses a day, for good health and lively blood".&lt;ref name="Buckfast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckfast.org.uk/tonic-wine_105.html|title=History of the Tonic Wine|publisher=Buckfast Abbey|access-date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Abbey lost its licence to sell wine. As a result, the Abbot allowed wine merchants to distribute on behalf of the Abbey. At the same time, the recipe was changed to be less of a [[patent medicine]] and more of a medicated wine.&lt;ref name="Buckfast"/&gt;

The wine, which comes in distinct brands depending on the market, has achieved popularity in working class, student, and bohemian communities in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. In the Republic of Ireland, Buckfast is packaged in a darker bottle, has a slightly lower alcoholic strength, and lacks the [[vanillin]] flavouring present in the British version. Buckfast sold in Northern Ireland is the same as that sold in the rest of the UK.&lt;ref name="independentonsunday"&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=McKittrick | title=Ireland demands tougher taxes on dreaded 'Buckie' | date=8 December 2006 | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ireland-demands-tougher-taxes-on-dreaded-buckie-427573.html | work =The Independent on Sunday | access-date = 24 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Buckfast contains 15% alcohol in the 750&amp;nbsp;ml green-bottled UK version, and 14.8% in the brown-bottled Republic of Ireland version, which equates to roughly 11.25 UK [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]].

Both versions of the drink contain [[phosphate]] and [[glycerophosphate]] (each of these as the [[sodium]] and/or [[potassium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]).

The "brown bottle" Buckfast sold in Ireland has a [[caffeine]] content about equal to a strong espresso coffee (60mg/100ml) whereas the UK-sold "green bottle" Buckfast has a caffeine content about equal to strong black tea (25mg/100ml).&lt;ref name="Content"&gt;{{cite web |title=Caffeine Content of Food and Drugs |work=Nutrition Action Health Newsletter |publisher=[[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] |date=December 1996 |url=http://www.cspinet.org/nah/caffeine/caffeine_content.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614144016/http://www.cspinet.org/nah/caffeine/caffeine_content.htm |archivedate=2007-06-14|access-date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erowid"&gt;{{cite web |title=Caffeine Content of Beverages, Foods, &amp; Medications |publisher=Erowid|date=17 August 2009 |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml |access-date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Scottish politicians and social activists have singled out Buckfast Tonic Wine as being particularly responsible for crime, disorder, and general social deprivation in these communities. Although Buckfast accounts for only 0.5% of alcohol sales in Scotland, the figure is markedly higher in [[Lanarkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=For Scots, a Scourge Unleashed by a Bottle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/world/europe/04scotland.html?em |quote= |work=New York Times |date=February 3, 2010 |access-date=2010-02-05 | first=Sarah | last=Lyall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SalesSurge&gt;{{cite web|last=Macmillan |first=Arthur |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Buckfast-sales-surge-after-Jamieson.2624524.jp |title=Buckfast Sales Surge |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2005-05-08 |accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Liddell]], former [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], called for the wine to be banned. In 2005, Scottish Justice Minister [[Cathy Jamieson]] suggested that retailers should stop selling the wine. On a subsequent visit to [[Auchinleck]] within her constituency, she was greeted by teenagers chanting, "Don't ban Buckie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5035714.html |title=Buckfast yobs give Jamieson hard time |access-date=2005-08-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310005938/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/hi/news/5035714.html |archivedate=2006-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamieson then received correspondence from lawyers acting for Buckfast distributors, J. Chandler &amp; Company, in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1066/0011297.pdf |first=Cathy |last=Jamieson |title=Letter from the Minister for Justice to Angus G MacLeod |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=3 March 2005 |access-date=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further consequence was that Buckfast sales increased substantially in the months following Jamieson's comments.&lt;ref name=SalesSurge /&gt;

In September 2006, [[Andy Kerr (Scottish politician)|Andy Kerr]], the [[Scottish Executive]]'s Health Minister, described the drink as "an irresponsible drink in its own right" and a contributor to anti-social behaviour. The distributors denied the claims and accused him of showing "bad manners" and a "complete lack of judgement" regarding the drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Macmillan |first=Arthur |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=1410682006 |title=Health minister condemns Buckfast tonic wine |publisher=Scotland on Sunday |date=24 September 2006 |access-date=2010-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206044656/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=1410682006# |archive-date=2007-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr met with J. Chandler &amp; Company to discuss ways of lessening Buckfast's impact on west Scotland but the talks broke up without agreement. Three months later, [[Jack McConnell]], [[First Minister of Scotland]], stated that Buckfast had become "a badge of pride amongst those who are involved in antisocial behaviour."&lt;ref name="health"&gt;{{cite web |last=Macdonell |first=Hamish |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1715022006&amp;bad=178112 |title=McConnell joins the war of words on Buckfast, 'a seriously bad drink' |publisher=The Scotsman |date=20 November 2006 |access-date=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206045533/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1715022006&amp;bad=178112 |archivedate=6 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the distributors accused the [[Scottish Executive]] of trying to avoid having to deal with the consequences of failed social policy and the actual individuals involved in antisocial behaviour by blaming it on the drinks industry."&lt;ref name="health"/&gt;

In January 2010, a [[BBC]] investigation revealed that Buckfast had been mentioned in 5,638 crime reports in the [[Strathclyde]] area of Scotland from 2006 to 2009, equating to an average of three per day.  In 2017, Scottish Police reported there had been 6,500 crimes related to the drink in the previous two years.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/news/england-gets-taste-buckfast-fortified-wine-linked-crime/|title=England gets a taste for Buckfast, the fortified wine that's linked to crime |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in 10 of those offences had been violent and 114 times in that period a Buckfast bottle was used as a weapon.
A survey at a Scottish [[Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution|young offenders’ institution]] showed of the 117 people who drank alcohol before committing their crimes, 43 per cent said they had drunk Buckfast. In another study of [[litter]] around a typical [[Council house|council estate]] in Scotland, 35 per cent of the items identified as rubbish were Buckfast bottles.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8464359.stm | work=BBC News | title=Buckfast 'in 5,000 crime reports' | date=18 January 2010 | access-date=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a [[Judge#Scotland|Sheriff]] said there was a “very definite association between Buckfast and violence” while sentencing a man for hitting a 15-year-old boy over the head with a bottle at a birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Buckfast breeds violence' Sheriff blasts drink as he sentences thug who attacked boy with bottle at kid's party|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/buckfast-breeds-violence-sheriff-blasts-9403289|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, a trial at the [[High Court in Edinburgh]] heard a man had consumed lager and a whole bottle of Buckfast before ferociously stabbing a workmate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-42664677|title=Man jailed for 10 years after workmate knife attack|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the British trade magazine ''[[The Grocer]]'' reported that increased sales of Buckfast in southeast England had pushed the drink up to 91 on UK's top 100 alcoholic brands. The increased sales were following a marketing campaign to improve the drink's image.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

In 2017, thousands of empty Buckfast bottles were recovered during a clean-up of the Eglinton Canal in [[Galway]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connachttribune.ie/thousands-empty-buckfast-bottles-found-claddagh-basin-022/|title=Thousands of empty Buckfast bottles found in Claddagh Basin - Connacht Tribune|first=Dara|last=Bradley|date=20 February 2017|website=ConnachtTribune.ie|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturer's response==
The [[monk]]s of Buckfast Abbey and  their distribution partner, J. Chandler &amp; Company, deny that their product is harmful, saying that it is responsibly and legally enjoyed by the great majority of purchasers. They also point out that the areas identified with its acute misuse have been economically deprived for decades and Buckfast represents less than one per cent of the total alcohol sales across Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8490681.stm | work=BBC News | title=Monks reject crime link to wine | date=1 February 2010 | access-date=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbot of Buckfast Abbey, [[David Charlesworth]], has emphasised that the tonic wine his monastery produces "is not made to be abused".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-25236076|title=Buckfast monks reject blame for 'tonic wine crime'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, J. Chandler &amp; Company applied to the Court of Session in [[Edinburgh]] to stop [[Strathclyde Police]] from marking bottles of Buckfast so they could trace where under-age drinkers bought them. A company spokesman complained, "This is discrimination at the highest level. Buckfast is no more involved in crime than any other brand of alcohol". A former head of the Scottish Police Federation said: "Buckfast, the distributors and the lawyers who act on behalf of the monks refuse, point blank, to take any responsibility for the antisocial behaviour that's caused by the distribution and the consumption of Buckfast. They even refuse to change the glass bottles to plastic bottles despite overwhelming evidence that large areas in play parks and certain areas in Scotland are littered with this green glass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/buckfast-tonic-wine-takes-police-force-to-court-1-2805789|title=Buckfast tonic wine takes police force to court|publisher=''The Scotsman''|date=|access-date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2013/02/buckfast-tonic-wine-takes-police-to-court/|title=Buckfast tonic wine takes police to court|publisher=''the drinks business ''|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the case was settled without any judgment being made by the court. Assistant Chief Constable Wayne Mawson of [[Police Scotland]] apologised to J. Chandler &amp; Co for asking a shopkeeper to stop selling Buckfast and gave written undertakings not to include the product in any bottle-marking scheme unless it has "reasonable grounds" for doing so, and "not to request licensed retailers, situated anywhere in Scotland, to cease stocking for sale Buckfast Tonic Wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1 February 2014|title=Police Scotland apologise in Buckfast tonic wine case|first=Glenn|last=Campbell|work=[[BBC News|BBC Scotland news]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25989700|access-date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 sales of Buckfast Tonic Wine reached record yearly profits of £8.8&amp;nbsp;million. The abbey trust, which is a shareholder of the Hampshire-based wine's distributor and seller, J Chandler, gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold. Although the trust declined to give out specific sales figures, it said it "strives to work with J Chandler and Co to ensure that the tonic wine is marketed and distributed responsibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-38290379|title=Buckfast monks make record £8.8m|publisher=[[BBC NEWS]]|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buckfast Day==
In 2015, a "National Buckfast Day" was set up by fans to honour the tonic wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glasgow.stv.tv/articles/319446-scotlands-first-ever-national-buckfast-day-set-to-be-held-on-may-9/|title=Thousands sign up to celebrate first National Buckfast Day|publisher=[[STV News]]|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers designated the second Saturday of each May National Buckfast Day.

'''''Campbell v. Clinton''''', 203 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 2000)&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Campbell v. Clinton |vol=203 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=19 |pinpoint= |court=D.C. Cir. |date=2000 |url=https://openjurist.org/203/f3d/19 |accessdate=2017-10-10 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a case holding that members of Congress could not sue President [[Bill Clinton]] for alleged violations of the [[War Powers Resolution]] in his handling of the war in Yugoslavia.

==Background==

===Statute: the War Powers Resolution===
The [[War Powers Resolution]] requires the President to submit a report within 48 hours "in any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced … into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances," and to "terminate any use of United States Armed Forces with respect to which a report was submitted (or required to be submitted), unless the Congress … has declared war or has enacted a specific authorization for such use of United States Armed Forces" within 60 days.

===Legislative actions pursuant to War Powers Resolution===
On March 26, 1999, two days after President Clinton announced the commencement of NATO air and cruise missile attacks on Yugoslav targets, he submitted to Congress a report, "consistent with the War Powers Resolution," detailing the circumstances necessitating the use of armed forces, the deployment's scope and expected duration, and asserting that he had "taken these actions pursuant to [his] authority … as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive."  On April 28, Congress voted on four resolutions related to the Yugoslav conflict: It voted down a declaration of war 427 to 2 and an "authorization" of the air strikes 213 to 213, but it also voted against requiring the President to immediately end U.S. participation in the NATO operation and voted to fund that involvement.

===Conflict between NATO and Yugoslavia===
The [[Kosovo War|conflict between NATO and Yugoslavia]] continued for 79 days, ending on June 10 with Yugoslavia's agreement to withdraw its forces from Kosovo and allow deployment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Throughout this period Pentagon, State Department, and NATO spokesmen informed the public on a frequent basis of developments in the fighting.

===Parties===
The lawsuit was filed before the end of hostilities by 31 members of Congress opposed to U.S. involvement in the Kosovo intervention, led by [[Tom Campbell (California politician)|Tom Campbell]] of California.

===Claim===
The Congressmen sought a declaratory judgment that the President's use of American forces against Yugoslavia was unlawful under both the [[War Powers Clause]] of the Constitution and the [[War Powers Resolution]] ("the WPR").  Appellants claim that the President did submit a report sufficient to trigger the WPR on March 26, or in any event was required to submit a report by that date, but nonetheless failed to end U.S. involvement in the hostilities after 60 days.

===District court===
The [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|district court]] granted the President's motion to dismiss for lack of standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Campbell v. Clinton |vol=52 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=34 |pinpoint= |court=D.D.C. |date=1999 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/52/34/2522389/ |accessdate=2017-10-10 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the court==
The appellate court affirmed. It held appellants had ample legislative authority it could exercise to stop appellee's war making, and thus, appellants lacked the power to challenge such executive action in court.&lt;ref name="Appeal"/&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

In [[Western world|Western]] [[jurisprudence]], '''concurrence''' (also '''contemporaneity''' or '''simultaneity''') is the apparent need to prove the simultaneous occurrence of both ''[[actus reus]]'' ("guilty action") and ''[[mens rea]]'' ("guilty mind"), to constitute a [[crime]]; except in crimes of [[strict liability]]. In theory, if the ''actus reus'' does not  hold concurrence in point of time with the  ''mens rea'' then no crime has been committed.

==Discussion==
Suppose for example that the accused accidentally injures a pedestrian while driving. Aware of the collision, the accused rushes from the car only to find that the victim is a hated enemy. At this point, the accused joyfully proclaims his pleasure at having caused the injury. The conventional rule is that no crime has been committed. The ''actus reus'' is complete, and no rule of ratification applies in the criminal law. Whereas in the [[agency (law)|law of agency]], a [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]] may retrospectively adopt a transaction as if the [[agent (law)|agent]] had originally been authorised to conclude an agreement with a third party ("ratification" of the agent's decision), and so acquires liability under that agreement, an alleged criminal cannot retrospectively adopt an ''actus reus'' and acquire guilt. To be convicted, the accused must have formed the ''mens rea'' either before or during the commission of the ''actus reus''. In the vast majority of cases, this rule works without difficulty.

;Two types of concurrence in criminal law
#Temporal concurrence – the ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' occur at the same time.
#Motivational concurrence – the ''mens rea'' motivates the ''actus reus''.

==The problem==
Not all events are limited to a particular moment in time. The normal physical rules of [[causation (law)|cause]] and effect may see a series of interlocking circumstances conspire to cause a particular injury. If the facts of the example above are slightly changed so that the accident occurs at night at a sharp bend on a very quiet country road. When the driver sees the victim lying in the road he simply leaves the unconscious person where he fell. Some hours later, when a second car innocently comes around the corner and kills the victim, the first driver is happily asleep in his bed. Thus, he argues that, at the time of the death, he had no ''mens rea'' and so cannot be guilty of homicide. This argument fails because of the so-called ''Single Transaction Principle''

==Single transaction principle==
Not all acts forming the basis of an ''actus reus'' are single, unconnected events. If a sequence of events is inevitably linked, it may be viewed as a single transaction. So long as the requisite ''mens rea'' is formed before the sequence begins, or during the sequence (before it ends), the accused will be liable.

In the previous example, the victim would not have died if the first driver had not abandoned him at a dangerous point on the road. The law will treat the ''actus reus'' as having started with the accidental injury and ended with the death. In ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' (1969) 1 QB 439, a police officer ordered the defendant to park his car and he reluctantly complied. In doing so, he accidentally drove the car on to the policeman’s foot and, when the policeman said "Get off my foot", said "Fuck you, you can wait" and turned off the ignition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-level-law.com/caselibrary/FAGAN%20v%20METROPOLITAN%20POLICE%20COMMISSIONER%20%5B1969%5D%201%20QB%20439%20-%20DC.doc FAGAN v METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER (1969) 1 QB 439 – DC]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the steel toe cap in his boot, the policeman's foot was not in actual danger, but the Divisional Court held that this could constitute a [[common assault]]. Albeit accidentally, the driver had caused the car to rest on the foot. This ''actus reus'' was a continuing state of affairs for so long as the car rested on the officer's foot and the ''mens rea'' was formed before the car was removed. Whether realistically or not, the officer apprehended the possibility of injury so the offence of common assault was complete.

A different way of justifying liability in this type of situation would be to consider an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]] at the point in time that the ''mens rea'' is formed. In the first example, liability arises from the [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] omission to move the man, or willful blindness that he was in danger. In ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner|Fagan]]'', liability arises from omitting to remove the car.

But not every factual sequence can be so conveniently recast as an omission. Suppose, for example, that A sees his enemy, B, and decides to attack him. A picks up a stick and begins to chase B who runs into a hotel, up the stairs and into a room, locking the door behind him. A hammers at the door, shouting threats. A then sees a fire axe in a glass case nearby. He tells B that he is going for the axe and will break down the door. When A walks away, B is so terrified that he jumps out of the window and breaks his legs. Even though A might not have had an immediate intention to injure B at the critical moment when B jumped, the fear was inspired with an appropriate intention and B would not have been desperate enough to jump had it not been for that fear. [It is fair to exclude liability when B's fear is entirely unreasonable given A's behaviour because B's self-induced injury will break the chain of causation].

This latter example raises a separate issue which is that it is sufficient to base a conviction on the presence of ''mens rea'' at some time during the occurrence of the events comprising the single transaction. The fact that the accused might mistakenly believe they have succeeded in the crime does not prevent a conviction. For example, suppose that A begins to strangle B and, believing B to be dead, abandons the "body" in nearby woods where B dies of exposure. A will still be convicted of the homicide even though the relevant behaviour of abandoning the body was not accompanied by a ''mens rea''.

And for the sake of completeness, if A commits an offence with an ''actus reus'' and a ''mens rea'', it will not affect liability that A subsequently repents the crime and effects restitution. Thus, if A steals goods from B but then returns them together with some money to make good the damage caused during the forced entry, this cannot change the fact that there was an ''actus reus'' accompanied by an appropriate ''mens rea''. A crime was committed although the subsequent conscience-based behaviour would be a relevant consideration during the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] stage of the trial.

==English case law examples==
*''Thabo Meli v R'' (1954) 1 All ER 373 (PC) Four defendants intended to kill their victim so they induced him to consume alcohol, struck him on the head and threw the "body" over a cliff to make the death appear accidental. Because they thought that the blow had killed him, there was no ''mens rea'' when they abandoned him and he died from exposure. The first act did not cause death but had the appropriate ''mens rea''. The second act caused death but had no ''mens rea''. But the [[Privy Council]] held that it was impossible to divide up what was really one transaction. The ''actus reus'' was said to be the series of acts and omissions with ''mens rea'' covering the initial stages. 
*In ''R v Church'' (1965) 2 AER 72 during an argument, the defendant struck the victim and, mistakenly believing her to be dead, threw her into a nearby river where she drowned. He was convicted of manslaughter.
*In ''R v LeBrun'' (1991) 4 All ER 673, the defendant struck his wife during an argument outside their house leaving her unconscious. He then tried to drag her inside but, as he did so, her head struck the pavement, fracturing her skull and killing her. At first sight, this is distinguishable from ''R v Church'' because death was accidental, whereas Church was intentionally disposing of the "body". But, in attempting to drag his unconscious wife indoors, LeBrun was either trying to conceal his initial assault on her, or forcing her to enter the house against her wishes (this being the original reason for the argument). The trial judge had directed the jury to acquit if they concluded that LeBrun had been trying to help his wife when he moved her, and the Court of Appeal agreed that this would have broken the essential nexus between the two halves of the incident.
*In ''AG's Reference (No. 4 of 1980)'' (1981) 2 All ER 617 the defendant was struggling with his girlfriend and she fell over a landing rail on to the floor below. Believing her dead, he dismembered her in the bath to dispose of her "body". It was impossible to prove whether she had died in the original fall or whether he killed her by his subsequent actions. The Court of Appeal held that a manslaughter conviction was only possible if each of the defendant's acts was accompanied by the requisite ''mens rea'' for that offence. At the very least, there must be an unlawful act which was the cause of the ultimate death. It was not enough to establish [[criminal negligence]] only in the subsequent act of disposal. Hence, the prosecution had to disprove D's claim of accident, i.e. that he had merely pushed her away in a "reflex action" when she dug her nails into him in the struggle on the upstairs landing.
*''[[Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' [1968] 3 All ER 442 The defendant accidentally drove his car onto a policeman's foot whilst the policeman was directing traffic, but then subsequently refused to move off during an argument with the policeman.  It was held that the ''actus reus'' was not the single act of driving onto the foot, but continued as long as the car remained there.  Once the defendant subsequently acquired the ''mens rea'' to harm the policeman, the crime was complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8612">Under [[Canadian trade-mark law]], "confusion" is where a [[Trademark|trade-mark]] is similar enough to another trade-mark to cause consumers to equate them. Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and [[Passing off; trademark registration in Canadian law|passing-off]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}} Whether a trade-mark or [[Trade name|trade-name]] is confusing is a [[question of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Limited v. St. Regis Tobacco Corporation|link=|year=1968|court=scc|num=1|format=canlii|pinpoint= p. 199|parallelcite=[1969] SCR 192|date=1968-11-18|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of [[Patent infringement in Canadian law|substantial infringement]] in [[Canadian patent law|patent law]].{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=530}}

==Definition==

Section 6 of the ''Trademarks Act'' sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing:

{{quote|6.(2) The use of a trade-mark causes confusion with another trade-mark if the use of both trade-marks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trade-marks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class.&lt;ref name = "TMA62"&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(2)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The essence of confusion is the inference of common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Visa International Service Association v. Visa Motel Corporation|link=|year=1984|court=bcca|num=517|format=canlii|pinpoint=par. 15|parallelcite=1 CPR (3d) 109 |date=1984-06-21|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Trade-mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source.

==Statutory Factors==

Section 6(5) of the ''Trademarks Act'' provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine "all of the surrounding circumstances" including:

{{quote|
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;

(b) the length of time the trade-marks or trade-names have been in use;

(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;

(d) the nature of the trade; and

(e) the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Trade-marks Act'' (R.S.C., 1985, c. T-13)|url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/T-13/section-6.html}}, s. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive.&lt;ref&gt;''Gainers Inc. v. Marchildon'' (1996), 66 C.P.R. (3d) 308 (F.C.T.D.)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=531}}

===Degree of Resemblance===

Determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=532}} Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. "Smoothies" and "Smarties" in the context of candies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowntree Company Limited v. Paulin Chambers Company Limited et al.|link=|year=1967|court=scc|num=100|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1968] SCR 134|date=1967-11-28|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard of Comparison===

In determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ultravite Laboratories Ltd. v. Whitehall Laboratories Ltd.|link=|year=1965|court=scc|num=43|format=canlii|pinpoint=p. 192|parallelcite=[1965] SCR 734|date=1965-06-24|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] compared the trade-marks "Molson Golden" and "Winchester Gold" in their entirety.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"&gt;''Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd.'' (1994), 58 C.P.R. (3d) 527&lt;/ref&gt; Although both trade-marks used the descriptive "Gold" or "Golden", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion.&lt;ref name = "MolsonLabatt"/&gt;

==="Ordinary Casual Consumer Somewhat in a Hurry"===

In a leading case on confusion, ''[[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|link=Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|year=2006|court=scc|num=22|format=|pinpoint=par. 56|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 772|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them.

===Actual Evidence of Confusion===

In addition to predicting whether an "ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Christian Dior, S.A. v.

===Distinctiveness===

Marks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=535}} However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively.{{sfn|Vaver|2011|p=534}} In [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the Court found that although [[Mattel]]’s "Barbie" trade-mark was based on an [[Barbara (name)|every day word]], it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's [[Barbie doll|doll products]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade-marks in Different Businesses===

Although section 6(2) of the ''Trade-marks Act'' provides that there can be confusion "whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class",&lt;ref name = "TMA62"/&gt; differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In  [[Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.|''Mattel'']], the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] found it unlikely that consumers would confuse "Barbie" for dolls with "Barbie" for restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''Mattel'', par. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée'', the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of  "Cliquot" for mid-market women’s clothing stores was not confusing with "Veuve Clicquot" as a mark for a [[Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin|famous brand of champagne]].&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Ltée|link=|year=2006|court=scc|num=23|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2006] 1 SCR 824|date=2006-06-02|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.&lt;ref name = "VeuveClicquot"/&gt;

}}The '''Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations''', passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13 February 1946 in New York, and sometimes referred to as the '''New York Convention''', defines and specifies numerous issues relating to the status of the United Nations, its assets, and officials, in terms of the privileges and immunities that must be granted to them by its [[United Nations member states|member states]]. As of February 2016, it has been ratified by 162 of the 193 UN member states.

On 21 November 1947, the '''Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies''' was adopted by GA resolution 179(II) to extend similar privileges to the [[specialized agencies]] of the UN. This convention has been ratified by 127 states.

== Key provisions ==
* Establishes Juridical personality of the UN (Art. I)
* UN premises shall be inviolable, and UN property shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation etc. (Art. II)
* UN shall be exempt from taxes and customs duties as well as prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports (Art. II)
* [[Diplomatic immunity]] of communications and mail (pouch) (Art. III)
* [[Functional immunity]] of delegates (Art. IV), officials (Art. V) and experts (Art. VI)
* Recognition of [[United Nations Laissez-Passer]] (Art. VII)

The conventions are in force ''"with regard to each State which has deposited an instrument of accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations as from the date of its deposit"'', i.e. not merely by a state's membership in the UN. Several states, for example the United States of America, have accepted the conventions only with some reservations.

{{Scots law|expanded=Civil courts}}
The '''Court of Session''' ({{lang-gd|Cùirt an t-Seisein}}; {{lang-sco|Coort o Session}}) is the [[Supreme court|supreme]] [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[Courts of Scotland|court of Scotland]] and constitutes part of the [[College of Justice]]; the supreme [[Criminal justice|criminal court]] of Scotland is the [[High Court of Justiciary]]. The Court of Session sits in [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] in [[Edinburgh]] and is both a [[trial court]] and a [[Appellate court|court of appeal]].  Decisions of the Court can be appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], with the permission of either the [[Inner House]] or the Supreme Court. The Court of Session and the local [[sheriff court]]s of Scotland have [[concurrent jurisdiction]] for all cases with a monetary value in excess of {{Currency|amount=100,000|code=GBP}}; the [[pursuer]] is given first choice of court. However, the majority of complex, important, or high value cases are brought in the Court of Session. Cases can be remitted to the Court of Session from the sheriff courts, including the [[Sheriff Personal Injury Court]], at the request of the presiding sheriff. [[Legal aid]], administered by the [[Scottish Legal Aid Board]], is available to persons with little [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable income]] for cases in the Court of Session.

The court is a unitary collegiate court, with all judges other than the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] and the [[Lord Justice Clerk]] holding the same rank and title—''[[Senator of the College of Justice]]'' and also ''Lord'' or ''Lady of Council and Session''. The Lord Lord President is [[Chief Justice|chief justice]] of the Court, and also head of the [[judiciary of Scotland]]; the Lord Justice Clerk is his deputy. There are 35 Senators, in addition to a number of temporary judges; these temporary judges are typically serving [[Sheriff Court|sheriffs]] and [[Sheriff principal|sheriffs principal]], or [[Faculty of Advocates|advocate]]s in private practice. The Senators sit also in the [[High Court of Justiciary]], where the Lord President is called the [[Lord Justice General]], and Senators are known as ''Lords Commissioners of Justiciary''.

The Court is divided into the [[Inner House]] of 12 Senators, which is primarily an [[appellate court|appeal court]], and the [[Outer House]], which is primarily a [[court of first instance]]. The Inner House is further divided into 2 divisions of 6 Senators: the 1st Division is presided over by the Lord President, and the 2nd Division is presided over by the Lord Justice Clerk. Cases in the Inner House are normally heard before a [[Bench (law)|bench]] of 3 Senators, through more complex or importance cases are presided over by 5 Senators. On very rare occasions the whole Inner House has presided over a case. Cases in the Outer House are heard by a single Senator sitting as a [[Lord Ordinary]], occasionally with a [[Trial by jury in Scotland|jury of twelve]].

The Court is administered by the [[Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service]], and the most senior [[Court clerk|clerk of court]] is the [[Principal Clerk of Session and Justiciary]]; the Principal Clerk is responsible for all court staff, and is also responsible for the administration of the [[High Court of Justiciary]].

The Court was established in 1532 by an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Act of the Parliament of Scotland]], and was initially presided over by the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]] and had equal numbers of [[clergy]] and [[laity]]. The judges were all appointed from the [[Privy Council of Scotland|King's Council]].

As of May 2017, the Lord President was [[Colin Sutherland, Lord Carloway|Lord Carloway]], who was appointed on 19 December 2015, and the Lord Justice Clerk was [[Leeona Dorrian, Lady Dorrian|Lady Dorrian]], who was appointed on 13 April 2016.

=== Courts Act 1672 ===
The Courts Act 1672 allowed for five of the Lords of Session to be appointed as [[Lords Commissioners of Justiciary]], and as such becomes judges of the [[High Court of Justiciary]]. The High Court of Justiciary is the [[Supreme court|supreme]] [[Criminal justice|criminal court]] of Scotland.

===Treaty of Union===
The Court of Session is explicitly preserved "in all time coming" in Article XIX of the [[Treaty of Union]] between England and Scotland, subsequently passed into legislation by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1706 and 1707 respectively.&lt;ref name="history_15th_to_18th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawscot.org.uk/media/3371/AGeneralHistoryofScotsLaw_15th18th.pdf|title=A General History of Scots Law (15th – 18th Centuries)|publisher=[[Law Society of Scotland]]|accessdate=2013-09-10}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th Century===

==== Court of Session Act 1810 ====
Several significant changes were made to the Court during the 19th century, with the [[Court of Session Act 1810]] formally dividing the Court of Session into the [[Outer House]] (with [[Trial court|first-instance jurisdiction]] before a [[Lord Ordinary]]) and [[Inner House]] (with [[appellate jurisdiction]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A History of Private Law in Scotland| first=Kenneth| last=Reid| isbn=0-19-829941-9| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases in the Outer House were to be heard by [[Lords Ordinary]] who either sat alone or with a [[Trial by jury in Scotland|jury of twelve]]. Cases in the Inner House were to be heard by three Lords of Council and Session, but significant or complicated cases were to be heard by five or more judges.&lt;ref name="history_private_law"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Private Law in Scotland|last=Reid|first=Kenneth|date=2000-12-21|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829941-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further separation was made in 1815, by the [[Jury Trials (Scotland) Act 1815]], with the creation of a lesser '''Jury Court''' to allow certain civil cases to be tried by jury.&lt;ref name="jury_court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/otherSeries.asp |title=Court of Session – other series |publisher=[[National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830 the Jury Court, along with the [[Admiralty Court|Admiralty]] and [[Commissary Court|Commissary]] Courts, was absorbed into the Court of Session following the enactment of the [[Court of Session Act 1830]].&lt;ref name="Shand"/&gt;

==== Judicial remuneration ====
In 1834 the [[remuneration]] and [[Working time|working conditions]] was a matter of public discussion and debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. On 6 May 1834 [[Sir George Sinclair, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Sinclair]] addressed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to plead for an increase in the salaries for the Senators, noting that "a Civil Judge in the Supreme Court in Scotland received only {{Currency|2,000|GBP}}" and the masters in the [[Court of Chancery]] were paid {{Currency|2,500|GBP}}.&lt;ref name="hansard_sinclair_1834"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1834/may/06/judges-salary-scotland#S3V0023P0_18340506_HOC_66|title=JUDGES' SALARY (SCOTLAND).

In October 1834, ''[[The Spectator]]'' reported on the conflicting views around the [[remuneration]] and [[Working time|working conditions]] of the judges of the Court of Session, with conflicting views being presented in response to the ''Report on the Scotch Judges' Salaries''. ''The Spectator'' reported the arguments made by [[Sir William Rae, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Rae]], [[Lord Advocate]], that the judges of the Court of Session had considerably duties, which he listed as:&lt;ref name="spectator_1834"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/18th-october-1834/12/administration-of-justice-in-scotland|title=ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN SCOTLAND. » 18 Oct 1834 » The Spectator Archive|last=|first=|date=18 October 2014|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=7 May 2017|publisher=The Spectator (1828) Ltd|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=On those thirteen are now devolved, first, all the duties that occur in the Court of Chancery in England ; second, all the duties that occur in the courts of Common Law in England, in civil matters; third, all the duties that devolve on the courts of Common Law in England as connected with criminal matters, including a large portion of those done in Quarter-sessions, inasmuch as the Sheriffs, who are the next in rank to the Justiciary Judges, are held incompetent to try any case when the punishment amounts to that of transportation ; fourth, all the duties of the Court of Exchequer, (the remaining Judges of that Court having by a subsequent act been abolished); fifth, all the duties connected with bankruptcy; sixth, a set of duties unknown in England, connected with the valuation and sale of tithes, and the augmentation of ministers' stipends out of the tithes—the tribunal for disposing of such matters it known by the name of the Teind Court ; seventh, the duties connected with the Court of Admiralty, and the duties connected with the Consistorial Courts.|sign=Sir William Rae|source=Evidence to Select Committee on Judges' Salaries (Scotland)}}

The Select Committee's Report recommended that the salaries of the Lord President, Lord Justice Clerk and remaining Senators should be increased, and also recommended that all Senators should become [[High Court of Justiciary|''Lords Commissioners of Justiciary'']]. The recommended salaries were:&lt;ref name="report_judges_salaries_1834" /&gt;
* Lord President: increase from {{Currency|4,300|GBP}} to {{Currency|5,300|GBP}}
* Lord Justice Clerk: increase from {{Currency|4,000|GBP}} to {{Currency|5,000|GBP}}
* Senator: increase from {{Currency|2,000|GBP}} to {{Currency|3,000|GBP}}
However, ''The Spectator'' was very critical of the actual amount of work done by the judges of the Court, noting that there was much public criticism of their effectiveness. The article noted that the judges were entitled to 7 months [[vacation]] in each year. ''The Spectator'' also asserted that civil justice was out of the reach of the poor in Scotland.&lt;ref name="spectator_1834" /&gt;

==== Unification of supreme courts judiciary ====
In 1887 all of the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Session]] were made Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, and thus judges of the [[High Court of Justiciary]], following the passage of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887.&lt;ref name="crim_proc_act_1887"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1887|chapter=35|act=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remit and jurisdiction==

===Civil cases===
The Court of Session is the [[Supreme court|supreme]] [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[Courts of Scotland|court]] of [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/legal/Civil|title=Courts and the Legal System – Civil Courts|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it shares [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the local [[sheriff court]]s over all cases with a value of more than {{Currency|amount=100,000|code=GBP}} (including [[Personal injury|personal injury claims]].) Where a choice of jurisdiction exists between the Court of Session and the sheriff courts, including the [[Sheriff Personal Injury Court]], it is for the pursuer to decide which court to raise the action in.&lt;ref name="sheriffexclusive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.judicialappointments.scot/sites/default/files/files/information_pages/The%20Office%20of%20Sheriff.doc|title=The Office of Sheriff|website=www.judicialappointments.scot|publisher=Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland|page=6|language=en|format=DOC|quote=23) A sheriff has exclusive competence to deal with civil proceedings where the total value of the orders sought does not exceed £100,000.|author1=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court sits in [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] in [[Edinburgh]] and is both a [[trial court]] and a court of [[appeal]].&lt;ref name="Session Introduction" /&gt;

===Exchequer cases===
The primary task of the Court of Session is to decide on civil law cases. The court is also the [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|Court of Exchequer for Scotland]], a jurisdiction previously held by the [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|Court of Exchequer]]. (In 1856, the functions of that court were transferred to the Court of Session, and one of the [[Lord Ordinary|Lords Ordinary]] sits as ''Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Causes'' when hearing cases therein.) This was restated by the [[Court of Session Act 1988]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856 |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| url= http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1856/56/ukpga/c56/1| volume=1856| issue=56 | page=1 |  quote=The whole power, authority, and jurisdiction at present belonging to the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, as at present constituted, shall be transferred to and vested in the Court of Session, and the Court of Session shall be also the Court of Exchequer in Scotland. |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]] |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Section 3,Court of Session Act 1988 | url= http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1988/36/ukpga/c36/partI/3 | periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament | volume=1988 | issue=36 |page=I(3) |quote=One of the judges of the Court who usually sits as a Lord Ordinary shall be appointed by the Lord President to act as Lord Ordinary in exchequer causes, and no other judge shall so act unless and until such judge is appointed in his place | publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 48, Rules of the Court of Session |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/Chapter48.asp  |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |quote=Exchequer causes |accessdate=2007-11-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321115808/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/Chapter48.asp |archivedate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Nobile officium'' ===
The jurisdiction of the Court of Session extends beyond statutory and common law powers, with the Court having an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] and [[inherent jurisdiction]] called the ''nobile officium''.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |year=2015 |title=''The Nobile Officium: The Extraordinary Equitable Jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Scotland''| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Avizandum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nobile officium'' enables the Court to provide a [[legal remedy]] where [[statute]] or the [[common law]] are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to [[injustice]]. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to [[precedent]], and when [[Primary and secondary legislation|legislation]] or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a [[statutory power]], but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a ''casus improvisus''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/|title=Nobile officium used to recognise English High Court orders due to statutory casus improvisus {{!}} The Nobile Officium|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uwH8m1opGboJ:https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|archive-date=2 Apr 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=J.

The ''nobile officium'' was used to implement recognition of an [[Court order|order]] of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] for the placement of children in secure accommodation in Scotland, in the case of ''Cumbria County Council, Petitioners [2016] CSIH 92''. An application was made to the Court of Session under the ''nobile officium'' by [[Cumbria County Council]], [[Stockport|Stockport Metropolitan Council]], and [[Blackpool Borough Council]] on behalf of 4 children. There was insufficient accommodation in England to house the children, so the Councils sought to place them in suitable Scottish accommodation. However, legislation was silent on the cross-border jurisdiction of such orders as made by the High Court of Justice. Nonetheless, equivalent orders made by a Scottish court were enforceable in [[England and Wales]]. Thus, the Court of Session found, using its inherent powers, that the orders could be applied as though they had been issued by the Court of Session itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Cumbria County Council, Petitioners|court=Court of Session, Inner House|reporter=CSIH|vol=2016|opinion=92|date=19 October 2016|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=00df25a7-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Appellate jurisdiction===
Appeals in the Court of Session are generally heard by the [[Inner House]] before three judges, although in important cases in which there is a conflict of authority a court of five judges or, exceptionally, seven, may be convened. The Inner House is sub-divided into two divisions of equal authority and jurisdiction - the First Division, headed by the Lord President; and the Second Division headed by the Lord Justice Clerk. The courts to hear each case are, ordinarily, drawn from these divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Session Act 1988: {{cite web|title=Part I Constitution and Administration of the Court |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880036_en_2#pt1|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Divisions: {{cite web|title=Court of Session - Judges |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/judges.asp|publisher=[[Scottish Courts Service]] |accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When neither is available to chair a hearing, an Extra Division of three Senators is summoned, chaired by the most senior judge present; due to pressure of business this Extra Division sits frequently nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;Information on composition: {{cite web|title=Court of Session - Introduction |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/|publisher=[[Scottish Courts Service]] |accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2015 [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] that went to a [[Hearing (law)|full proof]] (hearing) in the [[sheriff court]]s of Scotland could be appealed by right to the [[Inner House]] of the Court of Session. [[Appellant]]s could take the appeal to a [[sheriff principal]] for an initial appeal, and then onto the Inner House, or they could take the appeal directly to the Inner House.&lt;ref name="beckman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckman|first=Gail McKnight|date=January 1972|title=The Availability of Legal Services to Poor People and People of Limited Means in Foreign Systems|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/intlyr6&amp;collection=journals&amp;startid=&amp;endid=178&amp;id=172|journal=International Lawyer|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|volume=6|issue=1|pages=162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[appellate jurisdiction]] of [[sheriff principal|sheriffs principal]] for all civil cases (including summary cause and [[small claims court|small claims actions]]) was transferred to the [[Sheriff Appeal Court]] following passage of the [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]]. The 2014 Act also modified the appellate jurisdiction of the Inner House with civil appeals from the sheriff courts being heard by an Appeal Sheriff sitting in the Sheriff Appeal Court. Such appeals are binding on all sheriff courts in Scotland, and appeals can only be remitted (transferred) to the Inner House where they are deemed to be of wider public interest, raise a significant [[question of law|point of law]], or are particularly complex:&lt;ref name="act_2014_c18" /&gt;

The [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath of Allegiance]] is taken by holders of political office in Scotland before the Lord President of the Court of Session at a meeting of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Schedule, Promissory Oaths Act 1868 |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1868/72/ukpga/c72/schedule |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| year=1868| volume=72| page=Schedule| accessdate=2009-09-01| quote=The oath as to England is to be tendered by the Clerk of the Council, and taken in presence of Her Majesty in Council, or otherwise as Her Majesty shall direct.

=== Acts of Sederunt ===
[[Scots civil procedure|Civil procedure in Scotland]] is regulated by the Court of Session through [[Act of Sederunt|Acts of Sederunt]], which are [[subordinate legislation]] and take legal force as [[Scottish Statutory Instrument]]s. The power to enact Acts of Sederunt is granted by the [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]] and the [[Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014]], which replaced powers regulated by the [[Court of Session Act|Court of Session Act 1988]] and the [[Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971]].&lt;ref name="act_2014_c10"&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|act=Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014|chapter=10|type=act|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Section 5 Session 1988"&gt;{{citation|title=Section 5, Court of Session Act 1988 (as enacted)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/36/section/5/enacted|quote=The Court shall have power by act of sederunt...|periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament|volume=1988|issue=36|pages=II(5)|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="act_2014_c18"&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|act=Court Reforms (Scotland) Act 2014|chapter=18|type=act|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1971-c-58"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1971|chapter=58|act=Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are generally incorporated into the Rules of Court, which are published by the [[Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service]] and form the basis for [[Scots civil procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/index.asp|title=Rules of the Court of Session|publisher=[[Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service]]|accessdate=2009-08-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826111933/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/index.asp|archivedate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts of Sederunt regulate civil procedure in the Court of Session, the [[sheriff court]]s of Scotland (including the [[Sheriff Appeal Court]] and [[Sheriff Personal Injury Court]]), and in the tribunals of Scotland. The Court of Session can amend or [[repeal]] any [[Enactment (British legal term)|enactment]], including [[Primary and secondary legislation|primary legislation]], if it relates to matters an ''Act of Sederunt'' may cover. Rules for regulating civil procedure are decided upon by the [[Scottish Civil Justice Council]] before being presented to the Lords of Session for decision; the Lords of Session may approve, amend or reject the rules so presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishciviljusticecouncil.gov.uk/rule-making|title=Rule Making|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scottishciviljusticecouncil.gov.uk|publisher=Scottish Civil Justice Council|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rule Making"&gt;{{citation|title=Rule-Making in the Courts of the Empire|year=1915|author=Samuel Rosenbaum|series=New Series|periodical=Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation|volume=15|issue=2|pages=132–133|jstor=752486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Houses and Lords Ordinary ===
The Court of Session constitutes part of the [[College of Justice]], and is divided into two houses. The [[Lord Ordinary|Lords Ordinary]] sit in the Outer House, and usually singly. The Lords of Council and Session sit in the Inner House, typically in threes. The nature of cases referred to the Court of Session will determine which house that case shall be heard in.

===Inner House===
{{main|Inner House}}
The Inner House is the senior part of the Court of Session, and is both a [[Appeal|court of appeal]] and a [[Trial court|court of first instance]]. The Inner House has historically been the main locus of an extraordinary equitable power called the ''nobile officium'' - the High Court of Justiciary has a similar power in criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Stephen|title=The Nobile Officium:  The Extraordinary Equitable Jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Scotland|date=2015|publisher=Avizandum|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criminal law|Criminal]] [[appeal]]s in [[Scotland]] are handled by the [[High Court of Justiciary]] sitting as the [[Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Part V, Court of Session Act 1988| url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1988/36/ukpga/c36/partV | periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=1988| issue=36| page=V | publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]| quote=Appeal and Review | accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/justiciary/index.asp | title=High Court of Justiciary – Introduction| quote=The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland's supreme criminal court… When exercising its appellate jurisdiction it sits only in Edinburgh.| publisher=[[Scottish Courts Service]]| accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Section 228, Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975| periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=1975| url= http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1975/21/ukpga/c21/228| issue=21| page=V(228) | quote=Any person convicted on indictment may, with leave granted in accordance with section 230A of this Act, appeal in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act, to the High Court| accessdate=2009-09-02| publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inner House]] is the part of the Court of Session which acts as a [[court of appeal]] for cases decided the Outer House&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Part V, Court of Session Act 1988 |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880036_en_5#pt5 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | volume=1988| issue=36| page=V | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of civil cases from the [[Sheriff Court]]s, the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]], [[Scottish Land Court]], and the [[Lands Tribunal for Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Courts and Tribunals |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/07/16971 |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inner House always sits as a panel of at least three Senators and with no jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court of Session – Introduction |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/ |quote= Each division is made up of five Judges, but the quorum is three.| publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in the [[High Court of Justiciary]], there is a right of appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] of cases from the [[Inner House]]. The right of appeal only exists when the Court of Session grants leave to this effect or when the decision of the [[Inner House]] is by majority. Until the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] came into force in October 2009, this right of appeal was to the [[House of Lords]]&lt;ref name="Supreme" /&gt; (or sometimes to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]).

===Outer House===
{{main|Outer House}}The Outer House is a court of first instance, although some statutory appeals are remitted to it by the Inner House. Such appeals are originally referred from the sheriff courts, the court of first instance for civil causes in the court system of Scotland. Judges in the Outer House are referred to as ''Lord or Lady [name]'', or as ''[[Lord Ordinary]]''. The Outer House is superficially similar to the [[High Court]] in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/lord-mackay039s-courts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426005043/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/lord-mackay039s-courts |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in this house judges sit singly—and with a [[jury]] of twelve in personal injury or defamation actions.&lt;ref name="Session Introduction" /&gt; [[Subject-matter jurisdiction]] is extensive and extends to all kinds of civil claims unless expressly excluded by statute, and it shares much of this jurisdiction with the [[Sheriff court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Civil Pleading in Scotland |periodical=Michigan Law Review| author=Robert Wyness Millar |volume=30 | issue=4| year=1932 | pages=546–547|  jstor=1280689 | publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes of cases, such as intellectual property disputes, are heard by an individual judge designated by the Lord President as the jurist for intellectual property cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Chapter 55 – Causes relating to intellectual property| url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/chapter55.asp | periodical=Rules of the Court of Session| volume=2006| page=55.2| quote=All proceedings in the Outer House in a cause to which this chapter applies shall be brought before a judge of the court nominated by the Lord President as the intellectual property judge or, where the intellectual property judge is not available, any other judge of the court (including the vacation judge).| publisher=[[Scottish Courts Service]]| accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080207052440/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/chapter55.asp |archivedate = 2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Final judgments of the Outer House, as well as some important judgements on procedure, may be appealed to the Inner House. Other judgments may be so appealed with leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Section 28, Court of Session Act 1988| url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1988/36/ukpga/c36/partV/28 | periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=1988| issue=36| page=V(28) | quote= Any party to a cause initiated in the Outer House either by a summons or a petition who is dissatisfied with an interlocutor pronounced by the Lord Ordinary may, except as otherwise prescribed, reclaim against that interlocutor within such period after the interlocutor is pronounced, and in such manner, as may be prescribed.| publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]| accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lands Valuation Appeal Court ===
The [[Lands Valuation Appeal Court]] is a Scottish [[Scottish civil court|civil court]], composed of 3 Court of Session judges, and established under Section 7 of the Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Amendment Act 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|year=1879|chapter=42|type=act|act=Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Amendment Act 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hears cases where the decision of a local [[Valuation Appeal Committee]] is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Government/local-government/17999/11199/brief-guide/valuationappeal|title=Non-Domestic Rates -  Valuation Appeals|last=|first=|date=10 February 2010|website=www.gov.scot|publisher=Scottish Government|language=en-gb|access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senator of the College of Justice|Senators]] who make up the Lands Valuation Appeal Court was specified in 2013 by the Act of Sederunt (Lands Valuation Appeal Court) 2013, which has both [[Colin Sutherland, Lord Carloway|Lord Carloway]] ([[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]]) and [[Leeona Dorrian, Lady Dorrian|Lady Dorria]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n ([[Lord Justice Clerk]]) as members with a further four Senators specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2013|number=161|ssi=Act of Sederunt (Lands Valuation Appeal Court) 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of audience==
Members of the [[Faculty of Advocates]], known as [[advocate]]s or [[counsel]], and as of 1990 also some [[solicitors]], known as [[solicitor-advocate]]s, have practically exclusive [[right of audience]] rights of audience in the court.&lt;ref name="aboutsession"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Court of Session|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/the-courts/supreme-courts/about-the-court-of-session|website=www.scotcourts.gov.uk|publisher=Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barristers in England and Wales|Barristers]] from [[England and Wales]] have no right of audience, which caused controversy in 2011 (over an appeal from an immigration tribunal)&lt;ref name="barrister2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=English barrister refused right of audience in immigration tribunal in Scotland - Free Movement|url=https://www.freemovement.org.uk/english-barrister-refused-right-of-audience-in-immigration-tribunal-in-scotland/|website=Free Movement|publisher=Free Movement|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2015 (over an appeal from a tax tribunal)&lt;ref name="barrister2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=1532 law keeps English barrister out of Scotland's highest court|url=http://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/1532-law-keeps-english-barrister-out-of-scotlands-highest-court|website=Legal Futures|publisher=Legal Futures Publishing Limited|accessdate=6 April 2017|date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when barristers recognised by the [[General Council of the Bar]] were denied the right to take an appeal on behalf of clients they had represented at tribunal.

The court's [[Chief Justice|president]] is the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]], the second most senior judge is the [[Lord Justice Clerk]], with a further 33 [[Senators of the College of Justice]] holding office as Lords of Council and Session. The total numbers of judges is fixed by Section 1 of the Court of Session Act 1988, and subject to amendment by [[Order in Council]].&lt;ref name="act1988p1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1 {{!}} Court of Session Act 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/36/part/I|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en|date=29 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="2016-ssi-423"&gt;{{cite legislation Scotland|type=ssi|year=2016|number=423|ssi=The Maximum Number of Judges (Scotland) Order 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are appointed for life, subject to dismissal if they are found unfit for office, and subject to a compulsory retirement age of 75.&lt;ref name="retirement1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 26 of Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/8/section/26|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=29 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary judges can also be appointed.

The court is a unitary collegiate court, with all judges other than the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] and the [[Lord Justice Clerk]] holding the same rank and title—''[[Senator of the College of Justice]]'' and also ''Lord'' or ''Lady of Council and Session''.&lt;ref name="Session Introduction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court of Session – Introduction |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/|publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are thirty-four judges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/Upload/Documents/JudgesDivisions_feb13.pdf|title=Judges' Divisions February 2013|publisher=Judiciary of Scotland|date=February 2013|accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to a number of temporary judges; these temporary judges are typically [[Sheriff Court|sheriffs]], or [[advocate]]s in private practice. The judges sit also in the [[High Court of Justiciary]], where the Lord President is called the [[Lord Justice General]].&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{citation | title=Section 2, Paragraph 1, Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/2008/6/asp | periodical=Acts of the Scottish Parliament | volume=2008 | issue=6 | page=2(1) | accessdate=2009-08-29 | quote=The Lord President is the Head of the Scottish Judiciary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Section 18, Court of Session Act 1830| url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1830/69/ukpga| periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=69| page=18| quote=Office of lord justice general to devolve on lord president.| date=1830-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the First Minister must consult the Lord President (for all other judges) and the Lord Justice Clerk (when the Lord President is under investigation.) Should the tribunal recommend their dismissal the [[Scottish Parliament]] can resolve that the First Minister make a recommendation to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the Monarch]].&lt;ref name="removal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 5 of Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2008/6/part/2/chapter/5|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=3 April 2017|language=en|date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial independence|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/Upload/Documents/JudicialIndependence_2.pdf|website=judiciary-scotland.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017|language=en|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of exoneration of liens''' (sometimes simply referred to as "'''doctrine of exoneration'''") refers to a [[common law]] rule. The rule says that encumbrances (i.e. a [[mortgage law|mortgage]]) of a property conveyed by a [[Will (law)|will]] is discharged with funds from the originating [[Estate (law)|estate]], not from the property itself.&lt;ref name=WT&amp;E&gt;

The '''Financial Markets Authority''' (FMA) is the New Zealand government agency responsible for [[financial regulation]].  It is responsible for regulating all financial market participants, exchanges and the setting and enforcing of financial regulations.

==History==
{{See also|Finance company collapses, 2006-12 (New Zealand)}}
The authority was established on the 1st of May 2011 as part of the ''Financial Markets (Regulators and KiwiSaver) Bill'' which was passed by the New Zealand parliament on the 7 April 2011.  It was established in a wake of criticism over the failure of the previous regulatory regime to halt the failure of a large number of finance companies and to stem investor losses in the period between 2006 and 2010. It was introduced by Commerce Minister Simon Power as a "super regulator" whose purpose was to restore investor confidence battered by the finance company meltdown and global financial crisis. "This move is at the centre of the Government's drive to restore the confidence of mum and dad investors in our financial markets," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fma.govt.nz/news/releases-from-the-minister-of-commerce/new-financial-watchdog-to-be-up-and-running-in-three-weeks/|title = New Financial Watchdog to Be Up and Running in Three Weeks|date = April 7, 2011|publisher = Financial Markets Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authority took over the functions of the [[Securities Commission of New Zealand]] and Government Actuary which were disestablished, and consolidates other regulatory functions which were fragmented across the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)]]  the Companies Office and its National Enforcement Unit.&lt;ref name=threeweeks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1104/S00163/new-financial-watchdog-to-be-up-and-running-in-three-weeks.htm |title=New Financial Watchdog to Be Up and Running in Three Weeks |author=New Zealand government |publisher=scoop.co.nz |date=7 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The FMA is controlled by a board appointed by the Minister of Commerce and run by chief executive Rob Everett.  The board comprises chairman Murray Jack and members Arthur Grimes, Campbell Stuart, Mark Todd, Mary Holm, Shelley Cave, Vanessa Stoddart, and William Stevens.&lt;ref name=threeweeks/&gt;

== Priorities ==
The FMA's official website says its key statutory objective is "to promote and facilitate the development of fair, efficient, and transparent financial markets" and that it "will use the full range of its enforcement powers, targeting conduct that presents the greatest likelihood of harm to the function of open, transparent and efficient capital markets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fma.govt.nz/fmas-role/what-we-do/how-we-regulate/enforcement-policy/ FMA Enforcement Policy], FMA website&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was established in 2011, it has been involved in legal action against [[Bridgecorp]], KA Trustee Ltd, Perpetual, [[Hanover Finance]], [[Lombard Finance]], Sean Wood, Nathans Finance, Bernard Whimp and David Ross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fma.govt.nz/news/court-decisions/ FMA Court Decisions], FMA Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act''', also known as the '''Kingpin Act''', became law by the enactment of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. The U.S. [[Illegal drug trade|international narcotics trafficking]] [[Bill (law)|bill]] was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as {{USBill|106|H.R.|3164}} on October 28, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-106hr3164ih/pdf/BILLS-106hr3164ih.pdf |title=H.R. 3164  (IH) - Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act |website=GPO's Federal Digital System |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingpin Act [[legislation]] passed by a margin of three hundred and eighty-five to twenty-six ({{US House Vote|1999|555}}) in the United States House of Representatives on November 2, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll555.xml |title=Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act - H.R. 3164 |date=November 2, 1999 |website=[[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|Office of the Clerk]] |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The H.R. 1555 [[Act of Congress]] was passed by the 106th U.S. Congressional session and enacted into law by the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|42nd President of the United States]] Bill Clinton on December 3, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=57021 |title= William J.

==Purpose of Act==
According to the [[White House]], "Its purpose is to deny significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their related businesses, and their operatives access to the U.S. financial system and to prohibit all trade and transactions between the traffickers and U.S. companies and individuals.  The Kingpin Act authorizes the President to take these actions when he determines that a foreign person plays a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.  Congress modeled the Kingpin Act on the effective sanctions program that the Department of the Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] ("OFAC") administers against the Colombian drug cartels pursuant to [[Executive Order 12978]] issued in October 1995 ("Executive Order 12978") under authority of the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] ("IEEPA")."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Fact-Sheet-Overview-of-the-Foreign-Narcotics-Kingpin-Designation-Act |title=FACT SHEET: Overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210035917/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Fact-Sheet-Overview-of-the-Foreign-Narcotics-Kingpin-Designation-Act |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement of act==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' has said that the act has been used for the US to pursue dozens of criminal organizations involved in narcotics across the world. It also wrote that, "The act allows the Treasury Department to freeze any assets of the cartels found in United States jurisdictions and to prosecute Americans who help the cartels handle their money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1D6173FF935A25757C0A96F9C8B63 |title=Obama Takes Aim at Finances Of Three Mexican Drug Cartels |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2013 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |author=SHERYL GAY STOLBERG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2015 the [[Honduras|Honduran]] [[Banco Continental (Honduras)|Banco Continental]] was the first time the act had been used against a bank outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/10/07/powerful-honduran-businessman-accused-of-money-laundering|date=2015-10-09 |title=Powerful Honduran businessman indicted in US for alleged money laundering for drug traffickers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issuance of a Finding of Violation to BBVA Compass. On 7/27/2016, the OFAC issued a Finding of Violation to Compass Bank, which uses the trade name BBVA Compass ("Compass"), for violations of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 598 (FNKSR).  Due to a technical error with certain filtering software, Compass unknowingly maintained accounts on behalf of two individuals on OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the "SDN List").  Although OFAC found Compass to be technically in violation, no transactions occurred from the accounts during the time the individuals were on the SDN list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''Freenet''' is a [[Private mobile radio|personal mobile radio]] network in [[Germany]]. It was originally introduced in 1996 as a product name of [[Motorola]] and uses part of the frequency spectrum of the former [[B-Netz]] carphone network.

The original frequency allocation for Freenet encompassed three channels, each with a 12.5&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing. In January 2007, three additional channels were added, bringing the total up to six.

The ordinance only permits handheld transceivers which must not permit an [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) of 500&amp;nbsp;mW. Only specially certified and licensed transceivers may be used; the manufacturer must provide a declaration of conformity as well as a concise manual in German and a [[CE mark]]. The user is not permitted to modify the device.
The [[Federal Network Agency]] has laid out strict parameters for modulation, bandwidth and channel spacing in its ordinance.

In practice, relatively high prices for Freenet devices have kept away domestic users from the service. Oftentimes, modified [[amateur radio]] transceivers are used, violating the restrictions for the Freenet service.

With the maximum permitted ERP of 500&amp;nbsp;mW, a range of 1&amp;nbsp;km can be assumed. Due to the lower frequencies in the [[VHF]] band, signal attenuation from objects, such as houses and trees, is not as high as in the [[UHF]] band used by [[Short Range Devices|SRD]] and [[PMR446]] radios.

Originally, the Freenet frequencies were allocated until the end of 2005. The Federal Network Agency has extended this allocation until 31 January 2025.&lt;ref name=Allgemeinzuteilung2025&gt;{{cite web|title=Neue "Freenet"-Allgemeinzuteilung - Nutzung bis Ende 2025 verlängert|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.funkmagazin.de/230315.htm|deadurl=|accessdate=2015-03-29|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=FM - DAS FUNKMAGAZIN|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==Gateways==
Seit neustem (Zeitpunkt unbekannt) ist es möglich, über HF-Gateways weite Distanzen via Internet zu überbrücken. Hier wird ein Programm (z.&amp;nbsp;B. [[eQSO]], TS2 und auch TS3 oder [[Free Radio Network|FRN]]) eingerichtet, welches die empfangenen Audiosignale vom CB-Funk-, PMR-, Freenet oder SRD-Funkgerät ins Internet überträgt und an einem anderen Ort über ein CB-Funk-, PMR-, Freenet- oder SRD-Funkgerät wieder aussendet (''siehe auch [[VoIP]]'').--&gt;

==Freenet abroad==
Freenet is a national radio allocation that is used in Germany only. Foreign regulatory bodies usually do not permit use of Freenet devices since the frequencies are often already allocated for different radio services. Instead, [[PMR446]] has been harmonised on a European level.
Due to possible interference with Swiss military networks, it is not permitted to use the Freenet frequencies in the [[Black Forest]] and on the [[Swabian Alb]] at elevations of 600 metres or above.

'''Graft''', as understood in American English, is a form of [[political corruption]], being the unscrupulous use of a politician's authority for personal gain. The term has its origins in the [[graft (surgery)|medical procedure]] whereby tissue is removed from one location and attached to another for which it was not originally intended. Similarly, political graft occurs when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to private interests. 

==Description==
Political graft functions when the public officer is directed to purchase goods or services from a specific private interest at a cost far above regular market rates. The private interest then siphons some of the gratuitous profits to government officials that are able to ensure that future government spending continues in the same fashion so that this lucrative relationship continues. A member of a government may misappropriate directly from government funds, but they may also make decisions benefiting their own private economic interests by using inside knowledge of upcoming government decisions to their benefit, in a manner similar to [[insider trading]].

Although the conflict between public and private interests is common to all forms of corruption, the term "graft" is specific to the intentional misdirection of official funds. Although not the original usage of the term, graft in the modern context is commonly, but mistakenly, used as a blanket term for political [[embezzlement]], [[influence peddling]], or other forms of corruption. While [[embezzlement]] and influence peddling are elements sometimes present in graft, the relationship is not deterministic.{{citation needed|date= July 2016}}

==In popular culture==
Graft is exemplified in the film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'': A local political boss has insider knowledge of a government dam building project that will necessitate the purchase of certain tracts of land. In order to make a hefty profit, he purchases the land in advance so that he may charge the government exorbitant prices to buy the land it needs to complete the dam.

The system is configured on the [[Columbus – External Payload Facility]], which is a platform on the exterior of the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module where it is used to perform experiments to help NASA determine which cameras work best in outer space.&lt;ref name="nasaspaceflight081413" /&gt; The cameras are enclosed in a temperature-specific housing and exposed to the harsh radiation of space.&lt;ref name="nasa-32514" /&gt;

The German educational project [http://www.columbuseye.uni-bonn.de/ “Columbus Eye - Live Imagery from the ISS in Schools”], which is executed by the [[University of Bonn]] and is funded by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR), aims at the implementation of the ISS live imagery and videos in a web portal. It primarily acts as a learning portal for pupils, but also serves as a free access archive for the footage of the ISS HDEV cameras. Columbus Eye accompanied the ISS mission of the German [[ESA]] astronaut [[Alexander Gerst]] (May to November 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgpf.de/neu/Proc2014/proceedings/papers/Beitrag112.pdf Rienow, A.; Hodam, H. &amp; Menz, G.

The court (Bandaranayake, Chandra Ekanayake and [[K. Sripavan]]) met on 21 November 2011 to hear the petition. The court's determination (S.C. Special Determination No. 03/2011) was conveyed to [[Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka|Speaker]] [[Chamal Rajapaksa]], another brother of President Rajapaksa, on 2 December 2011 and on 3 December 2011 the Speaker announced the determination to Parliament: the bill was in respect of matters set out in the provincial council list and therefore cannot become law unless it has been referred to every provincial council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parliamentary Debates: Official Report|journal=Hansard|date=3 December 2011|volume=205|issue=3|pages=424–430|url=http://www.parliament.lk/news/ViewPublication.do?published=Y&amp;documentID=PUB3686|publisher=[[Parliament of Sri Lanka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirinde|first=Chandani|title=Land takeover: SC refuses to give ruling|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/111204/News/nws_03.html|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government withdrew the bill from parliament and referred it to the nine provincial councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Indrajith|first=Saman|title=Govt. withdraws Bill|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=40695|newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)]]|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial councils expressed concern about the bill and suggested amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perera|first=Yohan|title=PCs to amend Town and Country Planning Bill|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/news/16776-amendment-to-amendment-.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)]]|date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Town and Country Planning Act stuck at PCs for scrutiny|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/120212/News/nws_15.html|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by the [[Sri Lanka Muslim Congress]] and [[Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal]], both members of the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] (UPFA), President Rajapaksa's party, as well as the opposition [[United National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abeywickrema|first=Mandana Ismail|title=Govt.

The court (Bandaranayake, Priyasath Dep and Eva Wanasundera) met on 27 and 28 August 2012 to hear the petitions. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa announced the Supreme Court's determinations (S.C. Special Determination No. 01/2012, 02/2012 and 03/2012) to Parliament on 18 September 2012: the bill was in respect of matters set out in the provincial council list and therefore cannot become law unless it has been referred to every provincial council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parliamentary Debates: Official Report|journal=Hansard|date=18 September 2012|volume=210|issue=10|pages=1045–1069|url=http://www.parliament.lk/news/ViewPublication.do?documentID=PUB4100|publisher=[[Parliament of Sri Lanka]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102063740/http://www.parliament.lk/news/ViewPublication.do?documentID=PUB4100|archivedate=2 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Divi Negum bill needs approval of Provincial Councils|url=http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=19701|newspaper=adaderana.lk|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bastians|first=Dharisha|title=TNA moves to restrain Northern Governor on Divi Neguma Bill|url=http://www.ft.lk/2012/10/04/tna-moves-to-restrain-northern-governor-on-divi-neguma-bill/|newspaper=[[Daily FT]]|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPFA controlled eight of the nine provincial councils and between 25 September 2012 and 3 October 2012 all eight approved the Divi Neguma Bill. The ninth provincial council, [[Northern Provincial Council|Northern]], had not been functioning as an elected body since it was established in 2007. The bill was approved by the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]]'s [[List of Governors of Northern Province|Governor]] [[G. A.

The bill then returned to Parliament and a further eleven petitions were placed before the Supreme Court challenging the bill's constitutionality. Amongst these petitions was one filed on 4 October 2012 by opposition MP [[Mavai Senathirajah]] challenging the legality of Chandrasiri's approving the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SL Supreme Court to decide on governor’s approval to Divineguma bill|url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=35656|newspaper=[[TamilNet]]|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court (Bandaranayake, N.

The Supreme Court (N. G. Amaratunga, Priyasath Dep and K.

On 28 January 2015 the government of Sri Lanka, having removed all obstacles for Bandaranayake to hold her position as the 43rd Chief Justice by the President Maithripala Sirisena, on the grounds that her 2013 impeachment was unlawful and as such the appointment of Mohan Peiris, her successor, was void ''Ab initio''.

{{Equitable doctrines}}
An '''injunction''' is an [[equitable remedy]] in the form of a [[court order]] that compels a party to do or refrain from specific acts. A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or [[civil penalty|civil penalties]], including possible monetary sanctions and even imprisonment. They can also be charged with [[contempt of court]]. '''Counterinjunctions''' are injunctions that stop or reverse the enforcement of another injunction.

==Rationale==
The injunction is an equitable remedy,&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a remedy that originated in the English [[Court of equity|courts of equity]]. Like other equitable remedies, it has traditionally been given when a wrong cannot be effectively remedied by an award of money damages. (The doctrine that reflects this is the requirement that an injunction can be given only when there is "no adequate remedy at law.") Injunctions are intended to make whole again someone whose rights have been violated. Nevertheless, when deciding whether to grant an injunction, courts also take into account the interests of non-parties (that is, the public interest). When deciding whether to give an injunction, and deciding what its scope should be, courts give special attention to questions of fairness and good faith. One manifestation of this is that injunctions are subject to equitable defenses, such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]] and [[unclean hands]].&lt;ref name="Little Bit of Laches"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2376080 |title=A Little Bit of Laches Goes a Long Way: Notes on Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. |volume=67 |page=1 |journal=[[Vanderbilt Law Review En Banc]] |first=Samuel |last=Bray|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injunctions are given in many different kinds of cases. They can prohibit future violations of the law, such as trespass to real property, infringement of a patent, or the violation of a constitutional right (e.g., the free exercise of religion). Or they can require the defendant to repair past violations of the law.

An injunction can require someone to do something, like clean up an oil spill or remove a [[spite fence]]. Or it can prohibit someone from doing something, like using an illegally obtained trade secret. An injunction that requires conduct is called a "mandatory injunction." An injunction that prohibits conduct is called a "prohibitory injunction."&lt;ref name="Dobbs"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dobbs | first = Dan | year = 1993 | title = Law of Remedies: Damages—Equity—Restitution | edition = 2 | publisher = West Publishing Co. | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | isbn = 0-314-00913-2 | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many injunctions are both—that is, they have both mandatory and prohibitory components, because they require some conduct and forbid other conduct.

When an injunction is given, it can be enforced with equitable enforcement mechanisms such as contempt.&lt;ref&gt;International Union, United Mine Workers of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be modified or dissolved (upon a proper motion to the court) if circumstances change in the future.&lt;ref name="Jost"&gt;{{cite journal |title=From Swift to Stotts and Beyond: Modification of Injunctions in the Federal Courts |volume=64 |page=1101 |journal=[[Texas Law Review]]|first=Timothy Stoltzfus |last=Jost|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features of the injunction allow a court granting one to manage the behavior of the parties. That is the most important distinction between the injunction and another non-monetary remedy in American law, the declaratory judgment.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2330050 |title=The Myth of the Mild Declaratory Judgment |volume=63 |page=1091 |journal=[[Duke Law Journal]]|first=Samuel |last=Bray|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way these two remedies are distinguished is that the declaratory judgment is sometimes available at an earlier point in a dispute than the injunction.&lt;ref name="Myth" /&gt;

==In United States law==

===Form===

Injunctions in the United States tend to come in three main forms, temporary injunctions, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions.&lt;ref name="aba"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Injunctions|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/14/winter-2014/understanding-injunctions.html|website=Insights|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is an Injunction|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/what-injunction|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For both temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, the goal is usually to preserve the status quo until the court is able to decide the case.

====Temporary restraining orders====
A special kind of injunction that may be issued before trial is called a "temporary restraining order" or TRO. A TRO may be issued without notice to the other party or a hearing. A TRO will be given only for a short period of time before a court can schedule a hearing at which the restrained person may appear and contest the order. If the TRO is contested, the court must decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction. Temporary restraining orders are often, but not exclusively, given to prevent domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, or harassment.&lt;ref name="alel"/&gt;

====Preliminary injunctions====
Preliminary injunctions are given before trial. Because they are issued at an early stage, before the court has heard the evidence and made a decision in the case, they are more rarely given. The requirements for a preliminary injunction tend to be the same as for a permanent injunction, with the additional requirement that the party asking for the injunction is likely to succeed on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9332929800353837765|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent injunctions====
Permanent injunctions are issued after trial. Different federal and state courts sometimes have slightly different requirements for obtaining a permanent injunction. Typical requirements include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388 (2006)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4819344338954570996|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A.W. Chesterton Co., Inc. v. Chesterton, 128 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6847254962391449413|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# that without an injunction the plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury or harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law;
# that the balance of hardships does strongly cut against giving an injunction; and
# that the injunction would not disserve the public interest.

The balance of hardships inquiry is also sometimes called the "undue hardship defense".&lt;ref name="Neglected Defense"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2040896 |title=The Neglected Defense of Undue Hardship (and the Doctrinal Train Wreck in Boomer v. Atlantic Cement) |volume=4 |page=1 |journal=[[Journal of Tort Law]] |first=Douglas |last=Laycock|year=2012 |doi=10.1515/1932-9148.1123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use===
Injunctions have been especially important at two moments in American history.

First, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, federal courts used injunctions to break strikes by unions. For example, after the [[United States government]] successfully used an injunction to outlaw the [[Pullman Strike|Pullman]] boycott in 1894 in ''[[In re Debs]]'', employers found that they could obtain [[United States federal courts|federal court]] injunctions to ban strikes and organizing activities of all kinds by [[trade union|unions]]. These injunctions were often extremely broad; one injunction issued by a federal court in the 1920s effectively barred the [[United Mine Workers of America]] from talking to workers who had signed [[Yellow Dog contract|yellow dog]] contracts with their employers. Unable to limit what they called "government by injunction" in the courts, labor and its allies persuaded the [[United States Congress]] in 1932 to pass the [[Norris-LaGuardia Act]], which imposed so many procedural and substantive limits on the federal courts' power to issue injunctions that it effectively prohibited federal court from issuing injunctions in cases arising out of labor disputes. A number of states followed suit and enacted "Little Norris-LaGuardia Acts" that imposed similar limitations on state courts' powers. The courts have since recognized a limited exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act's strict limitations in those cases in which a party seeks injunctive relief to enforce the [[grievance]] [[arbitration]] provisions of a [[collective bargaining]] [[Contract|agreement]].

Second, injunctions were crucial to the second half of the twentieth century in the desegregation of American schools. Federal courts gave injunctions that carried out the command of ''[[Brown v Board of Education]]'' to integrate public schools in the United States, and at times courts took over the management of public schools in order to ensure compliance. (An injunction that puts a court in the position of taking over and administering an institution—such as a school, a prison, or a hospital—is often called a "structural injunction".)

Injunctions remain widely used to require government officials to comply with the Constitution, and they are also frequently used in private law disputes about intellectual property, real property, and contracts. Many state and federal statutes, including [[Environmental law|environmental statutes]], [[Civil rights law|civil rights statutes]] and [[Employment discrimination law in the United States|employment-discrimination statutes]], are enforced with injunctions.

===Antitrust intervention and injunctions for patent infringement===

The DOJ and the FTC have investigated patent holders in the United States for seeking preliminary injunctions against accused infringers of standard-essential patents, or patents that the patent holder must license on [[reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory terms]].&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Statement of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on Its Decision to Close Its Investigation of Samsung’s Use of Its Standards-Essential Patents (Feb. 7, 2014) [hereinafter DOJ Closes Its Samsung Investigation], available at http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2014/303547.pdf; Decision and Order § IV.D, Robert Bosch GmbH, No. C-4377 (F.T.C. Apr. 23, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing debate among legal and economic scholars with major implications for antitrust policy in the United States as well as in other countries over the statutory limits to the patent holder's right to seek and obtain injunctive relief against infringers of standard-essential patents.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''Injunctive Relief and the FRAND Commitment in the United States'' at 16, ''forthcoming in'' 1 Cambridge Handbook of Technical Standardization Law: Antitrust and Patents (Jorge L. Contreras ed., Cambridge Univ. Press 2017), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/injunctive-relief-and-the-frand-commitment-in-the-united-states.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing concerns of the absence of competition facing the patent holder once its technology is locked-in to the [[technical standard|standard]], some scholars argue that the holder of a standard-essential patent should face antitrust liability when seeking an injunction against an implementer of a standard.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farrell, John Hayes, Carl Shapiro &amp; Theresa Sullivan, Standard Setting, Patents, and Hold-Up, 74 ANTITRUST L.J. 603 (2007); Jorge L.

==Australian apprehended violence orders==

In the state of [[New South Wales]], a court may grant an apprehended violence order to a person who fears violence, harassment, abuse, or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsmc.org.au/wsas/legal_system/avo_nsw.htm |title=New South Wales – Apprehended Violence Orders |publisher=National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order prohibits the defendant from assaulting, harassing, threatening, stalking, or intimidating the person seeking the order. Other conditions may be included, like not contacting or trying to find the person online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/apprehended-violence-orders-applicants|title=Are you applying for an AVO?|first=corporateName=Legal Aid NSW; jurisdiction= New South|last=Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court may issue the order if it believes a person has reasonable grounds for their fears or has no reasonable grounds for their fears. Non-compliance may result in the imposition of a fine, imprisonment, or both, and deportation.

In England and Wales, injunctions whose existence and details may not be legally reported, in addition to facts or allegations which may not be disclosed, have been issued; they have been informally dubbed "super-injunctions".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Press Gazette]]'', 14 October 2009, [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=44466&amp;c=1 MPs slam 'super injunction' which gagged Guardian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616111929/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=44466&amp;c=1 |date=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/13/super-injunctions-guardian-carter-ruck | location=London |work=The Guardian  | title=How super-injunctions are used to gag investigative reporting | first=James | last=Robinson | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example was the super-injunction raised in September 2009 by [[Carter-Ruck]] solicitors on behalf of oil trader [[Trafigura]], prohibiting the reporting of an internal Trafigura report into the [[2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump]] scandal. The existence of the super-injunction was revealed only when it was referred to in a parliamentary question that was subsequently circulated on the Internet ([[parliamentary privilege]] protects statements by MPs in Parliament which would otherwise be held to be in contempt of court). Before it could be challenged in court, the injunction was varied to permit reporting of the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110317/halltext/110317h0001.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 17 Mar 2011 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By long legal tradition, parliamentary proceedings may be reported without restriction.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/13/trafigura-drops-gag-guardian-oil Trafigura drops bid to gag ''Guardian'' over MP's question]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary proceedings are covered by [[Absolute privilege in English law|absolute privilege]], but the reporting of those proceedings in newspapers is only covered by qualified privilege. Another example of the use of a super-injunction was in a libel case in which a plaintiff who claimed he was [[English defamation law|defamed]] by family members in a dispute over a multimillion-pound family trust obtained anonymity for himself and for his relatives.&lt;ref name=guardiansuper&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/mar/29/superinjunction-financier-libel-legal-case |title=Superinjunction scores legal first for nameless financier in libel action |work=The Guardian  |first=David |last=Leigh |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roy Greenslade]] credits the former editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Alan Rusbridger]], with coining the word "super-injunction" in an article about the Trafigura affair in September 2009.&lt;ref name=standard&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23943177-law-is-badly-in-need-of-reform-as-celebrities-hide-secrets.do |title=Law is badly in need of reform as celebrities hide secrets |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |first=Roy |last=Greenslade |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424125243/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23943177-law-is-badly-in-need-of-reform-as-celebrities-hide-secrets.do |archivedate=24 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "hyper-injunction" has also been used to describe an injunction similar to a super-injunction but also including an order that the injunction must not be discussed with members of Parliament, journalists, or lawyers. One known hyper-injunction was obtained at the High Court in 2006, preventing its subject from saying that paint used in water tanks on passenger ships can break down and release potentially toxic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8394566/Hyper-injunction-stops-you-talking-to-MP.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Steven | last=Swinford | title='Hyper-injunction' stops you talking to MP | date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1368395/Now-hyper-injunction-gagging-order-stops-constituent-speaking-MP.html | location=London |work=Daily Mail  | title=Now 'hyper-injunction' gagging order stops constituent speaking to his own MP | date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example became public knowledge in Parliament under parliamentary privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/mar/21/secrets-to-keep-hyper-injunction?INTCMP=SRCH| title=Got secrets you want to keep?

By May 2011, ''[[Private Eye]]'' claimed to be aware of 53 super-injunctions and anonymised privacy injunctions,&lt;ref name="PE1288/5"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2011 |title=Number crunching |journal=Private Eye |volume=1288 |page=5 |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger's]] report into the use of super-injunctions revealed that only two super-injunctions had been granted since January 2010. Many media sources were wrongly describing all [[gagging order]]s as super-injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13465286 |title=Media concession made in injunction report |date=20 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread media coverage of super-injunctions led to a drop in numbers after 2011; however four were granted in the first five months of 2015.&lt;ref name="PE1393/9"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2015 |title=A Philosophical Conundrum |journal=Private Eye |volume=1393 |page=9 |publisher=Pressdram Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Islam]]ic concept of [[sovereignty]]''' differs from the western principles of international custom and law established by the [[Treaty of Westphalia]].  An important element of this is the ''[[Ummah]]'' &amp;mdash; the community of Muslims as a whole.  Devout Muslims consider that there is no division between religion and politics and so government should be based upon the [[Qur'an]], following the word of God in a unified way, as in the first [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Westphalian and Islamic Concepts of Sovereignty in the Middle East |author=Amin Saikal |title=Re-envisioning sovereignty |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7546-7260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jurisdictionalism''' is a political maneuver intended to extend the State's [[jurisdiction]] and control over the life and organization of the Church, namely the parallel legal structure consisting of ecclesiastical rights and privileges.

Specifically, it can be defined as a current of thought and a political attitude aiming to affirm the authority of the laical jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical one. Fundamental tools of jurisdictionalism (also called ''[[wikt:regalism|regalism]]'') were the ''placet'' and the ''[[exequatur]]'', by which the State allowed or denied the publishing and implementation of orders from the [[Pope]] or other national ecclesiastical authorities, and the ''nomina ai benefici'' (“nomination to benefits”), to control the appointment of ecclesiastical charges.&lt;br&gt;
Besides these instruments of control, jurisdictionalism also implied the State's direct intervention on ecclesiastical matters such as the age and motives of people wishing to become monks, the usefulness of convents and contemplative religious orders (which were largely abolished), the number of religious festivities, the clergy's privileges and immunities, and the formation of [[Presbyter|priests]].

==History==
This policy, developed around the [[18th century]], was followed by some of the so-called “enlightened monarchs”, such as [[Maria Theresa|Maria Theresa of Habsburg]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Habsburg]], and others, especially after the events in [[Northern Europe]] following the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], of which they shared the motives but not the doctrine.

In particular, such a policy was aimed at opposing:
* the [[right of asylum]], namely the acknowledgement of immunity to whoever took refuge in a convent or monastery; 
* the power of ecclesiastical courts to pass judgement on crimes involving religious people;
* the clergy's fiscal privileges 

Jurisdictionalism, partly predating [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and partly developing parallelly to it, questioned the [[Inquisition]], the Church's traditional monopoly on education or book censorship, and drastically reduced the importance of [[Canon law]] – theretofore the universal law of Catholic states – in the context of the State.

The State tried to put limits to the so-called ''[[mortmain]]'', namely the possession of [[real estate]] by the Church and religious corporations; some religious orders were either reformed or abolished; attempts were made to reduce churchly interferences in temporal matters; subjects were allowed to appeal to the monarch in case of ecclesiastical sentences and judgements.

'''''Kinsella v. Krueger''''', {{ussc|351|470|1956}} and {{ussc|354|1|1957}}, was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court ruled that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] supersedes international [[treaty|treaties]] [[ratification|ratified]] by the [[United States Senate]]. According to the decision, the Court recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty, although the case itself was with regard to an [[executive agreement]], not a "treaty" in the U.S. legal sense, and the agreement itself has never been ruled unconstitutional.

== The case ==
[[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Aubrey Dewitt Smith was the chief of the Logistics Section of the Plans and Operations Division at the headquarters, [[United States Army, Japan]].&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"/&gt; A graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, ranked 123d in the class of 1930, he had served with distinction with the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], earning two [[Silver Star]]s, the [[Bronze Star Medal]], the [[Legion of Merit]] and the [[Commendation Ribbon]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=648}} He later served on the headquarters of the [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] in the [[Korean War]]. He married Dorothy Krueger, the daughter of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Walter Krueger]], who had commanded the [[Sixth United States Army]] during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Holzimmer|2007|p=236}} They had two children.&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt;

On 3 October 1952, Dorothy Smith stabbed her husband with a {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} long hunting knife while he slept in their Army quarters in Japan.&lt;ref name="Arlington"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aubrey Dewitt Smith, Colonel, United States Army |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/adsmith.htm |accessdate=26 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After trying unsuccessfully to staunch the flow of blood, Colonel Smith summoned their live-in Japanese maid, Shigeko Tani,&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; who found Dorothy Smith in her underwear and holding a knife.&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"/&gt; She took the knife from Dorothy Smith and, at Colonel Smith's request, summoned Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S. Hardin,&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; a neighbor and fellow West Point-educated regular Army officer.{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=1078}} Hardin found Dorothy attempting to light a pair of cigarettes. She told him: "I'm sorry I didn't get him in the heart."&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"/&gt;

Colonel Smith was taken to Tokyo Army Hospital, but died there from loss of blood at 6am the following morning. Dorothy Smith was held in the isolation ward of the 8167th Station Hospital for observation. Major General William E. Shambora, the Surgeon General of the [[Far East Command (United States)|Far East Command]], ordered a psychiatric evaluation. In December 1952, an  Army Medical Board declared her fit to stand trial.&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; A military [[court martial]] was convened in Tokyo under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. A nine-member court was convened in January 1953, headed by Major General Joseph P. Sullivan. Its members, all military officers, included a [[Women's Army Corps]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. Dorothy Smith's defense lawyer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Howard S. Levie]], initially argued that the court had no legal jurisdiction over the wife of an Army officer. When this was rejected by the court, he argued that she was not guilty due to [[temporary insanity]].&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"/&gt; At the time of the incident, Dorothy Smith had been taking [[barbiturate]]s and [[paraldehyde]].{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=6}}

The court martial was told that Dorothy Smith had undergone two months' treatment  for mental illness in 1951, and had attempted suicide while on the ship to Japan the year before. Her personal physician, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Rawley E. Chambers, told the court that Dorothy Smith was subject to "neurotic explosions," that she had slashed her wrists a number of times, and that she once had assaulted another Army wife. "I believe she would be able to tell right from wrong," the general said. "But I do not believe that she had any ability to adhere to the right."&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; By six votes to three, the court martial found Dorothy Smith guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her "to be confined at hard labor for the rest of her natural life".&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"/&gt; A unanimous verdict of guilty would have meant a mandatory death sentence.&lt;ref name="Neurotic Explosion"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Neurotic Explosion |newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = 19 January 1953 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820912,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was reviewed by Brigadier General [[Onslow S. Rolfe]], the commanding officer of the Headquarters and Service Command of the Far East Command, and the Judge Advocate General.&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; That he was junior in rank to Sullivan meant that his ability to overrule the former was constrained.&lt;ref name="fourth circuit" /&gt;   Meanwhile, Dorothy Smith was flown back to the United States in a [[Military Air Transport Service]] plane, which reached [[Travis Air Force Base]] near [[San Francisco]] on 25 February 1953. She was held at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], and then imprisoned at the [[Federal Prison Camp, Alderson]], in West Virginia.&lt;ref name="Arlington"/&gt;

Walter Krueger's lawyers filed an appeal with the [[United States Court of Military Appeals]]. Brigadier General Adam Richmond, who had been judge advocate of the [[United States Army Central|Third United States Army]] when it had been commanded by Krueger in the early 1940s,{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=6}} argued that Dorothy was not sane at the time of the incident, and that the testimony that the court-martial had heard to the contrary was military rather than medical.&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; On 30 December 1954, by a two-to-one majority, they rejected the appeal filed by Krueger's lawyers. "Since this court lacks the power to determine the weight of the evidence, even as to the issue of sanity, we are without authority to disturb the board's determination – regardless of whether we might have reached an opposite conclusion".&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; The opinion was written by Judge [[Paul William Brosman|Paul W. Brosman]], Judge [[George W. Latimer]] concurred. Chief Judge [[Robert E. Quinn]] dissented on the grounds that the prosecution's expert witnesses testified in accordance with Army regulations rather than their knowledge and medical experience,&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; feeling bound by the restrictive terms of the joint Air Force (AFM 160-42) and Army (TM 8–240) manual, ''Psychiatry in Military Law''.{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=6}} He felt that as a consequence, "their testimony was so seriously compromised as to require, in the interests of justice a rehearing."&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt;

Krueger's attorneys filed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' with  [[Ben Moore (judge)|Ben Moore]], Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], on 9 December 1955, based on a decision by District Court Judge [[Edward Allen Tamm|Edward A. Tamm]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. Tamm had released Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, the wife of an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] Sergeant who had killed her sleeping husband with an ax in [[England]] on 9 March 1953, from Alderson on a $1,000 bond. This in turn was based on a recent ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] on 7 November 1955 in the case of Robert W. Toth, a former Air Force Sergeant who had been tried by a court martial for a murder in Korea five months before he had been honorably discharged from the Air Force.{{sfn|Vladeck |2010|pp=302–303}} The Supreme Court had ruled the military had no jurisdiction to try someone once they had been discharged from military service.&lt;ref name="Arlington" /&gt; Krueger hired Covert's lawyer, [[Frederick Bernays Wiener]] to represent Dorothy. But Moore declined to follow Tamm, and denied relief. As a result, Covert was on release while Dorothy remained incarcerated in Alderson. Krueger appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case became ''Kinsella v. Krueger'', Nina Kinsella being the [[prison warden]] at Alderson. While the appeal was pending the Government sought [[certiorari]] from the United States Supreme Court before the 4th Circuit heard the appeal.  In view of the importance of the constitutional issue presented by the case, the writ was granted without action by the Circuit Court.&lt;ref name="US 470" /&gt;{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=7}}&lt;ref name="fourth circuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/137/806/1480371/ |title=United States v. Kinsella, 137 F. Supp. 806 (S.D.W. Va. 1956) |publisher=Justia |accessdate=2 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supreme Court decision ==
[[Article One of the United States Constitution]], §8, enumerates the powers of the [[United States Congress]]. These include "making rules for the government and regulation of the said land and naval forces, and directing their operations".{{sfn|Vladeck|2010|p=298}} From 1775 to 1949, the United States military exercised control over civilians under the [[Articles of War]], under which they were subject to military courts martial. In 1916, Congress specifically extended the scope of the articles of war to cover all civilians accompanying military forces outside the United States.{{sfn|Kerrigan|2004|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Gibson|1995|pp=122–124}} After World War II, the Articles of War were superseded by the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), which came into effect on 31 May 1951.{{sfn|Washington University Law Review|1957|p=384}} It specified that civilians were subject to the UCMJ:

{{quote|(10) In time of war, persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field;&lt;br/&gt;
(11) Subject to any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, persons serving with employed by or accompanying the armed forces outside the United States ... {{sfn|Kerrigan|2004|pp=9–10}} }}
These were the provisions under which Dorothy Smith was tried. The United States had struck [[executive agreement]]s with Great Britain and Japan allowing American citizens to be tried under the UCMJ rather than local law.{{sfn|American Journal of International Law|1957|p=786}} Notably, the UCMJ did not require trial by a jury, as required by [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], §2, and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].{{sfn|Kerrigan|2004|pp=11–12}}

The Supreme Court handed down its verdict on 11 June 1956. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Tom C. Clark]] wrote:

{{quote|Furthermore, since under the principles of international law each nation has jurisdiction of the offenses committed within its own territory ... the essential choice involved here is between an American and a foreign trial. Foreign nations have relinquished jurisdiction to American military authorities only pursuant to carefully drawn agreements which presuppose prompt trial by existent authority. Absent the effective exercise of jurisdiction thus obtained, there is no reason to suppose that the nations involved would not exercise their sovereign right to try and punish for offenses committed within their borders. Under these circumstances, Congress may well have determined that trial before an American court-martial in which the fundamentals of due process are assured was preferable to leaving American servicemen and their dependents throughout the world subject to widely varying standards of justice unfamiliar to our people ... No question of the legal relation between treaties and the Constitution is presented.{{sfn|American Journal of International Law|1956|pp=959–960}} }}

The Supreme Court ruled that: 

{{quote|Article 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice is constitutional.&lt;br/&gt;
(a) A civilian dependent of an American serviceman authorized to accompany him on foreign duty may constitutionally be tried by an American military court-martial in a foreign country for an offense committed there.&lt;br/&gt;
(b) The Constitution does not require trial in a foreign country before a court conforming to Article III for offenses committed there by an American citizen, and Congress may establish legislative courts for that purpose.&lt;br/&gt; 
(c) In the circumstances of this case, it was reasonable and consonant with due process for Congress to employ the existing system of courts-martial for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt; 
(d) There is no constitutional defect in the fact that the Uniform Code of Military Justice does not provide for indictment by grand jury or trial by a petit jury, since, in these respects, it does not differ from the procedures specifically approved by this Court in other types of legislative courts established abroad by Congress.&lt;ref name="US 470"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/351/470/case.html |title=''Kinsella v.

On this, the court relied for precedent on the [[Insular Cases]].{{sfn|Sigmon|1957|p=337}} The decision was five-three, with Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O. Douglas]] and Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] dissenting. Justice [[Charles Evans Whittaker|Charles E. Whittaker]] did not participate,{{sfn|American Journal of International Law|1956|pp=959–960}} Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] filed a reservation, which impelled Wiener to file a petition for a rehearing despite the fact that, as he later acknowledged, "most requests for rehearing enjoy the viability of snowballs beyond the River Styx."{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=9}}

On 8 October 1956, the first order day of its 1956 term, the Supreme Court asked [[J. Lee Rankin]], the [[United States Solicitor General]], for a response to Wiener's petition, which was granted on 5 November 1956. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan (born 1899)|John M. Harlan II]] had changed his mind, and Justice [[Sherman Minton]] had retired. Since he had not participated in the earlier decisions, his replacement, [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], was not involved in this decision, although he would sit on the rehearing. {{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=9}}

On rehearing, the Supreme Court merged the case with ''[[Reid v. Covert]]''.{{sfn|American Journal of International Law|1957|pp=783–784}} On 10 June 1957, it reversed its previous decision. It was a stunning development; it was the first time since it had first sat in 1790 that it had reversed a decision without a major intervening change in its membership,{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=6}} for even without Brennan, the verdict would have been the same.{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=9}} Writing for the plurality, Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote: 

{{quote|These cases raise basic constitutional issues of the utmost concern. They call into question the role of the military under our system of government. They involve the power of Congress to expose civilians to trial by military tribunals, under military regulations and procedures, for offenses against the United States thereby depriving them of trial in civilian courts, under civilian laws and procedures and with all the safeguards of the Bill of Rights. These cases are  particularly significant because for the first time since the adoption of the Constitution wives of soldiers have been denied trial by jury in a court of law and forced to trial before courts-martial ... Now, after further argument and consideration, we conclude that the previous decisions cannot be permitted to stand. We hold that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert could not constitutionally be tried by military authorities.{{sfn|American Journal of International Law|1957|pp=783–784}} }}

Black was joined in the plurality opinion by Warren, Douglas and Brennan. Frankfurter and Harlan wrote separate concurring opinions.{{sfn|Wiener|1988|p=9}} Only Justices Clark and [[Harold H. Burton]] dissented.{{sfn|Duke Law Review|1957|pp=155–156}} The Supreme Court ruled that: 

{{quote|
1. When the United States acts against its citizens abroad, it can do so only in accordance with all the limitations imposed by the Constitution, including Art. III, § 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Insofar as Art. 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides for the military trial of civilian dependents accompanying the armed forces in foreign countries, it cannot be sustained as legislation which is "necessary and proper" to carry out obligations of the United States under international agreements made with those countries, since no agreement with a foreign nation can confer on Congress or any other branch of the Government power which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.&lt;br/&gt;
3. The power of Congress under Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, of the Constitution, "To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval Forces," taken in conjunction with the Necessary and Proper Clause, does not extend to civilians – even though they may be dependents living with servicemen on a military base.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Under our Constitution, courts of law alone are given power to try civilians for their offenses against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/354/1/case.html |title=''Reid v.

On 18 January 1960, the Supreme Court handed down three more verdicts to clarify and extend ''Kinsella v. Krueger''. In ''Kinsella v. United States'', the Court extended the ruling to dependents for non-capital offenses. ''Grisham v. Hagen'' extended it to civilian employees of the military for capital offenses, and ''McElroy v. United States'' to civilian employees for all offenses.{{sfn|Vladeck|2010|pp=306–307}} The gap in the law remained for many years,{{sfn|Miller|2001|pp=47–48}} until the passage of the [[Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act]], which President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law on 22 November 2000.{{sfn|Yost|Anderson|2001|p=446}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41177">A '''law firm''' is a business entity formed by one or more [[lawyer]]s to engage in the [[practice of law]]. The primary service rendered by a law firm is to advise [[consumer|clients]] (individuals or [[corporation]]s) about their legal [[rights]] and [[Obligation|responsibilities]], and to represent clients in [[civil case|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal cases]], business transactions, and other matters in which legal advice and other assistance are sought.

== Arrangements ==
Law firms are organized in a variety of ways, depending on the jurisdiction in which the firm practices. Common arrangements include:
* [[Sole proprietorship]], in which the attorney ''is'' the law firm and is responsible for all profit, loss and liability;
* [[General partnership]], in which all the attorneys who are members of the firm share ownership, profits and liabilities;
* [[Professional corporation|Professional corporations]], which issue stock to the attorneys in a fashion similar to that of a business corporation;
* [[Limited liability company]], in which the attorney-owners are called "members" but are not directly liable to third party creditors of the law firm (prohibited as against public policy in many jurisdictions but allowed in others in the form of a "Professional Limited Liability Company" or "PLLC");
* [[Professional association]], which operates similarly to a professional corporation or a limited liability company;
* [[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP), in which the attorney-owners are partners with one another, but no partner is liable to any creditor of the law firm nor is any partner liable for any negligence on the part of any other partner. The LLP is taxed as a partnership while enjoying the liability protection of a corporation.

=== Restrictions on ownership interests ===
In many countries, including the United States, there is a rule that only lawyers may have an ownership interest in, or be managers of, a law firm. Thus, law firms cannot quickly raise [[Capital (economics)|capital]] through [[initial public offering]]s on the stock market, like most [[corporation]]s.  They must either raise capital through additional capital contributions from existing or additional equity partners, or must take on debt, usually in the form of a [[line of credit]] secured by their [[accounts receivable]].

In the United States this complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been codified by the [[American Bar Association]] as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] and has been adopted in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer.html Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/selling_law_on_an_open_market/ |title=Selling Law on an Open Market |first=Jason |last=Krause |publisher=''[[ABA Journal]]'' |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}} See also: [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter’s notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; except the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/rules_of_professional_conduct/amended_rules/rule_five/rule05_04.cfm Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; However, D.C.'s rule is narrowly tailored to allow equity ownership only by those nonlawyer partners who actively assist the firm's lawyers in providing legal services, and does not allow for the sale of ownership shares to mere passive nonlawyer investors.  The U.K. had a similar rule barring nonlawyer ownership, but under reforms implemented by the [[Legal Services Act 2007|Legal Services Act of 2007]] law firms have been able to take on a limited number of non-lawyer partners and lawyers have been allowed to enter into a wide variety of business relationships with non-lawyers and non-lawyer owned businesses.  This has allowed, for example, grocery stores, banks and community organizations to hire lawyers to provide in-store and online basic legal services to customers.

The rule is controversial. It is justified by many in the legal profession, notably the American Bar Association which rejected a proposal to change the rule in its Ethics 20/20 reforms,  as necessary to prevent [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. In the [[adversarial system]] of justice, a lawyer has a duty to be a zealous and loyal advocate on behalf of the client, and also has a duty to not bill the client excessively. Also, as an officer of the court, a lawyer has a duty to be honest and to not file frivolous cases or raise frivolous defenses. Many in the legal profession believe that a lawyer working as a shareholder-employee of a publicly traded law firm might be tempted to evaluate decisions in terms of their effect on the stock price and the shareholders, which would directly conflict with the lawyer's duties to the client and to the courts. Critics of the rule, however, believe that it is an inappropriate way of protecting clients' interests and that it severely limits the potential for the innovation of less costly and higher quality legal services that could benefit both ordinary consumers and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://works.bepress.com/ghadfield/29/ Gillian K. Hadfield "Legal Barriers to Innovation:  The Growing Economic Cost of Professional Control over Corporate Legal Markets" Stanford Law Review 2008]; [http://works.bepress.com/ghadfield/53/ Gillian K. Hadfield "The Cost of Law: Promoting Access to Justice through the (Un)Corporate Practice of Law" International Review of Law and Economics, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multinational law firms===
Law firms operating in multiple countries often have complex structures involving multiple partnerships, particularly in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Japan which restrict partnerships between local and foreign lawyers. One structure largely unique to large multinational law firms is the [[Swiss Verein]], pioneered by [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] in 2004, in which multiple national or regional partnerships form an association in which they share branding, administrative functions and various operating costs, but maintain separate revenue pools and often separate partner compensation structures. Other multinational law firms operate as single worldwide partnerships, such as British or American limited liability partnerships, in which partners also participate in local operating entities in various countries as required by local regulations.&lt;ref name=amlaw&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Vereins: The new structure for global firms|url=http://www.americanlawyer.com/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202591158156|accessdate=1 August 2013|newspaper=The American Lawyer|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial indicators ===
Three financial statistics are typically used to measure and rank law firms' performance:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v33_is4_an22.html|title=Profitability {{!}} Law Practice Division|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Profits per partner (PPP): [[Earnings before interest and taxes|Net operating income]] divided by number of equity partners. High PPP is often correlated with prestige of a firm and its attractiveness to potential equity partners. However, the indicator is prone to manipulation by re-classifying less profitable partners as non-equity partners.
* Revenue per lawyer (RPL): [[Revenue|Gross revenue]] divided by number of lawyers. This statistic shows the revenue-generating ability of the firm's lawyers in general, but does not factor in the firm's expenses such as associate compensation and office overhead.
* Average compensation of partners (ACP): Total amount paid to equity and nonequity partners (i.e., net operating income plus nonequity partner compensation) divided by the total number of equity and nonequity partners. This results in a more inclusive statistic than PPP, but remains prone to manipulation by changing expense policies and re-classifying less profitable partners as associates.

==Structure and promotion==

===Partnership===
Law firms are typically organized around [[partnership|partners]], who are joint owners and [[board of directors|business directors]] of the legal operation; [[associate attorney|associates]], who are [[employee]]s of the firm with the prospect of becoming partners; and a variety of staff employees, providing [[paralegal]], clerical, and other support services. An associate may have to wait as long as 11 years before the decision is made as to whether the associate "makes partner." Many law firms have an "[[up or out]] policy" (pioneered around 1900 by partner [[Paul Cravath]] of [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]]):&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Nelson, ''Partners With Power: The Social Transformation of the Large Law Firm'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; associates who do not make partner are required to resign and join another firm, do it alone as a solo practitioner, go to work in-house in a corporate legal department, or change [[profession]]s ([[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] rates are very high in law).&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Trotter, ''Profit and the Practice of Law: What's Happened to the Legal Profession'' (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1997), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Making partner is very prestigious at large or midsized firms, due to the competition that naturally results from higher associate-to-partner ratios. Such firms may take out advertisements in professional publications to announce who has made partner. Traditionally, partners shared directly in the profits of the firm, after paying salaried employees, the landlord, and the usual costs of furniture, office supplies, and books for the [[law library]] (or a database subscription). Partners in a [[limited liability partnership]] can largely operate autonomously with regard to cultivating new business and servicing existing clients within their [[book of business (law)|book of business]]. 

Partner compensation methods vary greatly among law firms. At major United States law firms, the "compensation spread" (ratio between the highest partner salary and lowest partner salary) among firms disclosing information ranges from 3:1 to 24:1. Higher spreads are intended to promote individual performance, while lower spreads are intended to promote teamwork and collegiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2013/06/which-firms-have-the-biggest-gaps-between-their-highest-and-lowest-paid-partners/|title=Which Firms Have The Biggest Gaps Between Their Highest- and Lowest-Paid Partners?|last=Lat|first=David|work=Above the Law|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large law firms have moved to a two-tiered partnership model, with [[Equity partner|equity and non-equity partners]]. Equity partners are considered to have ownership stakes in the firm, and share in the profits (and losses) of the firm. Non-equity partners are generally paid a fixed salary (albeit much higher than associates), and they are often granted certain limited voting rights with respect to firm operations.

The oldest continuing partnership in the United States is that of [[Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft]], founded in 1792 in [[New York City]]. The oldest law firm in continuous practice in the United States is [[Rawle &amp; Henderson LLP]], founded in 1783 in [[Philadelphia]].

==== Termination of one's partnership ====
It is rare for a partner to be forced out by fellow partners, although that can happen if the partner commits a crime or malpractice, experiences disruptive mental illness, or is not contributing to the firm's overall profitability. However, some large firms have written into their partnership agreement a forced [[retirement age]] for partners, which can be anywhere from age 65 on up. In contrast, most corporate executives are at much higher risk of being fired, even when the underlying cause is not directly their fault, such as a drop in the company's stock price. Worldwide, partner retirement ages can be difficult to estimate and often vary widely, particularly because in many countries it is illegal to mandate a retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Of counsel" role===
In the United States, Canada and Japan, many large and midsize firms have attorneys with the job title of "counsel", "special counsel" or "[[of counsel]]." As the [[Supreme Court of California]] has noted, the title has acquired several related but distinct definitions which do not easily fit into the traditional partner-associate structure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/20C4t1135.htm 20 Cal. 4th 1135], 1152-1153 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  These attorneys are people who work for the firm, like associates, although some firms have an [[independent contractor]] relationship with their counsel. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own cases, and supervise associates. These relationships are structured to allow more senior attorneys to share in the resources and "brand name" of the firm without being a part of management or profit sharing decisions.  The title is often seen among former associates who do not make partner, or who are laterally recruited to other firms, or who work as in-house counsel and then return to the big firm environment. At some firms, the title "of counsel" is given to retired partners who maintain ties to the firm. Sometimes "of counsel" refers to senior or experienced attorneys, such as foreign legal consultants, with specialized experience in particular aspects of law and practice. They are hired as independent contractors by large firms as a special arrangement, which may lead to profitable results for the partnership. In certain situations "of counsel" could be considered to be a transitional status in the firm.

===Mergers and acquisitions between law firms===
Mergers, acquisitions, division and reorganizations occur between law firms as in other businesses.  The specific books of business and specialization of attorneys as well as the professional ethical structures surrounding conflict of interest can lead to firms splitting up to pursue different clients or practices, or merging or recruiting experienced attorneys to acquire new clients or practice areas.  Results often vary between firms experiencing such transitions.  Firms that gain new practice areas or departments through recruiting or mergers that are more complex and demanding (and typically more profitable) may see the focus, organization and resources of the firm shift dramatically towards those new departments.  Conversely, firms may be merged among experienced attorneys as partners for purposes of shared financing and resources, while the different departments and practice areas within the new firm retain a significant degree of autonomy.

Law firm mergers tend to be [[assortative mating|assortative]], in that only law firms operating in similar legal systems are likely to merge. For example, U.S. firms will often merge with English law firms, or law firms from other common law jurisdictions. A notable exception is [[King &amp; Wood Mallesons]], a multinational law firm that is the result of a merger between an Australian law firm and a Chinese law firm.

Though mergers are more common among better economies, slowing down a bit during recessions, big firms sometimes use mergers as a strategy to boost revenue during a recession. Nevertheless, data from Altman Weil indicates that only four firms merged in the first half of 2013, as compared to eight in the same period in 2012, and this was taken by them as indicating a dip in morale regarding the legal economy and the amount of demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/16/despite-rising-economy-law-firms-remain-demoralized/|title=Despite Rising Economy, Law Firms Remain Demoralized - JD Journal|author=Daniel June|date=16 May 2013|work=jdjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
Law firms can vary widely in size. The smallest law firms are lawyers practicing alone, who form the vast majority of lawyers in nearly all countries.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/316 |title=Different types of law firm in the UK |publisher=Chambersstudent.co.uk |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller firms tend to focus on particular specialties of the law (e.g. [[patent law]], [[labor law]], [[tax law]], criminal defense, personal injury); larger firms may be composed of several specialized practice groups, allowing the firm to diversify their client base and market, and to offer a variety of services to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Large law firms usually have separate litigation and transactional departments. The transactional department advises clients and handles transactional legal work, such as drafting contracts, handling necessary legal applications and filings, and evaluating and ensuring compliance with relevant law; while the litigation department represents clients in court and handles necessary matters (such as discovery and motions filed with the court) throughout the process of litigation.

=== Anglo-American development ===

==== Boutique law firms ====
Lawyers in small cities and towns may still have old-fashioned general practices, but most urban lawyers tend to be highly specialized due to the overwhelming complexity of the law today.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 172, and Trotter, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some small firms in the cities specialize in practicing only one kind of law (like [[employment]], [[antitrust]], [[intellectual property]], [[investment funds]], [[telecommunications]] or aviation) and are called [[boutique law firm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Virtual Law Firms ====
A 21st Century development has been the appearance of the [[virtual law firm]], a firm with a virtual business address but no brick &amp; mortar office location open to the public, using modern telecommunications to operate from remote locations and provide its services to international clients, avoiding the costs of maintaining a physical premises with lower overheads than traditional law firms. This lower cost structure allows virtual law firms to bill clients on a contingency basis rather than by billable hours paid in advance by retainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excellolaw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/p10_SJJune14th.pdf|format=PDF|last=Boyall|first=Sue|title=Free Range|publisher=Solicitors Journal|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Megafirms" or Biglaw ====
The largest law firms have more than {{FORMATNUM:1000}} lawyers. These firms, often colloquially called "megafirms" or "'''biglaw'''", generally have offices on several continents, bill US$750 per hour or higher, and have a high ratio of support staff per attorney.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Abel, ''American Lawyers'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 190-199.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the localized and regional nature of firms, the relative size of a firm varies.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Full service" firms ===
The largest firms like to call themselves "Big-Law" firms because they have sections specializing on each category of legal work, which in the U.S. usually means [[mergers and acquisitions]] transactions,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 462.&lt;/ref&gt; banking, and certain types of high-stakes corporate litigation. These firms rarely do plaintiffs' personal injury work. However the largest law firms are not very large compared to other major businesses (or even other professional services firms). In 2008, the largest law firm in the world was the British firm [[Clifford Chance]], which had revenue of over [[US$]]2 billion. This can be compared with $404 billion for the world's largest firm by turnover [[Exxon Mobil]] and $28 billion for the largest professional services firm [[Deloitte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deloitte ascends to become the largest private professional services organization worldwide|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GX/global/press/global-press-releases-en/78ed944968a7b210VgnVCM1000001956f00aRCRD.htm|publisher=Deloitte.com|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide ===
The largest law firms in the world are headquartered primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, large firms of more than 1,000 lawyers are also found in Australia (Minter Ellison (1,500 attorneys), China (Dacheng 2,100 attorneys) and Spain (Garrigues, 2,100 attorneys). The American system of licensing attorneys on a state-by-state basis, the tradition of having a headquarters in a single U.S. state and a close focus on profits per partner (as opposed to sheer scale) has to date limited the size of most American law firms. Thus, whilst the most profitable law firms in the world remain in New York, four of the six largest firms in the world are based in London in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmacewen.com/blog/archives/2005/11/amlaw_global_10.html |title=Bmacewen.com |publisher=Bmacewen.com |date=2005-11-04 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the huge size of the United States results in a larger number of large firms overall – a 2003 paper noted that the United States alone had 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers, while there were only 58 such firms in Canada, 44 in Great Britain, 14 in France, and 9 in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Eliane Botelho Junqueira, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEMUKyPTE9AC&amp;pg=PA92 "Brazil: The Road of Conflict Bound for Total Justice,"] in ''Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe'', eds. Lawrence M. Friedman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, 64-107 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003), 92.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an increasing tendency towards globalisation of law firms.

Due to their size, the U.S.- and U.K.-based law firms are the most prestigious and powerful in the world, and they tend to dominate the international market for legal services. A 2007 research paper noted that firms from other countries merely pick up their leftovers: "[M]uch of the competition is relatively orderly whereby predominantly Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian firms compete for business not required by English or American law firms."&lt;ref&gt;Ashly&lt;!-- Ashly is the correct spelling of the author's name--&gt; H. Pinnington &amp; John T. Gray, "The global restructuring of legal services work? A study of the internationalisation of Australian law firms," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;14 Int'l J. Legal Prof. 147, 151-152 (2007).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recession ===
As a result of the U.S. recession in 2008 and 2009 many U.S. law firms have downsized staff considerably, and some have closed.  The ''[[Denver Post]]'' reported that major law firms have cut more than 10,000 jobs nationwide in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vuong |first=Andy |url=http://www.denverpost.com/theeconomy/ci_12050886 |title=Denver Post, Big law firms cut attorneys, staff in tight economy, 2 April 2009 |publisher=Denverpost.com |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2009, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported that 700 jobs were cut that one day at law firms across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortado |first=Lindsay |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aWC1nJ1AQX3I&amp;refer=home |title=Bloomberg, Law Firms in US eliminate 700 jobs as economy slows, 13 February 2009 |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the firms closed included [[Heller Ehrman]], a San Francisco-based firm established in 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/25/BUQF135ES8.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |title=San Francisco Chronicle, Heller Ehrman law firm to dissolve Friday, 26 September 2008 |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2008-09-26 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Halliwells of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;'Halliwells administrators report reveals details of financial fallout', [http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/1734157/halliwells-administrators-report-reveals-details-financial-fallout ''Legal Week''], 20 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Among those that survived, law firm layoffs became so common that trade publications like [[American Lawyer]] produced an ongoing “Layoff List” of the law firms nationwide that cut jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/tal/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202425647706&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1 American Lawyer, The Layoff List], 3 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salaries==
Law firm salary structures typically depend on firm size.  Small-firm salaries vary widely within countries and from one country to the next, and are not often publicly available. Because most countries do not have unified legal professions, there are often significant disparities in income among the various legal professions within a particular country. Finally, the availability of salary data also depends upon the existence of journalists and sociologists able to collect and analyze such data. The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) produces an annual study on Law Firm Compensation and Benefits, and can be found at http://alanet.org/compsurvey

=== United States ===

The U.S. is presently the only country with enough lawyers, as well as journalists and sociologists who specialize in studying them, to have widely available data on salary structures at major law firms.

In 2006, median salaries of new graduates ranged from [[US$]]50,000 per year in small firms (2 to 10 [[Lawyer|attorneys]]) to US$160,000 per year in very large firms (more than 501 attorneys). The distribution of these salaries was highly bimodal, with the majority of new lawyers earning at either the high end or the low end of the scale, and a median salary of US$62,000.&lt;ref&gt;"What Do New Lawyers Earn? A 15-Year Retrospective as Reported by Law School Graduates". [http://www.elsblog.org/the_empirical_legal_studi/2007/09/distribution-of.html]. The Association for Legal Career Professionals, {{cite web |url=http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pid=520 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110033727/http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pid=520 |archivedate=2008-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, New York law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore raised its first-year associate salary to $180,000. Many other high-end New York-based and large national law firms soon followed.  Two years later, in the summer of 2018, the Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy raised its first-year associated salary to $190,000, with other major firms following shortly thereafter.

The traditional salary model for law firm associates is [[lockstep compensation]], in which associate salaries go up by a fixed amount each year from the associate's law school graduation. However, many firms have switched to a level-based compensation system, in which associates are divided into three (or sometimes four) levels based on skills mastered. In 2013, the median salaries for the three associate levels were $152,500, $185,000 and $216,000 among large firms (more than 700 lawyers), and $122,000, $143,500 and $160,000 among all firms.&lt;ref name="nalp13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Associate Salaries Bobble But Remain Essentially Flat|url=http://www.nalp.org/associate_salaries_sept2013|publisher=NALP|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent law firms, like [[Goodwin Procter]] and [[Paul Hastings]], give generous signing bonuses (e.g., $20k)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwinprocter.com/Careers/Career-Opportunities/Law-Students/JD-MBA.aspx| title= Goodwin Procter Careers, Law Students |year=2008|publisher= Goodwin Procter| accessdate= November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulhastings.com/careers_attorneys_FAQs.aspx| title= Paul Hastings Career Center FAQ |year=2008|publisher= Paul Hastings| accessdate= May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to incoming first-year associates who hold [[JD/MBA]] degrees.

Another way law firm associates increase their earnings or improve their employment conditions is through a lateral move to another law firm.  
A recent survey by [[LexisNexis]], indicated that over 95% of law firms consulted intended to hire lateral attorneys within the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savarino|first=Julie|title=Successful Lateral Integration for Law Firms|url=http://about.bloomberglaw.com/practitioner-contributions/successful-lateral-integration-for-law-firms/|work=Bloomberg Law|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the success for both the attorney and the law firms in lateral hiring has been questioned.  The [[National Law Review]] reported that the cost of recruiting, compensating, and integrating a lateral attorney can be upwards of $600,000 and that 60% of lateral attorney hires fail to thrive at their new law firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knapp|first=Amy L.|title=The Most Interesting Trends from Marketing Partner Forum 2014|journal=The National Law Review|date=28 February 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/most-interesting-trends-marketing-partner-forum-2014|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

British firms typically practise [[lockstep compensation]]. In [[London]], entry-level solicitor salaries (NQ - Newly Qualified) are typically: (i) £38,000-54,500 at niche and boutique firms (ii) £61,000-65,500 at national firms (iii) £65,000-105,000 at international firms.

A senior associate with six years' experience may make £68,000-120,000 at a national firm or upwards of £160,000 at a global firm. Salary levels are lower in areas outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salaries|url=http://uk.hudson.com/Portals/UK/documents/SalarySurveys/Hudson%20Legal_Salary_Guide_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

Australia has regional variation in lawyer salaries, with the highest salary levels in [[Sydney]], followed by [[Melbourne]], [[Perth]], [[Brisbane]], then [[Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Practice Salary Report 2015|url=http://www.mahlab.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/MahlabReport2015_Private_WEB.pdf|publisher=Mahlab|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salaries vary between top-tier, mid-size, and small firms.  At top-tier firms in Sydney, salaries of lawyers who have been admitted to practice range from $75,000 to $92,000 and partners make on average $1,215,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Practice Salary Report 2015|url=http://www.mahlab.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/MahlabReport2015_Private_WEB.pdf|publisher=Mahlab|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sydney, mid-tier starting salaries for admitted lawyers range from between $65,000 and $82,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Practice Salary Report 2015|url=http://www.mahlab.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/MahlabReport2015_Private_WEB.pdf|publisher=Mahlab|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Australian lawyers are not admitted until 10 months into their time at their law firm, since the initial period involves supervised legal training before admission is granted.

Typically in Australian firms lawyers are in a lock-step system for the first two years of practice, following which pay increases are dependent on performance assessed, in large measure, by satisfaction of billable hour targets.

===Hong Kong===

Newly qualified associates at leading firms in Hong Kong typically make HK$840,000 to HK$948,000, with partners in the HK$1.6 million to HK$4 million+ range; many firms pay New York salaries with cost of living adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong 2013 Salary &amp; Employment Forecast|url=http://www.michaelpage.com.hk/websitepdf/Michael_PageHK_Salary_and_Employment_Forecast_Report2013.pdf|publisher=Michael Page|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===

At local firms in Singapore, associates in their first three years typically make $60,000 to $100,000, while midlevel (4–7 years) associates make $110,000 to $180,000 and senior (8+ years) associates make $160,000 or more. International firms pay significantly more, with senior associates often making more than $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore 2012/13 Salary &amp; Employment Forecast|url=http://www.michaelpage.com.sg/sites/default/files/MP_SEF_SG_1213_Final.pdf|publisher=Michael Page|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
There is more information available for entry level soups{{Definition needed|date=February 2018}}. First year lawyers earn anywhere between INR 25,000 to INR 1,10,000 a month. Tier 1 law firms provide the best pay package, of about INR 15,00,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agarwal|first1=Abhyuday|title=How to prepare for a law firm interview|url=http://blog.ipleaders.in/how-to-prepare-for-law-firm-interview/|website=iPleaders|publisher=iPleaders|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide difference in the salary range in big cities like Chennai and Delhi as opposed to other cities like Mumbai and Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalia|first1=Tanuj|title=REVEALED: Salaries and Packages of BIG and small Recruiters|url=http://www.lawctopus.com/salaries-packages/|website=Lawctopus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Most law firms are located in office buildings of various sizes, ranging from modest one-story buildings to some of the tallest [[skyscraper]]s in the world (though only in 2004, [[Paul Hastings]] was the first firm to put its name on a skyscraper).

In late 2001, it was widely publicized that [[John C. Dearie]]'s personal injury plaintiffs' firm in the state of New York has been experimenting with [[bus]]-sized "mobile law offices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/nyregion/wheels-office-go-round-round-next-stop-for-legal-team-personal-injury-case.html|title=Wheels on the Office Go Round and Round; Next Stop for a Legal Team? A Personal Injury Case in Queens|last=Feuer|first=Alan|date=26 December 2001|work=[[New York Times]], D1|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm insists that it does not "[[ambulance chaser|chase ambulances]]." It claims that a law office on wheels is more convenient for personal injury plaintiffs, who are often recovering from severe injuries and thus find it difficult to travel far from their homes for an intake interview.

== Rankings ==
As legal practice is adversarial, law firm rankings are widely relied on by prospective [[associate attorney|associates]], lateral hires and legal [[wikt:Client|clients]].  [[Substantive]] rankings typically cover practice areas such as [[The American Lawyer]]'s Corporate Scorecard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1175223828867|title=Routine Maintenance|work=law.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Top IP Firms.  Work place rankings are directed toward lawyers or law students, and cover such topics as quality of life, hours, family friendliness and salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.averyindex.com|title=Law Firm Rankings &amp; Information|work=averyindex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, [[statistical]] rankings generally cover profit-related data such as profits per partner and revenue per lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1177664676190|title=Routine Maintenance|work=law.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third party attorney ranking services such as Chambers and Partners and [[Martindale-Hubbell]] are generally very competitive and can help raise an individual attorney's professional profile, and to catch this marketing advantage, over 1,200 attorney ranking and or awards have sprung up in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=Susan|title=The Value of Legal Rankings|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=14 March 2017|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/value-legal-rankings|accessdate=5 October 2017|publisher=Jaffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Various state bar associations have taken notice of the prolific growth of attorney honor awards and have determined that lawyers may refer to such honors in advertising “[http://www.njlawjournal.com/id=1202758099430/Super-Lawyers-and-Its-Ilk-Widely-Misused-in-Ads-Committee-Warns?mcode=1202617074826&amp;curindex=0&amp;curpage=ALL&amp;slreturn=20170905191021 only when the basis for comparison can be verified” and the organization providing the award “has made adequate inquiry into the fitness of the individual lawyer.]” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Debra Cassens|title='Super lawyers' and 'rising stars' are warned about accolade advertising|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/super_lawyers_and_rising_stars_are_warned_about_accolade_advertising|accessdate=5 October 2017|work=The ABA Journal|publisher=American Bar Association|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In an October 2007 press conference reported in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', the law student group [[Building a Better Legal Profession]] released its first annual ranking of top law firms by average billable hours, ''[[pro bono]]'' participation, and demographic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Amir Efrati, You Say You Want a Big-Law Revolution, Take II, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Liptak]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/us/29bar.html?em&amp;ex=1193889600&amp;en=4b0cd84261ffe5b4&amp;ei=5087%0A In Students’ Eyes, Look-Alike Lawyers Don’t Make the Grade], ''The New York Times'', October 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably, the report ranked the percentages of women, [[African-Americans]], Hispanics, [[Asian-Americans]], and gays &amp; lesbians at America's top [[law firms]].

==In popular culture==
{{main|Legal drama|Law firms in fiction}}

A number of [[television]] shows, movies and books have revolved around relationships occurring in fictional law firms, highlighting both public fascination with and misperception of the lives of lawyers in high-powered settings. 

One popular American legal drama television series is called [[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]].There is one popular American dramedy, also known as, [[comedy-drama]] called [[Boston Legal]] which was created by [[David E. Kelley]] and produced in association with 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century Fox Television for ABC. It is a spin-off of another long running Kelly series, The Practice, following the exploits of former character Alan Shore at the legal firm of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/review/boston-legal/614330?ref=node_name&amp;pos=1&amp;a=0&amp;ltype=n&amp;l=128025&amp;g=3|title=Boston Legal|website=Ranker|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One famous legal movie is called [[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]], which was adapted from a book written by [[John Grisham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''''Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations''''' (Russian: «Закон О свободе совести и о религиозных объединениях»), also known as the 1997 Law  (Russian: «Закон 1997 года») is a [[Russia]]n law passed and signed by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on September 26, 1997.&lt;ref name="Law of Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association"&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/freedomofconscienceeng.html], the translation of the law from Stretson University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law redefined the state's relationship with religion, as Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had defined in on the Law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on Freedom of Worship passed on October 25, 1990, commonly known as the 1990 Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/cedir/cedir/Lex-doc/Ru_l_1990.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[fall of Communism]], Gorbachev had given much-needed breathing room to the practice of religion in Russia, whose culture's heart is Eastern Orthodoxy, but had also opened the door indescriminately and generally to the practice of religion. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] believed that a new law was needed to preserve Russia against what they considered to be the corruption of Orthodoxy.

The law was formulated and pushed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], secular nationalists, and communists alike, with such determination that though Yeltsin vetoed the bill once, he could not legitimately do so a second time.

Written in the law was the upholding of separation of church and state, as well as an interdiction against a state religion.  With that in mind, the following definitions and regulations are given:

==Definitions==
* ''religious organizations:'' at the level of individual church congregations
* ''religious associations:'' whole denominations
* ''religious groups:'' groups without legal status, such as a bible study group

==Regulations==

==Effects==
Religion under the new law became nearly as regulated as it had been in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, though without the official communist hostility.  It did accomplish some expulsion of [[Western culture|Western]] religious work, though it left room for some foreign churches to legitimately register.  There had been on the order of 16,000 registered organizations before the passage of the law, and by 2004 there were 22,000.  By regulating on grounds common among new, foreign organizations, it made it difficult for them to take root, and it succeeded in promoting and securing a privileged place for the Russian Orthodox Church.

On June 22, 2005, debate of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) concluded, that the 1997 Law "creates a complex form of categorization of religions which has led to various forms of discrimination and to the stigmatization of 'non-traditional' religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dimarzio.info/it/docum/finish/7-acm-europe/251-a-case-study-fecris.html|title=A Case Study: FECRIS|last=Besier|first=Gerhard|last2=Seiwert|first2=Hubert|publisher=Lit verlag|year=2012|isbn=978-3-643-99894-1|location=Berlin|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mississippi v. Johnson''''', 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475 (1867), was the first suit to be brought against a [[President of the United States]] in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The state of [[Mississippi]] attempted to sue President [[Andrew Johnson]] for enforcing [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The court decided, based on a previous decision of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' that the President has two kinds of task: ministerial and discretionary. Discretionary tasks are ones the president can choose to do or not to do, while ministerial tasks are ones required by his office: those whose failure to perform could leave him in violation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The court ruled that by enforcing Reconstruction, Johnson was acting in an "executive and political" capacity&amp;mdash;a discretionary rather than a ministerial one&amp;mdash;and so he could not be sued.

An '''occupational disease''' is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of [[occupational safety and health]]. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|first such disease to be recognised]], [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] of the [[scrotum]], was identified in [[chimney sweep]] boys by [[Percivall Pott|Sir Percival Pott]] in 1775{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.

Under the law of [[workers' compensation]] in many jurisdictions, there is a presumption that specific disease are caused by the worker being in the work environment and the burden is on the employer or insurer to show that the disease came about from another cause. Diseases compensated by national workers compensation authorities are often termed occupational diseases. However, many countries do not offer compensations for certain diseases like musculoskeletal disorders caused by work (e.g. in Norway). Therefore, the term work-related diseases is  utilized to describe diseases of occupational origin. This term however would then include both compensable and non-compensable diseases that have occupational origins.

==Examples==
Some well-known occupational diseases include:

===Lung diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational lung disease}}
Occupational lung diseases include [[asbestosis]] among [[asbestos]] miners and those who work with friable asbestos insulation, as well as black lung ([[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]]) among [[coal miner]]s, [[silicosis]] among miners and quarrying and tunnel operators and [[byssinosis]] among workers in parts of the cotton textile industry.

[[Occupational asthma]] has a vast number of [[Occupational asthma#Occupations at risk|occupations at risk]].

Bad [[indoor air quality]] may predispose for diseases in the lungs as well as in other parts of the body.

===Skin diseases===
{{Main article|Occupational skin diseases}}
Occupational skin diseases are ranked among the top five occupational diseases in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kanerva's Occupational Dermatology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-642-02035-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational skin diseases and conditions are generally caused by chemicals and having wet hands for long periods while at work. [[Eczema]] is by far the most common, but [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]] and [[skin cancer]] are also of concern.&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contact dermatitis]] due to irritation is [[inflammation]] of the skin which results from a contact with an irritant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irritant Dematitis|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-3-540-31294-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that this type of [[dermatitis]] does not require prior sensitization of the [[immune system]]. There have been studies to support that past or present [[Atopic dermatitis|atopic]] [[Atopic dermatitis|dermatitis]] is a risk factor for this type of [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coenraads|first=P. J.|last2=Diepgen|first2=T. L.|date=1998-02-01|title=Risk for hand eczema in employees with past or present atopic dermatitis|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=71|issue=1|pages=7–13|issn=0340-0131|pmid=9523243|doi=10.1007/s004200050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common irritants include detergents, acids, alkalies, oils, organic solvents and reducing agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsner|first=P.|date=1994-07-01|title=Irritant dermatitis in the workplace|journal=Dermatologic Clinics|volume=12|issue=3|pages=461–467|issn=0733-8635|pmid=7923942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acute form of this dermatitis develops on exposure of the skin to a strong irritant or caustic chemical. This exposure can occur as a result of [[accident]] at a [[workplace]]. The irritant reaction starts to increase in its intensity within minutes to hours of exposure to the irritant and reaches its peak quickly. After the reaction has reached its peak level, it starts to heal. This process is known as decrescendo phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dermatotoxicology|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0849397738|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent potent irritants leading to this type of dermatitis are acids and alkaline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eichmann|first=A.|last2=Amgwerd|first2=D.|date=1992-05-05|title=[Toxic contact dermatitis]|journal=Schweizerische Rundschau Für Medizin Praxis = Revue Suisse De Médecine Praxis|volume=81|issue=19|pages=615–617|issn=1013-2058|pmid=1589676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms include redness and swelling of the skin along with the formation of blisters.

The chronic form occurs as a result of repeated exposure of the skin to weak irritants over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=M. V.|date=1988-01-01|title=Chronic, irritant contact dermatitis: mechanisms, variables, and differentiation from other forms of contact dermatitis|journal=Advances in Dermatology|volume=3|pages=261–275|issn=0882-0880|pmid=3152823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical manifestations of the contact dermatitis are also modified by external factors such as environmental factors (mechanical pressure, temperature, and humidity) and predisposing characteristics of the individual (age, sex, ethnic origin, preexisting skin disease, atopic skin diathesis, and anatomic region exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/dermatitis.html|title=Dermatitis, Irritant Contact : OSH Answers|last=Safety|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another occupational skin disease is Glove related hand urticaria. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers. This type of hand urticaria is believed to be caused by repeated wearing and removal of the gloves. The reaction is caused by the latex or the nitrile present in the gloves.&lt;ref&gt;Glove-related hand urticaria: an increasing occupational problem amongst health care workers. Hawkey S, Abdul Ghaffar S.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-risk occupations include:&lt;ref name=hse/&gt;
* Hairdressing
* Catering
* Healthcare
* Printing
* Metal machining
* Motor vehicle repair
* Construction

===Other diseases of concern===
*[[Overuse syndrome]] among persons who perform repetitive or forceful movements in constrictive postures 
*[[Carpal tunnel syndrome]] among persons who work in the [[poultry]] industry and information technology
*[[Computer vision syndrome]] among persons using information technology for hours
*[[Lead poisoning]] affecting workers in many industries that processed or employed lead or lead compounds

===Historical===
[[Donald Hunter (physician)|Donald Hunter]] in his classic history of occupational diseases discusses many example of occupational diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Hunter |title=Diseases of Occupations |location= |publisher=Hodder Arnold |edition=8th rev. |year=1994 |isbn=0-340-55173-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:
* [[Phossy jaw]] among the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888|London matchgirls]]
* [[Radiation sickness]] among some persons who had been working in the nuclear industry
* [[Radium jaw]] among the [[Radium Girls]]
* [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the scrotum among chimney sweeps (see [[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma]])

==Prevention==
Prevention measures include avoidance of the irritant through its removal from the workplace or through technical shielding by the use of potent irritants in closed systems or automation, irritant replacement or removal &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Occupational Dermatology|isbn=978-3-662-07679-8 |last= |first= |publisher= |year= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal protection of the workers.

In order to better prevent and control occupational [[disease]], most countries revise and update their related laws, most of them greatly increasing the penalties in case of breaches of the occupational disease laws. Occupational disease prevention, in general legally regulated, is part of good [[supply chain]] management and enables companies to design and ensure supply chain social compliance schemes as well as monitor their implementation to identify and prevent occupational disease hazards.

An '''orphan work''' is a [[copyright]] protected work for which [[rightsholder]]s are positively indeterminate or uncontactable. Sometimes the names of the originators or rightsholders are known, yet it is impossible to contact them because additional details cannot be found.&lt;ref name= Borgman&gt;{{Cite book| last= Borgman| first= Christine L.| title= Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the internet| publisher= MIT Press| year= 2007| page= 108| url= http://Google.com/books?id=ZDDu3CuzDdMC&amp;dq=orphan+works+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn= 978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work can become orphaned through rightsholders being unaware of their [[:wikt:holding#Noun|holding]], or by their demise (e.g. deceased persons or defunct companies) and establishing inheritance has proved impracticable.&lt;ref name=JISC&gt;{{Cite book| title= In from the Cold: An assessment of the scope of 'Orphan Works' and its impact on the delivery of services to the public| publisher= JISC Collections Trust| date= April 2009| page= 9| url= http://sca.JISCinvolve.org/files/2009/06/sca_colltrust_orphan_works_v1-final.pdf| access-date= 2010-05-31| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091118103903/http://sca.jiscinvolve.org/files/2009/06/sca_colltrust_orphan_works_v1-final.pdf#| archive-date= 2009-11-18| dead-url= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, comprehensively diligent research fails to determine any authors, creators or originators for a work. Since 1989, the amount of orphan works has increased dramatically since registration is optional, many works' statuses remain unknown and therefore are in a grey area, therefore cannot be used, since fair use deals with non-orphaned works.

==Extent==
Precise figures of orphan works are not readily available, even though libraries, archives and museums hold a vast number of them. In April 2009, a study estimated that the collections of public sector organisations in the UK hold about 25&amp;nbsp;million orphan works.&lt;ref name=JISC /&gt; Examples of orphan works include photographs that do not note the photographer, such as photos from scientific expeditions and historical images, old folk music recordings, little known novels and other literature.&lt;ref name=Borgman /&gt; [[Software]] which became an orphaned work is usually known as ''[[abandonware]]''. The [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin]] estimates that around 50% of their [[video game]] collection consists of at least partial orphans.&lt;ref name="50percent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=127| quote=''The [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin|Computerspielemuseum]] in Berlin estimates that around 50 % of their collection consists of at least partial orphans.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Source code escrow]] can prevent software orphaning but is seldom applied.

==Impact==
In countries whose laws do not specifically allow for the use of orphan works, orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Because rightsholders cannot be identified and located to obtain permission, historical and cultural records such as period film footage, photographs, and sound recordings cannot be legally incorporated in contemporary works in such countries (unless the incorporation qualifies as [[fair use]]).&lt;ref name= Netanel&gt;{{Cite book| last= Netanel| first= Neil| title= Copyright’s paradox| publisher= Oxford University Press US| year= 2008| page= 200| url= https://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-19-513762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public libraries]], educational institutions, and [[museums]] that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings, and film may choose to not digitise orphan works or make orphan works available to the public&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt; for fear that a re-appearing rightsholder may sue them for damages.&lt;ref name= Borgman /&gt;

==Causes==
According to Neil Netanel the increase in orphan works is the result of two factors: (1) that [[copyright term]]s have been lengthened, and (2) that copyright is automatically conferred without registration or renewal.&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt; Only a fraction of old copyrighted works are available to the public. Netanel argues that rightsholders have "no incentive to maintain a work in circulation" or otherwise make their out-of-print content available unless they can hope to earn more money doing so than by producing new works or engaging in more lucrative activities.&lt;ref name= Netanel /&gt;

==Specifics by country==

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]] has created a supplemental licensing scheme, under Section 77 of its Copyright Act, that allows licenses for the use of published works to be issued by the Copyright Board of Canada on behalf of unlocatable rightsholders, after a prospective licensor has made "reasonable efforts to locate [holders of] copyright".&lt;ref name= Canada1&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
{{Main|Orphan Works Directive}}
The [[European Commission]] (EC), the civil branch of the [[European Union]] (EU), created a report on Digital Preservation of Orphan Works and Out-of-Print Works in 2007.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web

On 4 June 2008, European representatives of museums, libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and rightsholders signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/other_groups/hleg/meetings/index_en.htm |title=Digital Libraries Initiative - High Level Expert Group (HLEG) &amp;#124; Europa - Information Society |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an orphan works legislation supported by rightsholders. It helps cultural institutions to digitize books, films, and music whose authors are unknown, making them available to the public online.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; In 2009 the [[Strategic Content Alliance]] and the [[Collections Trust]] published a report&lt;ref name=JISC /&gt; on the scope and impact of orphan works and their effect on the delivery of web services to the public.

In October 2012 the European Union adopted [[Directive 2012/28/EU]] on Orphan Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm |title=Directive 2012/28/EU |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive applies to orphan works that were created in the EU as printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers), [[cinematographic]] and audio-visual works, [[Sound recording|phonogram]]s, and works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book). Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo - Orphan works - FAQ|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-743_en.htm?locale=en|work=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether orphaned [[software]] and [[video game]]s ("[[Abandonware]]") fall under the ''audiovisual works'' definition is a matter debated by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive was influenced by a survey of the state of intellectual property law in the [[United Kingdom]] called the ''[[Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth]]''. [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], one of the experts consulted for the Review, praised the directive as a start, but offered this criticism of the resulting policy:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Is-Copyright-Reform-Possible1.pdf "(When) Is Copyright Reform Possible? Lessons from the Hargreaves Review"] by James Boyle (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In brief, the scheme is heavily institutional, statist, and inflexible. Its provisions can really only be used by educational and cultural heritage institutions, only for non-profit purposes, with lengthy and costly licensing provisions designed to protect the monetary interests of&amp;mdash;almost certainly&amp;mdash;non-existent rights holders. The EU seemed never to grasp the idea that citizens also need to have access to orphan works, for uses that almost certainly present no threat to any living rights holder.}}

The ''' Philippine Constitutional Convention of 1971''' was called to change the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]].  The delegates were elected on November 10, 1970, and the convention itself was convened on June 1, 1971. It was marked by controversies, including efforts to uphold term limits for incumbent [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and a bribery scandal in which 14 people, including First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]], were accused of bribing delegates to favor the Marcoses.

Marcos [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|declared martial law]] in September 1972, and had 11 opposition delegates arrested. The remaining opposition delegates were forced to go either into exile or hiding.  Within two months, an entirely new draft of the constitution was created from scratch by a special committee.  The [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|1973 constitutional plebiscite]] was called to ratify the new constitution, but the validity of the ratification was brought to question because Marcos replaced the method of voting through secret ballot with a system of [[wikt:viva voce|viva voce]] voting by "citizen's assemblies". The ratification of the constitution was challenged in what came to be known as the [[Ratification Cases]].

== Background ==
=== The 1935 Constitution ===
By the middle of the 1930s, the end of the American occupation of the Philippines was supposed to be in sight. In 1934 the US had approved a ten-year plan for the Philippines' transition from a commonwealth to a fully independent nation-state, based on the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Act of 1916]].  One of the preconditions for this independence was the creation of "a stable democratic government" based on the American model of governance, rather than being based on the French model as the [[Malolos Constitution]] had been.&lt;ref name="ConstitutionNet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/country/constitutional-history-philippines |title=Constitutional history of the Philippines |website=ConstitutionNet |language=en |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although World War II interfered with the transition plan and a puppet constitution was put in place by the Japanese Imperial Army from 1943 until the defeat of the Japanese forces in 1944, the Philippines was granted independence on July 4, 1946.  Upon independence, the 1935 constitution came into effect, featuring a government structure very similar to that of the United States: an executive branch with a President who could be elected to a maximum of two four-year terms; a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of a congress and a senate; and an independent judicial branch.&lt;ref name="ConstitutionNet"/&gt;

=== Campaign to change the 1935 Constitution ===
In 1967, the executive branch was headed by the tenth president, [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Expressing opposition to the administration's policies and citing rising discontent over wide inequalities in society,&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Kasaysayan, The Story of the Filipino People Volume 9:A Nation Reborn |publisher=Asia Publishing Company Limited |year=1998 |editor-last=Magno |editor-first=Alexander R. |location=Hong Kong |chapter=Democracy at the Crossroads}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics of Marcos began campaigning to change a constitution which they said had been written under the dominion of the country's former colonial overlords.&lt;ref name="DeanAndyBautista20141011"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2014/10/11/1378790/chartering-change-ii |title=Chartering change (II) |last=Bautista |first=Andy |date=October 11, 2014 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 16 of that year, the Philippine Congress constituted itself into a Constituent Assembly and passed Resolution No. 2, which called for a Constitutional Convention to change the 1935 Constitution.&lt;ref name="ImbongvFerrer"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/scdecisions/jurisprudence1970/sep1970/gr_32432_1970.php |title=G.R. No. L-32432 – Manuel B. Imbong vs. Jaime Ferrer |last=R.E.Diaz |website=www.chanrobles.com |language=en |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos surprised his critics by endorsing the move, and it was later revealed that the resulting Constitutional Convention would lay the foundation for the legal justifications Marcos would use to extend his term past the two four-year terms allowable under the 1935 Constitution.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== Convention leadership and members ==
{{main|Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1970}}
A special election was held on November 10, 1970 to elect the delegates of the convention.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;{{rp|page="130"}} Once the winners had been determined, the convention was convened on June 1, 1971 at the newly completed [[Quezon City Hall]].&lt;ref name=""KatePedroso&amp;MinervaGeneralao20160921&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/817651/september-1972-recalling-the-last-days-and-hours-of-democracy |title=September 1972: Recalling the last days and hours of democracy |last=Pedroso |first=Kate  |date=September 21, 2016 |access-date=October 20, 2018 |last2=Generalao |first2=Minerva |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Philippine President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] was sworn in as the President of the Constitutional Convention on the day the convention was convened, but he died thirteen days after taking oath. Former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] replaced Garcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The election for the Presidency of the 1971 Constitutional Convention|url=http://tumblr.malacanang.gov.ph/post/42089411636/the-election-for-the-presidency-of-the-1971|website=Official Tumblr page of the Presidential Museum and Library|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sotero Laurel|Sotero H.

A total of 320 delegates were elected to the convention, the most prominent being former Senators [[Raul Manglapus]] and [[Roseller T. Lim]]. Other delegates would become influential political figures, including [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]], [[Marcelo Fernan]], [[Sotero Laurel]], [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], [[Teofisto Guingona, Jr.]], [[Raul Roco]], [[Edgardo Angara]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]], [[Margarito Teves]], and [[Federico Dela Plana]].&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=delegates/&gt;

== Proposal of "Ban Marcos" provisions ==
Even as far back as 1967, when the creation of the Constitutional Convention was proposed, opposition politicians feared that Marcos would use the convention as a way to stay in power beyond the two four-year terms allowed him by the 1935 Constitution.  Because of these fears, the original resolution in congress which called for the convention had a provision that would have required the proposed new Constitution to have a provision preventing Marcos or his wife Imelda from running for office after the end of his term in 1973.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;{{rp|page="132"}}  The provision was defeated in Congress by a narrow vote.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

Members of the opposition who were elected as Constitutional Convention delegates nevertheless proposed such "Ban the Marcoses" provisions during the deliberations of the Convention.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

Soon after the Constitutional Convention was convened, 176 of the 206 delegates signed a resolution by delegate [[Napoleon Rama]] calling for a ban on the Marcoses. Later, the Committee on Suffrage and Election Reforms, chaired by [[Raul Manglapus]], drafted a resolution&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt; which read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No person who has served as President of the Philippines shall be eligible to occupy the same office or that of chief minister or chief executive any time in the future, nor shall his spouse or relatives to the second degree by consanguinity or affinity be eligible to occupy the same office during any unexpired portion of his term or in one immediately succeeding term.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deliberations on these provisions dragged out due to partisan rambling, continuing until Marcos' declaration of martial law in September 1972.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt; Rama was put in jail along with 10 other members of the opposition bloc, while numerous others, including Manglapus, were forced into hiding or exile. They were dropped from the Marcos-sponsored final draft of the constitution which was approved by the convention in November 1972.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Espiritu1993" /&gt;

== Eduardo Quintero's delegate bribery exposé ==
Already bogged down by politicking and delays, the credibility of the 1971 Constitutional Convention took a severe blow in May 1972 when a delegate exposed a bribery scheme in which delegates were paid to vote in favor of the Marcoses – with First Lady Imelda Marcos herself implicated in the alleged payola scheme.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;{{rp|page="133"}}&lt;ref name="BantayogQuintero"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bantayog.org/quintero-eduardo-t/ |title=QUINTERO, Eduardo T. – Bantayog ng mga Bayani |date=May 16, 2016 |work=Bantayog ng mga Bayani |access-date=June 2, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the convention was convened, the "progressive bloc" of the convention believed that Marcos was influencing the proceedings through the votes of delegates allied to the Marcoses and Imelda's family, the Romualdezes.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;  This suspicion was further strengthened on May 19, 1972, when [[Eduardo Quintero (Filipino diplomat)|Eduardo Quintero]] – a former Ambassador to the United Nations and the elected Constitutional Convention delegate for [[Leyte]]'s first district – revealed that some of the delegates, including himself, had been receiving money from a "Money Lobby".&lt;ref name="BantayogQuintero"/&gt;  He was politically indebted to the Marcoses because he was elected with the aid of Imelda Marcos' brother, but he said that he finally wanted "to do the correct thing".&lt;ref name="BantayogQuintero"/&gt;

Quintero eventually released a three-page sworn statement that named 14 persons involved in the bribery scheme. The list included 12 of Quintero's fellow Convention delegates, the wife of delegate Artemio Mate, and Imelda Marcos.&lt;ref name="Newsbreak20030217"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.newsbreak-knowledge.ph/2003/02/17/looking-back-the-1971-constitutional-convention-2/ |title=Looking Back: The 1971 Constitutional Convention |date=February 17, 2003 |work=Newsbreak |access-date=June 2, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposé tainted the Convention, angered the anti-Marcos opposition, and scandalized the country.  [[Manila]] drivers plastered signs reading "Mabuhay Quintero!" ("Long Live Quintero!") on the sides of their cars in the days after Quintero's exposé.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;  Later historians&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt; note that this would have jeopardized any efforts on Marcos' part to hold on to power beyond the two four-year terms allowed him by the 1935 Constitution, but the social unrest brought about by Marcos' 1970 debt crisis enabled him to stay in power anyway – by declaring martial law.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== September 1972 bombing ==
On September 18, 1972 the convention was targeted by one of the last [[1972 Manila bombings]] – about 20 explosions in various locations in Metro Manila in the months after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]] and immediately preceding Marcos' declaration of martial law.&lt;ref name=""KatePedroso&amp;MinervaGeneralao20160921/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== Arrest of opposition delegates ==
{{main|Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos}}

The work of the Convention was affected by the declaration of martial law in September 1972 by President Marcos. The military units assigned to implement the law were given a list of 400 individuals to arrest, consisting mostly of outspoken critics of Marcos' administration.  This included a number of members of the Constitutional Convention.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

Some of the individuals on the list, such as [[Raul Manglapus]],&lt;ref name="MartinWeil1990726"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/07/26/raul-s-manglapus-former-foreign-secretary-of-philippines-dies-at-80/5f096154-7dec-4197-9ebb-44acd385ded4/ |title=Raul S.

As recounted by oppositionist Convention delegate Caesar Espiritu, officials privy to variations of the priority arrest list eventually informed them which other Convention delegates had been put on the list.  Aside from those actually arrested, one "shortlist" of 12 delegates identified six other delegates: Sonny Alvarez, Antonio "Tonypet" Araneta, Romy Capulong, Boni Gillego, [[Raul Manglapus]], and [[Raul Roco]]. (Among those actually arrested, this list named Garcia, Guiao, Lichauco, Rama, Rondon, and Velez.)&lt;ref name="Espiritu1993" /&gt;{{rp|page=39}}

The longest list the convention delegates were able to piece together listed a total of 32 delegates, identifying Bacalzo, Guingona, Concepcion, Nolledo, and Viterbo who were all arrested, and additionally mentioned "[[Lilia Delima|Delima]] (the only girl), [[Samuel Occeña|Occeña]], Badoy, Sanchez, the Espiritu brothers, Pepe Calderon, Kalaw, [[Pacifico Ortiz, SJ|Father Ortiz]], and Amatong".&lt;ref name="Espiritu1993" /&gt;{{rp|page=39}}

With nearly a dozen of its members in jail and some of its most prominent leaders overseas or in hiding, the "progressive faction" of the convention which spoke against Marcos was no longer able to contribute to the discussion.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== Revised new draft Constitution==
In contrast to the slow, contentious deliberations that marked its early days, the Convention moved quickly after Marcos had declared martial law. The opposition bloc had effectively been decimated and the threat of imprisonment hung over any delegates who might voice opposition in the Convention.  Macapagal thus allowed the regular rules of the Convention to be suspended so that a 166-member group headed by Marcos-supporting delegate Gilberto Duavit came up with a new draft of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="PCIJ20060501"/&gt;

By November 29, 1972, a little over two months after the declaration of martial law, the Convention approved the draft, with Macapagal "reluctantly putting his signature" on a document that would give so much power to Marcos.&lt;ref name="Espiritu1993" /&gt; It was presented to  Marcos at the Malacañang palace on December 1, 1972, marking the end of the Constitutional Convention's task.&lt;ref name="PCIJ20060501"/&gt;

==1973 constitutional plebiscite and the Ratification Cases==
{{main|Ratification Cases}}
On January 5, 1973, Marcos, who had seized legislative power as part of his declaration of martial law, issued Presidential Decree No. 86-A, an addendum to the Revised Barrio Charter (Presidential Decree No. 86) which he had signed in late December to reconstitute Philippine Barrios (villages) into a new structure called a "[[Barangay]]".&lt;ref name="PD86-1972"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 86 December 31, 1972|url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1972/pd_86_1972.html|publisher=The LAWPHIL Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential Decree No. 86-A cancelled the election plebiscite in which Philippine citizens would have voted whether or not to ratify the new Constitution. Instead, the 1973 Constitution would be ratified using "Citizen's Assemblies".&lt;ref name="PD86A-1973"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 86-A January 5, 1973 |url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1973/pd_86_a_1973.html|publisher=The LAWPHIL Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution was supposedly presented for the people's ratification in the [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|1973 constitutional plebiscite]],&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt; where the Citizen's Assemblies supposedly showed their assent through [[voice vote|''viva voce'' votation]].&lt;ref name="Graham&amp;Saunders2002"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/715166703 |title=Asia-Pacific constitutional systems |last=Graham. |first=Hassall, |last2=Saunders |first2=Cheryl |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511549960 |location=Cambridge |oclc=715166703}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=213}}  Due to the lack of reportage accompanying the gagging of the Philippine press during martial law, there are no reliable records of how many citizens actually participated in these assemblies.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt; The results of the plebiscite were thus questioned before the [[Philippine Supreme Court]] in what came to be known as the [[Ratification Cases|Plebiscite Cases (''Planas v. COMELEC'' (1973))]], and the legality of the 1973 Constitution questioned in what came to be known as the [[Ratification Cases|Ratification Cases (''Javellana v. Executive Secretary'')]].&lt;ref name="Bernas2003"&gt;Bernas, Joaquin (2003). ''The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines: a Commentary''. Rex Book Store, Manila&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruz2000"&gt;Cruz, Isagani A. (2000). ''Res Gestae: A Brief History of the Supreme Court''. Rex Book Store, Manila&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ratification Cases, six of the 10 members of the court (the Chief Justice, and Justices Makalintal, Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, and Teehankee) said that the 1973 Constitution had not been ratified validly. But Justices Makalintal and Castro said that the people had acquiesced to the 1973 Constitution whether or not the ratification was valid, saying that the question of whether the Constitution could be invalidated was a political determination and not a judicial one. The Constitution was thus effectively upheld.&lt;ref name="Bernas2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruz2000"/&gt;

Marcos would continue to rule as a dictator until being ousted by the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

'''Political sociology''' is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State, to civil society, to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the "founding fathers" of sociology – Marx, Durkheim and Max Weber – to such contemporary theorists as Gellner, Giddens, Habermas and Mann. 
Where a typical research question in political [[sociology]] might have been "Why do so few American or European citizens choose to [[Voting|vote]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way | publisher=Pantheon | author=Piven, F. | year=1988 | isbn=0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even "What difference does it make if women get elected?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Phillips |date=1991|title= Engendering Democracy | location= Cambridge| publisher=Polity | URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7EUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; political sociologists also now ask: "How is the body a site of power?",&lt;ref&gt;R. Sassatelli (2011) 'Body Politics' in E. Amenta, K. Nash and A. Scott (eds) The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; "How are emotions relevant to global [[poverty]]?",&lt;ref&gt;K. Nash (2008) 'Global citizenship as show business: the cultural politics of Make Poverty History' Media, Culture and Society 30/1 &lt;http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/94/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "What difference does knowledge make to [[democracy]]?"&lt;ref&gt;B. De Sousa Santos et al.

== Traditional divisions ==
Traditionally there were four main areas of research:

# The sociopolitical formation of the [[modern state]];
# "Who rules?" How [[social inequality]] between [[Social group|groups]] ([[Social class|class]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], etc.) influences [[politics]];&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff G. William. Power Structure Research and the hope for Democracy. Adam Schneider, April 2005. Web Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009. From: &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=three+major+theoretical+frameworks+are+elite+pluralism+and+managerial+theory.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
# How [[public opinion]], [[ideology|ideologies]], personalities, [[social movement]]s, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics;
# Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell,Timothy, Betty A. Dobratz,and Lisa K. Waldner."The Politics of Social Inequality." 14 Mar. 2001. Web. 29 Sept 2009. From: &lt;http://books.emeraldinsight.com/display.asp?K=9780762307562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nachtigal M. Paul."Political Trends Affecting Nonmetropolitan America." Journal of Research in Rural Education Vol.10 (1994):161–166. Print. From: &lt;http://www.jrre.psu.edu/articles/v10,n3,p161-166,Nachtigal.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], elite or managerial theory, and class analysis (which overlaps with [[Marxism|Marxist]] analysis).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Peter, Arnold Rose, [[Talcott Parsons]], and Neil Smelser. "Political Sociological Theories:Theories of the State and Power." 16 Jan. 2003. Web. 28 Sept 2009 from: &lt;{{cite web |url=http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212105955/http://stmarys.ca/~evanderveen/wvdv/political_sociology/political_sociological_theories.htm |archivedate=2009-12-12 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is [[Theda Skocpol]]. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis A. Coser]]. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48–50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from &lt;http://www.polycola.com/search.php?stypes=&amp;eng1=yahoo&amp;eng2=google&amp;st=Web&amp;q=social+class+theory+emerged+when&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can be split into two parts: one is the "power structure" or "instrumentalist" approach, whereas another is the [[Structural functionalism|structuralist]] approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is [[G. William Domhoff]]. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others ([[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Bob Jessop]]).

== Pluralism and power relations ==
Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of [[social theory]]. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies ([[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]), post-structuralism ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]]), pragmatism ([[Luc Boltanski]]), structuration theory ([[Anthony Giddens]]), and cultural sociology ([[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]).

Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal [[economic power]] and thus possible political inequality as well.

For pluralists,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another.

The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and Baratz&lt;ref&gt;Bachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non-decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57&lt;/ref&gt; (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.

The '''presumption of innocence''' is the principle that one is considered innocent unless proven guilty. It was traditionally expressed by the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin maxim]] ''ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat'' (“the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies”).

In many [[State (polity)|states]], presumption of innocence is a [[legal right]] of the accused in a [[criminal trial]], and it is an international [[human right]] under the [[UN]]'s [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of innocence, the [[legal burden of proof]] is thus on the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]], which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. The trier of fact (a judge or a jury)  is thus restrained and ordered by law to consider only actual evidence and testimony presented in court. The prosecution must, in most cases prove that the accused is [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] beyond [[reasonable doubt]]. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be [[Acquittal|acquitted]].

Under the [[Justinian Codes]] and [[English common law]], the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings, and in civil proceedings (like [[breach of contract]]) both sides must issue proof. 

== History ==

=== Roman law ===
The sixth century [[Digest_(Roman_law)|''Digest'']] of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (22.3.2) provides, as a general rule of evidence: ''Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/d-22.htm |title=Digesta seu Pandectae 22.3.2 |location=Grenoble |publisher=Université Pierre-Mendés-France |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}"Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him  who denies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Alan |editor-last=Watson |editor-link=Alan Watson (legal scholar) |title=The Digest of Justinian |year=1998 |origyear=1985 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-8122-1636-9 |section=22.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is there attributed to the second and third century jurist [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paul]]. It was introduced in Roman criminal law by emperor [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 527"&gt;See Bury, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
Similar to that of Roman Law, Islamic law also holds the principle that the onus of proof is on the accuser or claimant based on a [[hadith]] documented by [[Al-Nawawi|Imam Nawawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Imam Nawawi. 1977. ''An-Nawawi’s Forty Hadith (Second Edition English Translation by Ezzedin Ibrahim)''. Damascus: Holy Koran Pub. House, Hadith No. 33&lt;/ref&gt; 'Suspicion' is also highly condemned, this also from a hadith documented by Imam Nawawi&lt;ref&gt;Riyaadus Shaaliheen, Hadith No. 1573&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Imam Bukhari]]&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Al-Bukhari (English Version), Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 90&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim (English Version), Book 32, Hadith 6214&lt;/ref&gt;

After the time of [[Muhammad]], the fourth [[Caliph]] [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Thalib]] has also been cited to say 'Avert the prescribed punishment by rejecting doubtful evidence.'&lt;ref&gt;Imam ibn Hajar's Bulugh al-Maram (English Version), Book 10, Hadith 1260&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages in Europe ===

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe fell back on [[Feudalism|feudal]] law. This included some [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] customs, including presumed guilt. The accused could prove his innocence by having, for example, twelve people swear that he could not have done what he was accused of. This tended to favor the nobility over the lower classes."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.thefinertimes.com/Middle-Ages/law-in-the-middle-ages.html |title=Law in the Middle Ages |publisher=The Finer Times |accessdate=January 16, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil law ===
The maxim or its equivalent has been adopted by many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, including [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/del3689.htm Decree-Law 3689|date=August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/lawsdata/chineselaw/200211/20021100053376.html CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA|date=August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;[[France]],&lt;ref name="CPPprelim"&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=19C04F150E579BCAE87BE5E6305FF5F5.tpdjo03v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574771&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20110106 Code de procédure pénale, article préliminaire] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foroeuropeo.it/latino/latino.htm |title=ForoEuropo Italia |publisher=Foroeuropeo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611152854/http://www.foroeuropeo.it/latino/latino.htm |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assomedici.it/Doc/OnereProva.htm |title=Assomedici.It |publisher=Assomedici.It |date=1993-01-29 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1998/dec1998/124329.htm People vs. Masalihit, decision of the Supreme Court of The Philippines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120820/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1998/dec1998/124329.htm |date=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infoportal.fra.europa.eu/InfoPortal/infobaseShowContent.do?btnCat_320&amp;btnCountryBread_189 |title=National Constitutional Law Related to Article 48 – Presumption of Innocence and Right to Defence |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711025000/http://infoportal.fra.europa.eu/InfoPortal/infobaseShowContent.do?btnCat_320&amp;btnCountryBread_189 |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?den=act2_1&amp;par1=2#t2c2s0a23 |title=Constitution of Romania, Article 23 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Valentin Anders |url=http://latin.dechile.net/?Juridico=1 |title=Latin legal maxims in Spanish |publisher=Latin.dechile.net |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:William Garrow2.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[William Garrow]] coined the phrase "presumed innocent until proven guilty", insisting that defendants' accusers and their evidence be thoroughly tested in court]]

"Presumption of innocence" serves to emphasize that the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt (or some other level of proof depending on the criminal justice system) and that the accused bears no burden of proof.&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Mueller, Christopher B. |author2=Laird C. Kirkpatrick |title=Evidence; 4th ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Aspen (Wolters Kluwer) |isbn=978-0-7355-7968-2}} pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often expressed in the phrase ''innocent until proven guilty'', coined by the English lawyer [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] (1760–1840).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Christopher|title=The Law Society of Upper Canada and Ontario's lawyers, 1797–1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8020-4127-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrow insisted that accusers be robustly tested in court. An objective observer in the position of the juror must reasonably conclude that the defendant almost certainly committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of the Land |last=Rembar |first=Charles |year=1980 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page=&lt;!-- needed --&gt; |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption of innocence was originally expressed by the French cardinal and jurist [[Jean Lemoine]] in the phrase "''item quilbet presumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens'' (a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty)", based on the legal inference that most people are not criminals.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;''Words and Phrases'' 1914, p. 1168&lt;/ref&gt; However, this referred not merely to the fact that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution in a criminal case, but the protections which a defendant should be given-prior [[notice]] of the accusation being made against them, the [[right of confrontation]], [[right to counsel]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.edu/scholar/172/ Innocent Until Proven Guilty: The Origins of a Legal Maxim] Kenneth Pennington A Ennio Cortese (3 Volumes. Roma: Il Cigno Galileo Galilei Edizioni, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
It is literally considered favorable evidence for the accused that automatically attaches at trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coffin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|156|432|1895}} “the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in [their] behalf”&lt;/ref&gt; It requires that the [[trier of fact]], be it a juror or judge, begin with the presumption that the state is unable to support its assertion.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; To ensure this legal protection is maintained a set of three related rules govern the procedure of criminal trials.  The presumption means:&lt;ref name="Mueller"/&gt;

#With respect to the critical facts of the case—whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant was the person who committed the crime—the state has the entire burden of proof.
#With respect to the critical facts of the case, the defendant does not have any burden of proof whatsoever. The defendant does not have to testify, call witnesses or present any other evidence, and if the defendant elects not to testify or present evidence, this decision cannot be used against them.
#The jury or judge is not to draw any negative inferences from the fact the defendant has been charged with a crime and is present in court and represented by an attorney. They must decide the case solely on evidence presented during the trial.

This duty on the prosecution was famously referred to as the “golden thread” in the criminal law by [[John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey|Lord Sankey]] [[Lord Chancellor|LC]] in ''[[Woolmington v DPP]]'':
{{bquote|Throughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen—that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception...}}

==The fundamental right==
This right is so important in modern [[democracy|democracies]], [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and [[republic]]s that many have explicitly included it in their legal codes and constitutions:

* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 11, states: "Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.".
* The [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] of the [[Council of Europe]] says (art. 6.2): "Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law". This convention has been adopted by [[treaty]] and is binding on all Council of Europe members. Currently (and in any foreseeable expansion of the EU) every country member of the [[European Union]] is also member to the Council of Europe, so this stands for EU members as a matter of course. Nevertheless, this assertion is iterated ''verbatim'' in Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].
* In [[Canada]], [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] states: "Any person charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal".
* In the [[Constitution of Colombia|Colombian constitution]], Title II, Chapter 1, Article 29 states that "Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law".
* In [[France]], article 9 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] 1789, which has force as [[constitution]]al law, begins:  "Any man being presumed innocent until he has been declared guilty ...".  The Code of Criminal Procedure states in its preliminary article that "any person suspected or prosecuted is presumed innocent for as long as their guilt has not been established"&lt;ref name="CPPprelim" /&gt; and the [[Jury|jurors']] oath repeats this assertion (article 304).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=323BC6F257637C73CC209B436A9FDD7D.tpdjo03v_1?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006167464&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20110106 Code de procédure pénale, article 304] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists a popular misconception that under French law, the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Michael H.|title=French Law Presumes Accused Innocent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/opinion/l-french-law-presumes-accused-innocent-814392.html|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=[[New York Times]]|date=23 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Iran]], Article 37 of the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] states: "Innocence is to be presumed, and no one is to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court".
* In [[Italy]], the second paragraph of Article 27 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]] states: "A defendant shall be considered not guilty until a final sentence has been passed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Romania, article 23 of the [[Constitution of Romania|Constitution]] states that "any person shall be presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court."
* The [[Constitution of Russia]], in article 49, states that "Everyone charged with a crime shall be considered not guilty until his or her guilt has been proven in conformity with the federal law and has been established by the valid sentence of a court of law". It also states that "The defendant shall not be obliged to prove his or her innocence" and "Any reasonable doubt shall be interpreted in favor of the defendant".
* In the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa|South African Constitution]], section 35(3)''(h)'' of the [[Bill of Rights of South Africa|Bill of Rights]] states: "Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be presumed innocent, to remain silent, and not to testify during the proceedings."
* Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments. The case of ''[[Coffin v. United States]]'' (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also ''[[In re Winship]].''
* In [[New Zealand]], the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990]] provides inter alia at section 25 (c) "Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination of the charge, the following minimum rights: (c) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225527.html New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 25 Minimum standards of criminal procedure – New Zealand Legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern practices==
[[File:07CFREU-Article48.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Article 48 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms the right to the presumption of innocence]]
In the [[United Kingdom]] changes have been made affecting this principle. Defendants' previous convictions may in certain circumstances be revealed to juries. Although the suspect is not compelled to answer questions after formal arrest, failure to give information may now be prejudicial at trial. Statute law also exists which provides for criminal penalties for failing to decrypt data on request from the Police. If the suspect is unwilling to do so, it is an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000023_en_1 |title=OPSI.gov.uk |publisher=OPSI.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens can therefore be convicted and imprisoned without any evidence that the encrypted material was unlawful. Furthermore, in sexual offence cases such as rape, where the sexual act has already been proved beyond reasonable doubt, there are a limited number of circumstances where the defendant has an obligation to adduce evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual act, or that the defendant reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting.  These circumstances include, for example, where the complainant was unconscious, unlawfully detained, or subjected to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 |title=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical egalitarianism''' is a [[political theory]] associated with the ideas of optimistic tendencies, the suggestions that Americans must work in a [[Multiethnic society|multiracial society]] and that citizens must use [[activism]] to achieve the ultimate goal of satisfactory conditions for the entire population.

}} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "reconquest") is a name used in English to describe the period in the history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of about 780 years between the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in 711 and the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada]] to the expanding [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms]] in 1491. The completed [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] was the context of the Spanish voyages of discovery and conquest (Columbus got royal support in Granada in 1492, months after its conquest), and the [[Americas]]—the "[[New World]]"—ushered in the era of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonial empires.

Traditional historiography has marked the beginning of the ''{{lang|es|Reconquista}}'' with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] (718 or 722), the first known victory in Iberia by Christian military forces since the 711 military intervention in Iberia of combined Arab-Berber forces. In that small battle, a group led by the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] defeated a Muslim patrol in the mountains of northern Iberia and established the independent Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. It ended with the conquest of the [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim state in the peninsula, in 1491.

After 1491, the entire peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. The conquest was followed by the [[Alhambra Decree]] (1492) which expelled Jews who would not convert to Christianity from Castile and Aragon, and a series of edicts (1499–1526) which [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|forced the conversions of the Muslims in Spain]]. Since the mid-19th century, the idea of a 'reconquest' took hold in Spain associated with its rising [[nationalism]] and [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Concept and duration==
Traditional [[historiography]] has stressed since the 19th century the existence of the ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Fitz|first1=Francisco|date=2009|title=La Reconquista: un estado de la cuestión|url=http://www.durango-udala.net/portalDurango/RecursosWeb/DOCUMENTOS/1/1_1945_3.pdf|journal=Clío &amp; Crímen: Revista del Centro de Historia del Crimen de Durango |language=es|volume=|issue=6|pages=142–215|doi=|issn=1698-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |year= 2003 |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0812236965|page= 19|accessdate=February 15, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4gVIt5u0U5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Cambridge Medieval. History 1|last=McKitterick |first=Rosamond |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |author2=Collins, R. |year= 1990 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=|isbn= 9780521362924|page= 289|accessdate=July 26, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZEaSdNBL0sgC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=the+basques+roger+collins#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20basques%20roger%20collins&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark was set by the Christian ''[[Chronica Prophetica]]'' (883–884), a document stressing the Christian and Muslim cultural and religious divide in Iberia and the necessity to drive the Muslims out.

[[File:Almohad1200.png|thumb|The [[Islami]]c [[Almohad dynasty]] and surrounding states, including the Christian Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and the [[Crown of Aragon]], c. 1200.]]

Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval/&gt; Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;María Rosa Menocal, ''The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain'', Back Bay Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0316168718}}, and see [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]], which started late in the 11–12th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest, confronted at that time with a similarly staunch Muslim [[Jihad]] ideology in [[Al-Andalus]] by the [[Almoravids]], and to an even greater degree by the [[Almohads]]. In fact, previous documents from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of "reconquest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fPSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=October 23, 2017|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0306-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', a fictitious 11th-century French version of the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] dealing with the Iberian ''[[Saracen]]s'' (''Moors''), and taught as historical fact in the French educational system since 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Pagans are wrong and Christians are right': Alterity, Gender, and Nation in the ''Chanson de Roland''|last=Kinoshita|first=Sharon|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|volume=31|issue=1|date=Winter 2001|pages=79–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiVanna |first1=Isabel N. |year=2010 |title=Politicizing national literature: the scholarly debate around La Chanson de Roland in the nineteenth century |journal=Historical Research |volume=84 |issue=223 |pages=109–134 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00540.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern idea of the earlier concept of ''Reconquista'' is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of [[Spanish nationalism]] in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[National-Catholicism|National-Catholic]] dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a "liberation war" of ''reconquest'' against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the [[Spanish Civil War]] who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt; Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church's unity, where Franco stood for both [[Pelagius of Asturias]] and [[El Cid]].&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt;

Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the [[Moors]] in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being 'rebuilt'.&lt;ref name="Purkis"&gt;{{cite book |title= Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Perspectives on State Building in the Iberian Peninsula |last=Purkis |first=William J. |year= 2010 |publisher= University of Birmingham |pages= 57–58|accessdate=October 15, 2017|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2010-05_W._J._Purkis,_Eleventh-_and_Twelfth-Century_Perspectives_on_State_Building_in_the_Iberian_Peninsula.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of ''Reconquista'' as a concept created ''a posteriori'' in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Eugènia de Pagès, "''La 'Reconquista', allò que mai no va existir''", ''La Lamentable'', July 11, 2014, [http://lamentable.org/la-reconquista-allo-que-mai-no-va-existir/ lamentable.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín M.

Quoted by De Pagès, E. July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is still widely in use.

== Background ==
{{Further|Islam in Spain}}

===Islamic conquest of Christian Iberia===
{{Further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Battle of Guadalete}}

In 711, Muslim [[Moors]], mainly North African [[Berber people|Berber]] soldiers with some [[Arab]]s, crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began their conquest of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania]]. After their conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom's Iberian territories, the Muslims crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and took control of [[Septimania]] in 719, the last province of the Visigothic Kingdom to be occupied. From their stronghold of [[Narbonne]], they launched raids into the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].

The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=Los Angeles: University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24840-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These armies established an Islamic rule known as [[Al-Andalus]] that would last 300 years in much of the Iberian Peninsula and 770 years in [[Granada]].

===Islamic rule===
{{Main article|Berbers and Islam|Berber Revolt|}}

After the establishment of a local [[Emirate]], [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]], ruler of the [[Umayyad|Umayyad caliphate]], removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the first governor of the newly conquered province of Al-Andalus, was recalled to [[Damascus]] and replaced with Musa bin Nusair, who had been his former superior. Musa's son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married [[Egilona]], [[Roderic]]'s widow, and established his regional government in [[Seville]]. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz's assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa bin Nusair, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa's cousin, [[Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi]] became the [[emir]] of ''Al-Andalus''.

The conquering generals were necessarily acting independently, due to the methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a distant province would gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were likely watched by certain circles of the distant government with a degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the formerly successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal to the government in Damascus.

A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Lowney]], ''A Vanished World: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain'', (Oxford University Press, 2005), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain'', (St.Martin's Press, 1995), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This latent internal conflict jeopardized Muslim unity.

After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] and was halted for a while on its way north. [[Odo of Aquitaine]] had married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (and, perhaps, contemporary Catalonia), in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] in 732.

A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

==Reconquista==
=== Beginning of the ''Reconquista'' ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
[[File:Escudo de Alcanadre-La Rioja.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Alcanadre]]. [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain. Depicting [[Maure|heads of slain Moors]]]]
The first victory in resistance to Muslim rule occurred in [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] in 722. A drastic increase of taxes by the emir [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]] provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by [[Pelagius of Asturias]] (Pelayo in Spanish, Pelayu in Asturian). Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius' [[Battle of Covadonga|victory at Covadonga]] as the beginning of the ''Reconquista''. No Muslim source mentions the battle at Covadonga, in contrast with the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721, with a death toll of perhaps tens of thousands, which was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. For Pelagius, however, the Christian victory secured his independent rule, while the precise date and circumstances of the battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelagius' rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were focusing in [[Septimania]] and Toulouse (721).

Two northern realms, the Basque Navarre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a ''cul-de-sac'' on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alphonse I centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=156, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias]] was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayo's dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors, the ''Banu Alfons'' from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II (from 791–842). A king's expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Great]] were declared to have been found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.

===Franks and Al-Andalus===
{{Main article|Islamic invasion of Gaul|Marca Hispanica}}

After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of [[Septimania]], starting in 719 with the conquest of [[Narbonne]] through 725 when [[Carcassone]] and [[Nîmes]] were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer [[Aquitaine]] but suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"&gt;{{cite book |title= 
The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20–33|accessdate=October 28, 2017|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after halting their advance north, [[Odo of Aquitaine]] married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (perhaps all of contemporary Catalonia as well), in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

==== Pepin the Younger and Charlemagne ====
After expelling the Muslims [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|from Narbonne in 759]] and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Pepin the Short conquered Aquitaine]] in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal [[William of Gellone]], making [[Toulouse]] his base for expeditions against Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt; Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the [[Carolingian Empire]] against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] was crowned king of [[Aquitaine]], under the supervision of Charlemagne's trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient [[Spanish March]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of Al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman]], autonomous governor (''[[wāli]]'') or king (''malik'') of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], Husayn, and [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]] at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huesca]] were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of [[Zaragoza]] Charlemagne received the homage of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]]. However the city, under the leadership of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], closed its gates and refused to submit.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"/&gt; Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[The Song of Roland]], a highly romanticized account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous [[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]] of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]]. In 792 Hisham proclaimed a [[jihad]], advancing in 793 against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and Carolingian [[Septimania|Septimania (Gothia)]]. They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but [[William of Gellone|William]] led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees. [[Barcelona]], a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for two years until it finally capitulated in 801.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 37-49"&gt;{{cite book |title= 
The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=37–49|accessdate=October 28, 2017|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}} It took place on 28 December 801.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main passes in the Pyrenees were [[Roncesvalles]], [[Somport]] and [[La Jonquera]]. Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of [[Pamplona]], [[Aragon]], and [[Catalonia]] respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of [[Catalan counties|small counties]], including [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[Girona (province)|Girona]], and [[Urgell]]; it was called the ''Marca Hispanica'' by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplona's first king was [[Iñigo Arista]], who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the [[Banu Qasi]] and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Carolingian expedition in 824]] that led to the setup of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. Aragon, founded in 809 by [[Aznar Galíndez]], grew around [[Jaca]] and the high valleys of the [[Aragon River]], protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the ''Reconquista''.

In the late 9th century under [[Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona|Count Wilfred]], Barcelona became the ''de facto'' capital of the region. It controlled the other counties' policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borrel II]], who declared that the new dynasty in France (the [[Capet]]s) were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.

===Expansion into the Crusades and military orders===
[[File:Cantigas battle.jpg|thumb|A battle of the ''Reconquista'' from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'']]
In the [[High Middle Ages]], the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula became linked to the fight of the whole of [[Christendom]]. The ''Reconquista'' was originally a mere war of conquest. It only later underwent a significant shift in meaning toward a religiously justified war of liberation (see the Augustinian concept of a [[Just War]]). The [[papacy]] and the influential [[Abbey of Cluny]] in Burgundy not only justified the acts of war but actively encouraged Christian knights to seek armed confrontation with Moorish "infidels" instead of with each other.

From the 11th century onwards [[indulgences]] were granted: In 1064 [[Pope Alexander II]] promised the participants of [[War of Barbastro|an expedition against Barbastro]] (''Tagr al-Andalus'', Aragon) a collective indulgence 30 years before [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]]. Papal interest in Christian-Muslim relations in the peninsula was not without precedent&amp;nbsp;– Popes Leo IV (847–855), John VIII (872–882) and John XIX (1024–33) are all known to have displayed substantial interest in the region. Not until 1095 and the [[Council of Clermont]] did the ''Reconquista'' amalgamate the conflicting concepts of a peaceful pilgrimage and armed knight-errantry. But the papacy left no doubt about the heavenly reward for knights fighting for Christ (''militia Christi''): in a letter, Urban II tried to persuade the ''reconquistadores'' fighting at [[Tarragona]] to stay in the Peninsula rather than joining the armed pilgrimage to conquer Jerusalem, saying that their contribution for Christianity was equally important. The pope promised them the same indulgences that he had promised to those who chose to join the First Crusade.

Later [[Military order (society)|military orders]] such as the [[Order of Santiago]], [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]], [[Order of Calatrava]], and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded or called to fight in Iberia. The Popes called the knights of Europe to join the effort to destroy the Muslim states of the peninsula. After the so-called [[Battle of Alarcos|Disaster of Alarcos]], French, Navarrese, Castilian, Portuguese and Aragonese armies united against the Muslim forces in the massive ''[[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]'' (1212). The large territories awarded to military orders and nobles were the origin of the [[latifundia]] in today's [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] in Spain, and [[Alentejo]] in Portugal.

==Military culture in medieval Iberia==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. Small, lightly equipped armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times, allowing a quick return home after sacking a target. Battles were mainly waged between clans, expelling intruder armies or sacking expeditions.

In the context of the relative isolation of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, and the contact with Moorish culture, geographical and cultural differences necessitated the use of military strategies, tactics, and equipment that were markedly different from those found in the rest of western Europe during this period.

Medieval Iberian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry (mostly nobles, but including commoner knights from the 10th century on) and the infantry, or ''peones'' (peasants). Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent.

=== Cavalry and infantry ===
Iberian [[cavalry tactics]] involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing [[javelin]]s, then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting [[spear]]s ([[lance]]s did not arrive in Hispania until the 11th century). There were three types of knights (''caballeros''): royal knights, noble knights (''caballeros [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]]''), and commoner knights (''caballeros villanos'', or "mounted soldier from a [[Villa#Post-Roman era|villa]]"). Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.

Royal knights were equipped in the same manner as their [[Goths|Gothic]] predecessors: mail [[hauberk]], kite shield, a long [[sword]] (designed to fight from the horse), javelins, spears and a [[francisca|Visigothic axe]]. Noble knights came from the ranks of the ''infanzones'' or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] because of ''[[fueros]]'' (charters) with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shields (influenced by Moorish shields), as well as a sword.

The ''peones'' were [[peasants]] who went to battle in service of their [[feudal]] lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The [[longbow]], the [[composite bow]], and the [[crossbow]] were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.

Armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales; full coats of [[chain mail]] were extremely rare and horse [[barding]] completely unknown. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector (influenced by the designs used by [[Viking]]s, who attacked during the 8th and 9th centuries) and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.

Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30&amp;nbsp;cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

Finally, mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available. [[Norsemen]], [[Flemings|Flemish]] spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers, and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.

=== Technological changes ===
This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.

Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family's coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, ''a la jineta'' (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey's seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, ''a la brida'', a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.

==Northern Christian realms==
The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds (see above). However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century (Leon, Najera). The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova (1031) heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre (1035). A myriad of autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.

===Kingdom of Asturias (718–924)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
{{See also|Kingdom of Galicia}}
{{See also|Duchy of Cantabria}}
The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] (''Pelayo''), a [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] noble who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, laying the foundations for the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz De La Peña. La monarquia asturiana 718–910, p. 27. Cangas de Onís, 2000. {{ISBN|9788460630364}} / Fernández Conde. Estudios Sobre La Monarquía Asturiana, pp. 35–76. Estudios Históricos La Olmeda, 2015. {{ISBN|9788497048057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in [[Cangas de Onís]], and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings (particularly [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]) emphasized the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in [[Visigothic Kingdom|Toledo]] and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Casariego, J.E.: Crónicas de los reinos de Asturias y León. Biblioteca Universitaria Everest, León 1985, p. 68. {{ASIN|B00I78R3S4}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius' daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alfonso's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque from [[Álava]], after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], while Alfonso I's daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

Alfonso's military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of [[Vardulia]]. With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], and [[Coimbra]]. Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|[[James, son of Zebedee#Spain|St James the Great]], depicted as [[Saint James Matamoros|Santiago Matamoros]] (Santiago the Moor-slayer)]]

During the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to [[Oviedo]]. The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of [[Pamplona]] and the [[Carolingian]]s, thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the [[Pope]] and [[Charlemagne]].

The [[relic|bones]] of St. [[James the Great]] were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia (present day [[Padrón]]) in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally "the star field"), possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to León, to become the [[Kingdom of León]] or Galicia-León. Santiago's were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Iberia. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later [[Way of Saint James]] (11–12th century) that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental [[Christian Europe]] for centuries.

Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], famed for the highly legendary [[Battle of Clavijo]], the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Galicia, and [[León (province)|León]] were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the [[Kingdom of León]], when León became the seat of the royal court (it didn't bear any official name).

===Kingdom of León (910–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of León|Kingdom of Galicia|County of Portugal}}
[[Alfonso III of Asturias]] repopulated the strategically important city [[León, Spain|León]] and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the [[Douro]] river. He reorganized his territories into the major duchies ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal) and major counties ([[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]] and Castile), and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the [[Kingdom of León]]. From this power base, his heir [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]] was able to organize attacks against [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and even [[Seville]].

The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] was gaining power, and began to attack León. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were [[battle of Valdejunquera|defeated in Valdejunquera]] in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.

The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for León was the reign of [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]]. King Ramiro, in alliance with [[Fernán González of Castile]] and his retinue of ''caballeros villanos'', [[battle of Simancas|defeated the Caliph in Simancas]] in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until [[Almanzor]] began his campaigns. [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]] finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.

The conquest of León did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after (by Ferdinand, son of Sancho the Great, around 1038). However, this brief period of independence meant that Galicia remained a kingdom and fief of Leon, which is the reason it is part of Spain and not Portugal. Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and León, instead of merely king of León as the two were united personally and not in union.

===Kingdom of Castile (1037–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Castile}}
[[File:Alfonso VI reconquista Toledo.JPG|thumb|Ceramic of the conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]]]]
[[Ferdinand I of León]] was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered [[Coimbra]] and attacked the [[taifa]] kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as [[parias]]. Ferdinand's strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous ''fueros''. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son [[Sancho II of Castile]] wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as [[El Cid Campeador]]. Sancho was killed in the siege of [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]] by the traitor Bellido Dolfos (also known as Vellido Adolfo) in 1072. His brother [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] took over León, Castile and Galicia.

Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the ''fueros'' and repopulated [[Segovia]], [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]] and [[Salamanca]]. Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful [[Taifa of Toledo|Taifa kingdom of Toledo]] in 1085. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this "conquest" was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. It was not until after sporadic and consistent population resettlements had taken place that Toledo was decisively conquered.

Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ("Emperor of all [[Hispania]]", referring to all the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, and not just the modern country of Spain). Alfonso's more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African [[Almoravid]]s for help.

=== Kingdom of Navarre (824–1620) ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Navarre}}
The [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona (traditionally in 824), establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the [[muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] of Tudela.

Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho the Great]] (1004–1035). The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the Principality of Catalonia. This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over [[Gascony]].

In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]] declared himself [[Kingdom of Navarre|king of Navarre]]. Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.

===Kingdom of Aragon (1035–1706)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon}}
[[File:Jaume I, Cantigas de Santa Maria, s.XIII.jpg|thumb|The Moors request permission from [[James I of Aragon]]]]

The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when [[Sancho III of Navarre]] decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of [[Alfonso the Battler]] in 1135.

In 1137 the heiress of the kingdom married the [[count of Barcelona]], and their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in what modern historians call the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the [[kingdom of Valencia]] and the [[kingdom of Mallorca]]. [[James I of Aragon]], also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], which released him from the nominal suzerainty of the King of France.

Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless [[Sancho VII of Navarre]]. But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose [[Theobald IV of Champagne]] in his stead.

Later on, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], married [[Isabella of Castile]], leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern [[Spain]], after the conquest of Upper [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (Navarre south of the Pyrenees) and the [[kingdom of Granada]].

===Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1910)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Portugal}}
[[File:GeraldoGeraldesSemPavor.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of [[Gerald the Fearless]]. A Portuguese folk hero with the head of a Moor]]

In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]] against the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Afonso Henriques]] was proclaimed the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Afonso's great deeds, whereby he would establish the first [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]] and be crowned by the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Archbishop of Braga]]. In the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143, [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.

In 1147, Portugal [[Conquest of Santarém|captured Santarém]], and seven months later the city of [[Lisbon]] was also brought under Portuguese control after the [[Siege of Lisbon]]. By the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]], [[Pope Alexander III]] recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.

With [[Portugal]] finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbours, [[Afonso Henriques]] and his successors, aided by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and the military monastic orders the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Order of Aviz]] or the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Saint James]], pushed the [[Moors]] to the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the ''Reconquista'' came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of [[Afonso III of Portugal]], religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.

[[File:OrderOfCristCross.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]]]

After the completion of the ''Reconquista'', the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless, [[Denis of Portugal]] carried out a short war with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] for possession of the towns of [[Serpa]] and [[Moura Municipality|Moura]]. After this, Denis avoided war; he signed the Treaty of Alcanizes with [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in 1297, establishing the present-day borders.

During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over [[Europe]], under the influence of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]] requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of [[Tomar]] as the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in 1319. Denis believed that the Order's assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars' contribution to the ''Reconquista'' and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.

The experience gained during the battles of the ''Reconquista'' was fundamental to [[Conquest of Ceuta]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} the first step to the establishment of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Likewise, the contact with [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim's navigation techniques and sciences]] enabled the creation of [[Portuguese Renaissance|Portuguese nautical innovations]] such as the [[caravel]] – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=John M.|title=The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521547246|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C&amp;pg=PA141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Minor Christian realms were the [[Kingdom of Viguera]] (970–1005), and the [[:es:Señorío de Valencia|Principality of Valencia]] (1094–1102).

==Christian infighting==
Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers.  Some Christian champions, like [[El Cid]], were contracted by [[taifa]] kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed, [[El Cid]]'s first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the [[Battle of Graus]] in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir|al-Muqtadir]], Muslim [[sultan]] of [[Zaragoza]], against the forces of [[Ramiro I of Aragon]]. There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Iberia.&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan"&gt;Joseph O'Callaghan (2003). ''Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain'', Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disastrous defeat of [[Alfonso VIII]], King of Castile, at [[Battle of Alarcos|Alarcos]], Kings [[Alfonso IX]] of León and [[Sancho VII]] of Navarre entered an alliance with the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], King of Portugal, Pope [[Celestine III]] declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that "the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see."&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan" /&gt; Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] invaded León. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.

In the late years of ''Al-Andalus'', Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of [[Granada]], but the kings preferred to claim the tribute of the Muslim ''[[parias]]''. The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered [[medieval Europe]].

==Christian repopulation of Iberian Peninsula==
{{Further|Medieval demography|Repoblación}}
The ''Reconquista'' was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of [[colonization|repopulation]]. Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the [[Douro]] Basin (the northern plateau), the high [[Ebro]] valley ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) and central [[Catalonia]]. The repopulation of the [[Douro]] Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the "pressure" (or ''presura'') system was employed. South of the [[Douro]], in the 10th and 11th centuries, the ''presura'' led to the "charters" (''[[foral|forais]]'' or ''[[fueros]]''). ''Fueros'' were used even south of the Central Range.

The ''presura'' referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as [[León (province)|León]] and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many [[wikt:freeman|free]] peasants. ''Presuras'' also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of [[Vic]].

During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing. ''[[Fuero]]s'' were [[charter]]s documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The ''fueros'' provided a means of escape from the [[feudal system]], as ''fueros'' were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide ''auxilium'' – aid or troops – for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the ''caballeros villanos''. The first ''fuero'' was given by count [[Fernán González]] to the inhabitants of [[Castrojeriz]] in the 940's. The most important towns of medieval Iberia had ''fueros'', or ''forais''. In Navarre, ''fueros'' were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the ''fuero'' of [[Teruel]], which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.

From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. ''Fueros'' remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. ''Fueros'' had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the ''fueros'' in Navarre would be one of the causes of the [[Carlist Wars]]. In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I ([[Castilian War of the Communities]]).

==Muslim decline and defeat==

===Fall of the Caliphate===
[[File:Batalla del Puig por Marzal de Sas (1410-20).jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Puig]] at [[El Puig|El Puig de Santa Maria]] in 1237]]

During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the [[Emir of Córdoba]] ([[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself [[Caliph]], independent from the [[Abbasid]]s in [[Baghdad]]. He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.

After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. Abd-ar-Rahman's grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great [[Vizier]] [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir|Almanzor]] (''al-Mansur'', "the victorious"). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking [[Burgos]], León, [[Pamplona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Santiago de Compostela]] before his death in 1002.

Between Almanzor's death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the [[Taifa|Taifa kingdoms]]. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.

The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] conquered [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], leader of the Almoravids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Almoravids===
{{Main article|Almoravid dynasty}}
[[File:Mapa reconquista almohades-en.svg|thumb|Extent of the ''Reconquista'' into Almohad territory as of 1157.]]
[[File:Capture de Séville par Ferdinand III.jpg|thumb|Capture of Seville by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] (painted by [[Francisco Pacheco]])]]
The [[Almoravid]]s were a Muslim militia primarily composed of Berber and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] Moors, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1094, due to the actions of [[El Cid]].

Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]], for he lost Rioja to [[Sancho II of Castile]], and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king [[Sancho Ramírez]], King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering ''Wasqa&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Huesca]] deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25&amp;nbsp;km from ''Saraqusta&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Zaragoza]].

Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and [[Taifa of Lérida|Lérida]], as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties.  But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

===Almohads===
{{Main article|Almohad dynasty}}
[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|''The Surrender of Granada'' by [[Francisco Pradilla Ortiz]]]]
After a brief period of disintegration (the second [[Taifa]] period), the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of ''Al-Andalus''. However they were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of ''Al-Andalus'' in the following decades. By 1252 only the [[Kingdom of Granada]] remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.

===Granada War and the end of Muslim rule in Iberia===
{{Main article|Granada War|Treaty of Granada (1491)}}
[[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] completed the ''Reconquista'' with a war against the [[Emirate of Granada]] that started in 1482 and ended with Granada's surrender on January 2, 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered "half a million within the realm." By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada's former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the [[Alpujarras]] mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to [[Tlemcen]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry. "Spain 1469 – 1714 A Society of Conflict." Third edition. pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1497 Spanish forces took [[Melilla]], west of Oran, and the island of [[Djerba]], south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|seizure of Oran in 1509]], and the capture of [[Bougie]] and [[Spanish conquest of Tripoli (1510)|Tripoli in 1510]]. The Spanish capture of [[Tripoli]] cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Great Muslim Empires|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in the east and were pushed back.

==Conversions and expulsions==
{{Main article|Treaty of Granada (1491)|Alhambra decree|Expulsion of the Moriscos|Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain}}
[[File:Higueruela.jpg|thumb|Forces of [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] Sultan of [[Granada]], at the [[Battle of La Higueruela]], 1431]]

As elsewhere in the Muslim world, Christians and Jews were allowed to retain their religions, with their own legal systems and courts, by paying a tax, the ''[[jizya]]''. The penalty for not paying it was imprisonment.

The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)]] only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On July 30, 1492, all the Jewish community – some 200,000 people – were forcibly expelled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/expulsion.html "Modern Jewish History: The Spanish Expulsion (1492)"], ''The Jewish Virtual Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the [[Alhambra decree]] ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared conversion to Catholicism compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] did the same to Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing conversions of its Muslim population during the [[Revolt of the Germanies]].&lt;ref name = "Tofiño"&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ciberletras/v06/tofino.html Censorship and Book Production in Spain During the Age of the Incunabula], Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada. Graduate Center, CUNY.&lt;/ref&gt; Many local officials took advantage of the situation to seize property.

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
{{Main article|Spanish Inquisition}}

Most of the descendants of those Muslims who submitted to conversion to Christianity – rather than exile – during the early periods of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, the Moriscos, were later [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled from Spain]] after serious social upheaval, when the Inquisition was at its height. The expulsions were carried out more severely in eastern Spain (Valencia and Aragon) due to local animosity towards Muslims and Moriscos where they were seen as economic rivals by local workers who saw them as cheap labor undermining their bargaining position with the landlords. Exactions imposed on the Moriscos paved the way to a major [[Morisco revolt]] happening in 1568, with the final [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] from [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] taking place in 1609; they were driven from [[Aragon]] at about the same time.

Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as ''[[Morisco]]s'', ''[[Marrano]]s'', and ''[[Converso]]s'', who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some – the numbers are debated – continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nevertheless, all those deemed to be "New Christians" were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions various [[treason|crimes against the Spanish state]] including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Classifications and later consequences==
[[File:Pedro Berruguete Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe 1495.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Dominic]] presiding over an ''auto-da-fé'', by [[Pedro Berruguete]] (around 1495)&lt;ref name="Prado"&gt;* [http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/saint-dominic-presides-over-an-auto-da-fe/] at [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The many advances and retreats created several social types:
*The ''[[Muladi]]'': Christians under Islamic rule who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Berbers.
*The ''[[Mozarab]]s'': Christians in Muslim-held lands. Some of them migrated to the north of the peninsula in times of persecution bringing elements of the styles, food and agricultural practices learned from the Andalusians, while they continued practicing their Christianity with older forms of Catholic worship and their own versions of the [[Latin]] language.
*"[[New Christians]]", Jews converting to Christianity called ''[[conversos]]'', or pejoratively ''[[Marrano]]s''. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were [[Crypto-Jews]] who continued practicing [[Judaism]] secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews, known as ''Conversos'' (''the converted''), were subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of ''conversos'' in [[auto-da-fé]]s ("acts of faith"), often public executions by burning the victim alive.
*The ''[[Mudéjar]]'' : Muslims in Christian-held lands.
* ''[[Morisco]]s'': Muslim ''[[converso]]s''. Muslims who were forced to convert to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the [[Alhambra Decree]] the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]].

==Legacy==
{{See also|History of Spain|History of Portugal|Portugal in the period of discoveries}}

Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the ''Reconquista'' are the subject of much of medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Spanish literature|Spanish]], and [[Catalan literature]] such as the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

Some noble [[genealogy|genealogies]] show the close relations (although not very numerous) between Muslims and Christians. For example, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]], whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish ''Al-Andalus'' Iberia, married Abda, daughter of [[Sancho II of Navarra|Sancho Garcés II]] of [[Navarra]], who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in pejorative sense as [[Sanchuelo]] (''Little Sancho''; in Arabic: ''Shanjoul'').

After his father's death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], considered among the greatest of the Medieval Spanish kings, designated as his heir his son (also a Sancho) by the refugee [[Muslim]] princess [[Zaida of Seville]].

The ''Reconquista'' was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.

===Festivals in modern Spain===
Currently, festivals called ''[[moros y cristianos]]'' (Castilian), ''moros i cristians'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''mouros e cristãos'' (Portuguese) and ''mouros e cristiáns'' (Galician), which all mean "Moors and Christians", recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and lots of fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the [[Land of Valencia]], like [[Alcoi]], [[Ontinyent]] or [[Villena]].

=== Persistent effects ===
A 2016 study found that the manner of the Reconquest has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oto-Peralías|first=Daniel|last2=Romero-Ávila|first2=Diego|date=May 13, 2016|title=The economic consequences of the Spanish Reconquest: the long-term effects of Medieval conquest and colonization|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=409–464|doi=10.1007/s10887-016-9132-9|issn=1381-4338|hdl=10023/10769}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show how territory quickly re-taken during the Reconquest was given to nobility, whereas territory slowly re-taken was more equally distributed and settled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lands dominated by nobility have worse long-term development outcomes and greater inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Reverberations===

On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didn't stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas. The Spanish under the Hapsburg dynasty soon became the champions of Roman Catholicism in Europe and the Mediterranean against the encroaching threat of the [[Ottoman-Hapsburg Wars|Ottoman Caliphate]]. In a similar vein, the Portuguese also extended the Reconquista, this time against Muslim states overseas. The [[conquest of Ceuta]] marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion into Muslim Africa. Soon, the Portuguese also [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts|went into conflict with the Ottoman Caliphate]] in the [[Portuguese expedition to Otranto|Mediterranean]]&lt;ref&gt;proficiscitur Hydruntum classis quam ex Portugallia accersivimus. . .

==Qualified research, history and definitions==
With widespread concern that U.S. economic performance had fallen well below its potential, Congress passed 'The Economic Recovery Tax Act' (ERTA) of 1981. The ERTA was intended to act as an economic stimulus that would encourage investment within the United States. Congress perceived that research spending declines had adversely affected the Country's economic growth, productivity gains, and competitiveness within the global marketplace (defined by the fall of the U.S. automaker). Included within the ERTA was a provision called the 'Credit for Increasing Research Activities' (the Credit). The Credit was tailored to reverse the decline in U.S. research spending by providing an incentive that was premised on benefiting increases in (as opposed to total) year over year research spending.

Originally embodied within House Report No. 97-201 (H.R. 4242) and then later codified by The [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], 'Qualified Research' generally constitutes private sector or commercially driven development effort intended to yield innovation within a scientific or technological field. However, administrative difficulties coupled with divergent interpretations by the IRS and Taxpayers have led to a series of revisions to the Code Section and related Treasury Regulations.

In practice, 'Qualified Research' is often reduced to a "Four Part Test" to provide a frame of reference. However, this can be misleading due to the number of requirements or elements within each "Test" and the extensive Regulations that were provided to supplement some parts of Section 41 with examples. This convention belies the need for fact intensive evaluations and documentation of taxpayer research efforts over a period of time on the business component level (see below).  This evaluation can be further complicated by a large body of case law and the need to reconcile research activities with allowable expenditures.

Not coincidentally, while the Credit celebrated its 30th year of existence in 2011, significant rulings have been issued in the preceding few years (with more in process) as technology and methods change which is a by-product of what the Credit, ironically, was designed to promote. Perhaps in light of this and given the shift towards compliance based tax reporting over the last decade, taxpayers have increasingly relied upon niche tax professionals to assess research activities/projects on their behalf.

===Four-part test===
Generally, qualified research is an activity or project undertaken by a taxpayer (directly or through direct funding of a third party on the taxpayers behalf) that comprises each of the four distinct elements:

Permitted Purpose: The purpose of the activity or project must be to create new (or improve existing) functionality, performance, reliability, or quality of a business component. A business component is defined as any product, process, technique, invention, formula, or computer software (see exclusion for internal use software below) that the taxpayer intends to hold for sale, lease, license, or actual use in the taxpayer's trade or business.

Elimination of Uncertainty - the taxpayer must intend to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of the business component.  Uncertainty exists if the information available to the taxpayer does not establish the capability of development or improvement, method of development or improvement, or the appropriateness of the business component's design.

Process of Experimentation: the taxpayer must undergo a systematic process designed to evaluate one or more alternatives to achieve a result where the capability or the method of achieving that result, or the appropriate design of that result, is uncertain as of the beginning of the taxpayer's research activities. Treasury Regulations define this as broadly as conventional implementation of the scientific method to something as informal a systematic trial and error process.

Technological in Nature: the process of experimentation used to discover information must fundamentally rely on principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science.  A taxpayer may employ existing technologies and may rely on existing principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science to satisfy this requirement.

===Exclusions===
Notwithstanding the general application and evaluation of the requirements stated above, the following do not constitute qualified research.  
* Research conducted after the beginning of commercial production of the business component;
* Adaptation of existing business components;
* Duplication of existing business components;
* Reverse Engineering;
* Surveys, studies, activity relating to management function/technique, market research, routine data collection, or routine testing/quality control;
* Software developed for internal use;
* Foreign research conducted outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States;
* Research related to social sciences, arts, or humanities;
* Research to the extent funded by any grant, contract, or otherwise by another person (or governmental entity).

==Research &amp; Experimentation Tax Credit Calculation==
The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit hinges on the quantification of eligible expenses during one of three possible base periods.  The three base period calculation methods are referred to as the Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit.

===Eligible expenses===
The eligible expenses or qualified research expenditures include four types of expenses.  The quantification of each of these varies based on each company's accounting methodologies.

====Wages====
41(b)(2)(D)Wages for in-house research and development activities usually constitute the majority of expenses eligible for the credit.&lt;ref name="Research Expenses Expanded"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-4: Qualified Research Expenditures Incurred After January 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wages"&gt;For purposes of the I.R.C. §41, the term "wages" is defined by wages in I.R.C. §3401(a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Expenses"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-2: Qualified Research Expenses&lt;/ref&gt;  The research expenditure is only eligible if the wage is paid to the employee for the performance of a qualified service.  Qualified Services consist of:

*engaging in qualified research
*directly supervising qualified research
*supporting qualified research

"Engaging in qualified research" means the direct conduct of research and development.  "Directly supervising qualified research" is the first-line supervision of qualified research.  This does not include the higher-level managers to whom the first-line supervisors report.  "Supporting qualified research" includes an employee's time spent aiding the direct conduct of research and development.  This includes data recording, prototype building, and performing test/trials.&lt;ref name="Audit Guide June 2005"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/rc2005atg2irsgovrepublished1_2008.pdf IRS Research Credit Audit Techniques Guide June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies must provide contemporaneous documentation that links an employee's time directly to a project or activity.  This documentation takes the form of two methods; Project Approach and Departmental Approach.  The project approach relies on a taxpayer's time tracking documentation to directly link an employee's hours to a specific qualified R&amp;D project.  The departmental approach relies on oral testimony, contemporaneous engineering documentation, job descriptions, educational background, and other information to develop a time estimate.&lt;ref name="Audit Guide June 2005" /&gt;

====Supplies====
I.R.C. §41(b)(2)(C) defines the term supply to mean any tangible property other than land or land improvements, and property subject to depreciation.  Supply expense must be directly linked to qualified research activities using the taxpayer's accounting system.  This can include using general ledgers or job summary reports.  Qualified supplies include prototypes and testing materials.  The taxpayer cannot include travel, shipping, or royalty expenses as supply expenses.&lt;ref name="Research Expenses Expanded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Expenses" /&gt;

====Contract research====
I.R.C. §41(b)(2)(B) and Treasury Regulation §1.41-2(e) requires a third party to perform a qualified research service on behalf of the taxpayer; and requires the taxpayer to make payment to the third party regardless of success.  The "on behalf of" is refined by I.R.C. §1.41-2(e)(3), which requires the taxpayer to have rights into the research results.  The contract research payments are included at 65% of the actual expense.&lt;ref name="Research Expenses Expanded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Research Expenses" /&gt;

====Basic research payments====
I.R.C. §41(e)(2) qualifies basic research payments made to qualified non-profit organizations and institutions.  Basic research refers to fundamental research that focuses on evaluating theories and hypotheses regardless of an application.  Basic research payments are included at 75% of the actual expense.&lt;ref name="basic research"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-5: Basic Research for Taxable Years Beginning After December 31, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Credit calculation===
The R&amp;D Tax Credit allows for three calculation methods based on the taxpayer's date of incorporation, initiation of qualified research, and ability to collect required contemporaneous documentation.&lt;ref name="AIRC"&gt;A fourth calculation method called the Alternative Incremental Research Credit may be elected but this method has largely become obsolete due to the inclusion of the Alternative Simplified Credit in the code.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Traditional Credit Calculation and Start-Up Credit Calculation provide a credit of 20% of the taxpayers qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount.  The Alternative Simplified Credit base amount is equal 14% of the taxpayers qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount. Regardless of calculation method the base amount cannot be less than 50% of the taxpayer's current year qualified expenditures.  The following sections describe the three calculation methods; Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit.&lt;ref name="1.41-3"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-3: Base Amount Calculation&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traditional credit calculation====
I.R.C. §41(c)(3)(A) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated prior to January 1, 1984 and had 3 or more tax years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988.  The fixed-base percentage is calculated by dividing the taxpayers aggregate qualified research expenses by the aggregate gross receipts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, and before January 1, 1989.&lt;ref name="1.41-3" /&gt;

For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year.  The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition.

====Start-up credit calculation====
I.R.C. §41(c)(3)(B) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated after December 31, 1983, or had fewer than 3 years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988.  The fixed-base percentage is calculated according to the code as follows.&lt;ref name="1.41-3" /&gt;

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(I) 3 percent for each of the taxpayer's 1st 5 taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, for which the taxpayer has qualified research expenses,

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(II) in the case of the taxpayer's 6th such taxable year, 1/6 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 4th and 5th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years,

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(III) in the case of the taxpayer's 7th such taxable year, 1/3 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th and 6th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years,

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(IV) in the case of the taxpayer's 8th such taxable year, 1/2 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, and 7th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years,

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(V) in the case of the taxpayer's 9th such taxable year, 2/3 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years,

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(VI) in the case of the taxpayer's 10th such taxable year, 5/6 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, and

:§41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(VII) for taxable years thereafter, the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses for any 5 taxable years selected by the taxpayer from among the 5th through the 10th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such selected years.

For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year.  The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition.

====Alternative simplified credit====
For those companies that cannot adequately substantiate qualified research expenditures for the Traditional or Start-Up calculation methods, or generate fixed-base-percentages that significantly limit the credit, the I.R.C. §41(c)(5) provides an alternative calculation method.  This calculation provides a credit equal to 14 percent of the current year qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the 3 preceding taxable years.  As of January 1, 2009, this calculation supplanted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit election.

Since this calculation method is an election, a taxpayer may not apply for this calculation method retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;Need reference&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, I.R.C. §41(c)(5)(C) states this election applies to all of the taxpayer's future claims unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.

===Special rules===
To further supplement the calculation methods and definitions of qualified research and experimentation, the R&amp;D Tax Credit provides special rules for various situations.  The following sections briefly describe some of these special rules.&lt;ref name="1.41-6"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-6: Aggregation of Expenditures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1.41-7"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-7: Special Rules&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1.41-8"&gt;Final Regulations §1.41-8: Special Rules for Taxable Years After November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consistency rule====
In order to accurately calculate a credit, the taxpayer is required to define qualified research expenditures the same from year to year, per I.R.C. §41(c)(5)(A).&lt;ref name="Audit Guide May 2008"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/article/0,,id=183208,00.html ''IRS Research Credit Audit Techniques Guide'' May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  If a taxpayer changes their definition of qualified expenditures due to the results of an audit, tax court case ruling, or publication of an IRS document, the tax payer must accordingly change their definition for prior years that will affect the results of one of the three calculation methods.

====I.R.C. §280C election====
I.R.C. §280C(c)(3) allows the taxpayer to elect a reduced credit amount thereby eliminating the requirement to deduct qualified research expenditures claimed for the R&amp;D Tax Credit.  This election can only be made on a timely return.
&lt;ref name="280C"&gt;[http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Internal_Revenue_Code:Sec._280C._Certain_expenses_for_which_credits_are_allowable ''I.R.C. §280C: Certain expenses for which credits are allowable'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="280C directive"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=148281,00.html ''LMSB Directive on Amended Returns/Refund Claims Containing Invalid I.R.C. § 280C(c)(3) Elections'' by Paul D. DeNard]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controlled groups====
A group of corporations that maintain more than 50% common ownership are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the R&amp;D Tax Credit.  Special brother/sister and spouse rules factor into determining ownership.&lt;ref name="IRC §41"&gt;[http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Sec._41._Credit_for_increasing_research_activities Internal Revenue Code §41]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carry-forward and carry-back====
The credits generated for the I.R.C. §41 can be carried forward 20 years and may be carried back 1 year.

==Legislation==
The legislative intent for the R&amp;D Tax Credit is to increase R&amp;D spending in the United States.  Currently separate bills are being proposed in the House of Representatives and the Senate.  The House of Representatives bill, cosponsored by U.S. Representatives [[Kendrick Meek]] and [[Kevin Brady]], H.R. 422 proposes to make the credit permanent and increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%.&lt;ref name="HR 422"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-422 H.R. 422]:To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the research credit through 2010 and to increase and make permanent the alternative simplified research credit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Senators [[Max Baucus]] and [[Orrin Hatch]] are cosponsoring bill S. 1203.  This bill proposes to make the credit permanent, increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%, and terminate the other calculation methods.&lt;ref name="S 1203"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-1203 S. 1203]:Grow Research Opportunities With Taxcredits' Help Act&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[112th Congress]], Representative [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] is sponsoring H.R. 134 to make the R&amp;D Tax Credit permanent.&lt;ref name="HR 134"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:h134:]:HR 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic effect of the credit==
The magnitude of the R&amp;D Tax Credit's economic effects are debated by many economists but a majority of them agree the credit does increase R&amp;D spending in the United States.  While measuring the actual effect of the credit is difficult, a 2005 study by Ernst &amp; Young measured the amount of dollars returned to companies in the form of the R&amp;D Tax Credit.&lt;ref name="E&amp;Y Study"&gt;[http://www.investinamericasfuture.org/PDFs/R&amp;DTaxCreditStudy2008final.pdf ''Supporting innovation and economic growth''], Prepared by Ernst &amp; Young LLP for the R&amp;D Credit Coalition, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

*17,700 corporations claimed $6.6 billion in R&amp;D Tax Credits on their tax returns in 2005.  Approximately 11,300 C corporations and 6,400 S corporations claimed the credit.&lt;ref name="E&amp;Y Study" /&gt;
*Corporations claiming the R&amp;D Tax Credit in 2005 divided up by size are 29% had $1 million in assets or less, 25% with assets of $1–$5 million, 25% with assets of $5–$25 million, and 21% with assets of $25 million or more.&lt;ref name="E&amp;Y Study" /&gt;
*14,953 corporations with less than $50 million in total assets claimed more than $891 million in Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credits.&lt;ref name="E&amp;Y Study" /&gt;
*71.2% of these corporations had a Standard Industrial Classification in some type of Manufacturing, the remaining 28.8% include Services, Information, and Agriculture.&lt;ref name="E&amp;Y Study" /&gt;

[[File:Régie du logement.JPG|thumb|right|Organisation's logo]]
The '''Régie du logement du Québec''' (RDL) is an agency of the [[Government of Quebec]], which governs relations between the owners of homes and their tenants. It was created in 1974 and its main offices are in the [[Olympic Village (Montreal)]].

The Board is responsible for dealing with disputes between landlords and tenants and has exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases relating to leases residential worth less than $70,000 .&lt;ref name="educ"&gt;Éducaloi. ''[http://www.educaloi.qc.ca/loi/locataires/66/ La Régie du logement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205104920/http://www.educaloi.qc.ca/loi/locataires/66 |date=2012-12-05 }}''.  s.d. Page consultée le 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; juillet 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It acts as a specialized tribunal to rule on rent increases, the lease conditions, noise, heating, repairs, and the termination of the leases. It bases its decisions on the particular provisions of the Act respecting the Régie du logement and the Civil Code of Québec .

It publishes a series of forms of lease - whose use is mandatory since September 1996 &lt;ref&gt;Régie du logement du Québec. ''[http://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/fr/droits/bail.asp Le bail]''. Le 12 décembre 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;- and previously published a series of recommendations on the average increase in rents for one year.

Each year, the board receives more than 800,000 requests for information from the public .&lt;ref name="rdl"&gt;Régie du logement du Québec. [http://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/fr/outils/faq.asp Foire aux questions]. 24 janvier 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary liability''', or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for directly infringing acts carried out by another party. The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for [[trademarks]] and [[patents]], but for matters relating to [[copyright]], this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability.

==Early case law==
Secondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''&lt;ref name=kalem&gt;''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/222/222.US.55.26.html 222 U.S. 55] (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; (the producer of the movie [[Ben Hur (1907 film)]] didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), ''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.''&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/316/316.F2d.304.294.27979.html 316 F.2d 304] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called "dance hall" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises ''and'' obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).&lt;ref name=dreamland&gt;''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/36f2354.html 36 F. 2d 354] (7th Cir. 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copyright Act of 1790]] did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.

Despite the fact that the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are ''Fishel v. Lueckel''&lt;ref name=fishel&gt;''Fishel v. Lueckel'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/53f499.html 53 F. 499] (1892).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''.&lt;ref name=kalem /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, and Mark A. Lemley (2007). ''Intellectual Property in the New Technological Era'', p. 572, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of secondary liability==
There are generally two kinds of secondary [[Legal liability|liability]] developed by courts – [[vicarious liability]] and [[contributory liability]]. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ecourse/cases/netcom.htm 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70] (1995)

Some academics have classified the active inducement adopted in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson,[http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf ''Three Reactions to MGM v. Grokster''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021534/http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, 13 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.

===Vicarious liability===
One of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Gorman and Jane C. Ginsburg (2009). ''Copyright Cases and Materials'', Foundation Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the [[common law]] doctrine of [[agency (law)|agency]] – ''respondeat superior'' (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is ''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway''.&lt;ref name=Witmark&gt;''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/22f2d412.html 22 F. 2d 412, 415 ] (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under ''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'',&lt;ref name=dreamland/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, ''Deutsch v. Arnold'',&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;''Deutsch v. Arnold'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/98f2d686.html 98 F. 2d 686] (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction''&lt;ref name=fonovisa&gt;''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/76/76.F3d.259.94-15717.html 76 F. 3d 259] (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie E. Cohen]], Lydia Pallas Loren, [[Ruth L. Okediji]], and [[Maureen A. O'Rourke]] (2006). ''Copyright in a Global Information Economy'', p. 481, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is ''[[Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.]]''&lt;ref name=shapiro /&gt; In ''Shapiro'', the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The ''Shapiro'' court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.

===Contributory liability===
{{main article|Contributory copyright infringement}}

Contributory liability or [[Contributory Copyright Infringement|contributory infringement]] has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.

Contributory liability is rooted in the [[tort]] theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in ''[[Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.]]'': “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;''Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/443/443.F2d.1159.606.35260.html 443 F. 2d 1159] (2d Cir. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the passage of the [[1976 Copyright Act]], the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name=sony&gt;''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html 464 U.S. 417] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919165747/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html |date=2008-09-19 }} (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the [[Betamax]], the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the ''Sony'' exception with regard to new technologies: "The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."&lt;ref name=sony /&gt;

==Liability of internet service providers (ISPs)==
Regarding [[internet]] communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.

The question of whether [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;See K. A. Taipale, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=712101 ''Secondary Liability on the Internet: Towards a Performative Standard for Constitutive Responsibility''], Center for Advanced Studies Working Paper No. 04-2003 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.

Recent statutes in the United States ([[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998) and the [[European Union]] have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;See D. Panethiere,''The Basis for Copyright Infringement Liability: The Law in Common Law Jurisdictions'', 13 [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 26 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DMCA]] states four safe harbors:
(a) Transitory network communications
(b) System caching
(c) Information storage and
(d) Information location tools.&lt;ref name=17usc512&gt;''[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. §512]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last three have so called “notice &amp; take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.

In order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.&lt;ref name="17usc512"/&gt;

As to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=2012-09-13 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary liability in the future?==
Future treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through [[cost-benefit analysis]], multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or [[business models]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1002676 ''Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform''], Utah Law Review (2007); UC Berkeley Public Law Research Paper No. 1002676.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.
In light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.

A '''secundogeniture''' (from {{lang-la|secundus}} "following, second," and {{lang|la|genitus}} "born") was a dependent territory given to a younger son of a princely house and his descendants, creating a [[cadet branch]].  This was a special form of [[inheritance]] in which the second and younger son received more possessions and prestige than the [[apanage]] which was usual in principalities practising [[primogeniture]].  It avoided the generational division of the estate to the extent that occurred under [[gavelkind]], and at the same time gave younger branches a stake in the stability of the house.
==Creation==
The creation of a secundogeniture was often regulated by a [[house law]].  The younger sons would receive some territory, but much less than the older brother, and they would not be sovereign.  Examples of such house laws would be
* the [[House Treaty of Gera]] in Brandenburg
* the testament of [[John George I, Elector of Saxony|John George I of Saxony]] and the {{lang|de|Freundbrüderliche Hauptvergleich}} of 1657, in which John George I's sons regulated the details.

A secondogeniture is different from a [[partition (politics)|partition]].  A ''partition'' creates two (or more) separate, largely independent states.  An example of a partition would be the division of [[Hesse]] after the death of [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip I of Hesse]].  Nevertheless, there have been intermediate cases between a secundogeniture and a proper partition.

=== Examples ===
* [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Armenia]] in 63 AD
* [[Brandenburg-Küstrin]]
* [[Brandenburg-Schwedt]]
* Habsburg-Tuscany
* [[Hesse-Homburg]]
* [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg|Hesse-Rotenburg]]

The '''Spam Act 2003''' (Cth) is an Act passed by the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] in 2003 to regulate commercial [[e-mail]] and other types of commercial [[electronic message (disambiguation)|electronic message]]s. The Act restricts [[spam (electronic)|spam]], especially [[e-mail spam]] and some types of phone spam, as well as [[e-mail address harvesting]]. However, there are broad exemptions.

The first portions of the Act came into effect on 12 December 2003, the day the act received [[Royal Assent]], with the remaining sections of the Act coming into force on 10 April 2004. The Act was originally enforced by the Australian Communications Authority, which in 2005 merged into the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA).

== Outline ==

The key points of the act provide that:

* Unsolicited commercial electronic messages must not be sent unless it is a designated commercial electronic message defined at Schedule 1 of the act.
* Commercial electronic messages must include information about the individual or organisation who authorised the sending of the message.
* Commercial electronic messages must contain a functional unsubscribe facility.
* Address‑harvesting software must not be supplied, acquired or used.
* An electronic address list produced using address‑harvesting software must not be supplied, acquired or used.
* The main remedies for breaches of this Act are civil penalties and injunctions.

== Significant cases ==

=== Australian Communications Authority v Clarity1 (2006)===

In ACA v Clarity1 (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 410 {{Cite AustLII|FCA|410|2006}} (13 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nicholson (judge)|Robert Nicholson]], J looked at the respondent’s key defence, being retrospective application of provisions under the Act relating to the acquisition and use of harvested address lists. He noted specifically that lists gathered or acquired prior to the Act coming into force are still subject to the legislation. He also struck down the respondent's defence that he had obtained consent to use the gathered addresses for the defined purpose, and also noted a lack of compliance with the provisions of the Act requiring the provision of a functional unsubscribe facility.

}}

The '''Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights''' ('''TRIPS''') is an [[international agreement|international legal agreement]] between all the member nations of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of [[intellectual property]] (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.&lt;ref&gt;See TRIPS Art. 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1994 and is administered by the WTO.

The TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the international trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the [[Doha Declaration]]. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal "to promote access to medicines for all."

Specifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide [[copyright]] rights, covering content producers including performers, producers of sound recordings and broadcasting organizations; [[geographical indication]]s, including appellations of origin; [[Industrial design law|industrial designs]]; [[mask work|integrated circuit layout-designs]]; [[patent]]s;  [[plant breeders' rights|new plant varieties]]; [[trademark]]s; [[trade dress]]; and undisclosed or [[confidential information]]. TRIPS also specifies [[enforcement]] procedures, remedies, and [[dispute resolution]] procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.

==Background and history==
{{refimprove|date=May 2012}}
TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1994.   Its inclusion was the culmination of a program of intense [[lobbying]] by the [[United States]], supported by the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and other [[developed nations]].  Campaigns of unilateral economic encouragement under the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] and [[Economic coercion|coercion]] under [[Section 301]] of the Trade Act played an important role in defeating competing policy positions that were favored by developing countries like Brazil, but also including Thailand, India and Caribbean Basin states.  In turn, the United States strategy of linking trade policy to intellectual property standards can be traced back to the entrepreneurship of senior management at [[Pfizer]] in the early 1980s, who mobilized corporations in the United States and made maximizing intellectual property privileges the number one priority of trade policy in the United States (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000, Chapter 7).

After the Uruguay round, the GATT became the basis for the establishment of the World Trade Organization.  Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS.  For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws.  States like Russia and [[China]] &lt;ref&gt;Farah, Paolo Davide &amp; Cima, Elena (2010) '[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1527992 SSRN.com  China’s Participation in the World Trade Organization: Trade in Goods, Services, Intellectual Property Rights and Transparency Issues" in Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella Martinez (ed.), El comercio con China. Oportunidades empresariales, incertidumbres jurídicas, Tirant lo Blanch, Valencia (Spain) 2010, pp. 85–121.] {{ISBN|978-84-8456-981-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that were very unlikely to join the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] have found the prospect of WTO membership a powerful enticement.

Furthermore, unlike other agreements on intellectual property, TRIPS has a powerful enforcement mechanism.  States can be disciplined through the WTO's [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|dispute settlement]] mechanism.

==The requirements of TRIPS==

TRIPS requires member states to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights. For example, under TRIPS:

* Copyright terms must extend at least 50 years, unless based on the life of the [[author]]. (Art. 12 and 14)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards |publisher=WTO |date=1994-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based upon any [[copyright formalities|"formality,"]] such as [[copyright registration|registrations]], as specified in the [[Berne Convention]]. (Art. 9)
* Computer programs must be regarded as "literary works" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.
* National [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|exceptions to copyright]] (such as "[[fair use]]" in the United States) are constrained by the [[Berne three-step test]]
* Patents must be granted for "inventions" in all "fields of technology" provided they meet all other patentability requirements (although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

* Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided that a normal exploitation of the work (Art.&amp;nbsp;13) and normal exploitation of the patent (Art&amp;nbsp;30) is not in conflict.
* No unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the right holders of computer programs and patents is allowed.
* Legitimate interests of third parties have to be taken into account by patent rights (Art&amp;nbsp;30).
* In each state, intellectual property laws may not offer any benefits to local citizens which are not available to citizens of other TRIPS signatories under the principle of [[national treatment]] (with certain limited exceptions, Art. 3 and 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TRIPS also has a [[most favored nation clause]].

Many of the TRIPS provisions on copyright were copied from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and many of its trademark and patent provisions were modeled on the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]]. It is the case of the protection of software and database.

Article 10 of the treaty stipulates:

"1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).
2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself."

===Access to essential medicines===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Patent]] --&gt;

The most visible conflict has been over [[AIDS]] drugs in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]].  Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs  for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the [[Doha Declaration]], was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises.  After Doha, [[PhRMA]], the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timmermann, Cristian, and Henk van den Belt. 2013. Intellectual property and global health: from corporate social responsibility to the access to knowledge movement. Liverpool Law Review 34 (1):47-73. [http://edepot.wur.nl/252885 also available at http://edepot.wur.nl/252885]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 agreement loosened the domestic market requirement, and allows developing countries to export to other countries where there is a national health problem as long as drugs exported are not part of a commercial or industrial policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 2003, the Bush administration also changed its position, concluding that generic treatments might in fact be a component of an effective strategy to combat HIV.  Bush created the [[PEPFAR]] program, which received $15 billion from 2003–2007, and was reauthorized in 2008 for $48 billion over the next five years.  Despite wavering on the issue of [compulsory licensing], PEPFAR began to distribute generic drugs in 2004-5.

===Software and business method patents===
{{main article|Software_patents_under_TRIPs_Agreement}}
Another controversy has been over the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for patentability "in all fields of technology", and whether or not this necessitates the granting of [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent]]s.

According to article 10 of the TRIPS Agreement the appropriate instrument to protect software protection is author right. The importance of this instrument has recently been confirmed by the US Supreme Court ([[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]).

== Implementation in developing countries ==

The obligations under TRIPS apply equally to all member states, however [[developing countries]] were allowed extra time to implement the applicable changes to their national laws, in two tiers of transition according to their level of development.  The transition period for developing countries expired in 2005. The transition period for [[least developed countries]] to implement TRIPS was extended to 2013, and until 1 January 2016 for pharmaceutical patents, with the possibility of further extension.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organisation, IP - http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/tripfq_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It has therefore been argued that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This has not happened in most cases.  A 2005 report by the [[WHO]] found that many developing countries have not incorporated TRIPS flexibilities (compulsory licensing, parallel importation, limits on data protection, use of broad research and other exceptions to patentability, etc.) into their legislation to the extent authorized under Doha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is likely caused by the lack of legal and technical expertise needed to draft legislation that implements flexibilities, which has often led to developing countries directly copying developed country IP legislation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Post-TRIPS expansion==

In addition to the baseline [[intellectual property]] standards created by the TRIPS agreement, many nations have engaged in bilateral agreements to adopt a higher standard of protection.  These collection of standards, known as TRIPS+ or TRIPS-Plus, can take many forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195390124.001.0001/acprof-9780195390124-chapter-8|title=Overview of "TRIPS-Plus" Standards - Oxford Scholarship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  General objectives of these agreements include:

* The creation of [[anti-circumvention laws]] to protect [[Digital Rights Management]] systems.  This was achieved through the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty]] (WIPO Treaty) and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty]].
* More stringent restrictions on [[compulsory license]]s for patents.
* More aggressive patent enforcement. This effort has been observed more broadly in proposals for WIPO and [[European Union]] rules on intellectual property enforcement. The 2001 [[EU Copyright Directive]] was to implement the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty.
* The campaign for the creation of a WIPO Broadcasting Treaty that would give broadcasters (and possibly webcasters) exclusive rights over the copies of works they have distributed.

==Criticism==

Since TRIPS came into force, it has been subject to criticism from [[developing countries]], [[academic]]s, and [[non-governmental organization]]s. Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of [[artificial scarcity]] on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ping Xiong ‘Patents in TRIPS-Plus Provisions and the Approaches to Interpretation of Free Trade Agreements and TRIPS: Do They Affect Public Health?’ (2012) 46(1) Journal of World Trade 155&lt;/ref&gt; Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.

[[Daniele Archibugi]] and [[Andrea Filippetti]]&lt;ref&gt;Archibugi, D. and Filippetti, A. (2010) '[http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/IPRglobalization.pdf The globalization of intellectual property rights: Four learned lessons and four thesis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220707/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/IPRglobalization.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}', Journal of Global Policy, 1: 137-49.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the importance of TRIPS in the process of generation and diffusion of knowledge and innovation has been overestimated by its supporters. This point has been supported by United Nations findings indicating many countries with weak protection routinely benefit from strong levels of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins-Chase |first1=Charles |title=The Case Against TRIPS-plus protection in developing countries facing AIDs epidemics |journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law]] |date=Spring 2008|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/jil/vol29/iss3/6/|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of OECD countries in the 1980s and 1990s (during which the patent life of drugs was extended by 6 years) showed that while total number of products registered increased slightly, the mean innovation index remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Troullier et al 'Drug Development for Neglected Diseases: A Deficient Market and a Public Health Policy Failure' (2002) 360 The Lancet, 2188&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to that, [[Jörg Baten]], Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser(2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Jörg|last2=Bianchi|first2=Nicola|last3=Moser|first3=Petra|title=Compulsory licensing and innovation–Historical evidence from German patents after WWI|journal=Journal of Development Economics|date=2017|volume=126|pages=231-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; find historical evidence that under certain circumstances compulsory licensing –  a key mechanism to weaken intellectual property rights that is covered by Article 31 of the TRIPS  –  may indeed be effective in promoting invention by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition. They argue, however, that the benefits from weakening intellectual property rights strongly depend on whether the governments can credibly commit to using it only in exceptional cases of emergencies since firms may invest less in R&amp;D if they expect repeated episodes of compulsory licensing.   

The 2002 Doha Declaration affirmed that the TRIPS agreement should not prevent members from taking measures necessary to protect public health. Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as compulsory licensing, are near-on impossible to exercise. In particular, less developed countries have cited their infant domestic manufacturing and technology industries as evidence of the policy's bluntness.

TRIPS-plus conditions mandating standards beyond TRIPS have also been the subject of scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Frederic Morin, '[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_tripping.pdf Tripping up TRIPs Debate: IP and Health]', International Journal of Intellectual Property Management 1(1/2), 2006:37-53.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Free trade area|FTA]] agreements contain conditions that limit the ability of governments to introduce competition for generic producers. In particular, the United States has been criticised for advancing protection well beyond the standards mandated by TRIPS. The United States Free Trade Agreements with Australia, Morocco and Bahrain have extended patentability by requiring patents be available for new uses of known products.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Richard Newfarmer, Trade, Doha, and Development (The World Bank, 1st ed, 2006) 292&lt;/ref&gt; The TRIPS agreement allows the grant of compulsory licenses at a nation’s discretion. TRIPS-plus conditions in the United States FTA’s with Australia, Jordan, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted the application of compulsory licenses to emergency situations, antitrust remedies, and cases of public non-commercial use.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''The CW Television Network''' (commonly referred to as just '''The CW''') is an American [[English language|English-language]] [[Terrestrial television|free-to-air]] [[television network]] that is operated by the CW Network, LLC, a [[Limited liability company|limited liability]] joint venture&lt;ref name="CW Bloomberg"/&gt; between [[CBS Corporation]], the former owners of United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), and [[AT&amp;T]], whose [[WarnerMedia]] subsidiary is the parent company of [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]], former majority owner of [[The WB]]. The network's name is an [[abbreviation]] derived from the first letters of the names of its two parent corporations ('''C'''BS and '''W'''arner Bros.).

The CW Television Network made its debut on September 18, 2006, after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, respectively ceased independent operations on September 15 and 17 of that year. The CW's first two nights of programming – on September 18 and 19, 2006 – consisted of reruns and launch-related [[television special|specials]]. The CW marked its formal launch date on September 20, 2006, with the two-hour premiere of the [[America's Next Top Model (cycle 7)|seventh cycle]] of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''. Originally, the network's programming lineup was intended to appeal mainly to women between the ages of 18 and 34,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="90210" Upfront and Center for CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/90210-upfront-center-cw-111620|author=Paul J. Gough|author2=James Hibberd|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Nielsen N.V.|Nielsen Company]]|date=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although starting in 2011 the network increased in programming that appeals to men.&lt;ref name="Molloy"&gt;{{cite news|title=CW's Plans Include More Men, More Muppets|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/cws-plans-include-more-men-more-muppets-49921|author=Tim Molloy|website=[[The Wrap]]|publisher=The Wrap News Inc.|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017, the CW's audience is 50% male and 50% female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/dynasty-riverdale-tca-1202513508/|title=CW Chief Looks to Lure Women Viewers Back With ‘Dynasty,’ ‘Riverdale’|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=August 2, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=October 19, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network currently runs programming seven days a week: airing Mondays through Fridays in the [[The CW Daytime|afternoon]] and Sundays through Fridays in prime time, along with a Saturday morning live-action [[E/I|educational programming]] block produced by [[Litton Entertainment]] called ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'', which is the successor to the animation block [[Vortexx]].

It is also available in Canada on [[pay television]] providers through stations [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] by CBS Corporation and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] that are located within proximity to the [[Canada–United States border]] (whose broadcasts of CW shows are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]] laws imposed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], if a Canadian network holds the broadcast rights); it is also available through two affiliates owned by [[Tribune Media]] that are classified in the United States as [[superstation]]s – New York City affiliate [[WPIX]] and Los Angeles affiliate [[KTLA]].

Additionally, The CW is available in Mexico through affiliates located near the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexico–U.S. border]] (such as [[KFMB-TV|KFMB-DT2]]/[[San Diego]]-[[Tijuana]], [[KECY-TV|KECY-DT3]] in [[El Centro, California]], [[KVIA-TV|KVIA-DT2]] in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], and [[KCWT-CD]] with simulcasters [[KFXV-LD|KFXV-LD2]] and [[KNVO (TV)|KNVO-DT4]] in [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]]–[[Brownsville, Texas]]) on pay television providers. In both Canada and Mexico, some CW affiliate signals originating from the U.S. are receivable over-the-air in border areas depending on the station's [[broadcast range|signal coverage]].

==History==

{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}

===1993–2006: Origins===
{{main|The WB|UPN}}
[[File:The CW logo.png|225px|thumb|right|The CW's original pre-launch logo. At the network's first upfront presentation on May 18, 2006, the provisional blue-and-white rectangle logo that was used during the network's formation announcement in January was replaced by a green-and-white, curved-letter insignia that drew comparisons to the logo used by [[CNN]], another company with Time Warner ownership interest.]]
The CW Television Network is a successor to [[The WB]] and [[UPN]], both of which launched within one week of each other in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 2 Would-Be Networks Get Set for Prime Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/the-media-business-2-would-be-networks-get-set-for-prime-time.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=January 9, 1995|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPN and The WB both began just as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network had started to secure a foothold with American television audiences. The two networks launched to limited fanfare and generally mediocre to poor results. However, over the subsequent 11{{frac|1|2}} seasons, both were able to air several series that became quite popular (such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[America’s Next Top Model]]''). Towards the end of their first decade on the air, The WB and UPN were in decline, unable to reach the audience share or have the effect that Fox had gained within its first decade, much less that of the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]]). In the eleven years that UPN and The WB were in operation, the two networks lost a combined $2 billion.&lt;ref name="wsj2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's No Gossip, Ratings Slip Threatens CW Network|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121089546043097065 |author=Rebecca Dana|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones and Company]]|date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, Chris-Craft Industries, Viacom and Time Warner officials had discussed a possible merger of UPN and The WB as early as September 1995, only eight months after their respective launches; however, discussions ultimately broke down over issues on how to combine Chris-Craft and [[Tribune Broadcasting]]'s station interests in the proposal to merge the networks, since the two companies' station portfolios overlapped with one another in several major markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fledgling Networks UPN, WB Already Pondering Merger|url=http://adage.com/article/news/fledgling-networks-upn-wb-pondering-merger/85731/|author=Thomas Tyrer|periodical=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=September 18, 1995|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; than facing questionable futures as separate networks.

Executives from CBS and Time Warner announced on January 24, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Littleton, [https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cw-wb-network-upn-merger-announcement-10-years-ago-1201687040/ Birth of the CW: UPN-WB Network Merger Deal Rocked TV Biz 10 Years Ago], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', January 24, 2016, Retrieved July 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; that they would respectively shut down UPN and The WB, and combine resources to form a new broadcast network, to be known as The CW Television Network, that would – at the outset – feature programming from both of its predecessors-to-be as well as new content developed specifically for the new network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/|author=Jessica Seid|website=[[CNNMoney.com]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPN and WB to Combine, Forming New TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/media/24cnd-network.html?bl|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS chairman [[Leslie Moonves]] explained that the name of the new network was formed from the first letters of CBS and Warner Bros, joking, "We couldn't call it the [[Flush toilet|WC]] for obvious reasons." Although some executives reportedly disliked the new name, Moonves stated in March 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Staying CW, Says Moonves|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/cw-staying-cw-says-moonves/79264|author=Ben Grossman|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915031033/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6316450.html|archivedate=September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was "zero chance" the name would change, citing research claiming 48% of the target demographic were already aware of the CW name.

In May 2006, The CW announced that it would pick up a combined thirteen programs from its two predecessors to air as part of the network's inaugural fall schedule: seven series held over from The WB (''7th Heaven'', ''[[Beauty and the Geek]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'') and six held over from UPN (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', ''[[Girlfriends (2000 TV series)|Girlfriends]]'', ''[[All of Us]]'' and ''[[WWE SmackDown]]''). Upon the network's launch, The CW chose to use the scheduling model utilized by The WB due in part to the fact that it had a more extensive base programming schedule than UPN, allowing for a larger total of weekly programming hours for the new network to fill. (The WB carried 30 hours of programming each week because of it having a children's program block and a daytime lineup that UPN did not offer; UPN was primarily a prime time-only network with 12 weekly hours of network programming at the time of the network's shutdown.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crupi|first1=Anthony|title=UPN, WB to Merge Into CW Network|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/upn-wb-merge-cw-network-83687|accessdate=November 12, 2015|work=Ad Week|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006–2011: Ostroff era===
Like both UPN and The WB, The CW targets its programming towards younger audiences. CBS and Time Warner hoped that combining their networks' schedules and affiliate lineups would strengthen The CW into a fifth "major" broadcast network. One week before the network's official launch, on September 11, 2006, a new, full version of the network website, [http://www.cwtv.com/ www.cwtv.com], was [http://www.thetvaddict.com/2006/09/14/check-out-the-new-cwtvcom/ launched]; the website began to feature more in-depth information about The CW's shows.

The CW launched with a premiere special/launch party from the [[CBS Television Distribution|CBS]]-produced ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' at [[Warner Bros. Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] on September 18, 2006, after a repeat of the tenth-season finale of ''7th Heaven'';&lt;ref name="zap2it-1559260"&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Staggers Its Debut – New net will roll out schedule over two weeks|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cwpremieredates,0,1559260.story|website=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|date=August 18, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818103850/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cwpremieredates,0,1559260.story|archivedate=August 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same schedule was repeated on September 19, with the sixth-season finale of ''Gilmore Girls'' airing in the second hour of prime time.&lt;ref name="[[TV Guide]]"&gt;''[[TV Guide]]'', September 11, 2006, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The network continued to air season finales from the previous season through the remainder of the first week, except for ''America's Next Top Model'' and ''WWE SmackDown'', which respectively began their new seasons on September 20 and 22, with two-hour premieres. When ''Top Model'' made its network premiere on September 20, 2006, The CW scored a 3.4 rating/5 share (with hourly ratings of 3.1/5 and 3.6/6; The CW placed fifth overall) in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household ratings]]. It scored a 2.6 rating among Adults 18–49, finishing fourth in that age demographic and beating the 2.2 rating earned by Fox on that night. The network's second week consisted of season and series premieres for all of its other series from September 25 to October 1, with the exception of ''Veronica Mars'', which debuted its third season on October 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=THE CW NETWORK ANNOUNCES ITS INAUGURAL 2006-2007 PREMIERE SCHEDULE|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2006/07/17/the-cw-network-announces-its-inaugural-2006-2007-premiere-schedule-21795/20060717cw01/|publisher=The CW|via=The Futon Critic|date=July 17, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having several of the most popular programs carried over from UPN and The WB as part of its schedule, The CW – even though it experienced some success with newer programs that launched in subsequent seasons which became modest hits – largely struggled to gain an audience foothold throughout its first five years on the air.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Because of declining viewership for the network during the 2007–08 season and effects from the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]], the network announced on March 4, 2008, that it would eliminate its comedy department (dismissing executive vice president of comedy Kim Fleary, and senior vice president of comedy Steve Veisel), while also combining its drama and current programming departments into a single scripted programming unit. The corporate restructuring – which also included the elimination of certain positions, other newly opened positions being left unfilled, layoffs from the Kids' WB unit (as the block was set to be replaced by [[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]] on May 24), and the elimination and transfer of marketing positions at [[The CW Plus]] to the network's marketing department – resulted in the layoffs of around 25 to 30 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strike, ratings slip lead to CW layoffs|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/strike-ratings-slip-lead-to-cw-layoffs-1117981768/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW downsizes, sheds comedy division|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-downsizes-sheds-comedy-division-106143|author=James Hibberd|agency=[[Associated Press]]|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Nielsen Company|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2008, The CW announced that it would lease its Sunday lineup (then running from 5:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The CW "Outsources" Its Sunday-Night Block; Two Dramas, Two Comedies Coming|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/the-cw-outsources-12191/|periodical=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Macrovision]]|date=May 9, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221532/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Cw-Puts-Sunday/800039275|archivedate=May 11, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW outsources Sunday to MRC|url=https://variety.com/2008/tv/features/cw-outsources-sunday-to-mrc-1117985413/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 9, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to production company [[Media Rights Capital]] (MRC). As Sundays have historically been a low-rated night for the network during its first two seasons on the air (due to stiff competition from CBS, ABC and Fox's strong Sunday lineups, and complicated further by NBC's acquisition of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' in September 2006, shortly before The CW debuted), the move allowed The CW to concentrate on its Monday through Saturday prime time schedule, while giving MRC the right to develop and schedule programs of its own choosing and reap advertising revenue generated by the lineup. The Sunday series that were scheduled – two reality series (''[[4Real]]'' and ''[[In Harm's Way (TV series)|In Harm's Way]]'') and two scripted series (romantic dramedy ''[[Valentine (TV series)|Valentine]]'' and drama ''[[Easy Money (TV series)|Easy Money]]'') – performed poorly in the ratings (averaging only 1.04 million viewers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW ends time-buy deal with MRC|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/cw-ends-time-buy-deal-with-mrc-1117996223/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompting The CW to scrap its agreement with MRC and program Sunday nights on its own starting on November 30, 2008. With no first-run programming available to run on Sundays as a backup, the network added reruns of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', and movies to replace the MRC-produced programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Takes Back Its Sunday Nights, Sets ‘Jericho' Reruns|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2008/11/cw-takes-back-its-sunday-night/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the shows carried over to the network from UPN, ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWE Friday Night SmackDown]]'', ended its run on The CW after the September 26, 2008, episode due to negotiations ending between the [[WWE]] and The CW on renewing the program. Representatives for The CW later confirmed that it had chosen not to continue carrying ''SmackDown'' because the network had redefined its target audience as exclusively females 18 to 34 years old,&lt;ref name="wsj2008"/&gt; whereas ''Smackdown'' targeted a predominately male audience – although it continued to air some shows that targeted male viewers afterward, such as ''Smallville'' and ''Supernatural''. Following ''Smackdown''{{'}}s move to [[MyNetworkTV]] that same season, the [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]-owned network (which launched the same month as The CW's debut, albeit two weeks earlier, on September 5, 2006) began beating The CW in the Friday ratings every week from that program's debut on the network, though The CW continued to beat MyNetworkTV overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox Still Likely to Pass CBS in Adults 25–54 to Top All Key Age Demos|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/03/25/fox-still-likely-to-pass-cbs-in-adults-25-54-to-top-all-key-age-demos/15178#more-15178|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CW has generally struggled in the Nielsen ratings since its inception, primarily placing fifth in all statistics tabulated by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] (total audience viewership and demographic ratings). On several occasions, The CW has even been outrated by Spanish language network [[Univision]]. This had led to speculation within the industry (including a May 16, 2008 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name="wsj2008"/&gt;) that CBS, Time Warner or both companies could abandon the venture if ratings did not improve. However, The CW's fortunes were buoyed in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 television seasons thanks to increased ratings among females in the 18–34 demographic and the buzz that some of its newer series (such as ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'') had generated with audiences. Executives with CBS Corporation and Time Warner also emphasized their commitment to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Parents Emphasize Support of Network|url=http://adage.com/article/media/cw-parents-emphasize-support-network/130465/|author=Josef Adalian|periodical=AdAge|publisher=Crain Communications|date=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2009, The CW announced that it would give the five hours of network time on Sundays back to its affiliated stations that fall, effectively becoming a weeknight-only network in prime time, in addition to The CW Daytime and The CW4Kids blocks (the latter block, airing on Saturday mornings, would remain the only weekend programming supplied by the network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune Psyched to Take back Sundays on The CW|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/tribune-psyched-take-back-sundays-cws/34685?rssid=20105|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Drops Sundays In Another Blow to Broadcast Model|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE54514E20090506|author=Nellie Andreeva|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, resulted in the discontinuance of the Sunday late afternoon repeat block that The CW inherited from The WB (formerly branded by that network as "EasyView") through its use of the predecessor network's scheduling model. Subsequently, in mid-May, 65% of The CW's affiliates, including those carrying The CW Plus, signed agreements to continue to air the replacement ''[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] Showcase'' movie package on Sundays, which was offered as a traditional syndicated film package meant for The CW's former prime time slot on that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Affiliates Booking MGM Movie Pack|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-affiliates-booking-mgm-movie-83903|author=Nellie Andreeva|agency=Associated Press|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Guggenheim Partners|Prometheus Global Media]]|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–present: Pedowitz era===
On April 28, 2011, [[Mark Pedowitz]] was appointed by the network to succeed original president of entertainment [[Dawn Ostroff]]; Pedowitz assumed broader responsibilities in The CW's business operations than Ostroff had, as the network's first president.&lt;ref name="thr-pedowitz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Pedowitz Named President of The CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mark-pedowitz-named-president-cw-183298|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president of entertainment, Ostroff oversaw entertainment operations while John Maatta, the network's chief operating officer, handled business affairs; both reported to a board composed of CBS and Warner Bros. executives. Maatta began reporting to Pedowitz as a result of the latter's appointment as network president.&lt;ref name="thr-pedowitz"/&gt; Pedowitz revealed that the core target demographic of the network would not change, though The CW would attempt to lure new viewers. Pedowitz began looking to bring comedies back to The CW after former president, Dawn Ostroff, publicly declared that the difficulty of developing comedies for its target demographic as the reason for their removal from the network following the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008–09 season]] (with ''Everybody Hates Chris'', and ''[[The Game (U.S. TV series)|The Game]]'' – a spin-off of ''Girlfriends'' – becoming the last comedies to be cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Chief: Network Is in Search of Close-Ended Series, Comedies and a Superhero Show|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-chief-network-is-search-219442|author=Lacey Rose|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also ordered more episodes of its original series and ran them consecutively through the first week of December, starting on September 12, without repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW President Mark Pedowitz Talks RINGER, SUPERNATURAL, NIKITA, GOSSIP GIRL, Developing More DC Superheroes, and More|url=http://collider.com/cw-mark-pedowitz-ringer-supernatural-smallville/107697/|author=Christina Radish|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Pedowitz no longer referred to the target demographic of The CW as women 18-34, but rather that it would now be an "18-34 adult network".&lt;ref name="Molloy" /&gt;

The 2012–13 season saw the introduction of action-superhero series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' based on [[DC Comics]]' [[Green Arrow]], which received favorable reviews from critics and became a hit with audiences when it premiered. As evidence of the network's refocusing toward a more inclusive audience, ''Arrow'' not only premiered to some of the highest viewership totals in the network's history (the third highest overall {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, behind the series premieres of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''The Flash''), it also gave the network its strongest performance in the demographic of males 18-34 since ''Smallville'' ended its run in May 2011. The strength of ''Arrow'', combined with the stability of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and a rejuvenated ''Supernatural'' gave The CW a much needed win for the season. However, the network's other creative swings in ''[[Emily Owens, M.D.]]'' and ''[[Cult (TV series)|Cult]]'' were not successful and were canceled after one season, in addition, fan favorite, ''Gossip Girl'', ended after six seasons and once breakout hit 90210 was cancelled due to declining ratings. The remaining freshman lineup of ''[[Beauty &amp; the Beast (2012 TV series)|Beauty &amp; the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' performed adequately enough for renewal. During this season, the network introduced an image campaign under the "TV Now" slogan, in part to emphasize the availability of CW content across television, computer and mobile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/arrow-ratings-series-premiere_n_1958246.html|title='Arrow' Brings In Huge Audience For The CW, 'Nashville' Off To Solid Start|last=Harnick|first=Chris|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013–14 season saw the network continue to build on its newfound stability with the introduction of ''The Vampire Diaries'' spin-off, ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]''. Paired with ''Supernatural'', this combo led The CW to success on a new night. ''Arrow'' continued to perform strongly, however its new companion, the highly anticipated ''[[The Tomorrow People (U.S. TV series)|The Tomorrow People]]'' fizzled out and was canceled despite a promising start. Freshman period-piece ''[[Reign (TV series)|Reign]]'' performed adequately enough to earn a renewal. Mid-season entry ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'' proved to be a success, however fellow mid-season entry ''[[Star-Crossed (TV series)|Star-Crossed]]'' did not fare as well and was canceled. The network finally found success with its summer programming in 2013, with the revival of the U.S. version of the improv comedy series ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which later became part of the network's fall-to-spring schedule.

The 2014–15 season saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed shows that also earned strong ratings: ''Arrow'' spin-off ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the freshman comedy-drama ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' (loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela ''[[Juana la virgen|Juana la Virgen]]''), and freshman offbeat crime dramedy ''[[iZombie (TV series)|iZombie]]'' (a loose adaptation based on DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comic book series [[iZOMBIE|of the same name]]). ''The Flash'' surpassed ''The Vampire Dairies'' as the highest-rated premiere in the network's history and became the most watched show on the network. ''Jane the Virgin'', meanwhile, earned some of the highest critical praise of any series during the 2014–15 television season, and during its first season, became the first CW series ever to have been nominated for and win a [[Golden Globe Award]] (with lead actress [[Gina Rodriguez (actress)|Gina Rodriguez]] winning the Golden Globe for "Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series"). ''iZombie'', which premiered as a [[mid-season replacement]], earned both strong ratings (at one point becoming the third highest-rated show on The CW) and critical acclaim. Overall, the network ended the 2014–15 season posting its highest average total viewership in a single television season since 2007–08 with 2.15 million viewers, a 12% increase in total viewership year-to-year; The CW also posted its highest seasonal demographic ratings among males ages 18–49 with a 0.8 share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/05/13/the-cw-delivers-its-most-watched-season-in-7-years/403500/|title=The CW Delivers its Most Watched Season in 7 Years|last=Bibel|first=Sara|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=May 13, 2015|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network's Summer 2015 schedule also saw the debut of ''[[Significant Mother]]'', the first original half-hour sitcom to air on The CW since 2009 (other scripted half-hour comedies have aired on the network since that time, consisting of imported series acquired by The CW through distribution deals with Canadian and British producers).

The 2015–16 season saw two shows that receive similar success: the freshman musical comedy-drama ''[[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]]'' and the ''Arrow/Flash'' spin-off ''[[Legends of Tomorrow|DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]''. ''Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'' became one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the season and became the second show on the network to be nominated and win a Golden Globe Award (with actress [[Rachel Bloom]] winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series); ''DC's Legends of Tomorrow'', meanwhile, earned high ratings for the network and became the most watched show on the network's Thursday night block in two years. On the other hand, ''[[Containment (TV series)|Containment]]'' was cancelled following mixed reviews and falling ratings (although the series had been promoted as being a limited series).&lt;ref name="variety-containmentcancelled"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/containment-cancelled-no-season-2-cw-1201773226/|title='Containment' Canceled at The CW|last=Prudom|first=Laura|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016–17 season saw mixed fortunes with CBS transplant ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' providing a boost to the lineup, while freshmen series ''[[Frequency (TV series)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[No Tomorrow (TV series)|No Tomorrow]]'' failed to live up to ratings expectations and were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/the-cw-streak-ends-no-tomorrow-frequency-no-back-orders-1201855990/|title= The CW Streak Ends With ‘No Tomorrow’ &amp; ‘Frequency’ Getting No Back Orders|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/frequency-no-tomorrow-canceled-the-cw-once-season-1202087053/|title=‘Frequency’ &amp; ‘No Tomorrow’ Canceled By the CW After One Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date= May 8, 2017|accessdate=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critically acclaimed freshman series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' fared better, securing a renewal despite modest ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/riverdale-renewed-season-2-the-cw-archie-comics-1202038629/|title=‘Riverdale’ Renewed For Season 2 By the CW|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-running ''The Vampire Diaries'' and ''Reign'' concluded their runs.

The 2017–18 season saw the success of new DC Comics entry ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', but with little else as rookie entries ''[[Valor (TV series)|Valor]]'' and ''[[Life Sentence (TV series)|Life Sentence]]'' were canceled after being met with dismal ratings. Soap reboot ''[[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' was met with similarly dismal ratings, but was renewed thanks to lucrative off-network streaming deals struck with the show's producing studio and network co-owner, CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-cbs-earnings-conference-033925537.html|title=Q2 2017 CBS Corp Earnings Call|work=Yahoo!

==Programming==
===Network programming and scheduling===
{{main|List of programs broadcast by The CW}}
The CW airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Sunday through Friday evenings, compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sunday nights programmed by the three longest-established networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC. This "common prime" scheduling (which was originated by Fox when it launched its prime time schedule in April 1987, and later adopted by CW predecessors The WB and UPN when they launched in January 1995) allows the option for affiliates to air either a local newscast, syndicated programming or both during the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period. As with The WB and UPN, The CW does not run network programming on Saturday nights – even though it maintains a syndicated children's program block on Saturday mornings – allowing affiliates to run syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week because of special programming carried by the station, in the 8:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period (MyNetworkTV also does not carry any weekend prime time programming, having turned network time on Saturday evenings over to its affiliates in March 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyNetworkTV Shakeup Music to Syndicators Ears|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/mynetworktv-shakeup-music-syndicators-ears/34149?rssid=20065|author=Paige Albiniak|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The CW is also tied with NBC (if its morning news program ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' is not counted) for the fewest daytime hours programmed by any of the major broadcast networks, running only one hour of programming each weekday afternoon (compared to 4{{frac|1|2}} daytime hours on CBS and three hours on ABC). The CW, unlike the "Big Four" broadcast networks, also does not air any national [[news]]casts, network-supplied sports, or [[Late night television in the United States|late-night programming]].

Because of these factors, The CW's affiliates handle the responsibility of programming non-network time periods, with the majority of its stations filling those slots mainly with syndicated programming. However, some of the network's affiliates broadcast their own local news and/or sports programs (either produced by the station itself or through outsourcing agreements with an affiliate of another network). Many affiliates also carry telecasts of [[college basketball|basketball]], [[college football|football]] and in some cases, other collegiate sporting events (such as [[college baseball|baseball]] or [[College ice hockey|hockey]]) that are produced by syndicators such as [[American Sports Network]] and [[Raycom Sports]], while a few (mainly those owned by Tribune Broadcasting, such as former Chicago affiliate WGN-TV) carry games from local teams of major professional sports leagues such as [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].

{{As of|October 2018}}, The CW currently provides 20 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week, over the course of seven days. The network provides twelve hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Sunday through Fridays from 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Outside of prime time, an hour of daytime programming is also offered Monday through Fridays from 3:00 to 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in all time zones, in the form of tabloid talk show ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' (though a few affiliates – such as [[WPIX]]  in New York City, [[WPWR-TV]] in Chicago, [[KDAF]] in [[Dallas]]-[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[KPXJ]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[WCCB]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] – carry the show earlier in the afternoon); also, a three-hour [[E/I|educational programming]] block called "[[One Magnificent Morning]]" (which airs as part of the CW schedule through a time-lease agreement with [[Litton Entertainment]]) airs on Saturday mornings from 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. in all time zones.

The weekday daytime hour provided by the network and the Litton-produced Saturday morning block (the latter of which is subject to scheduling variances similar to the weekday hour in some markets, such as in [[WUPA|Atlanta]] and [[XETV-TDT|San Diego]]) are designed to be [[broadcast delay|tape delayed]] and are therefore recommended to air in the same time slot in all time zones, though both are broadcast one hour earlier on affiliates of The CW Plus in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] and [[Alaska Time Zone]]s. In [[Guam]], CW Plus affiliate [[KTKB-LD]] in [[Hagåtña, Guam|Hagåtña]] airs the CW schedule day and date on a one-day tape delay from its initial broadcast because of the time difference between Guam and the [[continental United States]] as the island is on the west side of the [[International Date Line]]. As of 2018, ''Supernatural'' (which originally aired on The WB) is the only CW series carried over from either of the network's respective predecessors that continues to be broadcast on the network.

The CW formerly aired short segments during commercial breaks within certain episodes of its programs known as "Content Wraps" – a play on the network's name – in order to advertise one company's product during part or the entirety of a commercial break. The entertainment magazine series ''[[CW Now]]'' was inspired in part by the success of the Content Wraps as it was intended to be a series with [[product placement]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="CW Now": Content or Commercial?|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/09/25/cw-now-content-or-commercial.aspx|author=Steven Mallas|website=[[The Motley Fool]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program was cancelled in 2008, after a single 23-episode season. For the 2006–07 season, The CW reached an agreement with [[American Eagle Outfitters]] to incorporate tie-ins with the company's [[Aerie (intimates)|aerie]] clothing line as part of the Content Wrap concept within the network's Tuesday night schedule, which included subjects in the commercials commenting on plot points in each of the shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="aerie girls" – Google Search|url=http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aerie+girls%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|website=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was cut down to regular advertising in February 2007, after a fan backlash by viewers of both shows and general criticism of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aerie Girls and Terrible TV Advertising|url=http://www.makemewatchtv.com/2006/10/04/the-aerie-girls-and-terrible-tv-advertising/|website=Make Me Watch TV|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=December 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918085714/http://www.makemewatchtv.com/2006/10/04/the-aerie-girls-and-terrible-tv-advertising/|archive-date=September 18, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News programming===
The CW does not produce any national news content, and the majority of its affiliates do not have their own autonomous news operations. {{As of|September 2018}}, the network currently has only four affiliates that produce their own local news programming, all of which were carry-overs from previous affiliations: WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles started their news departments as independent stations and/or during early affiliations with other networks including DuMont; [[WCCB]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Channel 18 to be new home of CW network|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/04/18/3990396/channel-18-to-be-new-home-of-cw.html |author=Mark Washburn|agency=McClatchy-Tribune Information Services|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=April 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927013236/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/04/18/3990396/channel-18-to-be-new-home-of-cw.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; started its news operation as a Fox affiliate; and [[WISH-TV]] in [[Indianapolis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WISH-TV Expanding Daily Newscasts by Four Hours|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/49771-wish-tv-expanding-daily-newscasts-by-four-hours|author=Jeff Newman|author2=Anthony Schoettle|newspaper=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=October 1, 2014|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which became a CW affiliate on January 1, 2015) started its news operation as an ABC affiliate before affiliating with CBS in 1956. KTLA has the largest number of weekly hours devoted to local news programming of any CW affiliate with 78¾ hours of scheduled news each week.

Eight other CW-affiliated stations maintained in-house news operations, but have since disaffiliated from the network or discontinued in-house production:
* WGN-TV in Chicago has maintained a news department since it launched as a CBS affiliate in 1948; the station – which, along with sister stations KTLA and WPIX, transitioned into a news-intensive outlet during its tenures with The WB and The CW – retains a news-heavy format after disaffiliating from the network in September 2016;
* Under Tribune Broadcasting ownership, [[WLVI]] in [[Boston]] produced an in-house 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast, which was replaced in December 2006 with one produced by then-NBC affiliate (now independent) [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]], after Tribune sold WLVI to that station's longtime owner [[Sunbeam Television]];
* [[XETV-TDT]] in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], Mexico (serving the [[San Diego]] market) retained the news department it launched in 1999 as a Fox affiliate when it joined The CW in August 2008; XETV's news department shut down on March 31, 2017, following the earlier announcement that the CW affiliation in San Diego would move to a subchannel of CBS affiliate [[KFMB-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego's CW6 news signs off|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/tv/sd-me-test-cw6-story.html|author=Karla Peterson|website=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=March 12, 2017|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2012, [[KCWI-TV]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] broadcast a morning news and talk program, which transitioned from an in-house production to a brand extension during ''[[Good Morning America]]'' of ABC affiliate [[WOI-DT]]'s morning newscast on April 11, 2016, as a result of Nexstar Broadcasting's acquisition of KCWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KCWI-TV has new owner, morning show changes planned|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/03/20/kcwi-tv-changes-hands-loses-morning-show/82017610/|author=Timothy Meinch|newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=March 20, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For several years, [[WDCW]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] used reporters from Tribune's local bureau and anchors based from the studios of sister CBS station [[WTVR-TV|WTVR]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and [[KDAF]] in [[Dallas]], [[KIAH]] in [[Houston]] and [[WSFL-TV]] in Miami used non-traditional formats (in the form of a [[newsreel]]-style program known as ''[[NewsFix]]'', along with the morning show ''Morning Dose''; both KDAF and KIAH had previously produced more traditional newscasts, launched during their WB affiliations, earlier in their tenures with The CW). These programs were all canceled in September 2018, a result of budget cuts within Tribune, along with the termination of Tribune's attempted merger with [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]].

News programming on CW affiliates – if the station carries any – is often outsourced to another major network affiliate in the market, especially if they are operated as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] or [[local marketing agreement|management agreement]], such as Tribune's respective CW-Fox duopolies of [[KWGN-TV]]/[[KDVR]] in [[Denver]] and [[KPLR-TV]]/[[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] (the Fox stations in both duopolies – KDVR and KTVI – were formerly owned by [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]], with Tribune-owned KWGN and KPLR respectively consolidating with those stations through local marketing agreements formed as part of a wider partnership involving Local TV, which Tribune bought outright in 2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver, St. Louis To Get Fox-CW Duops|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/25485/denver-st-louis-to-get-foxcw-duops|author=Harry A.

The scheduling of news programming on The CW's affiliates often mirrors that of Fox stations, with morning newscasts (designed to compete with the national morning shows on ABC, CBS and NBC within the 7:00–9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. timeslot; in duopolies, these are typically an extension of a sister station's morning newscast) and a prime time newscast within the 10:00–11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific (9:00–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) time slot. Rarely (but more common on the few major-market CW affiliates with in-house news departments), they may also include midday and/or early evening newscasts, including the network newscast slot of 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. CT.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|Kids' WB|Toonzai|Vortexx|One Magnificent Morning}}
On September 23, 2006, the ''[[Kids' WB]]'' children's programming block – which originated on The WB in September 1995 and continued to be produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] – was carried over to The CW as part of its inaugural programming lineup; although the network on which it originated ceased operations the week before, the "Kids' WB" branding was retained for the block. On October 2, 2007, through a joint decision between corporate parents Warner Bros. Television and CBS Corporation, The CW announced that it would discontinue the ''Kids' WB'' block due to competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic (such as [[Cartoon Network]], which carried many series shared with the block and vice versa, [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Disney Channel]]), as well as the effects of children's advertising limits, and would sell the programming rights to the network's Saturday morning block to [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] (which at the time of the announcement, had produced a competing children's programming block, ''[[4Kids TV]]'', for [[Fox (TV channel)|Fox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW turns to 4Kids on Saturdays|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/markets-festivals/cw-turns-to-4kids-on-saturdays-1117973235/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kids' WB'' ended its run on May 17, 2008 (though some CW affiliates that delayed the block to Sundays, such as [[Atlanta]] O&amp;O [[WUPA]], aired the block for the last time on May 18).

The following week on May 24, 4Kids took over responsibility for The CW's Saturday morning children's lineup, with the debut of a new block called ''[[Toonzai|The CW4Kids]]''. The block's lineup initially consisted mostly of programs carried over from ''Kids' WB'', before eventually adding 4Kids-produced shows such as ''[[Chaotic (TV series)|Chaotic]]'' as well as new seasons of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brands Old and New for 4Kids at Licensing Expo 2008|url=http://www.awn.com/news/brands-old-and-new-4kids-licensing-expo-2008|author=Annemarie Moody|website=[[Animation World Network]]|publisher=AWN, Inc.|date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was rebranded into ''[[Toonzai]]'' on August 14, 2010 (though The CW4Kids name was retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding obligations that the network had to comply with per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning timeslots); ''Toonzai'' ended its run on August 18, 2012.

On July 3, 2012, [[Saban Capital Group#Saban Brands|Saban Brands]] and Kidsco Media Ventures, affiliates of [[Saban Capital Group]], entered into an agreement to program the five-hour Saturday morning time slot with a new action-adventure and comedy programming block for The CW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands to rebuild CW toon block|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/saban-brands-to-rebuild-cw-toon-block-1118056206/|author=Andrew Wallenstein|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 2, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW signs Saban Brands for kids block|url=http://rbr.com/the-cw-signs-saban-brands-for-kids-block/|author=C.

On June 5, 2014, The CW announced an agreement with [[Litton Entertainment]] to program a block of live-action series designed to comply with the FCC's [[E/I|educational programming]] guidelines. Vortexx (which was the last remaining non-educational children's block on the major U.S. broadcast networks) was replaced by ''[[One Magnificent Morning]]'' on October 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The CW Sets 5-Hour Saturday Morning Block|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/the-cw-saturday-morning-block-litton-entertainment/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saturday morning cartoons are no more|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/30/saturday-morning-cartoons-are-no-more/|author=Gail Sullivan|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]]|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block features a mix of wildlife and lifestyle-themed programs, similar in vein to those featured on the Litton-produced blocks aired by [[Litton's Weekend Adventure|ABC]] and CW sister network [[CBS Dream Team|CBS]] (one of its initial programs, ''Expedition Wild'', was moved over to "One Magnificent Morning" from the ABC block; while one of the CW block's early entries, ''Rock the Park'', moved to "Litton's Weekend Adventure" after one season).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Joins With Litton For Sat.

{{main|List of The CW Television Network affiliates (table)|List of The CW Television Network affiliates (by U.S. state)|The CW Plus|CBS Television Stations}}
&lt;!--- Please update station count in below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. ---&gt;
{{As of|November 2017}}, The CW has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 209 additional television stations encompassing 46 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. possessions.&lt;ref name=recw&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Search: CW|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=CW|website=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recwplus&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Search: CW+|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=CW%2B|website=RabbitEars|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StationIndex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Profile: The CW|url=http://www.stationindex.com/tv/by-net/cw|website=Station Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counting only conventional CW affiliates and over-the-air affiliates of The CW Plus, the network has an estimated combined national reach of 100% of all households in the United States (or 323,107,367 Americans with at least one television set); this makes The CW the largest U.S. broadcast network by population reach percentage. As of January 2016, four U.S. states (Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont) lack a locally licensed CW affiliate, largely due to a lack of a need for a local affiliate as those states are located within the broadcast ranges of stations in nearby states. Delaware is served by Philadelphia O&amp;O WPSG and [[Salisbury, Maryland]] affiliate [[WMDT|WMDT-DT2]], while New Hampshire and Vermont are each served by four CW stations based in surrounding states (including Boston affiliate [[WLVI]]). New Jersey is served by WPSG and New York City affiliate WPIX.

As a newer broadcast network, The CW maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in [[analog television|analog]] or [[digital terrestrial television|digital]]) in a few markets, such as [[Reno, Nevada]] ([[KRNS-CD]]) and [[Boise, Idaho]] ([[KYUU-LD]]). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. The CW also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets and receive the network's programming via The CW Plus; the largest subchannel-only CW affiliate by market size, as of May 31, 2017, is [[KFMB-TV|KFMB-TV DT2]] in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]].

Currently, the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] is the largest operator of CW stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 24 CW-affiliated stations, nine subchannel-only affiliates and one cable-only affiliate, covering 17% of all U.S. television markets; Tribune Broadcasting is the largest operator of CW stations in terms of overall market reach, owning or providing services to thirteen CW stations (including its three largest affiliates in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago), covering 28% of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW In Talks With Tribune As Network Faces Affiliate &amp; Streaming Renewals|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/cw-tribune-deal-renewal-talks-netflix-hulu-1201505947/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
On the day of the network launch announcement, The CW immediately announced it had reached ten-year affiliation agreements with Tribune Broadcasting and CBS Television Stations. Tribune originally committed 16 stations that were previously affiliated with The WB (including its [[Flagship (television)|flagship]] broadcast stations WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York City; another committed station, [[KSWB-TV]] in [[San Diego]], joined Fox in August 2008, and two others, [[WLVI|WLVI-TV]] in Boston and [[WCWN]] in [[Albany, New York]] were respectively sold by Tribune to Sunbeam Television and [[Freedom Communications]] shortly after the network launched), while CBS committed 11 of its UPN stations (including [[WKBD]] in Detroit, WPSG in Philadelphia, KBHK-TV (now [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]]) in San Francisco and WUPA in Atlanta). These stations combined to reach 48% of all television households in the United States. Both companies also owned several UPN and WB-affiliated stations that did not join The CW in overlapping markets (such as [[Seattle]], Philadelphia and [[Dallas]]). As part of its affiliation agreement with the network, the Tribune Company agreed to divest its ownership interest in The WB (a move it made partly to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for The WB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.com/investors/transcripts/thecw_06.html |title=Conference Call Regarding "The CW" |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070926231441/http://www.tribune.com/investors/transcripts/thecw_06.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not acquire an equity stake in The CW.

The network stated that it would eventually reach 95% of all U.S. television households. In markets where separate affiliates of both UPN and The WB operated, only one station became a CW affiliate. Executives were on record as preferring the "strongest" stations among The WB and UPN's existing affiliates. As one example, the new network's first affiliate outside the core group of Tribune and CBS-owned stations, [[WJZY]] in [[Charlotte]] (which was later acquired by Fox Television Stations and converted into a Fox O&amp;O in July 2013), was tied with Atlanta O&amp;O WUPA as UPN's fifth highest-rated station. In most cases, it was obvious where the new network would affiliate; there were only a few markets (such as Philadelphia, Miami–[[Fort Lauderdale]], Boston, Charlotte and Atlanta) where the WB and UPN affiliates were both relatively strong in terms of local overall viewership. For example, one of the earliest affiliates to be announced outside the core group, [[WKCF]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], had not only been The WB's highest-rated affiliate for the virtual entirety of that network's run, but had also been the fourth highest-rated television station in [[Central Florida]].

Nearly all of The CW's affiliates were formerly affiliated with UPN or The WB, with very few having been independent stations or affiliates of other networks prior to joining the network; a notable exception was [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] affiliate [[KVCW]], which had been a fairly successful independent before joining The CW. Although it was generally understood that The CW was a merger of UPN and The WB, the new network's creation was not structured as a merger in the legal sense. Rather, it was one new network launching at the same time that two others shut down, although it did assume certain programming content, operations and management from its predecessors. As such, The CW was not obligated by existing affiliations with The WB and UPN; it had to negotiate from scratch with individual stations. As a result, in several markets, the CW affiliation is on a local station different from either the former WB and UPN stations (for example, the CW affiliation in Las Vegas ended up on KVCW, instead of former WB affiliate [[KSNV|KVMY]] or now-defunct former UPN affiliate [[KTUD-CD|KTUD-CA]]). The network has also affiliated with some [[digital subchannel]]s, usually those launched by a local [[Television network#United States|Big Four]] affiliate as a new service, in several other markets – especially if fewer than six commercial television stations existed at the time of affiliation, requiring The CW to carry its programming on a subchannel by default (for example, The CW opted to affiliate with a subchannel of WKRC-TV in Cincinnati – which has only five commercial full-power stations – instead of former WB affiliate [[WSTR-TV]], which instead became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV).

Because of the availability of "instant duopoly" digital subchannels that will likely be easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic timeslots that would subject the timeshifted programs to lower average viewership in certain markets, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when they both launched in January 1995. UPN, for several years, had affiliation gaps in the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to cover only 86% of the country. This resulted in secondary affiliations with other networks and the resulting diluted ratings when programs were shown out of their intended timeslots, or the lack of the program airing at all (a problem experienced by many fans of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise with ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').

===Launch repercussions===
{{further|2006 United States broadcast TV realignment}}
The announcement of The CW caused the largest single shakeup in U.S. broadcast television since the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation alliance between Fox and New World Communications]] in 1994 (as well as a separate alliance with Burnham Broadcasting that began a year later) and the subsequent launches of UPN and The WB the following year. While The CW's debut affected more markets, it likely did not cause the same degree of viewer confusion, as no affiliates of the four major networks dropped those affiliations to join The CW (some "Big Four" affiliations did change at this time, but for unrelated reasons). The WB and UPN were the first major television networks to shut down since the collapse of the DuMont Television Network in August 1955, although other small broadcast television networks have also ceased operations over the years.

It became clear that Fox Television Stations, which purchased several UPN-affiliated stations from that network's former co-owner Chris-Craft Industries in 2002, would be affected. Its UPN affiliates in five major markets ([[WWOR-TV|New York City]], [[KCOP|Los Angeles]], [[WPWR-TV|Chicago]], [[WDCA|Washington, D.C.]] and [[KTXH|Houston]]) did not receive affiliations with The CW, due to the agreement with Tribune, and Fox made it clear it would not even seek carriage of the network for its UPN stations in four other markets. All network logos and references were quickly removed from Fox's UPN stations. Shortly thereafter, Fox parent [[News Corporation]] (which spun off its American media and entertainment properties into [[21st Century Fox]] as part of the company's July 2013 corporate separation) announced that it would launch MyNetworkTV, a programming service meant to fill the two nightly prime time hours that UPN would vacate on the network's Fox-owned affiliates after The CW launched. Fox also offered the service to stations owned by other broadcasting groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 22, 2006|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News Corp.

In markets where The WB and UPN were carried on separate stations, one of the two local outlets was left out in the merger; most of the stations that did not join The CW had signed affiliation agreements with MyNetworkTV instead, while others elected to become independent stations. Some stations (mainly digital subchannels, some cable channels that were formerly part of The WB 100+ Station Group, and struggling low-power stations) which did not affiliate with either network opted instead to shut down permanently.

===Affiliate distribution===
Like its predecessors UPN and by technicality, The WB (as none of Tribune Broadcasting's WB stations were considered to be O&amp;Os since Time Warner held majority ownership of that network), The CW does not have [[owned-and-operated station]]s in any of the three largest U.S. television markets – New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. The network's largest owned-and-operated station is CBS-owned [[WPSG]] in [[Philadelphia]], which also became UPN's largest O&amp;O after Chris-Craft Industries (which sold most of its UPN stations, including its affiliates in [[WWOR-TV|New York City]] and [[KCOP-TV|Los Angeles]], to [[Fox Television Stations]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had its ownership stake in that network acquired by Viacom in March 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom wins UPN so let the digestion begin|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|periodical=[[Media Life Magazine]]|date=March 2000|accessdate=May 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205150040/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2000/mar00/news20321.html|archivedate=February 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPN deal done; Viacom buys out Chris-Craft share|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62239976.html|author=Melissa Grego|author2=Joe Schlosser|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=April 10, 2000|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (neither UPN nor the [[DuMont Television Network]] had an O&amp;O in Chicago at all; a similar situation arose with DuMont's O&amp;O in Los Angeles, present-day CW affiliate [[KTLA]] – which had disaffiliated from the network in 1948 shortly after the FCC ruled that it and WDTV in [[Pittsburgh]] (now [[KDKA-TV]], a CW corporate cousin through CBS Corporation), to be O&amp;Os through their then-owner [[Paramount Pictures]]' voting stock interest in DuMont).

Because Tribune Broadcasting does not maintain an ownership stake in The CW, its stations in the two respective top markets (WPIX and KTLA) are actually ''[[network affiliate|affiliates]]'' of the network; CBS Corporation owns secondary stations – both [[Independent station (North America)|independents]] – in two of the three markets, [[KCAL-TV]] in Los Angeles and [[WLNY-TV]] in the New York City market (however, while KCAL was owned by CBS at the network's launch, WLNY was not acquired by CBS until 2011; neither station carries CW programming, though, because of the network's affiliation deals with Tribune-owned stations in those markets, and in the latter case, WLNY's over-the-air signal does not serve the entire New York City market – resulting in most residents in the metropolitan area receiving the station mainly through cable or satellite – due to being licensed to the [[Long Island]] community of [[Riverhead, New York|Riverhead]], restricting its transmitter from being located more than {{convert|15|mi|km}} from its [[city of license]] under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations). Unlike with The WB and UPN (the latter network's founding owners, Chris-Craft and Viacom, both had their own station groups that formed UPN's core stations at its launch), only one of The CW's co-owners – CBS Corporation – maintains ownership of the network's owned-and-operated stations (since the summer 2017 sale of [[WPCH-TV]]/[[Atlanta]], Time Warner holds no over-the-air assets whatsoever).

===Digital multicasting and cable television===
Unlike the other major networks, The CW distributes its programming in small and certain mid-sized markets throughout the United States (generally those ranked among the bottom 110 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] [[media market]]s) through [[The CW Plus]], a separate national feed that is carried on a mixture of full-power and [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power station]]s in some markets, and cable-only outlets and [[digital subchannel]] affiliations on major network stations in markets that do not have enough commercial stations to support a standalone CW affiliate (several of The CW Plus's digital subchannel outlets originally operated as cable-only affiliates at the network's launch). The service offers its own master schedule of syndicated and [[brokered programming]] acquired by the network (including some feature films and [[infomercial]]s) during non-network programming hours, although some CW Plus affiliates may also run local newscasts produced by a major network affiliate.

CW predecessor The WB previously had two cable-only affiliate outlets: [[WGN America]], the national [[superstation]] feed of WGN-TV at the time, from January 1995 to October 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WGN Drops WB, Adds Movies, Sitcoms|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55897252.html|author=Linda Moss|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 20, 1999|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last night Dawson's last ? WGN ceases to air WB programming|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18522684.html|author=MaryWade Burnside|newspaper=[[The Charleston Gazette]]|publisher=The Daily Gazette Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 7, 1999|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and network-operated [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] (the direct predecessor to The CW Plus), which was formed in September 1998 and had several of its cable-only outlets join The CW Plus at the CW network's launch. Not all of the network's cable-only affiliates were CW Plus outlets, [[WT05]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] offered its own schedule of syndicated programs during non-network hours that was programmed by its then-owner [[Block Communications]], which also operates that market's major cable provider [[Buckeye CableSystem]] (WT05 now exists as "CW13," having been converted into a digital subchannel of [[Gray Television]]-owned ABC affiliate [[WTVG]] in October 2014). Though The CW is the only network with a station group that includes cable-only outlets, it is actually one of only three networks that have had cable-only stations within its affiliate body (ABC formerly had a cable-only affiliate in [[Winchester, Virginia]]-based [[TV3 Winchester]] until Gray shut the channel down in December 2013).

===Station standardization===
When The CW launched in September 2006, the network began branding most of its affiliates using a combination of "CW" or "The CW", and at the affiliate's choice, either the station's channel number (for example, [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] affiliate [[WNAB]] is branded as "CW58" and Seattle O&amp;O [[KSTW]] brands as "CW11") or the name of the city or region it serves. Examples of the latter include Philadelphia O&amp;O WPSG (known as "The CW Philly 57" as an homage to its prior branding as an independent station), WLVI (known at launch as "Boston's CW", though it rebranded to "CW56" after being sold to Sunbeam Television), WUPA (known as "CW Atlanta" at launch, but is now known as "CW69"), [[Waco, Texas]] subchannel affiliate [[KWTX-TV|KWTX-DT2]] (known as "CW Texas") and KVCW (branded as "CW Las Vegas"). Some stations also use the call sign either within the station logo, in on-air identification or both; examples include [[WNLO]]/[[Buffalo, New York]] and  [[WWHO]]/[[Columbus, Ohio]] ([[WBNX]]/[[Cleveland]] formerly also did so until their affiliation was terminated in July 2018).

In [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KXVO]] uses the dual brandings of "CW15" and "Omaha's CW". In [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], [[KHON-TV|KHON-DT2]] was originally branded as "Hawaii's CW 93" (the "93" refers to the subchannel's cable channel position on Oceanic Time Warner Cable), before it was shortened to "Hawaii's CW" in September 2014. The branding once used by WKRC-DT2/Cincinnati, Ohio was "CinCW", a [[portmanteau]] with the common nickname for the city, "Cincy" (it now brands as "The CW Cincinnati"). With the exceptions of [[WXCW]]/Fort Myers and (to a somewhat lesser extent) XETV/San Diego, all CW affiliates not owned by Tribune usually brand themselves using a version of the network logo. [[Mobile, Alabama]] CW affiliate WBPG, then known as "The Gulf Coast's CW" changed its call letters to [[WFNA (TV)|WFNA]] in December 2009 and used a similar approach around their new call letters, before becoming known as "CW 55" in September 2012 and adopting a style reflective of The CW's branding techniques once again. WISH-TV in Indianapolis, as it had during its CBS affiliation, continues to brand solely with its channel number and calls as "WISH-TV 8", with "The CW" appended where appropriate, usually only in print and radio advertising.

===Affiliate issues===

====Problems with Time Warner Cable====
Some [[Time Warner Cable]] subscribers around the country were unable to watch CW programming when the network debuted, as stations in several markets were not able to reach carriage deals with the provider to distribute the local affiliates. In markets like [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; [[El Paso, Texas]]; [[Honolulu]], Hawaii; [[Palm Springs, California]]; [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]; [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], where The CW is broadcast on a digital subchannel of one of the market's major network affiliates, there were unsuccessful attempts in getting Time Warner Cable to carry the subchannel affiliates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Warner Cable Squeezes CW Stations|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/time-warner-cable-squeezes-cw-stations/81083|author=[[John M. Higgins]]|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CW co-parent Time Warner had owned Time Warner Cable until it [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] the provider into a separate company in 2009).

Some affiliates eventually signed carriage deals with Time Warner Cable, but not all of the CW affiliates received carriage on the provider's basic cable tiers (for example, [[Syracuse, New York]] affiliate [[WSTQ-LP]] can only be viewed on [[digital cable]] channel 266 in the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ithaca Journal – www.theithacajournal.com – Ithaca, NY|url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061128/NEWS01/611280340|newspaper=[[The Ithaca Journal]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=November 28, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the largest market without a known affiliate is the [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]–[[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] market, whose closest CW station is CBS-owned [[WPCW]]/[[Pittsburgh]], which is carried on TWC's Johnstown and Altoona area systems; WPCW was originally targeted to serve that area before it refocused its programming toward the Pittsburgh market in the late 1990s.

On February 2, 2007, [[Beaumont, Texas]] CBS station [[KFDM]] made its CW-affiliated subchannel available to Time Warner Cable customers in the market on channel 10. On April 20, 2007, ABC affiliate [[KVIA-TV]] in El Paso, Texas began broadcasting its CW-affiliated subchannel on Time Warner Cable channel 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW Wait Over |url=http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=6394674 |website=[[KVIA-TV]] |publisher=[[News-Press &amp; Gazette Company]] |date=April 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927022003/http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=6394674 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2007, [[KCWQ-LP]] made its broadcast debut on channel 5 on Time Warner Cable in the Palm Springs area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW to debut on Time Warner|url=http://www.thedesertsun.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070420/BUSINESS06/704200345|newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pappas Telecasting bankruptcy====
One of the network's major affiliate groups, [[Pappas Telecasting|Pappas Telecasting Companies]], filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] for thirteen of its television stations on May 10, 2008. Within the petition, Pappas specifically cited the network's low ratings and lackluster performance as one of many complications that had forced it to make the filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pappastv.com/pressdetail.php?id=108&amp;prYr=2008 |title=PAPPAS TELECASTING ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT CERTAIN AFFILIATES HAVE FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION |accessdate=June 17, 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921223623/http://www.pappastv.com/pressdetail.php?id=108&amp;prYr=2008 |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stations have since been sold either in business transactions with representatives involved in Pappas's bankruptcy proceedings or via station auction processes as the company winds down operations.

Although Pappas had originally stated that none of its stations would be affected at all by the closing, two stations owned by the company that were formerly affiliated with The CW have ceased operations. On May 29, 2008, [[Yakima, Washington]] affiliate [[KCWK]] (which served the south-central portion of that state) shut down and the station's offices were closed, leaving that area without locally based CW programming and forcing cable and satellite providers to carry Los Angeles affiliate KTLA in order to provide the network's programming to their subscribers. The situation was resolved in April 2009, when [[Fisher Communications]] announced that its CBS affiliates in the area, [[KIMA-TV]] and satellite station [[KEPR-TV]], would carry the network through digital subchannel affiliations.

Subsequently, [[WLGA]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] lost its CW affiliation in April 2009 to a subchannel of NBC affiliate [[WLTZ]] because of the network's concerns about Pappas' financial state;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WLTZ's parent firm to carry CW Network in Columbus|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2009/04/03/672471/wltzs-parent-firm-to-carry-cw.html|author=Andrea V. Hernandez|newspaper=[[Ledger-Enquirer]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WLGA ultimately ceased operations in June 2010 as it was unable to compete in the market as an independent station; it later resumed operations in August 2012, as an affiliate of [[WeatherNation TV]] (it is now an [[Antenna TV]] affiliate).

====Marianas Media bankruptcy====
Marianas Media signed on KTKB-LD in [[Hagåtña, Guam]] as a CW affiliate on April 20, 2009, becoming the U.S. territory's fifth commercial television outlet. However, competition from other stations in the island combined with financial problems at Marianas, which was running the station under a local marketing agreement with the troubled [[KM Communications|KM Communications Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marianas Media closes CW4, PSST|url=http://www.kuam.com/story/14353897/2011/03/30/marianas-media-announces-closure-of-cw4-psst|website=[[KUAM-TV]]|publisher=Pacific Telestations, Inc.|date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the station off the air on March 31, 2011. The station resumed operations the following year.

====Tribune's relations with The CW====
While [[Tribune Media]] has solid affiliation deals with The CW on several of its stations, it also maintains a strong affiliation alliance with Fox. But with new management and ownership taking over Tribune in 2008, it was apparent that the company would switch one of its CW-affiliated stations to Fox (at least those in markets without a Fox owned-and-operated station or a former O&amp;O that was acquired by Local TV, which Tribune later acquired in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Acquisition to make Tribune Co. largest U.S. TV station operator|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-tribune-buying-local-tv-20130701,0,3402241.story|author=Robert Channick|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), adding to more questions surrounding The CW's future. In a March 2008 seminar by Tribune's then-chairman and CEO [[Sam Zell]], it was revealed that the company's San Diego outlet KSWB-TV would switch its affiliation from The CW to Fox that August, with KSWB assuming the Fox affiliation from [[XETV-TDT|XETV-TV]], which had been a Fox charter affiliate since that network's October 1986 inception. XETV (which is licensed to [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], Mexico under the ownership of [[Grupo Televisa]] but whose U.S. operations are programmed by [[Entravision|Bay City Television]]) was not informed of Zell's deal until it was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XETV, KSWB Battle For Fox Affiliation In San Diego |url=http://radiomatthew.com/posts/xetv-kswb-battle-for-fox-affiliation-in-san-diego/ |website=RadioMatthew.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609113416/http://radiomatthew.com/posts/xetv-kswb-battle-for-fox-affiliation-in-san-diego/ |archivedate=June 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the news broke, XETV planned on suing to prevent the switch on the grounds that it would violate an affiliation contract that XETV had with Fox that was not set to expire until 2010. However, on July 2, 2008, XETV announced that it would join The CW on August 1 (the same day that KSWB became a Fox affiliate) and rebrand as "San Diego 6".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fox6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=7a4bac12-8df5-48e6-8f68-d8e355f50b95 |title=XETV Becomes San Diego 6 – New Home of The CW Television Network |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707223418/http://www.fox6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=7a4bac12-8df5-48e6-8f68-d8e355f50b95 |archivedate=July 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} (July 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Though twelve of Tribune's thirteen other CW-affiliated stations have remained with the network, all of them began to de-emphasize the network from their branding (e.g., "CW 11") in favor of one with a stronger local identity. On-air branding that excised the CW name began being implemented by the stations in July 2008, either on-air (in the case of KWGN-TV) or through their websites (as part of a redesign for all of the Tribune stations' websites).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune gives CW the cold shoulder|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/tribune-gives-cw-the-cold-shoulder-1117991420/|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these stations eventually began reincorporating the CW branding starting in 2011, such as KDAF/Dallas, KIAH/Houston and [[KRCW-TV]]/[[Portland, Oregon]].

Tribune Company president and CEO [[Peter Liguori]] said in a May 2014 discussion at the MoffettNathanson Media &amp; Communications Summit that he was "not pleased with where the CW is [in regards to its ratings performance]," stating that the network "should not program to [young] people who don't watch [conventional] television." Liguori also stated that he would consider collaborating with the network in regards to improving its programming slate, possibly by incorporating programs from the company's Tribune Studios unit (a production division which launched shortly after Liguori was appointed president of Tribune in November 2013) onto the network, as well as having Tribune play a larger role in The CW's management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune CEO Says He's "Not Pleased" With CW's Performance|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/tribune-ceo-says-hes-not-pleased-with-cws-performance/|author=David Lieberman|website=Deadline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at [[Goldman Sachs]]' 23rd Annual Communacopia Conference in September 2014, Les Moonves acknowledged that Tribune had been looking for more input in how the network is programmed and noted that Liguori is a former programmer (having previously served in executive roles at Fox, [[FX (TV network)|FX]] and [[Discovery Communications]]), saying that "[Liguori] would like to participate. He has some good ideas. He's part of our team. Will there be some change in how the CW is structured going forward? I don't know." Moonves went on to reiterate that Tribune is "a very important part of [CBS'] future" (considering that Tribune had recently acquired the CBS affiliation for its Indianapolis station and then-CW affiliate [[WTTV]], following disagreements between CBS and longtime affiliate WISH-TV, which would eventually take over the CW affiliation in January 2015, over [[reverse compensation]] demands by the network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Showtime Could Stream in International Markets; Moonves also hints at CW changes|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/showtime-could-stream-international-markets/133869|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 10, 2014|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2014 interview with ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', Liguori appeared to reverse course on his previous statements and spoke of Tribune's support of the network. Liguori said in a statement, "We are very encouraged by the recent uptick in The CW['s] ratings and the positive critical response to the new primetime lineup. In particular, [CW CEO Mark Pedowitz] has put in place a programming strategy that will help the network appeal to a wider, more inclusive audience, which is important for our stations across the country. We were glad to support the launch of the new shows through editorial and promotional initiatives, and we look forward to more continued collaboration to build upon this momentum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bet on The CW Paying Off For the Network's Parents|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/bet-cw-paying-network-s-parents/135127|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2015}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, The CW and Tribune began negotiations on a new affiliation deal, as the original 10-year agreement signed at the network's inception was approaching its end. Complicating matters was the desire by The CW's parent companies, CBS and Warner Bros., to stream the network's programming as a standalone pay [[Over-the-top content|OTT]] service. The impasse in negotiations resulted in a months-long standoff between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/91468/tribune-impasse-is-behind-cw-ott-option|title=Tribune Impasse Is Behind CW OTT Option  –  TVNewsCheck.com|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2016,  The CW and Tribune announced they had come to a new affiliation agreement. As part of the deal, Tribune's Chicago flagship [[WGN-TV]] would leave the network and revert to being an independent station after nearly 21 years of being affiliated with The CW and its predecessor network, The WB. A major factor in this decision is WGN-TV's large use of local sports programming, which led to many pre-emptions of the CW while WGN-TV has had to move as many as 30 games a year to another local station in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/the-cw-tribune-new-affiliate-agreement-2-1201761192/|title=The CW &amp; Tribune Reach New 5-Year Agreement, Chicago Affiliation Switches To Fox-Owned Station WPWR|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CW affiliation moved to [[WPWR-TV]], a [[Fox Television Stations]]-owned [[MyNetworkTV]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cw-tribune-affiliation-wgn-1201780975/|title=CW, Tribune Stations Set Affiliation Deal as WGN-TV Chicago Goes Indie|first=Brian Steinberg, Cynthia|last=Littleton|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roberts Broadcasting bankruptcy====
[[Roberts Broadcasting]] filed for Chapter 11 [[bankruptcy protection]] on October 7, 2011; the company cited the loss of the UPN affiliations on its stations in St. Louis ([[WRBU]]), [[Columbia, South Carolina]] ([[WZRB]]) and [[Jackson, Mississippi]] ([[WRBJ-TV]]) when that network shut down in favor of The CW in 2006, as much of UPN's programming consisted of minority-targeted programs that Roberts felt were compatible with their stations' target audiences (though the stations have since recovered from this setback; additionally, its station in [[Evansville, Indiana]], [[WAZE-TV]], had instead affiliated with The WB prior to 2006, as it was owned by [[South Central Communications]] until February 2007). The company had also been hit with lawsuits from Warner Bros. Television, [[Twentieth Television]] and [[CBS Television Distribution]] over its failure to pay fees for syndicated programming; Roberts eventually settled with Twentieth but lost the Warner Bros. and CBS cases.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-robertsbankruptcy&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberts Broadcasting Files For Bankruptcy|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/475001-Roberts_Broadcasting_Files_For_Bankruptcy.php|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&amp;p-robertsbankruptcy&gt;{{cite news|title=WAZE Owner Roberts Broadcasting files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/oct/10/waze-owner-roberts-broadcasting-files-chapter-11-b/|author=Jacob Newkirk|newspaper=Evansville Courier &amp; Press|publisher=E.

On December 2, 2013, Roberts filed to sell WZRB to Radiant Light Ministries, a subsidiary of [[Tri-State Christian Television]], for $2 million.&lt;ref name=fcc-wzrbtct&gt;{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE (WZRB)|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1599575&amp;Service=DT&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=136750|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=December 4, 2013|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, Roberts also filed to sell WRBU to TCT for $5.5 million.&lt;ref name=fcc-wrbutct&gt;{{cite web|title=APPLICATION FOR CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF BROADCAST STATION CONSTRUCTION PERMIT OR LICENSE (WRBU)|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1605318&amp;Service=DT&amp;Form_id=314&amp;Facility_id=57221|website=CDBS Public Access|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=December 9, 2013|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 11, the [[United States bankruptcy court]] gave initial approval for a plan by Roberts's creditors to instead transfer WRBU, WZRB and the WAZE repeaters to a trust with [[Ion Media Networks]] (a creditor in Roberts's chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings) as its beneficiary, with Roberts' attorney subsequently stating that Ion would purchase the stations for $7.75 million.&lt;ref name=slbj-robertsion&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge approves creditors' proposal in Roberts Broadcasting bankruptcy|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/2013/12/judge-approves-creditors-proposal-in.html?page=all|author=Angela Mueller|newspaper=St. Louis Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slpd-robertsion&gt;{{cite news|title=Roberts' TV stations to be sold|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/roberts-tv-stations-to-be-sold/article_6dbc41fa-08af-5618-97d4-33b7acf750d0.html|author=Lisa Brown|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|publisher=Lee Enterprises|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts had earlier proposed an alternate plan that would have had only the WAZE repeaters be transferred to the trust, which would have allowed the sale of WRBU and WZRB to TCT.&lt;ref name=slbj-robertsion/&gt; The CW affiliation in Columbia moved to [[WKTC]] (with MyNetworkTV, which the station had already been affiliated with, being relegated to a secondary affiliation) in March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WKTC Columbia (S.C.)

===Video-on-demand services===
The CW provides [[video on demand]] access for delayed viewing of full episodes of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at CWTV.com and its [[mobile app]] for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices (with programs streamable over [[3G]] and [[WiFi]] networks), a traditional VOD service – called The CW on Demand – that is available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers, and through content deals with [[Hulu]], [[iTunes]] and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hulu to Get Current Season of Gossip Girl and Other CW Content|url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/28/hulu-gossip-girl-cw|author=Todd Wasserman|website=[[Mashable]]|publisher=Mashable Inc.|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"&gt;{{cite news|title=Netflix, CW Sign 4-Year Deal to Stream Shows|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/13/idUS77575804120111013|agency=Reuters|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2007, The CW began streaming full-length episodes of several of its programs on the CWTV.com website. The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on The CW app and The CW on Demand the day after their original broadcast. However, due to restrictions imposed through its deal with the streaming service, streaming of the most recent episode of any CW program on Hulu is restricted until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both [[digital video recorder|DVR]] and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of Hulu's subscription service. The CW previously imposed a three-day delay after an episode's original airdate before making its programs available on its website and through the Hulu subscription service (then known as Hulu Plus). However, changes implemented by the network on March 15, 2012 in an effort to reduce [[copyright infringement]] of its programming content through illegal streaming and downloading internet platforms resulted in that delay being reduced to eight hours after a program's original airing through both services.&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW shortens Web streaming delay to battle piracy|url=https://variety.com/2012/digital/news/cw-shortens-web-streaming-delay-to-battle-piracy-1118051427/|author=Andrew Wallenstein|website=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, The CW on Demand disables [[fast forward]]ing for content provided through the service.

On October 13, 2011, the network entered into digital distribution deals with streaming services Netflix and Hulu. The four-year Netflix agreement allows its customers to instantly watch more than 700 hours of previous seasons of The CW's current scripted series, while Hulu inked a five-year deal, giving the streaming site access to next-day content from four of the five major networks (with the exception of CW sister network CBS).&lt;ref name="The CW on Hulu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWNetflix"/&gt;

On October 24, 2012, The CW entered into its first video-on-demand distribution deal with a pay television provider through an agreement with [[Comcast]] that allows customers to watch the four most-recent episodes of the network's primetime shows on the [[cable television|cable provider]]'s Xfinity On Demand service, along with next-day episode content. The CW On Demand, which is accessible to subscribers at no additional charge, debuted on [[Comcast Cable|Comcast Xfinity]] systems nationwide on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW Inks First On Demand Deal With Comcast|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-inks-first-demand-deal-382290|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The CW HD===
The CW's master feed is transmitted in [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], with all transmission of the network's programming moving to the format in June 2012. All of the network's prime time programming has been presented in HD since March 2012 (when ''America's Next Top Model'' became the final CW program to convert to the format), with the exception of certain specials produced prior to that point (such as ''[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer (TV special)|Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]'', a [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] special carried over to the network from The WB) and select movie presentations. The network's Saturday morning E/I block, [[One Magnificent Morning]], is also broadcast in HD, with the final SD program, the two-season daytime talk show ''[[The Robert Irvine Show]]'' converting to the format for its second to last season in September 2017 (and in turn ending American broadcast network television's standard definition age).

The network is available in HD on most of its full-power affiliates, while availability of high definition content on subchannel-only or cable-exclusive affiliates varies by market; in some of these cases, the over-the-air signal is available only in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] (a [[16:9]] widescreen feed transmitted in [[480i]] SD is presented on some over-the-air affiliates to meet minimum requirements for presentation), with the station offering an exclusive high definition feed to cable and satellite providers. Some affiliates transmit CW programming in [[720p]] HD due to technical considerations if the network is carried on a digital subchannel of a station affiliated with another major network or if a primary feed CW affiliate carries more than one subchannel. Since June 2012, The CW Plus feed is also transmitted in HD, and the network has asked those affiliates to carry it in high definition wherever possible.

With [[CBS]] beginning to use [[16:9]] framing for all of their graphics on September 24, 2018, The CW is currently the last major network that continues to use 4:3 framing for all graphics.

===CW Seed===
CW Seed (originally called CWD or the CW Digital Studio) is a production arm that provides original content created exclusively for digital platforms focused in the areas of animation, game shows, comedy and digital personalities. Included in the service is interactivity, feedback from viewers, and social engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW Launches Digital Studio, Unveils Online Projects|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cw-digital-studio-cwd-326165|author=Philiana Ng|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=May 17, 2012|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously existing as a section on The CW's main website, CW Seed was spun-off to a separate website (cwseed.com) in 2014. Original web series produced by CW Seed includes  ''Stupid Hype'', ''I Ship It'', ''How to Be a Vampire'', ''[[JoJoHead]]'', ''[[Prom Queen (web series)|Prom Queen]]'', ''[[Husbands (TV series)|Husbands]]'', and the [[Arrowverse]] series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'', ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', and ''[[Constantine: City of Demons]]''. In addition, CW Seed hosts archive programming including shows such as ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', ''[[Hellcats]]'', ''[[Forever (2014 TV series)|Forever]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.

'''''The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State''''' is a 1990 book by [[Bruce L. Benson]], in which he challenges readers' assumptions about the nature of the legal justice system.  Benson uses "economic theory to compare institutions and incentives that influence public policy and private performance in the provision of law and its enforcement".&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;[[Bruce L. Benson|Benson, Bruce]], ''The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State'', Pacific Research Institute, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson discusses many topics and does a comprehensive summary of each.  The book includes 5 Parts and 14 Chapters in all.

A '''top-level domain''' ('''TLD''') is one of the [[Domain name|domains]] at the highest level in the hierarchical [[Domain Name System]] of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="rfc1591_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1591 | title=Domain Name System Structure and Delegation | accessdate=7 February 2011 | last=Postel | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Postel | date=March 1994 | work=Request for Comments | publisher=Network Working Group|quote=This memo provides some information on the structure of the names in the Domain Name System (DNS), specifically the top-level domain names; and on the administration of domains.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top-level domain names are installed in the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the [[domain name]], that is, the last label of a [[fully qualified domain name]]. For example, in the domain name [[example.com|www.example.com]], the top-level domain is [[.com|com]]. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), which operates the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the [[DNS root zone]].

IANA currently distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ |title=Root Zone Database |publisher=Interxxx Assigned Numbers Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLD)

*[[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD)
** [[sponsored top-level domains]] (sTLD)
** [[unsponsored top-level domains]]

*[[top-level domain#Infrastructure domain|infrastructure top-level 
domain]] ([[.arpa]])

==History==
Originally, the top-level domain space was organized into three main groups: ''Countries'', ''Categories'', and ''Multiorganizations''.&lt;ref name="rfc920_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc920 | title=Domain Requirements | accessdate=7 February 2011 | author=Postel, J. |author2=Reynolds, J. | date=October 1984 | work=Request for Comments | publisher=Network Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional ''temporary'' group consisted of only the initial DNS domain, [[.arpa|arpa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc921 | title=Domain Name System Implementation Schedule - Revised | accessdate=7 February 2011 | author=Postel, J. | date=October 1984 | work=Request for Comments | publisher=Network Working Group | quote=This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain Style Naming System in the Internet. This memo is an update of RFC-881, and RFC-897. This is an official policy statement of the    IAB and the DARPA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was intended for transitional purposes toward the stabilization of the domain name system.

==Types==
As of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ |title=IANA root zone database |website=Iana.org |publisher=[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[#Infrastructure domain|infrastructure top-level domain]] (ARPA): This group consists of one domain, the [[.arpa|Address and Routing Parameter Area]]. It is managed by IANA on behalf of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] for various purposes specified in the [[Request for Comments]] publications.
*[[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters
* restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD): These domains are managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.
*[[sponsored top-level domain]]s (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the TLD. Use is based on community theme concepts; these domains are managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.
*[[Country code top-level domain|country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLD): Two-letter domains established for [[country|countries]] or [[List of dependent territories|territories]]. With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its two-letter [[ISO 3166]] code.
**[[internationalized country code top-level domain]]s (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Hebrew,  or Chinese).
*[[.test|test top-level domains]] (tTLD): These domains were installed under [[.test]] for testing purposes in the IDN development process; these domains are not present in the root zone.

Countries are designated in the Domain Name System by their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|two-letter ISO country code]];&lt;ref&gt;''Codes for the Representation of Names of Countries'', ISO-3166, International Organization for Standardization. (May 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; there are exceptions, however (e.g., [[.uk]]). This group of domains is therefore commonly known as [[country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLD). Since 2009, countries with non–Latin-based scripts may apply for [[internationalized country code top-level domain]] names, which are displayed in end-user applications in their language-native script or alphabet, but use a [[Punycode]]-translated ASCII domain name in the Domain Name System.

[[Generic top-level domain]]s (formerly Categories) initially consisted of [[.gov|gov]], [[.edu|edu]], [[.com|com]], [[.mil|mil]], [[.org|org]], and [[.net|net]].  More generic TLDs have been added, such as [[.info|info]].

The authoritative [[List of Internet top-level domains|list of currently existing TLDs]] in the root zone is published at the IANA website at [https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/].

==Internationalized country code TLDs==
An [[internationalized country code top-level domain]] (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end user application, such as a [[web browser]], in its language-native script or [[alphabet]], such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], or a non-alphabetic [[writing system]], such as [[Chinese character]]s. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the [[internationalized domain name]] (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.

ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ICANN Bringing the Languages of the World to the Global Internet|url=https://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-30oct09-en.htm|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Infrastructure domain==
The domain [[.arpa|arpa]] was the first Internet top-level domain. It was intended to be used only temporarily, aiding in the transition of traditional ARPANET host names to the domain name system. However, after it had been used for [[reverse DNS lookup]], it was found impractical to retire it, and is used today exclusively for Internet infrastructure purposes such as in-addr.arpa for [[IPv4]] and ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse DNS resolution, uri.arpa and urn.arpa for the [[Dynamic Delegation Discovery System]], and e164.arpa for [[telephone number mapping]] based on [[NAPTR record|NAPTR DNS records]]. For historical reasons, [[.arpa|arpa]] is sometimes considered to be a generic top-level domain.

==Reserved domains==
RFC 6761 reserves the following four top-level domain names to avoid confusion and conflict.&lt;ref name="rfc"&gt;RFC 6761, ''Special-Use Domain Names'', S. Cheshire, M. Krochmal, The Internet Society (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Any such reserved usage of those TLDs should not occur in production networks that utilize the global domain name system:
*[[.example|example]]: reserved for use in examples
*[[.invalid|invalid]]: reserved for use in obviously invalid domain names
*[[.localhost|localhost]]: reserved to avoid conflict with the traditional use of [[localhost]] as a hostname
*[[.test|test]]: reserved for use in tests
RFC 6762 reserves the use of [[.local]] for link-local host names that can be resolved via the [[Multicast DNS]] name resolution protocol.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 6762, ''Multicast DNS'', S. Cheshire, M. Krochmal, The Internet Society (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 7686 reserves the use of [[.onion]] for the self-authenticating names of [[Tor_(anonymity_network)|Tor]] [[Tor_(anonymity_network)#Hidden_services|hidden services]]. These names can only be resolved by a Tor client because of the use of [[onion routing]] to protect the anonymity of users.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 7686, ''The ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name'', J. Appelbaum, A. Muffett, The Internet Society (October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical domains==
In the late 1980s, [[InterNIC]] created the [[.nato|nato]] domain  for use by [[NATO]]. NATO considered none of the then existing TLDs as adequately reflecting their status as an [[international organization]]. Soon after this addition, however, InterNIC also created the [[.int|int]] TLD for the use by international organizations in general, and persuaded NATO to use the second level domain ''nato.int'' instead. The ''nato'' TLD, no longer used, was finally removed in July 1996.

Other historical TLDs are [[.cs|cs]] for [[Czechoslovakia]] (now using [[.cz|cz]] for [[Czech Republic]] and [[.sk|sk]] for [[Slovak Republic]]), [[.dd|dd]] for [[East Germany]] (using [[.de|de]] after [[reunification of Germany]]), [[.yu|yu]] for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] (now using [[.ba|ba]] for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[.hr|hr]] for [[Croatia]], [[.me|me]] for [[Montenegro]], [[.mk|mk]] for [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[.rs|rs]] for [[Serbia]] and [[.si|si]] for [[Slovenia]]), and [[.zr|zr]] for [[Zaire]] (now [[.cd|cd]] for [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). In contrast to these, the TLD [[.su|su]] has remained active despite the demise of the [[Soviet Union]] that it represents. Under the chairmanship of [[Nigel Roberts]], [[ICANN]]'s [[ccNSO]] is working on a policy for retirement of [[ccTLD]]s that have been removed from [[ISO-3166]].

==Proposed domains==
{{further|Proposed top-level domain}}
Around late 2000, when [[ICANN]] discussed and finally introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internic.net/faqs/new-tlds.html |title=InterNIC FAQs on New Top-Level Domains |publisher=Internic.net |date=2002-09-25 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[.aero|aero]], [[.biz|biz]], [[.coop|coop]], [[.info|info]], [[.museum|museum]], [[.name|name]], and [[.pro|pro]] TLDs, site owners argued that a similar TLD should be made available for adult and pornographic websites to settle the dispute of obscene content on the Internet and the responsibility of US service providers under the US [[Communications Decency Act]] of 1996.  Several options were proposed including [[.xxx|xxx]], ''sex'' and ''adult''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3675 RFC 3675:] .sex Considered Dangerous&lt;/ref&gt;  The .xxx domain went live in 2011.

An older proposal consisted of seven new gTLDs: arts, firm, [[.info|info]], nom, rec, [[.shop|shop]], and [[.web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtld-mou.org/docs/faq.html#2.1 (historical) gTLD MoU] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613083133/http://www.gtld-mou.org/docs/faq.html#2.1 |date=13 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[.biz|biz]], [[.info|info]], [[.museum|museum]], and [[.name|name]] covered most of these old proposals.

During the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in 2008, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a ''"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://par.icann.org/|title=32nd International Public ICANN Meeting|date=22 June 2008|publisher=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm|title=New gTLD Program|accessdate=15 June 2009|publisher=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.circleid.com/posts/86269_icann_approves_overhaul_top_level_domains/ ICANN Board Approves Sweeping Overhaul of Top-level Domains], CircleID, 26 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 June 2012, [[ICANN]] announced nearly 2,000 applications for top-level domains, which began installation throughout 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top 10 Proposed New Top Level Domains So Far|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/257430/the_top_10_proposed_new_top_level_domains_so_far.html|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en |title=Reveal Day 13 June 2012 – New gTLD Applied-For Strings |publisher=Newgtlds.icann.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615092059/https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en |archivedate=15 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donuts Inc.]] invested $57 million in more than 300 applications&lt;ref name=Donuts&gt;{{cite web|title=Donuts full application list|url=http://donuts.co/news/files/donuts_tld_application_list.pdf|publisher=Donuts Inc.|accessdate=18 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061707/http://donuts.co/news/files/donuts_tld_application_list.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT81713&gt;{{cite news|title=When You Can’t Tell Web Suffixes Without a Scorecard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/technology/when-you-cant-tell-web-suffixes-without-a-scorecard.html|accessdate=18 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 August 2013|author=Natasha Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Famous Four Media]] applied for 61 new domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://domaintyper.com/new-gTLD/applicant/Famous-Four-Media|title=List of 61 new strings applied for Famous Four Media|publisher=domaintyper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven – ''bike'', ''clothing'', ''guru'', ''holdings'', ''plumbing'', ''singles'', and ''ventures'' – were released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/will-new-top-level-domains-change-use-web/#ixzz3MlC65c6x|title=What the new top-level domains from ICANN mean for you - Digital Trends|date=5 February 2014|work=Digital Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative DNS roots==
{{further|Alternative DNS root}}
ICANN's slow progress in creating new [[generic top-level domain]]s, and the high application costs associated with TLDs, contributed to the creation of alternate DNS roots with different sets of top-level domains. Such domains may be accessed by configuration of a computer with alternate or additional (forwarder) DNS servers or plugin modules for web browsers. Browser plugins detect alternate root domain requests and access an alternate domain name server for such requests.

==Pseudo-domains==
{{Main | Pseudo-top-level domain}}

Several networks, such as [[BITNET]], [[CSNET]], [[UUCP]], existed that were in widespread use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and exchanged mail with the Internet via special email gateways. For relaying purposes on the gateways, messages associated with these networks were labeled with suffixes such as [[.bitnet|bitnet]], [[.oz|oz]], [[.csnet|csnet]], or [[.uucp|uucp]], but these domains did not exist as top-level domains in the public [[Domain Name System]] of the Internet.

Most of these networks have long since ceased to exist, and although UUCP still gets significant use in parts of the world where Internet infrastructure has not yet become well established, it subsequently transitioned to using Internet domain names, and pseudo-domains now largely survive as historical relics.  One notable exception is the 2007 emergence of [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFTNet]] Mail, which uses the [[.swift|swift]] pseudo-domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.swift.com/about_swift/press_room/swift_news_archive/home_page_stories_archive_2007/mail_now_available.page |title=SWIFTNet Mail now available |date=16 May 2007 |publisher=SWIFT |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] formerly used the top-level pseudo-domain [[.onion|onion]] for [[Tor hidden service]]s, which can only be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor [[onion routing]] protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users. However, the pseudo-domain became officially reserved in October 2015.   [[i2p]] provides a similar hidden pseudo-domain, .i2p.

[[British Telecom|BT]] hubs use the top-level pseudo-domain [[.home|home]] for local DNS resolution of routers, modems and gateways.

'''Victoria Legal Aid (VLA)''' is an organisation that focuses on helping and protecting the legal rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. It provides information, referral, advice and legal representation services in family, civil and criminal law within Victoria.&lt;br /&gt;
 
As a [[statutory authority]], VLA operates under the ''Legal Aid Act 1978'' and is funded by the [[Australian Government]] for matters that fall under Commonwealth law, and the [[Victorian Government|Victorian state government]]. The majority of Commonwealth law matters fall within the family law jurisdiction.

Another source of funding is from the public purpose fund, made up of interest paid on money that is collected by the Legal Services Board from solicitors' trust accounts.

VLA also administers Commonwealth and state government funding of [[Community Legal Centre]]s within Victoria. Community legal centres (CLCs) are independent community organisations that provide free advice, casework and legal education to their communities. VLA administers funding for the majority of CLCs in Victoria and the Federation of Community Legal Centres through the CLC Funding Program, ensuring that centres meet their service agreements. It also focuses on supporting the professional development of the sector through joint training initiatives.

==History==
The idea of [[legal aid]] is more than 100 years old in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;The background and chronology in this section is a summary of information found in: Legal Aid Commission of Victoria ''Legal aid in Victoria: A brief summary of the history and operations of the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria'' 4th ed. LACV 1994; Field, C &amp; Giddings, J "A history of legal aid in Victoria" in Giddings J (ed) ''Legal Aid in Victoria: at the crossroads again Fitzroy Legal Service'' 1998: 20–34; and Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, ''Inquiry into the Australian Legal Aid System: Second report (June 1997)'' 1997: 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1928 only prisoners or very poor people could apply to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] for legal aid. In 1928 the government set up the Public Solicitor's Office to make legal aid more easily available. People were eligible if they did not own property worth more than 50 pounds. As more people learnt about legal aid, demand increased. This created a backlog of cases in the Public Solicitor's Office. To provide more legal aid, the Victorian state government passed the ''Legal Aid Act 1961'' which set up the Legal Aid Committee. This committee was run by the legal profession.

In 1969, the state government passed new legislation. This Act made the Legal Aid Committee responsible for civil and minor criminal cases, and made the Public Solicitor responsible for serious criminal cases. In 1974 the [[Australian Government|Commonwealth government]] set up the Australian Legal Aid Office. This office provided legal aid for Federal law cases such as family law and bankruptcy. The Australian Legal Aid Office also helped people who the commonwealth had a special responsibility for, such as people receiving [[Social Security (Australia)|social security]] and members of the armed forces.

The Legal Aid Commission of Victoria (LACV) was set up in 1978 as an independent statutory body. The LACV took over the functions of the Australian Legal Aid Office, the Legal Aid Committee and the Public Solicitor's Office. The LACV had a wider role than the Legal Aid Committee and the Public Solicitor's Office. Its role included providing community legal education and law reform. The LACV had an 11-member board including representatives from community legal centres, welfare groups and the legal profession.

Victoria Legal Aid replaced the LACV in December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Legal Aid ''Twelfth statutory annual report 2006-7'', VLA 2007: 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
VLA has a board of directors, a managing director, three large in-house legal practice directorates, an in-house advocacy team, and legal and corporate support functions.

The board's directors are nominated by the Victorian attorney-general and appointed by the Governor-in-Council. At least one member must have experience in financial management and one must have experience in business or government operations. One of the directors is the Managing Director.  
Board members are Chairperson Bill Jaboor; managing director Bevan Warner; David Thompson, Jennifer Kanis, Robbie Campo, Betty King and Joh Kirby.
