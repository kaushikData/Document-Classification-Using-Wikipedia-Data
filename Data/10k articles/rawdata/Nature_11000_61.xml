[[Image:Curtis guide.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Page from the ''Guide'']]
'''''A guide to the arrangement of British insects''''' is a [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work of [[entomology]]. A monumental piece of work with over 10,000 insect names it was intended for the author's own use, but pressure for publication grew until it appeared in 1829. Uniquely for its time, all insect orders were included. A second was published in 1837.

Six pages of introductory matter are followed by 282 columns of insect names in two columns per page systematically arranged and followed by an index to genera. This work attributed to [[John Curtis (entomologist)|John Curtis]] was in fact co-authored by [[James Charles Dale]], [[Francis Walker (entomologist)|Francis Walker]] and [[Alexander Henry Haliday]]; Haliday and Walker writing almost the whole of the sections on Diptera and parasitic Hymenoptera. The list contains 1500 generic and 15,000 specific names. Ireland and Britain are not separated.

The full title is  '''''A guide to the arrangement of British insects being a catalogue of all the named species hitherto discovered in Great Britain and Ireland'''''. The ''Guide'' had five purposes for entomologists
*1st. It will enable them to arrange their Cabinets systematically.
*2ndly. They may mark off their own Insects so as to know instantly whether they have a species or not, by which means
their desiderata will be shown ; and this the Author is persuaded will enable Students to enrich their Cabinets by mutual
exchanges to an extent which could not be accomplished by any other means.
*3rdly. It will form Labels for Cabinets.
*4thly. It will be a systematic Index to " [[British Entomology|The British Entomology]]’’ a reference being given to every Genus already illustrated and may be easily continued by those who are desirous of completing it.
*5thly. It will be a Catalogue of the Author's Cabinet those without a * being his desiderata and of those with a J he has only foreign specimens. The names in italics denote insects which are doubtful natives.

The ''Guide'' was the subject of a celebrated quarrel between [[James Francis Stephens]] and John Curtis [[s:Quarrel between James Francis Stephens and John Curtis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1190">The '''Arkansas Champion Tree Program'''  is a listing of the largest known specimens of particular tree species in the U.S. state of [[Arkansas]]. It is updated every five years by the [[Arkansas Forestry Commission]]. The program was modeled on the [[National Register of Big Trees]], started by the [[American Forests]] organization in 1940. The goal of Arkansas's program is to record, heighten awareness of, and preserve the largest tree specimens in the state. It uses the same formula for recording tree specimens that was developed by American Forests. Former champions are removed from the list as new, larger, champions are identified and recorded. The program had a total of 130 Champion Trees listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forestry.arkansas.gov/Pages/ChampionTrees.aspx |title= Champion Trees |publisher=Arkansas Forestry Commission |accessdate= December 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earthpark''' is a proposed best-in-class educational facility with indoor rain forest and aquarium elements, and a mission of "inspiring generations to learn from the natural world."  It was previously called the '''Environmental Project'''.

Earthpark was to be located around [[Lake Red Rock (Des Moines River)|Lake Red Rock]], near the town of [[Pella, Iowa]].&lt;ref name="topten"&gt;&lt;!-- bad URL  [http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061227/NEWS01/612270305/1079] --&gt; ''Press Citizen'', "Top 10 news stories of 2006", December 27, 2006, retrieved on December 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2007, federal funding from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] for the Pella location was rescinded. Proposals from a variety of potential hosts, some outside of Iowa are being considered.

== Location ==

Talks between Earthpark and the city of [[Coralville, Iowa]], the original planned location of Earthpark, ended in 2006. The project then found a new home in [[Pella, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/NEWS01/809020329/1079 "Can this vision become reality?"], ''Press-Citizen'', September 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but that did not become a reality.  A similar project exists in [[Cornwall, England]], called [[Eden Project|The Eden Project]].

== Size and scope ==
The total project cost for Earthpark is estimated to be $155 million USD. The complex was planned to be {{convert|3.5|acre|m2}} in area with a 600,000 gallon aquarium and outdoor wetland and prairie exhibits.&lt;ref name="topten"/&gt;

The Earthpark project was expected to employ 150 people directly and create an additional 2000 indirect jobs. The economic impact was estimated to be $130 million USD annually. The park was projected to draw 1 million visitors annually to the Pella area.&lt;ref name="topten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="towncrier"&gt;&lt;!-- bad URL [http://www.towncriernews.com/pages/news/othernewsstories/earthpark.htm] --&gt; "Pella Lands the Earthpark", ''Town Crier News'', retrieved on December 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
In August 2008, when asked if any efforts would be made to get additional federal money for the project, U.S. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] said "Not by this senator, and I don't think there will be any by other senators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 26, 2008| title=Grassley frustrated with federal response to flood |author=Stephen Schmidt |publisher=''The Gazette'' |url=http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080827/NEWS/708279946/1006/news }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Energy Market Authority''' ('''EMA''') is a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]] under the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] of [[Singapore]]. EMA's main goals are to promote [[effective competition|effective]] [[competition]] in the [[energy market]], ensure a reliable and secure [[energy supply]], and develop a dynamic energy sector in Singapore.

== Liberalization of Retail Electricity Market&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ema.gov.sg/electricity_market_liberalisation.aspx|title=EMA : Liberalisation of Retail Electricity Market|website=www.ema.gov.sg|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Since 2001, EMA has progressively opened the retail electricity market to competition to allow business consumers more options to manage their energy cost. Instead of buying from SP Group at the regulated tariff, eligible consumers can choose to buy from a retailer at a price plan that best meet their needs, or buy from the wholesale electricity market at the half-hourly wholesale electricity prices. Those who exercise this choice are termed as contestable consumers.

Currently, business consumers with an average monthly electricity consumption of at least 2,000 kWh (equivalent to a monthly electricity bill of at least $400) are eligible to become contestable. Currently, about 95,000 business accounts, making up about 80% of the total electricity demand, are eligible to exercise this choice and flexibility in their electricity purchases.

Since 1 April 2018, EMA commenced the soft launch of Open Electricity Market, where households and businesses in Jurong can choose to buy electricity from a retailer at a price plan that best meets their needs.

From 1 November 2018, the Open Electricity Market will be extended to all consumers across Singapore by zones. This initiative will provide about 1.4 million households and business accounts with more choice and flexibility when buying electricity, while being provided with the same electricity supply through the national power grid.

Consumers who wish to remain with SP Group and buy electricity at the regulated tariff can choose to do so, and no further action is needed on their part. It is not compulsory to switch to a retailer and there is no deadline for switching.

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

'''Energy storage''' is the capture of energy produced at one time for use at a later time. 
A device that stores energy is generally called an [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulator]] or [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. 
Energy comes in multiple forms including radiation, [[chemical energy|chemical]], [[gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential]], [[Electric potential energy|electrical potential]], electricity, elevated temperature, [[latent heat]] and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]].
Energy storage involves converting energy from forms that are difficult to store to more conveniently or economically storable forms.

Some technologies provide short-term energy storage, while others can endure for much longer.
Bulk energy storage is currently dominated by hydroelectric dams, both conventional as well as pumped.

Common examples of energy storage are the [[rechargeable battery]], which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone, the [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam, which stores energy in a [[reservoir]] as gravitational [[potential energy]], and [[Ice storage air conditioning|ice storage]] tanks, which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling.
[[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. 
[[Food]] (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in [[chemical]] form.

== History ==

=== Recent history ===
In the twentieth century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel. When less power was required, less fuel was burned. Concerns with air pollution, energy imports, and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power. Wind power is uncontrolled and may be generating at a time when no additional power is needed. Solar power varies with cloud cover and at best is only available during daylight hours, while demand often peaks after sunset (''see'' [[duck curve]]). Interest in storing  power from these intermittent sources grows as the [[renewable energy industry]] begins to generate a larger fraction of overall energy consumption.

[[Off-the-grid|Off grid electrical]] use was a niche market in the twentieth century, but in the twenty first century it has expanded. Portable devices are in use all over the world. Solar panels are now a common sight in the rural settings worldwide. Access to electricity is now a question of economics, not location. Powering transportation without burning fuel, however, remains in development.

=== Mechanical storage ===
Energy can be stored in water pumped to a higher elevation using [[pumped storage]] methods or by moving solid matter to higher locations ([[gravity battery|gravity batteries]]). 
Other commercial mechanical methods include [[Compressed-air energy storage|compressing air]] and [[Flywheel energy storage|flywheels]] that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks.

==== Hydroelectricity ====
{{Main|Hydroelectricity}}
[[Hydroelectric dam]]s with reservoirs can be operated to provide electricity at times of peak demand. 
Water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high. 
The net effect is similar to pumped storage, but without the pumping loss.

While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources. 
In this mode, dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage, because only the timing of its generation changes. 
Hydroelectric turbines have a start-up time on the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert A|last=Huggins|title=Energy Storage|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Nn5y9gQeIlwC|page=60}}|date=September 1, 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pumped-storage ====
[[File:Adam Beck Complex.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations|Sir Adam Beck Generating Complex]] at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls, Canada]], which includes a large [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage hydroelectricity reservoir]] to provide an extra 174 MW of electricity during periods of peak demand.]]
{{Main|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}

Worldwide, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] (PSH) is the largest-capacity form of active [[grid energy storage]] available, and, as of March 2012, the [[Electric Power Research Institute]] (EPRI) reports that PSH accounts for more than 99% of bulk storage capacity worldwide, representing around 127,000 [[Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref name="EconomistPSH" /&gt; 
PSH [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] varies in practice between 70% and 80%,&lt;ref name="EconomistPSH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yang" /&gt; with claims of up to 87%.&lt;ref name="heco" /&gt;

At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir. 
When demand grows, water is released back into a lower reservoir (or waterway or body of water) through a [[turbine]], generating electricity. Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine (usually a [[Francis turbine]] design). 
Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies. 
Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs, while the "pump-back" approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional [[hydroelectric plant]]s that use natural stream-flow.

==== Compressed air ====
[[Image:Compressed Air Loco.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Fireless locomotive|compressed air locomotive]] used inside a mine between 1928 and 1961.]]
{{Main|Compressed air energy storage|Salt dome}}

Compressed air energy storage (CAES) uses surplus energy to compress air for subsequent electricity generation.&lt;ref name="NYT-2010.07.28"&gt;Wild, Matthew, L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/energy-environment/28storage.html Wind Drives Growing Use of Batteries], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 28, 2010, pp. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Small scale systems have long been used in such applications as propulsion of mine locomotives. 
The compressed air is stored in an  [[underground reservoir]], as a [[salt dome]].

Compressed-air energy storage (CAES) plants can bridge the gap between production volatility and load. CAES storage addresses the energy needs of consumers by effectively providing readily available energy to meet demand. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy have variable resources. As a result, the supplement of other forms of energy is necessary to meet energy demand during periods of decreased resource availability. Compressed-air energy storage plants are capable of taking in the surplus energy output of renewable energy sources during times of energy over-production. This stored energy can be used at a later time when demand for electricity increases or energy resource availability decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keles |first1=Dogan |last2=Hartel |first2=Rupert |last3=Möst |first3=Dominik |last4=Fichtner |first4=Wolf |title=Compressed-air energy storage power plant investments under uncertain electricity prices: an evaluation of compressed-air energy storage plants in liberalized energy markets |journal=The Journal of Energy Markets |date=Spring 2012 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=54 |accessdate=September 6, 2018 |ref=Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1037988494?accountid=14524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gas compressor|Compression]] of [[air]] creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. [[Thermal expansion|Expansion]] requires heat. 
If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, efficiency improves considerably.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.10.01" /&gt; A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways. Air storage can be [[adiabatic]], [[diabatic]], or [[isothermal]]. 
Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles.&lt;ref name="Auto.com-2004.03.18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freep-2004.03.18" /&gt;

{{Main|Flywheel energy storage|Flywheel storage power system}}

Flywheel energy storage (FES) works by accelerating a rotor ([[flywheel]]) to a very high speed, holding energy as [[rotational energy]]. When energy is extracted, the flywheel's rotational speed declines as a consequence of [[conservation of energy]]; adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.

Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use mechanical energy are under consideration.&lt;ref name="Torotrak"&gt;[http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf Torotrak Toroidal variable drive CVT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516084534/http://www.xtrac.com/pdfs/Torotrak_Xtrac_CVT.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }}, retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

FES systems have rotors made of high strength [[carbon-fiber]] composites, suspended by [[magnetic bearing]]s and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000&amp;nbsp;rpm in a vacuum enclosure.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Castelvecchi | first1 = Davide| title = Spinning into control: High-tech reincarnations of an ancient way of storing energy| doi = 10.1002/scin.2007.5591712010| journal = Science News| volume = 171| issue = 20| pages = 312–313| date = May 19, 2007| url = http://sciencewriter.org/flywheels-spinning-into-control/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such flywheels can reach maximum speed&amp;nbsp;("charge") in a matter of minutes. The flywheel system is connected to a combination [[electric motor]]/[[electric generator|generator]].

FES systems have relatively long lifetimes (lasting decades with little or no maintenance;&lt;ref name="ScienceNews" /&gt; full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, cycles of use),&lt;ref name="Investire"&gt;[http://www.itpower.co.uk/investire/pdfs/flywheelrep.pdf Storage Technology Report, ST6 Flywheel]

=== Thermal storage ===
[[File:Fernwärmespricher Theiss.JPG|thumb|District heating accumulation tower from Theiss near [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]] with a thermal capacity of 2 GWh]]
{{Main|Thermal energy storage|Molten salt|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}

Thermal energy storage (TES) is the temporary storage or removal of heat.

==== Sensible heat thermal energy storage ====

Sensible heat storage take advantage of [[sensible heat]] in a material to store energy.

[[Seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) allows heat or cold to be used months after it was collected from waste energy or natural sources. 
The material can be stored in contained aquifers, clusters of boreholes in geological substrates such as sand or crystalline bedrock, in lined pits filled with gravel and water, or water-filled mines.
Seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) projects often have paybacks in the four-to-six year range.&lt;ref name="Hellström" /&gt; 
An example is [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] in Canada, for which 97% of the year-round heat is provided by solar-thermal collectors on the garage roofs, with a borehole thermal energy store (BTES) being the enabling technology.&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DistrictEnergy.org-a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2012/6586 Canadian Solar Community Sets New World Record for Energy Efficiency and Innovation], Natural Resources Canada, October 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Braestrup, Denmark, [[Solar power in Denmark|the community's solar district heating system]] also utilizes STES, at a storage temperature of {{convert|65|C}}. 
A heat pump, which is run only when there is surplus wind power available on the national grid, is used to raise the temperature to {{convert|80|C|F}} for distribution. 
When surplus wind generated electricity is not available, a gas-fired boiler is used. Twenty percent of Braestrup's heat is solar.&lt;ref name="Solar District Heating" /&gt;

==== {{anchor|Latent heat thermal energy storage}} Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) ====
Latent heat thermal energy storage systems works with materials with high [[latent heat]] (heat of fusion) capacity, known as [[Phase-change material|phase change material]]s (PCMs). The main advantage of these materials is that their latent heat storage capacity is much more than sensible heat. In a specific temperature range, phase changes from solid to liquid absorbs a large amount of thermal energy for later use.

Latent-heat thermal energy storage consists of a process by which, energy in the form of heat, is either absorbed or released during the phase-change of a [[Phase-change material|phase change material]] (PCM). A PCM is a material with a high heat of fusion. A phase-change is the melting or solidifying of a material. During a phase change, a PCM has the capacity to absorb large amounts of energy due to its high heat of fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sekhara Reddy |first1=M.C. |last2=T. |first2=R.L. |last3=K. |first3=D.R |last4=Ramaiah |first4=P.V |title=Enhancement of thermal energy storage system using sensible heat and latent heat storage materials |journal=I-Manager's Journal on Mechanical Engineering |date=2015 |volume=5 |page=36 |accessdate=September 6, 2018 |ref=Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718068707?accountid=14524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrochemical ===

==== Rechargeable battery ====
[[File:Datacenter Backup Batteries.jpg|thumb|A rechargeable battery bank used as an [[uninterruptible power supply]] in a data center]]
{{main|Rechargeable battery|Battery storage power station}}

A rechargeable battery, comprises one or more [[electrochemical cell]]s. It is known as a 'secondary cell' because its [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[chemical reaction|reactions]] are electrically reversible. Rechargeable batteries come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from [[Button cell#Rechargeable variants|button cell]]s to megawatt grid systems.

Rechargeable batteries have lower total cost of use and environmental impact than non-rechargeable (disposable) batteries. Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same form factors as disposables. Rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times.

Common rechargeable battery chemistries include:
* [[Lead–acid battery]]: Lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products. A single cell produces about 2V when charged. In the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the [[lead sulfate]] positive electrode are immersed in a dilute [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) [[electrolyte]]. In the discharge process electrons are pushed out of the cell as lead sulfate is formed at the negative electrode while the electrolyte is reduced to water.

::*Lead-acid battery technology has been developed extensively. Upkeep requires minimal labor and its cost is low. The battery's available energy capacity is subject to a quick discharge resulting in a low life span and low energy density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yao |first1=L. |last2=Yang |first2=B. |last3=Cui |first3=H. |last4=Zhuang |first4=J. |last5=Ye |first5=J. |last6=Xue |first6=J. |title=Challenges and progresses of energy storage technology and its application in power systems |journal=Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy |date=2016 |pages=520–521 |doi=10.1007/s40565-016-0248-x |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Nickel–cadmium battery]] (NiCd): Uses [[nickel oxide hydroxide]] and metallic [[cadmium]] as [[electrode]]s. Cadmium is a toxic element, and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004. Nickel–cadmium batteries have been almost completely replaced by nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.
* [[Nickel–metal hydride battery]] (NiMH): First commercial types were available in 1989.&lt;ref name="Aifantis et al" /&gt; These are now a common consumer and industrial type. The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing [[alloy]] for the negative [[electrode]] instead of [[cadmium]].
* [[Lithium-ion battery]]: The choice in many consumer electronics and have one of the best [[specific energy|energy-to-mass ratios]] and a very slow [[self-discharge]] when not in use.
* [[Lithium-ion polymer battery]]: These batteries are light in weight and can be made in any shape desired.

===== Flow battery =====
{{Main|Flow battery|Vanadium redox battery}}

A [[flow battery]] operates by passing a solution over a membrane where ions are exchanged to charge/discharge the cell. 
[[Electrode potential#Potential difference of a cell assembled of two electrodes|Cell voltage]] is chemically determined by the [[Nernst equation]] and ranges, in practical applications, from 1.0 to 2.2 V. Its storage capacity is a function of the volume of the tanks holding the solution.

A flow battery is technically akin both to a [[fuel cell]] and an [[Electrochemical cell|electrochemical accumulator cell]]. 
Commercial applications are for long half-cycle storage such as backup grid power.

==== Supercapacitor ====
[[File:Expo 2010 Electric Bus.jpg|thumb|One of a fleet of [[Capa vehicle|electric capabuses]] powered by supercapacitors, at a quick-charge station-bus stop, in service during [[Expo 2010|Expo 2010 Shanghai China]]. Charging rails can be seen suspended over the bus.]]
{{main|Supercapacitor}}

[[Supercapacitor]]s, also called electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors, are generic terms for a family of [[electrochemical capacitor]]s&lt;ref name="Conway" /&gt; that do not have conventional solid [[dielectric]]s. [[Capacitance]] is determined by two storage principles, double-layer capacitance and [[pseudocapacitance]].&lt;ref name="Halper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frackowiak1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volfkovich" /&gt;

Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. 
They store the most energy per unit volume or mass ([[energy density]]) among capacitors. They support up to 10,000 [[farads]]/1.2 volt,&lt;ref name="Elton" /&gt; up to 10,000 times that of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s, but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time ([[power density]]).&lt;ref name="Conway" /&gt;

While supercapacitors have specific energy and energy densities that are approximately 10% of batteries, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater. This results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles. Additionally, they will tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than batteries.

Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications, including:
* Low supply current for memory backup in [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM)
* Power for cars, buses, trains, cranes and elevators, including energy recovery from braking, short-term energy storage and burst-mode power delivery

==== Power to gas ====
{{Main|Power to gas}}

[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity]] into a gaseous [[fuel]] such as [[hydrogen]] or [[methane]]. The three commercial methods use electricity to reduce [[water splitting|water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] by means of [[electrolysis]].

In the first method, hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry. The second method is to combine the hydrogen with [[carbon dioxide]] to produce [[methane]] using a [[methanation]] reaction such as the [[Sabatier reaction]], or biological methanation, resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8%. The methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid. The third method uses the output gas of a [[wood gas generator]] or a [[biogas]] plant, after the [[biogas upgrader]] is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer, to upgrade the quality of the biogas.

===== Hydrogen =====
{{Main|Hydrogen storage}}
The element [[hydrogen]] can be a form of stored energy. Hydrogen can produce electricity via a [[hydrogen fuel cell]].

At penetrations below 20% of the grid demand, renewables do not severely change the economics; but beyond about 20% of the total demand,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013|reason=Couldn't find statement in source.}} external storage becomes important.&lt;ref name="Storage" /&gt; If these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen, they can be freely expanded. A 5-year community-based pilot program using [[wind turbine]]s and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of [[Ramea, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="NaturalResourcesCan" /&gt; A similar project began in 2004 on [[Utsira]], a small Norwegian island.

Energy losses involved in the [[hydrogen storage]] cycle come from the [[electrolysis of water]], liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity.&lt;ref name="PhysOrg.com-news-85074285" /&gt;

About 50&amp;nbsp;kW·h (180 MJ) of solar energy is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen, so the cost of the electricity is crucial. At $0.03/kWh, a common off-peak high-voltage line rate in the [[United States]], hydrogen costs $1.50 a kilogram for the electricity, equivalent to $1.50/gallon for [[gasoline]]. Other costs include the [[High pressure electrolysis|electrolyzer plant]], [[hydrogen compressor]]s or [[Liquid hydrogen|liquefaction]], storage and [[Hydrogen infrastructure|transportation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Hydrogen can also be produced from [[aluminum]] and [[water]] by stripping aluminum's naturally-occurring [[aluminum oxide]] barrier and introducing it to water. This method is beneficial because recycled aluminum cans can be used as fuel to generate hydrogen, however systems to harness this option have not been commercially developed and are much more complex than electrolysis systems.&lt;ref name="Aluminum-Hydrogen" /&gt; Common methods to strip the oxide layer include caustic catalysts such as [[sodium hydroxide]] and alloys with [[gallium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and other metals.&lt;ref name="Woodall" /&gt;

[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is the practice of [[hydrogen storage]] in underground [[cave]]rns, [[salt dome]]s and depleted oil and gas fields.&lt;ref name="Royal Society of Chemistry-a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyunder" /&gt; Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] for many years without any difficulties.&lt;ref name="Hyweb.de" /&gt; The European Hyunder project indicated in 2013 that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require 85 caverns.&lt;ref name="Hyunder.eu-b" /&gt;

===== Methane =====
{{Main|Substitute natural gas}}

[[Methane]] is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Methane is more easily stored and transported than hydrogen. Storage and combustion infrastructure (pipelines, [[gas holder|gasometers]], power plants) are mature.

Synthetic natural gas ([[syngas]] or SNG) can be created in a multi-step process, starting with hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is then reacted with [[carbon dioxide]] in a [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier process]], producing methane and water. Methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity. The resulting water is recycled, reducing the need for water. In the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant, eliminating [[nitrogen oxide]]s.

Methane combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water. The carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the Sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis. Methane production, storage and combustion recycles the reaction products.

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector, not a cost as in [[carbon capture and storage]].

==== Power to liquid ====
Power to liquid is similar to power to gas, however the hydrogen produced by electrolysis from wind and solar electricity isn't converted into gases such as methane but into liquids such as [[methanol]]. Methanol is easier to handle than gases, and requires fewer safety precautions than hydrogen. It can be used for [[transportation]], including [[aircraft]], but also for industrial purposes or in the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Varone, Michele Ferrari: ''Power to liquid and power to gas: An option for the German Energiewende''. [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] 45, (2015), 207–218, {{DOI|10.1016/j.rser.2015.01.049}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biofuels ====
{{Main|Biofuel}}

Various [[biofuels]] such as [[biodiesel]], [[straight vegetable oil|vegetable oil]], [[alcohol fuel]]s, or [[biomass]] can replace [[fossil fuels]]. Various chemical processes can convert the carbon and hydrogen in coal, natural gas, plant and animal [[biomass]] and organic wastes into short hydrocarbons suitable as replacements for existing hydrocarbon fuels. Examples are [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Fischer–Tropsch]] diesel, [[methanol]], [[dimethyl ether]] and [[syngas]]. This diesel source was used extensively in [[World War II]] in Germany, which faced limited access to crude oil supplies. South Africa produces most of the country's diesel from coal for similar reasons.&lt;ref name="EPA-2002.a" /&gt; A long term oil price above US$35/bbl may make such large scale synthetic liquid fuels economical.

===== Aluminum =====

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an energy storage method by a number of researchers. The volume [[electrochemical equivalent]] of aluminum (8.04 Ah/cm3) is nearly a factor of four greater than lithium (2.06 Ah/cm3).&lt;ref name="Aluminum-density" /&gt; Energy can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water to generate [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper" /&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall" /&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.&lt;ref name="Woodall" /&gt; If the Hall-Heroult Process is run using solar or wind power, aluminum could be used to store the energy produced at higher efficiency than direct solar electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Aluminum Solar Storage" /&gt;

==== Boron, silicon, and zinc ====

[[Boron]],&lt;ref name="Cowan" /&gt; [[silicon]],&lt;ref name="Auner" /&gt; and [[zinc]]&lt;ref name="Engineer-Poet" /&gt; have been proposed as energy storage solutions.

==== Other chemical ====
The organic compound ''[[norbornadiene]]''&amp;nbsp;converts to ''[[quadricyclane]]'' upon exposure to light, storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds. A working system has been developed in Sweden as a  molecular solar thermal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170320085445.htm|title=Liquid storage of solar energy: More effective than ever before|website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical methods ===

==== Capacitor ====
{{main|capacitor}}
[[File:Mylar-film oil-filled low-inductance capacitor 6.5 MFD @ 5000 VDC.jpg|thumb|175px|right|This mylar-film, oil-filled capacitor has very low inductance and low resistance, to provide the high-power (70 megawatts) and the very high speed (1.2 microsecond) discharges needed to operate a [[dye laser]].]]

A [[capacitor]] (originally known as a 'condenser') is a [[passivity (engineering)|passive]] [[terminal (electronics)|two-terminal]] [[electronic component|electrical component]] used to store [[energy]] [[electrostatic]]ally. Practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two [[electrical conductor]]s (plates) separated by a [[dielectric]] (i.e., [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]). A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit, so it can be used like a temporary [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], or like other types of [[rechargeable energy storage system]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change. (This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.) Conventional capacitors provide less than 360 [[joule]]s per kilogram, while a conventional [[alkaline battery]] has a density of 590 kJ/kg.

Capacitors store [[energy]] in an [[electric field|electrostatic field]] between their plates. Given a [[potential difference]] across the conductors (e.g., when a capacitor is attached across a battery), an [[electric field]] develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge (+Q) to collect on one plate and negative charge (-Q) to collect on the other plate. If a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time, no current can flow through the capacitor. However, if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a [[displacement current]] can flow. Besides capacitor plates, charge can also be stored in a dielectric layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bezryadin|first1=A.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Large energy storage efficiency of the dielectric layer of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Nanotechnology|date=2017|volume=28|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa935c|bibcode=2017Nanot..28W5401B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area. In practice, the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of [[leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] and has an electric field strength limit, known as the [[breakdown voltage]]. However, the effect of recovery of a dielectric  after a high-voltage breakdown holds promise for a new generation of self-healing capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belkin|first1=Andrey|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Recovery of Alumina Nanocapacitors after High Voltage Breakdown|journal=Sci.

==== Superconducting magnetics ====
{{main|Superconducting magnetic energy storage}}

Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in a [[magnetic field]] created by the flow of [[direct current]] in a [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] coil that has been cooled to a temperature below its [[Superconductivity#Superconducting phase transition|superconducting critical temperature]]. A typical SMES system includes a superconducting [[inductor|coil]], power conditioning system and refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current does not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Hassenzahl" /&gt;

The stored energy can be released to the network by discharging the coil. The associated inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses the least amount of [[electricity]] in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems offer round-trip efficiency greater than 95%.&lt;ref name="Cheung-Cheung-De Silvia-Juvonen-Singh-Woo" /&gt;

Due to the energy requirements of refrigeration and the cost of [[superconducting wire]], SMES is used for short duration storage such as improving [[power quality]]. It also has applications in grid balancing.&lt;ref name="Hassenzahl" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Mills ===

The classic application before the [[industrial revolution]] was the control of waterways to drive water mills for processing grain or powering machinery. Complex systems of [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s were constructed to store and release water (and the [[potential energy]] it contained) when required.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Home energy storage ===
{{Main|Home Energy Storage}}

Home energy storage is expected to become increasingly common given the growing importance of distributed generation of renewable energies (especially photovoltaics) and the important share of energy consumption in buildings.&lt;ref name="Silva-Hendrick" /&gt; To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40%
in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed.&lt;ref name="Silva-Hendrick" /&gt; Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy, generally to hold surplus energy from home solar/wind generation.

Storing wind or solar energy using [[thermal energy storage]] though less flexible, is considerably less expensive than batteries. A simple 52-gallon electric water heater can store roughly 12 kWh of energy for supplementing hot water or space heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/need-high-power-home-battery-use-your-water-heater|title=Your Water Heater Can Become A High-Power Home Battery|author=|date=|website=popsci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For purely financial purposes in areas where [[net metering]] is available, home generated electricity may be sold to the grid through a [[grid-tie inverter]] without the use of batteries for storage.

[[File:12-05-08 AS1.JPG|thumb|right| The 150 MW [[Andasol solar power station]] is a commercial [[parabolic trough]] [[solar thermal]] power plant, located in [[Renewable energy in Spain|Spain]]. The Andasol plant uses [[Thermal energy storage#Molten salt technology|tanks of molten salt]] to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn't shining.&lt;ref name="Cartlidge" /&gt;]]

The largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams. A large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons. A very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years. While a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources, it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind. If wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity, then some additional source of energy will be needed.

Many [[renewable energy]] sources (notably solar and wind) produce [[variable renewable energy|variable power]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2010.07.28" /&gt; Storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes. Electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms.&lt;ref name="Ingebretsen-Johansen" /&gt;

The main method of electrical grid storage is [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]. Areas of the world such as Norway, Wales, Japan and the US have used elevated geographic features for [[reservoir]]s, using electrically powered pumps to fill them. When needed, the water passes through generators and converts the gravitational potential of the falling water into electricity.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2010.07.28" /&gt; Pumped storage in Norway, which gets almost all its electricity from hydro, has currently a capacity of 1.4 GW but since the total installed capacity is nearly 32 GW and 75% of that is regulable, it can be expanded significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hydropower.org/country-profiles/norway "Norway statistics - International Hydropower Association"]. Retrieved on September 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of storage that produce electricity include pumped-storage [[hydroelectric dams]], [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] including [[Molten salt heat storage|molten salts]] which can efficiently store and release very large quantities of heat energy,&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2014.04.21" /&gt; and [[compressed air energy storage]], [[Flywheel energy storage|flywheels]], [[cryogenic energy storage|cryogenic systems]] and [[superconducting magnetic energy storage|superconducting magnetic coils]].

Surplus power can also be converted into [[power to gas|methane]] ([[sabatier process]]) with stockage in the natural gas network.&lt;ref name="Schmid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NégaWatt" /&gt;

In 2011, the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] in [[Northwestern United States]] created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds. Under central control, home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in [[Storage heater|special space heaters]] to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified [[Storage water heater|hot water heater tanks]]. After charging, the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed. The experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down, or in the case of a nuclear power plant, reduced to its lowest possible operating level, leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2011.11.05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2010.07.07" /&gt;

Another advanced method used at the former [[the Solar Project|Solar Two project]] in the United States and the [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant|Solar Tres Power Tower]] in Spain uses [[Thermal energy storage#Molten salt technology|molten salt]] to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power. The system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun. Insulated tanks store the solution. Electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to [[turbine]]s.

Since the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and [[Utility frequency|frequency regulation]] capabilities.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2010.07.28" /&gt;

In [[vehicle-to-grid]] storage, electric vehicles that are plugged into the energy grid can deliver stored electrical energy from their batteries into the grid when needed.

=== Air conditioning ===
{{Main|Ice storage air conditioning}}

[[Thermal energy storage]] (TES) can be used for [[air conditioning]].&lt;ref name="Calmac" /&gt; It is most widely used for cooling single large buildings and/or groups of smaller buildings. Commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads. In 2009, thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries. It works by creating ice at night and using the ice to for cooling during the hotter daytime periods.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2014.04.21" /&gt;

The most popular technique is [[Thermal energy storage#Air conditioning|ice storage]], which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chiller's daytime output.

A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water. Water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water. Such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day. Capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50% of the size needed for a conventional, no-storage design. Storage sufficient to store half a day's available heat is usually adequate.

A full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours. Capital costs are higher, as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system.

This ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower.&lt;ref name="DistributedEnergy.com" /&gt; Off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs. The U.S. [[Green Building Council]] has developed the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings. Off-peak cooling may help toward LEED Certification.&lt;ref&gt;Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, Fundamentals of HVAC/R, Page 1263&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling. An example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night.

Latent heat can also be stored in technical [[Phase-change material|phase change materials]] (PCMs). These can be encapsulated in wall and ceiling panels, to moderate room temperatures.

=== Transport ===
Liquid [[hydrocarbon fuel]]s are the most commonly used forms of energy storage for use in [[transportation]], followed by a growing use of [[Battery Electric Vehicles]] and [[Hybrid Electric Vehicle]]s. Other energy carriers such as [[hydrogen]] can be used to avoid producing greenhouse gases.

Public transport systems like trams and trolleybuses require electricity, but due to their variability in movement, a steady supply of electricity via renewable energy is challenging. [[Photovoltaic]] systems installed on the roofs of buildings can be used to power public transportation systems during periods in which there is increased demand for electricity and access to other forms of energy are not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bartłomiejczyk |first1=Mikołaj |title=Potential Application of Solar Energy Systems for Electrified Urban Transportation Systems |journal=Energies |date=2018 |volume=11 |issue=4 |page=1 |doi=10.3390/en11040954 |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronics ===
Capacitors are widely used in [[electronic circuit]]s for blocking [[direct current]] while allowing [[alternating current]] to pass. In [[analog filter]] networks, they smooth the output of [[power supply|power supplies]]. In [[LC circuit|resonant circuit]]s they tune [[radio]]s to particular [[frequency|frequencies]]. In [[electric power transmission]] systems they stabilize voltage and power flow.&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt;

== Storage capacity ==
'''Storage capacity''' is the amount of energy extracted from a [[power plant]] energy storage system; usually measured in [[joule]]s or [[Kilowatt hour|kilowatt-hours]] and their multiples, it may be given in number of hours of electricity production at power plant [[nameplate capacity]]; when storage is of primary type (i.e., thermal or pumped-water), output is sourced only with the power plant embedded storage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Economics{{anchor|Economic_and_technical_evaluations}} ==
The economics of Energy Storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested, and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of Energy Storage. Therefore, not every Energy Storage is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several MWh, and the optimal size of the Energy Storage is market and location dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Palerma|first2=Emanuele|last3=Mancini|first3=Mauro|date=April 1, 2015|title=Assessing the economics of large Energy Storage Plants with an optimisation methodology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544215000742|journal=Energy|volume=83|pages=15–28|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2015.01.050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, ESS are affected by several risks, e.g.:&lt;ref name="Locatelli 114–131"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Invernizzi|first2=Diletta Colette|last3=Mancini|first3=Mauro|date=June 1, 2016|title=Investment and risk appraisal in energy storage systems: A real options approach|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544216303425|journal=Energy|volume=104|pages=114–131|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2016.03.098 |archiveurl=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/97158/ | archivedate=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) techno-economic risks, which are related to the specific technology;

2) Market risks, which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system;

3) Regulation and policy risks.

Therefore, traditional techniques based on deterministic [[Discounted cash flow|Discounted Cash Flow]] (DCF) for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investor’s flexibility to deal with them. Hence, the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the Real Option Analysis (ROA), which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts.&lt;ref name="Locatelli 114–131"/&gt;

The economic valuation of large-scale applications (including pumped hydro storage and compressed air) considers benefits including: wind curtailment avoidance, grid congestion avoidance, price arbitrage and carbon free energy delivery.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2014.04.21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Loisel et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.01.03" /&gt; In one technical assessment by the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Centre]], economic goals could be met with batteries if energy storage were achievable at a capital cost of $30 to $50 per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2014.04.21" /&gt;

A metric for calculating the energy efficiency of storage systems is Energy Storage On Energy Invested (ESOI) which is the useful energy used to make the storage system divided into the lifetime energy storage. For lithium ion batteries this is around 10, and for lead acid batteries it is about 2. Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI, such as 210.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/march/store-electric-grid-030513.html|title=Stanford scientists calculate the carbon footprint of grid-scale battery technologies|work=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Germany ===
In 2013, the German Federal government has allocated €200M (approximately US$270M) for advanced research, as well as providing a further €50M to subsidize battery storage for use with residential rooftop solar panels, according to a representative of the German Energy Storage Association.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2013.10.13" /&gt;

[[Siemens|Siemens AG]] commissioned a production-research plant to open in 2015 at the ''Zentrum für Sonnenenergie und Wasserstoff (ZSW,'' the German Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research in the [[Baden-Württemberg|State of Baden-Württemberg]]), a university/industry collaboration in Stuttgart, Ulm and Widderstall, staffed by approximately 350 scientists, researchers, engineers, and technicians. The plant develops new near-production manufacturing materials and processes (NPMM&amp;P) using a computerized [[SCADA|Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]] (SCADA) system. Its goals will enable the expansion of [[rechargeable battery]] production with both increased quality and reduced manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name="Physics.org.a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZSW-BW.de" /&gt;

=== United States ===
In 2014, research and test centers opened to evaluate energy storage technologies. Among them was the Advanced Systems Test Laboratory at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin at Madison]] in [[Wisconsin|Wisconsin State]], which partnered with battery manufacturer [[Johnson Controls]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Sentinel-2014.05.05" /&gt; The laboratory was created as part of the university's newly opened [[Wisconsin Energy Institute]]. Their goals include the evaluation of state-of-the-art and next generation [[Electric vehicle battery|electric vehicle batteries]], including their use as grid supplements.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Sentinel-2014.05.05" /&gt;

The [[New York (state)|State of New York]] unveiled its New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology (NY-BEST) Test and Commercialization Center at [[Eastman Business Park]] in [[Rochester, New York]], at a cost of $23&amp;nbsp;million for its almost 1,700&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; laboratory. The center includes the Center for Future Energy Systems, a collaboration between [[Cornell University]] of [[Ithaca, New York]] and the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]]. NY-BEST tests, validates and independently certifies diverse forms of energy storage intended for commercial use.&lt;ref name="Democrat and Chronicle-2014.04.30" /&gt;

On September 27, 2017, Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico introduced Advancing Grid Storage Act (AGSA), which would devote more than $1 billion in research, technical assistance and grants to encourage energy storage in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2017/09/28/senators-want-more-than-1-billion-to-promote-energy-storage-answers/|title=Senators want more than $1 billion to promote energy storage answers|work=pv magazine USA|access-date=September 28, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glastonbury thorn''' is a form of common hawthorn, ''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'' 'Biflora'&lt;ref name=Phipps&gt;Phipps, J.B.; O’Kennon, R.J.; Lance, R.W. 2003. ''Hawthorns and medlars''. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes incorrectly called ''[[Crataegus oxyacantha]]'' var. ''praecox''), found in and around [[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]], England. Unlike ordinary hawthorn trees, it flowers twice a year (hence the name "biflora"), the first time in winter and the second time in spring. The trees in the Glastonbury area have been propagated by [[grafting]] since ancient times.&lt;ref name=Phipps/&gt; The tree is also widely called the '''holy thorn''', though this term strictly speaking refers to the original (legendary) tree.&lt;ref name="BBCHT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17589575|title=The mystery over who attacked the Holy Thorn Tree)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAHT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyabbey.com/holy_thorn.php?sid=5c503fa01c732d2027daeae6d38da1b8|title=The Holy Thorn|accessdate=2016-01-13|publisher=Glastonbury Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is associated with legends about  [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and the arrival of Christianity in Britain, and has appeared in written texts since the medieval period. A flowering sprig is sent to the British Monarch every Christmas. The original tree has been propagated several times, with one tree growing at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] and another in the churchyard of the [[Church of St John the Baptist, Glastonbury|Church of St John]]. The "original" Glastonbury thorn was cut down and burned as a relic of superstition  during the [[English Civil War]], and one planted on Wearyall Hill in 1951 to replace it had its branches cut off in 2010.

==History==
{{see also|Joseph of Arimathea}}
According to legend, [[Joseph of Arimathea]] visited Glastonbury with the [[Holy Grail]] and thrust his staff into Wearyall Hill, which then grew into the original thorn tree.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; Early writers do not connect Joseph to the arrival of Christianity in Britain, and the first literary source to place him in Britain appeared in the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/mss/laud.htm |title=Manuscripts |author=Bodleian Library}} {{cite web| url=http://cfp.english.upenn.edu/archive/Medieval/0183.html |title= MS. Laud 108 of the Bodleian|work=University of Pennsylvania Medieval archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of Joseph's presence in Glastonbury remains controversial, but the thorn is first mentioned in an early sixteenth-century metrical ''Lyfe of Joseph of Arimathea.''  The anonymous author notes that the thorn was unusual in that it flowered twice in a year, once as normal on "old wood" in spring, and once on "new wood" (the current season's matured new growth) in the winter. This flowering of the Glastonbury thorn in mild weather just past midwinter was accounted miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 5. Glastonbury Thorn |url=http://www.oxleigh.freeserve.co.uk/AR05.htm |publisher=Albion Revisteted |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013203555/http://www.oxleigh.freeserve.co.uk/AR05.htm |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the adoption of the revised [[Gregorian calendar]] in Britain in 1752, the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' reported that curious visitors went to see whether the Glastonbury thorn kept to the [[Julian calendar]] or the new one:
{{quote|text=Glastonbury.—A vast concourse of people attended the noted thorn on Christmas-day, new style; but, to their great disappointment, there was no appearance of its blowing, which made them watch it narrowly the 5th of January, the Christmas-day, old style, when it blowed as usual.&lt;br&gt;
:''Gentleman's Magazine'' January 1753 }}

The original Glastonbury thorn itself was cut down and burned as a relic of superstition by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops (or '[[Roundheads]]' by another source) during the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651).&lt;ref name="DailyMail"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bygone Somerset |last=Walters |first=Cuming |year=1897 |publisher=William Andrews |location=London |isbn= |pages=48–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal tradition===

The custom of sending a budded branch of the Glastonbury thorn to the Queen at Christmas was initiated by [[James Montague (bishop)|James Montague]], Bishop of Bath and Wells during [[James I of England|James I]]'s reign, who sent a branch to [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], King James I's consort. A spray of thorn was sent to the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] each Christmas by the Vicar and Mayor of Glastonbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9268000/9268731.stm | title=Sprig of Holy Thorn in Glastonbury is cut for the Queen  | publisher=BBC | accessdate=10 December 2010 | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thorn also featured on British [[Postage stamp]]s on the 12p and 13p [[Christmas stamp]]s in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectgbstamps.co.uk/explore/years/?year=1986 | title=British stamps for 1986 | publisher=Collect GB Stamps | accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Glastonbury Myth &amp; Archeology |last=Rahtz |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Rahtz |author2=Lorna Watts |year=2003 |publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud |isbn=978-0-7524-2548-1 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Deliberate damage===

The Glastonbury thorn was once again attacked and its branches cut off, in this case the 1951 specimen that was growing on Wearyall Hill on the southwestern side of the town, on 9 December 2010.&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1337159/Glastonburys-2000-year-old-Holy-Thorn-Tree-hacked-vandals.html |title=Vandals have hacked at the heart of Christianity: 2000-year-old Holy Thorn Tree of Glastonbury is cut down|date=9 December 2010|work=Daily Mail Online|accessdate=9 December 2010 | first= Luke | last= Salkeld |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-11957440 | title=Historic Holy Thorn tree cut down in Glastonbury | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=10 December 2010 | date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/vandals-destroy-sacred-thorn-tree-2155627.html | title=Vandals destroy sacred thorn tree | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=10 December 2010 | location=London | first1=Emma | last1=Hallett | date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/glastonbury-mourns-felling-thorn-tree | title=Glastonbury Thorn chopped down as town rages over attack on famous tree | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=10 December 2010 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy | date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2011, it was reported that a new shoot had appeared on the damaged tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-12886489 | publisher= BBC News | date= 28 March 2011 | accessdate= 29 March 2011 | title= Vandalised Holy Thorn in Glastonbury has a new shoot}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as these new shoots came up they would suspiciously disappear a few days or weeks later.&lt;ref name="centre"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://glastonbury-pilgrim.co.uk/holy-thorn-news.php |title=Glastonbury Thorn: News |publisher=Glastonbury Pilgrim Reception Centre |accessdate=29 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723135241/http://glastonbury-pilgrim.co.uk/holy-thorn-news.php |archive-date=23 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 replanting and further damage===
On 1 April 2012 a sapling grafted from a descendant of the pre-1951 specimen was planted by the landowners working with Glastonbury Conservation Society and consecrated, but it was snapped in half and irreparably damaged 16 days later.&lt;ref name="centre"/&gt;

==Propagation==
[[File:Glastonbury Thorn.jpg|thumb|Glastonbury Thorn at [[Glastonbury Abbey]], 1984. This tree died in 1991 and was removed in 1992.]]
Many have tried to grow the Glastonbury thorn from seed and direct cuttings, but in the later part of the 20th century all attempts reverted to the normal hawthorn type, flowering only in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Searle | first=Muriel V. | title=West Country History: Somerset | year=2002 | publisher=Venton Publications | location=Bristol | isbn=1-84150-802-0 | pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tree has been widely propagated by grafting or cuttings, with the [[cultivar]] name 'Biflora' or 'Praecox'. An early antiquarian account by Mr Eyston was given in Hearse's ''History and Antiquities of Glastonbury,'' 1722 : "There is a person about Glastonbury who has a nursery of them, who, Mr. Paschal tells us he is informed, sells them for a crown a piece, or as he can get."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/dec/25b.htm|title=Legend of the Glastonbury Thorn|last=Robert|first=Robert|year=1869|work=The Book of Days|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree in the grounds of the church was pronounced dead in June 1991, and cut down the following February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Marion|date=August 2006|title=The Holy Thorn Ceremony: Revival, Rivalry and Civil Religion in Glastonbury|journal=Folklore|volume=117 |pages=117 123–140|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rfol/2006/00000117/00000002/art00001?crawler=true|accessdate=2008-08-19|doi=10.1080/00155870600707805}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many cuttings were taken from it before its destruction. The pre-1991 thorn in the grounds of Glastonbury Church is said to be a cutting from the original plant which was planted in secret after the original was destroyed. Now only trees budded or grafted from the original exist, and these blossom twice a year, in May and at Christmas. The blossoms of the Christmas shoots are usually much smaller than the May ones and do not produce any [[Common hawthorn|haw]]s. Plants grown from the haws do not retain the characteristics of the parent stem.

The present "sacred thorn tree" at the [[Church of St John the Baptist, Glastonbury|Church of St John]] was grown from a local cutting, like many others in the neighbourhood of Glastonbury.  The large tree had been in the churchyard for eighty years. It was planted by Mr George Chislett, then head gardener of Glastonbury Abbey. He also learned how to graft holy thorn cuttings onto the root of [[blackthorn]] stock, and so preserve the “miraculous” Christmas blossoming characteristic. His son, Wilf, sent Glastonbury thorn cuttings all over the world, including to Washington, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

Luckily, trees survive from earlier grafts to perpetuate the Glastonbury legend, among them two other holy thorns in the grounds of St John’s. The blossom sent to the Queen now comes from one of these. At the end of term, the pupils of St John’s Infants School gather round the tree in St John’s parish churchyard on the High Street. They sing carols, including one specially written for the occasion, and the oldest pupil has the privilege of cutting the branch of the Glastonbury thorn that is then taken to London and presented to Her Majesty The Queen.
In 1965, the Queen erected a wooden cross at Glastonbury with the following inscription:
"The cross, the symbol of our faith, the gift of Queen Elizabeth II, marks a Christian sanctuary so ancient that only legend can record its origin."

[[Image:Noahs Ark.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A painting of [[Noah's Ark]], said to be constructed from ''gopher'' wood]]

'''Gopher wood''' or '''gopherwood''' is a term [[hapax legomenon|used once]] in the [[Bible]] for the substance from which [[Noah's Ark|Noah's ark]] was built. Genesis 6:14 states that Noah was to build the Ark of ''gofer'' (Hebrew {{lang|he|גפר}}), more commonly transliterated as ''gopher'' wood, a word not otherwise known in the Bible or in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Although some [[English translations of the Bible|English Bibles]] attempt a translation, older English translations, including the [[King James Version]] (17th century), leave it untranslated. The word is unrelated to the name of the North American animal, the [[gopher (animal)|gopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=gopher |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==
The Greek [[Septuagint]] (3rd&amp;ndash;1st centuries BC) translated it as ''xylon tetragonon'', squared timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sir Lancelot C.L.|last=Brenton|title=The Septuagint with Apocrypha: Greek and English (reprint)|year=1986|origyear=1851|location=Peabody|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|isbn=0-913573-44-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin [[Vulgate]] (5th century AD) rendered it as ''lignis levigatis'' (''lævigatis'', in the [[Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate|Clementine Vulgate]]),  smoothed (possibly planed) wood.

The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' believes it was most likely a translation of the Babylonian ''gushure iṣ erini'', cedar beams, or the Assyrian ''giparu'', reeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=365&amp;letter=G&amp;search=gopher%20wood|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: Goper-Wood|publisher=The Jewish Encyclopedia|author1=Hirsch, EG  |author2=Hyvernat, H|year=2002|accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aramaic Language|Aramaic]] [[Targum Onkelos]], considered by many Jews to be an official translation of the Hebrew scripture renders this word as ''qadros'', cedar. The [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]] translates this word as ''arqa'', [[Buxus|box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/|title=The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon|publisher=Hebrew Union College|accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern English translations tend to favor [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] (although otherwise the word for "cypress" in [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] is ''berosh''). This was espoused (among others) by [[Adam Clarke]], a [[Methodist]] [[theologian]] famous for his commentary on the Bible: Clarke cited the resemblance between [[Greek language|Greek]] word for cypress, ''kuparisson'' and the Hebrew word ''gophar''.

Other suggestions include [[pine]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[fir]], [[teak]], [[sandalwood]], [[ebony]], [[wicker]], [[juniper]], [[acacia]], [[buxus|boxwood]], slimed [[bulrush]]es, and resinous wood.

Others, noting the physical similarity between the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] ''g'' (''gimel'' {{script|Hebr|ג}}) and ''k'' (''kaf'' {{script|Hebr|כ}}), suggest that the word may actually be ''kopher'', the Hebrew word meaning "[[pitch (resin)|pitch]]"; thus ''kopher'' wood would be "pitched wood". Recent suggestions have included a lamination process (to strengthen the Ark), or a now-lost type of tree, but there is no consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor, Paul|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/gopherwood.html|title=What is "Gopher Wood"?|year=2001|publisher=Eden Communications|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Ellis Eckland''' (born 1942) is a former [[CIA]] [[Future energy development|Alternative Energy]] Analyst, and pioneer of early [[renewable energy]] efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. He was the founder and president of the now defunct [[Fayette Manufacturing Corporation]], a [[Fortune 500]] company.
His is the 1979 recipient of the [[Arthur S. Flemming Award]] for Excellence in Government Service and the first member of the CIA to receive this recognition.

==Early life and personal life==
John was the second of three sons of Stockton natives; Ellis E. Eckland, an engineer and Yardley Moore Eckland, artist.  He was raised in the nearby farming community of Linden, and attended Linden High School, class of 1960.  After being awarded the [[Bank of America]] scholarship prizes in Science and Mathematics, he attended [[Tulane University]], earning a degree in Economics. He has a Master's in Economics and started a doctoral program at the University of Florida but dropped out before completion.
While attending Tulane, he met Susan H. Weinfield, a graduate student at the School of [[Social work|Social Work]].  After a brief courtship, they married February 21, 1965. 
They have three grown children:
[[Ellis A. Eckland]], Economist (1971-), [[Kristin L. Eckland Gustafson]], Nurse Practitioner, [Author] (b. 1974) and Thomas Eckland (b. 1976), who manages a [http://kaslohotel.com/ small hotel].  John and Susan Eckland currently divide their time between Nevada and [[British Columbia]].

==Early career==
John Eckland later joined the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] as an alternative energy analyst.  During this time, he designed and built a {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in the (at that time) rural D.C. suburb of [[Great Falls, Virginia]].  This home was equipped with prototype [[solar panel]]s, and a small [[windmill]] as part of his interest in [[Energy development|alternative energy sources]] (Mother Earth, 1981).

==Fayette==
Following his formation of a small alternative energy company with a co-worker, Mr. Eckland resigned from [[National service|federal service]] and temporarily relocated to central Pennsylvania.

Mr. Eckland later returned to [[central California]] where he established the first commercial [[wind farm]] in the United States. The first [[windmills]] were placed on the Altamont Pass on land leased from a local rancher, Joe Jess, Sr. The purpose of this project was to promote [[Wind power|wind energy]] as a viable source of clean, [[renewable energy]].

==Conflicts and controversies affect wind energy==
{{Original research|section|date=February 2015}}

===Windmills and the media===
When the first windfarms appeared in 1981, on the Altamont hills alongside the [[Altamont Pass]] portion of the I-580 freeway, the appearance of the modern windmill generated media excitement and public interest.  This portion of the freeway was an increasingly used corridor for growing the [[Bedroom community|bedroom communities]] of Tracy, Lodi and Modesto serving the Bay Area of California (Oakland, San Francisco and Pleasanton).  Daily commuters crowded past the otherwise barren cattle ranches for several hours each day.

By 1985, the Altamont Pass was crowded with over 26 different windfarms.  The increased visibility from the nearby I-580 freeway, which had once sparked the media and community's interest, was now widely regarded as a growing eyesore. 
Successful windfarms at the Altamont Pass encouraged the development of further industrial wind areas in [[southern California]]. These windfarms, in the [[Tehachapi Pass]], led to wider recognition, after windmills played a role as a prominent backdrop in several feature films of the mid- and late 1980s including a 1985 film based on the [[Bret Easton Ellis]] novel ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'', featuring [[Andrew McCarthy]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]

===Environmental concerns===
[[Wind power|Wind energy]] was initially considered to be a boon to environmentalists, as a source of clean, renewable energy. However, as wind energy became more prominent and visible in central California, several outspoken environmentalists{{Who|date=February 2015}} made claims that windmills were damaging the local ecology.  They reported that several thousands of birds, particularly several [[endangered species]], were enticed into the turbine blades which then destroyed the birds.  The debate on this issue remains heated, with one prominent researcher stating that more birds are killed by cars from the nearby freeway that turbines, and another activist labeling turbines as a "[[Cuisinart]] of death [for birds]".  Research results are mixed, and widespread publicity on this issue has resulted in several wind companies being limited in their development and expansion of wind energy.

'''Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands''' is an [[ecoregion]] located in [[Botswana]], northern [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

==Setting==
These [[woodland]]s cover the center of southern Africa, from northern Namibia diagonally through to southeast Botswana and just into the [[Tuli Block]] of South Africa. In Botswana there is another area running north from the [[Okavango Delta]] and the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]] towards the border of the [[Chobe National Park]] and then east to the border with Zimbabwe. All this is [[semi-arid]] [[sandveld]] with little surface water. Droughts occur approximately every seven years. Rainfall, when it occurs, is mostly in the summer, from October through March.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands|id=at0709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The [[flora]] depends on the availability of water. The northern section to the west of the Okavango Delta and into Namibia  has a moister climate and the ''[[Baikiaea plurijuga]]'' woodland with bush savanna is dominant. In the [[hardveld]] areas to the south, the climate becomes more [[arid]] and the plants are dominated by [[xerophytic]] [[acacia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Kalahari_Acacia-Baikiaea_woodlands EO Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Fauna includes [[Ceratotherium simum|white]] and [[Diceros bicornis|black rhino]]. [[Lycaon pictus|Wild dogs]] and [[Loxodonta africana|elephant]] are also notable. Large mammals that migrate through the region include [[Blue wildebeest]] (Connochaetes taurinus), [[Common eland|eland]] (Taurotragus oryx), [[zebra]] (Equus burchelli), [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] (Syncerus caffer), and [[red hartebeest]] (Alcelaphus buselaphus). The region is rich in birdllife including the endemic Bradfield’s hornbill ([[Tockus bradfieldi]]).

==Threats and preservation==

Problems facing the region include the low but growing human population and the increased [[cattle]] [[ranch]]ing. The annual movement of the large [[herbivore]]s are now stopped by [[Pest-exclusion fence|veterinary control fence]]s aimed at foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, with devastating effects on their ability to move to water sources in times of drought. Commercial hunting is a major element of tourism in the region but illegal hunting presents the main threat to wildlife. Protected areas within the region include [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] in Botswana, [[Khaudom National Park]] in Namibia, and [[Nxai Pan National Park]], but there is little protection in the hardveld area to the south of the ecoregion.
The diamond mine at [[Orapa]] is in the centre of the region but does not present a threat to wildlife.

{{Judaism}}

'''''Kashrut''''' (also '''''kashruth''''' or '''''kashrus''''', {{Hebrew|כַּשְׁרוּת}}) is a set of [[Jews|Jewish]] religious [[Food and drink prohibitions|dietary laws]]. Food that may be consumed according to ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) is termed '''kosher''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|ʃ|ər}} in English, {{lang-yi|כּשר}}), from the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''kashér'' ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}}), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption).

Among the numerous laws that form part of ''kashrut'' are the prohibitions on the consumption of certain animals (such as [[pork]], [[shellfish]] [both [[Mollusca]] and [[Crustacea]]], and most [[insect]]s, with the exception of [[Kosher locust|certain species]] of kosher [[locust]]s), mixtures of [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|meat and milk]], and the commandment to [[Ritual slaughter|slaughter]] mammals and birds according to a process known as ''[[shechita]]''. There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact the suitability of food for consumption.

Most of the basic laws of ''kashrut'' are derived from the [[Torah]]'s Books of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. Their details and practical application, however, are set down in the [[oral law]] (eventually codified in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most ''kashrut'' laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's obedience,&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (ed. M. Friedländer), Part III (chapter 26), New York 1956, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (ed. M. Friedländer), Part III (chapter 48), New York 1956, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past century, many rabbinical organizations have started to certify products, manufacturers, and restaurants as kosher, usually using a symbol (called a ''[[hechsher]]'') to indicate their support. Currently, about a sixth of [[American Jews]] or 0.3% of the American population fully keep kosher, and there are many more who  do not strictly follow all the rules but still abstain from some prohibited foods (especially pork). The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], a [[Christian]] denomination, have a health message that expects adherence to the kosher dietary laws.&lt;ref name="Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review 1996 p.

==Explanations==

===Philosophical===
[[Jewish philosophy]] divides the [[613 commandments]] (or ''mitzvot'') into three groups—laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (''mishpatim''), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (''edot''), and laws that do not have a rational explanation (''chukim''). Some Jewish scholars say that ''kashrut'' should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean+&amp;+Unclean+Meats.htm |title=William H. Shea, Clean and Unclean Meats, Biblical Research Institute |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212211142/http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean%20%26%20Unclean%20Meats.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |df= }}, December 1998 (archived from [http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean%20&amp;%20Unclean%20Meats.htm the original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003060056/http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean%20%26%20Unclean%20Meats.htm |date=2008-10-03 }})&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Maimonides]] believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' ''[[Korban]]ot'', ''[[Temurah (Halacha)|Temurah]] 4:13 (in eds.

Some theologians have said that the laws of ''kashrut'' are symbolic in character: Kosher animals represent [[virtue]]s, while non-kosher animals represent [[vice]]s. The 1st century BCE [[Letter of Aristeas]] argues that the laws "have been given&amp;nbsp;... to awake pious thoughts and to form the character".&lt;ref&gt;''Letter of Aristeas'', 145–154&lt;/ref&gt; This view reappears in the work of the 19th century [[Rabbi]] [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year =1971|title=Dietary Laws|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]|publisher=[[Keter Publishing House]]|location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah prohibits "seething the kid (goat, sheep, calf) in its mother's milk". While the Bible does not provide a reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gottlieb| first = Roger S.| title = The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_LldeLvqQNsC&amp;pg=PA45| accessdate = October 18, 2012| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford Handbooks Online| isbn = 0-19-517872-6| page = 45 }} quoting [[Deuteronomy Rabbah]] 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Chill| first = Abraham| authorlink = Abraham Chill| title = The mitzvot: the commandments and their rationale| year = 1974| publisher = [[Bloch Publishing Company]]| isbn = 0-8197-0376-1| page = 114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hasidic Judaism]] believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with [[God|Divinity]], the ''activation'' of which it sees as helping the [[Shechinah|Divine Presence]] to be drawn into the physical world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73827/jewish/The-Chassidic-Masters-on-Food.htm |title=The Chassidic Masters on Food and Eating |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Schneersohn |first=Yosef Yitzchak |authorlink=Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn |publisher=[[Chabad.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed ''sparks of holiness'', interact with various animals. These ''sparks of Holiness'' are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a ''holy reason'' (which includes eating);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73850/jewish/Meat.htm |title=Meat |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Tauber |first=Yanki |authorlink=Yanki Tauber |publisher=[[Chabad.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their ''sparks of holiness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7887/jewish/Chapter-8.htm |title=The Tanya Chapter 8 |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |last=Borukhovich |first=Shneur Zalman |publisher=[[Chabad.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasidic argument is that  animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually ''clean'' and ritually ''unclean''.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829062317/http://www.rabbifriedman.org/sichaReeh.asp |date=August 29, 2007 |title=Re'eh }}, rabbifriedman.org (archived from [http://www.rabbifriedman.org/sichaReeh.asp the original]  on August 29, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian theologian [[Gordon Wenham|Gordon J. Wenham]], the purpose of ''kashrut'' was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted.&lt;ref name="Gordon J. Wenham 1981, p.6-15"&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, ''The Theology of Unclean Food'', ''[[The Evangelical Quarterly]]'' 53, January March 1981, pp.6–15&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.&lt;ref name="Gordon J. Wenham 1981, p.6-15"/&gt;

===Medical===
There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose, one of the earliest being from [[Maimonides]] in his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]''.  In 1953, [[David Macht]], an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of biblical scientific foresight, conducted [[toxin|toxicity]] experiments on many kinds of animals and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Experimental Pharmalogical Appreciation of Leviticus&amp;nbsp;XI and Deuteronomy&amp;nbsp;XIV |url=http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/Macht1953.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070630112056/http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/Macht1953.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-30 |last=Macht |first=David I. |date=September–October 1953 |work=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=XXXVII |issue=5 |pages=444–450 |format=pdf |ref=harv |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiment involved [[lupin]] seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually ''unclean'' meat inhibited the seedling's growth more than that from ritually ''clean'' meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macht|1953}} op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar [[Lester L. Grabbe]], writing in the ''Oxford Bible Commentary'' on Leviticus, says "[a]n explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11–15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; have hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the 'unclean' animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is sometimes asserted."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Bible Commentary'', eds. J. Barton and J. Muddiman. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001: 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibited foods==
{{Main article|Kosher foods}}
[[File:Kosher BethDin.jpg|thumb|[[Kosher foods|Kosher meal]] approved by the [[Beth din]] of [[Johannesburg]]]]

The laws of ''kashrut'' can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition (Biblical or rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.&lt;ref name="Forst"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forst |first=Binyomin |title=The laws of kashrus: a comprehensive exposition of their underlying concepts and applications |year=1994 |publisher=Mesorah Publications |location=Brooklyn, N.Y |isbn=0-89906-103-6 |pages=32–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblically prohibited foods include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* [[Kosher animals|Non-kosher animals and birds]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:3–8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:3–21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; mammals require certain identifying characteristics ([[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and being [[ruminants]]), while birds require a tradition that they can be consumed. Fish require scales and fins (thus excluding [[catfish]], for instance). All [[invertebrates]] are non-kosher apart from certain types of locust, on which most communities lack a clear tradition. No [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]] are kosher.
* Carrion (''nevelah''): meat from a kosher animal that has not been slaughtered according to the laws of ''[[shechita]]''. This prohibition includes animals that have been slaughtered by non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Hullin'' 13a (on Mishnah ''Hullin'' 1:1).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Injured (''[[terefah]]''): an animal with a significant defect or injury, such as a fractured bone or particular types of lung adhesions.
* Blood (''dam''): blood of kosher mammals and fowl is removed through salting, with special procedures for the [[Liver (food)|liver]], which is very rich in blood.
* Particular fats (''[[chelev]]''): particular parts of the abdominal fat of cattle, goats and sheep must be removed by a process called ''[[nikkur]]''.
* The twisted nerve (''[[gid hanasheh]]''): the [[sciatic nerve]], as according to Genesis 32:32 the patriarch [[Jacob]]'s was damaged when he fought with an angel, cannot be eaten and is removed by ''nikkur''.
* Limb of a living animal (''[[Taboo food and drink#Living animals|ever min ha-chai]]''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; God forbade [[Noahide laws|Noah and his descendants]] to consume a limb torn from a live animal. Hence, Jewish law considers this prohibition applicable even to non-Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doron-spalter |first=Pinchos |title=Major Concepts of the Talmud: An Encyclopedic Resource Guide, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kPARAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Targum Press]] |isbn=978-1-56871-465-3 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, a Jew may not give or sell such meat to a non-Jew.
* Untithed food (''tevel''): produce of the [[Land of Israel]] requires the removal of certain [[tithe]]s, which in ancient times were given to the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] (priests), [[Levite]]s and the poor (''[[Heave offering|terumah]]'', ''[[First tithe|maaser rishon]]'' and ''[[Poor tithe|maaser ani]]'' respectively) or taken to the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] to be eaten there (''[[maaser sheni]]'').
* Fruit during the first three years (''[[orlah]]''): according to Leviticus 19:23,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|19:23|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting cannot be consumed (both in the Land of Israel and the diaspora). This applies also to the fruit of the vine—grapes, and wine produced from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blech |first=Zushe Yosef |title=Kosher Food Production |date=January 27, 2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-8138-2093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New grain (''[[chadash]]''):&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|23:14|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible prohibits newly grown grain (planted after [[Passover]] the previous year) until the second day of Passover; there is debate as to whether this law applies to grain grown outside the Land of Israel.
* Wine of libation (''[[Kosher wine|yayin nesekh]]''): wine that may have been dedicated to idolatrous practices.

Biblically prohibited mixtures include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* Mixtures of meat and milk&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|23:19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:26|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21|}}&lt;/ref&gt;(''[[Milk and meat in Jewish law|basar be-chalav]]''): this law derives from the broad interpretation of the commandment not to "cook a kid in its mother's milk";&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|23:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|34:26|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; other non-kosher food may be used for other benefit (e.g. sold to non-Jews), but mixtures of meat and milk are prohibited even with regards to other benefit.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* Plants grown together (''[[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|kilayim]]''): in the Land of Israel plants are to be grown separately and not in close proximity according to Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:9–11. A specific subdivision of this law is ''kil'ei ha-kerem'', the prohibition of planting any grain or vegetable near a [[grapevine]]; this law applies to Jews throughout the world, and one may not derive benefit from the produce.

Rabbinically prohibited foods include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* Non-Jewish milk (''[[Cholov Yisroel|chalav akum]]''): milk that may have an admixture of milk from non-kosher animals (see below for current views on this prohibition).
* Non-Jewish cheese (''gevinat akum''): cheese that may have been produced with non-kosher [[rennet]].
* Non-Jewish wine (''stam yeinam''): wine that while not produced for idolatrous purposes may otherwise have been poured for such a purpose or alternatively when consumed will lead to intermarriage.
* Food cooked by a non-Jew (''[[Bishul Yisrael|bishul akum]]''): this law was enacted for concerns of [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]].
* Non-Jewish bread (''[[Pas Yisroel|pat akum]]''): this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage.
* Health risk (''sakanah''): certain foods and mixtures are considered a health risk, such as mixtures of [[fish]] and meat.

===Permitted and forbidden animals===

{{further|Unclean animal}}
Only meat from particular species is permissible. Mammals that ''both'' chew their cud ([[Ruminant|ruminate]]) and have [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other (the [[camel]], the [[hyrax]], and the [[hare]] because they have no cloven hooves, and the [[pig]] because it does not ruminate) are specifically excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:3–8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive review of the issue involving the difficulty that neither the hyrax nor the hare are ruminants, see {{cite book |last=Slifkin |first=Rabbi Nosson  |authorlink=Natan Slifkin |title=The Camel, the Hare &amp; the Hyrax: A Study of the Laws of Animals with One Kosher Sign in Light of Modern Zoology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHsRAQAAIAAJ |edition=illustrated |year=2004 |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim |isbn=978-1-56871-312-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a rabbinical ruling determined that [[giraffes]] and their [[milk]] are eligible to be considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud, characteristics of animals considered kosher.  Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards. Although kosher, the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/2084281/Giraffe-is-kosher-Israeli-vets-have-ruled.html |title=Giraffe is kosher, rabbis rule in Israel |last=Butcher |first=Tim |date=June 6, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 82:1–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashrut.com-archive.info/articles/giraffe/ |title=What's the Truth About Giraffe Meat! |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407105109/http://www.kashrut.com-archive.info/articles/giraffe/ |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-kosher birds are listed outright&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:12–18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the exact ''zoological'' references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned). The [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bavli]]'' ''[[Chullin]]'' 3:22–23&lt;/ref&gt; refers to four signs provided by the [[Chazal|sages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part2/ |title=Is Turkey Kosher?, part 2 |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, a ''dores'' (predatory bird) is not kosher.  Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics:  an extra toe in the back (which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg), a ''zefek'' ([[crop (anatomy)|crop]]), and a ''korkoban'' ([[gizzard]]) with a peelable [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].  However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition (''masorah'') is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is turkey.  There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the signs (''simanim'') in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part3/ |title=Is Turkey Kosher?, part 3 |last=Zivotofsky |first=Ari Z. |website=Kashrut.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shellfish]] and other non-fish water animals [[fauna]] are not kosher.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 83 and 84&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Kosher fish list|kosher species of fish]].) Insects are not kosher, except for certain species of [[kosher locust]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 85&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, any animal that eats other animals, whether they kill their food or eat [[carrion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13–31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not kosher, as well as any animal that has been partially eaten by other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|22:30-31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation of meat and milk===
{{Main article|Milk and meat in Jewish law}}
Meat and milk (or derivatives) cannot be mixed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koshercertification.org.uk/whatdoe.html |title=What Does Kosher Mean? - section 2.4|website=koshercertification.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that meat and [[dairy product]]s are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together. Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 87 ''et seq''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''milchig'' and ''fleishig''  (lit. ''milky'' and ''meaty'') utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to Yiddish delineations between dairy and meat ones, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/kashrut.html |title=Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosher slaughter===
{{Main article|Shechita}}
[[File:Schect.jpg|thumb|A 15th-century depiction of ''[[shechita]]'']]

Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual (a ''[[shochet]]'') using a special method of slaughter, ''[[shechita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|12:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other features, ''shechita'' slaughter severs the [[jugular vein]], [[carotid artery]], [[esophagus]], and [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp [[Shechita#The knife|knife]]. Failure of any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 1–65&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions (''[[treifot]]'') include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats (''[[chelev]]'') and the [[sciatic nerve]]s from the legs, the process of [[Nikkur|excision]] being done by experts before the meat is sold. As much blood as possible must be removed&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the ''kashering'' process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the [[liver]], as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an open flame.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 66–78&lt;/ref&gt; Fish (and kosher locusts, for those who follow the traditions permitting them) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABCs of Kosher|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/m/mm/48958906.html|publisher=[[Aish HaTorah]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Locusts Go Biblical – But Are They Kosher?|url=http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/172409/locusts-go-biblical-but-are-they-kosher/|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legal aspects of ritual slaughter]] are governed not only by Jewish law but civil law as well.

====Preparation of meats====
When an animal is ritually slaughtered (''shechted'') the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out the blood that lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of [[Kosher salt|salt]], while the meat is laid over a grating or [[colander]] to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed to remain on the meat for the duration of time that it takes to walk one [[biblical mile]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulhan Arukh]], ''Yoreh De'a''h § 69:6; ibid., § 69:16–19&lt;/ref&gt; (appx. 18– 24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood. 

A late Commentary on the [[Shulchan Arukh]] known as the ''[[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]]'' (''Turei Zahav''), on ''Yoreh De'ah'' 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be "very thick" when salting.&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh, ''Yoreh De'ah'', § 69:5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yemenite Jewish]] practice, however, follows Rabbi [[Saadiah Gaon]] who required that the meat not be larger than half a "rotal" (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting.&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbi Isaac Alfasi on Tractate Ḥullin'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), chapter ''Kol haBasar'', Jerusalem 1960, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the effects of the salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ''ḥaliṭah'' ({{Lang-he-n|'''חליטה'''}}), “blanching.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishne Torah]]'' (''Hil. Ma'achaloth Asuroth'' 6:10); cf. Babylonian Talmud, ''Hullin'' 111a.&lt;/ref&gt; This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water for as long as it takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ''ḥaliṭah'' in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. ''Ḥaliṭah'' is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.

===Kosher utensils===
[[File:Kosher dishes P7160076.JPG|thumb|Kosher dairy dishes from the 19th century in the [[Jewish Museum, Berlin]].]]

Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, depending on the material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch. Food prepared in a manner that violates the ''[[Shabbat]]'' (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Orach Chayim'', 318:1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passover laws===
[[File:Kosher for Passover orange juice.JPG|thumb|left|Label on bottle of [[orange juice]] certifying that it is kosher for [[Passover]].]]

[[Passover]] has special dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating [[leavened bread]] or derivatives of this, which are known as ''[[chametz]]''. This prohibition is derived from Exodus 12:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utensils used in preparing and serving ''chametz'' are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed (''kashered'').&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Orach Chayim'', 431–452&lt;/ref&gt; Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of ''kashrut'', such as not eating ''[[gebrochts]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oukosher.org/blog/industrial-kosher/keeping-up-with-passover-trenditions/ |title=Keeping Up with Passover Trenditions |last=Brenner |first=Bayla Sheva |website=OUKosher.org |publisher=[[Orthodox Union]] |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/493085/jewish/Which-vegetables-may-be-eaten-on-Passover.htm |title=Which vegetables may be eaten on Passover? |last=Davidson |first=Baruch S. |website=[[Chabad.org]] |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Produce of the Land of Israel===

Some rules of ''kashrut'' are subject to different rabbinical opinions. For example, many hold that the rule against eating ''[[yoshon|chadash]]'' (new grain) before the 16th of the month [[Nisan]] does not apply outside the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is "Yashan"?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/584873/jewish/What-is-Yashan.htm|last=Posner|first=Menachem|publisher=[[Chabad.org]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetables===
Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a ''[[hechsher]]'', certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The ''hechsher'' usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of ''[[bishul Yisrael]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are vegan restaurants automatically kosher?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/547235/jewish/Are-vegan-restaurants-kosher.htm|last=Posner|first=Eliezer|publisher=[[Chabad.org]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetables such as [[spinach]] and [[cauliflower]] must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Check for Insects?|url=http://star-k.org/cons-insectintro.php|publisher=[[Star-K]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321204333/http://www.star-k.org/cons-insectintro.php|archivedate=March 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pareve foods===
Some processes convert a meat or dairy product into a ''[[pareve]]'' (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, [[rennet]] is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese,&lt;ref&gt;''The rennet must be kosher, either microbial or from special productions of animal rennet using kosher calf stomachs.''[http://oukosher.org/index.php/articles/single/2828/ Oukosher.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306151416/http://oukosher.org/index.php/articles/single/2828/ |date=2012-03-06 }}, Retrieved August 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher [[gelatin]], an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as [[agar agar]] and [[carrageenan]] are ''pareve'' by nature. ''Fish gelatin'' is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) ''pareve''. [[egg (food)|Egg]]s are also considered ''pareve'' despite being an animal product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meat, Dairy and Pareve|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=63|publisher=[[OK Kosher Certification]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kashrut'' has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for those with allergies, vegetarians, or adherents to other religious statutes. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant ''pareve'' status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue, and that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry "milk" warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosher Consumer Misconsumptions|url=http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-KosherConsumerMisconsumptions.htm|publisher=[[Star-K]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetically modified foods===
With the advent of [[genetic engineering]], a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and scholars in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first [[genetically modified]] animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the [[AquAdvantage salmon]], and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a [[gene]] from a nonkosher organism.

Some put forth that this intermixing of species is against the teachings of the [[Talmud]] and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene accounts for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/2011-2020/nevins-gmos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supervision and marketing==

[[File:Barley bug.jpg|thumb|A [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] found among [[barley]]corns in a commercially available bag of barley. Foods such as [[seed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s and [[vegetable]]s need to be checked to avoid eating insects.]]
Certain foods must be prepared in whole or in part by Jews. This includes [[kosher wine|grape wine]],&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 114&lt;/ref&gt; certain cooked foods (''[[Bishul Yisrael|bishul akum]]''),&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[cheese]] (''g'vinat akum''), and according to some also butter (''chem'at akum'');&lt;ref name="YD115"&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 115&lt;/ref&gt; dairy products (Hebrew: חלב ישראל [[chalav Yisrael]] "milk of Israel");&lt;ref name=YD115/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many rely on lenient rulings by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] in ''Teshuvot Igrot Moshe'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 1:47 and other 20th century rabbinic authorities who rule that strict government supervision prevents the admixture of non-kosher milk, making supervision unnecessary.

{{details|Hechsher}}
Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients.  Such "hidden" ingredients may include [[lubricant]]s and [[flavoring]]s, among other [[Food additive|additives]]; in some cases, for instance, the use of ''natural'' flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-kosher substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What foods are kosher?|url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/307920/jewish/Kosher-Foods.htm|publisher=Oxford Chabad Society|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high rate of [[Seafood mislabelling|mislabeling]], which may result in a non-kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html |title=Tests Reveal Mislabeling of Fish |last=Rosenthal |first=Elizabeth |date=May 26, 2011 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as ''kosher'': this involves a visit to the manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization, who will inspect the production methods and contents, and if everything is sufficiently ''kosher'' a certificate would be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to choose a kosher certification|url=http://www.kashrut.com/trade/trade_links/hechsher/|publisher=Kashrut.com|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as ''[[hechsher]]im''.&lt;ref name="Hechshers"&gt;{{cite web|title=About this web-site|url=http://www.hechshers.info/about.htm|publisher=Hechshers.info|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to differences in ''kashrut'' standards held by different organizations, the ''hechsheirim'' of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosher Certification|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113474/jewish/Kosher-Certification.htm|publisher=[[Chabad]].org|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[certification mark]]s of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]], who use a ''U'' inside a circle ("O-U"), symbolising the initials of ''Orthodox Union''. In Britain, a commonly used symbol is the "KLBD" logo of the [[London Beth Din]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  A single ''K'' is sometimes used as a symbol for ''kosher'', but since many countries do not allow letters to be [[trademark]]ed (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.&lt;ref name="Kosherfest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Kosher Terms |url=http://www.kosherfest.com/about-kosher/glossary-of-kosher-terms |publisher=[[Kosherfest]] |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203160355/http://www.kosherfest.com/about-kosher/glossary-of-kosher-terms |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law;&lt;ref name=Kosherfest/&gt; the categorisation may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as ''dairy'', but legal classification does not.
* D—Dairy
* DE—Dairy equipment
* M—''Meat'', including [[poultry]]
* Pareve—Food that is neither meat nor dairy
* Fish
* P—''[[Passover]]''-related (''P'' is not used for ''Pareve'')

In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing [[tallow]], which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any ''hechsher'' or ''kashrut''. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the ''hechsher'' may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active ''[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]'' among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the ''hechsher''. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss ''kashrut'' products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosher Supervision|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=116|publisher=[[OK Kosher Certification]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products labeled [[kosher-style]] are non-kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef [[hot dog]]s,&lt;ref name="zeldes"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Know your wiener! | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant &amp; Entertainment Guide, Inc. | date = July 8, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/08/know-your-wiener/ | accessdate = July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with [[Ashkenazi]] practices, like [[dill pickles]].&lt;ref name="pickle"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Origins of neon relish and other Chicago hot dog conundrums  | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant &amp; Entertainment Guide, Inc.  | date = July 20, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/20/chicago-hot-dog-yellow-mustard-neon-green-relish#pickle | accessdate = July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation usually refers to [[delicatessen]] items.

===History of kosher supervision and marketing===
Food producers often look to expand their markets or marketing potential, and offering kosher food has become a way to do that. The uniqueness of kosher food was advertised as early as 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10938449/early_mention_of_kosher/|title=Early mention of kosher|last=|first=|date=1849-03-15|work=Public Ledger|access-date=2017-05-12|pages=2|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] became the first company to advertise one of their products, Crisco, as kosher.&lt;ref name="Heinze1992"&gt;
{{cite book| last = Heinze| first = Andrew R.| title = Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0QRmrxJfP44C&amp;pg=PA176| accessdate = March 15, 2013| date = 1 August 1992| publisher = Columbia University Press| isbn = 978-0-231-06853-6| page = 176 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two decades, companies such as [[Lender's Bagels]], [[Maxwell House]], [[Manischewitz]], and [[Empire Kosher|Empire]] evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf-space. In the 1960s, [[Hebrew National]] hotdogs launched a "we answer to a higher authority" campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, "kosher" became a symbol for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it more opportunities for kosher products. Menachem Lubinsky, founder of the [[Kosherfest]] trade fair, estimates as many as {{Nowrap|14 million}} kosher consumers and {{Nowrap|$40 billion}} in sales of kosher products in the USA.&lt;ref name="Kosherfest-history"&gt;
{{cite web|title=The History of Kosher |url=http://www.kosherfest.com/about-kosher/the-history-of-kosher |publisher=Kosherfest |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321023402/http://www.kosherfest.com/about-kosher/the-history-of-kosher |archivedate=March 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases, and the first women kosher inspectors were 
certified in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/190635/idf-to-allow-female-kosher-supervisors-to-work-on/|title=IDF To Allow Female Kosher Supervisors To Work on Military Bases|date=9 January 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdjewishworld.com/2014/05/08/first-women-kashrut-inspectors-certified-israel/|title=First women kashrut inspectors certified in Israel - San Diego Jewish World|work=San Diego Jewish World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal usage===
{{Main article|Civil laws regarding Kashrut}}

Advertising standards laws in many{{quantify|date=August 2014}} jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase ''kosher'' in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the ''kashrut'' nature, in others the rules of ''kosher'' are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term ''kosher'' have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.&lt;ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Adherence===
A 2013 survey found that 22% of [[American Jews]] surveyed claimed to keep kosher in the home.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Jews observe ''kashrut'' partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not drinking milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one analysis of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of kosher consumers were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ats-sea.agr.gc.ca/info/6116-eng.htm|title= The Specialty Food Market in North America|date= March 2012|publisher= Agri-Food Trade Service, Canada|work= Market Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the ''kosher-pareve'' designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kosher-directory.com/whoeats.htm |title= Who Eats Kosher?

===Linguistics===
In Ancient Hebrew Kosher ({{lang-he|כשר}}) means ''be advantageous'', ''proper'', ''suitable'', or ''succeed''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/BDB.pdf |title=A Hebrew and English lexicon of the Old Testament |publisher=Palmer Theological Seminary}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] Hebrew and English Lexicon.  In Modern Hebrew, it generally refers to ''kashrut'' but it can also sometimes mean "proper". For example, the [[Babylonian Talmud]] uses ''kosher'' in the sense of ''virtuous'', when referring to [[Darius I]] as a "kosher king"; Darius, a [[Persia]]n King, assisted in building the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Tractate ''Rosh Hashanah'']] 3b, ''Schottenstein Edition'', [[Mesorah Publications]] Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, ''[[wiktionary:kosher|kosher]]'' often means ''legitimate'', ''acceptable'', ''permissible'', ''genuine'', or ''authentic''.&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Partridge |author2=Tom Dalzell |author3=Terry Victor | title = The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: Volume 2, J-Z| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA388| year = 2006| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 0-415-25938-X| page = 388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phythian"&gt;{{cite book| author = B.A. Phythian| title = A concise dictionary of English slang and colloquialisms| year = 1976| publisher = The Writer, Inc| isbn = 0-87116-099-4| page = 110| quote = Kosher Genuine.

The word ''kosher'' is also part of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an abbreviation of ''koshering'', meaning the process for making something ''kosher''; for example, ''[[kosher salt]]'' is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of ''kashrut'', because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.mos.org/sln/SEM/ksalt.html |title=Kosher Salt |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230171127/http://legacy.mos.org/sln/sem/ksalt.html |archivedate=2015-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times it is used as a synonym for ''Jewish tradition''; for example, a ''kosher dill'' [[pickled cucumber|pickle]] is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_pkwhat.htm |title=FROM PICKLE DAY EXHIBITS: What is a Pickle? |accessdate=March 14, 2013 |last1=Bowen |first1=Dana |last2=Ralph |first2=Nancy |publisher=New York Food Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.&lt;ref name=Jewfaq/&gt;

The following is a list of some notable species of the [[agaric]] genus ''[[Amanita]]''. This genus contains over 500 named species and varieties, but the list is far from exhaustive. The list follows the classification of subgenera and sections of ''Amanita'' outline by Corner and Bas; Bas,&lt;ref name="Corner 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bas 1969"/&gt; as used by Tulloss (2007) and modified by Redhead &amp; al. (2016)&lt;ref name=Redheadetal2016/&gt; for ''Amanita'' subgenus ''Amanitina'' and Singer for ''Amanita'' section ''Roanokenses''. Bolding of the species name and an asterisk (*) following indicates the species is the [[type species]] of that section, with a double asterisk (**) indicating the type species of the entire genus. Use of common names follows Tulloss (2007), Holden (2003), Arora (1986), and Lincoff (1981).

[[File:Size and Location of State Forests.pdf|thumb|Size and Location of State Forests]]
There are 20 state forests in the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]].  These forests are managed by the [[Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry]], which is a division of the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]. 

A reorganization effective July 1, 2005, shifted territory among several state forests in eastern Pennsylvania, resulting in the elimination of Wyoming State Forest and the creation of Loyalsock State Forest. As of May 2006, the State Forester is Dr. James R. Grace.

[[File:Woodland in Aunt Mary's Bottom - geograph.org.uk - 560568.jpg|thumb|300px|Woodland in Aunt Mary's Bottom SSSI, Dorset]]
This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in the county of [[Dorset]]''', [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England uses Dorset's borders to mark one of its [[Area of Search|Areas of Search]]. {{As of|2012}}, there are 139 sites designated in this Area of Search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSSIs in Dorset|work=English Nature|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1012|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 20 sites with a purely geological interest, and 103 listed for biological interest. A further 16 sites are designated for both reasons.

Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974&amp;ndash;1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here. The data in the table is taken from Natural England in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI, and the County Background Datasheet for Dorset.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/reportAction.cfm?Report=sdrt07&amp;Category=CF&amp;Reference=1012 Natural England County Background datasheet for Dorset SSSIs] Accessed 6 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Loita Plains''' are a [[savanna]] and pastoral grazing ground in the southern [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] in [[Kenya]], just north of the [[Maasai Mara]].

The plains and nearby [[Loita Hills]] have been the territory of the [[Maasai people]]s since the 19th century and now include ranches and fences.&lt;ref name=serengeti4&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinclair|first1=Anthony|last2=Metzger|first2=Kristine|last3=Mduma|first3=Simon|last4=Fryxell|first4=John|title=Serengeti IV: Sustaining Biodiversity in a Coupled Human-Natural System|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive surveys of the Loita Plains ecosystem were carried out by Vershuren and Misonne, the later an experienced [[taxonomist]], in 1962-3. Focusing on small rodents, they found that most specimens were [[African grass rat]]s or [[Natal multimammate mouse|Natal multimammate mice]], but that overall species diversity was very high.&lt;ref name=serengeti4 /&gt;

In the northern Loita Plains, a substantial amount of land was converted to wheat field in the 1980s. This practice declined later on, but not before reducing the Loita [[wildebeest]] migration from 130,000 to only 30,000 individuals within the space of 15 years, mostly through blocking migration routes with fences.&lt;ref name=serengeti4 /&gt; The Loita Plains were especially important to wildebeest during wet seasons; during dry seasons they would move south to the Maasai Mara and meet up with [[Tanzania]]n wildebeest from the [[Serengeti National Park|Serengeti]].&lt;ref name=gces&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steffen|first1=Will|last2=Sanderson|first2=Regina|last3=Tyson|first3=Peter|last4=Jager|first4=Jill|last5=Matson|first5=Pamela|last6=Moore|first6=Berrien|last7=Oldfield|first7=Frank|last8=Richardson|first8=Katherine|last9=Schellnhuber|first9=Hans|last10=Turner|first10=Billie|last11=Wasson|first11=Robert|title=Global Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marineland''' (official name '''Marineland of Canada Inc.'''), is a themed [[amusement park]] and zoo for both marine and land animals, in the city of [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Opened in 1961, the park has roller coasters and a triple tower ride, along with marine shows and exhibits of dolphins, walruses, sea lions, an orca, and beluga whales. The park also keeps bears, deer and other land animals. The park's keeping of sea mammals is controversial and the park is involved in several lawsuits over the practice. The park has an annual attendance of 250,000.&lt;ref name="gm-2018-07-22"/&gt;

==Attractions==
Marineland of Canada keeps about 4,000 land and marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe &amp; Mail |location=Toronto, Ontario |first=Liam |last=Casey |title=OSPCA responds to lawsuit: Marineland ‘the author of its own misfortune’ |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ospca-responds-to-lawsuit-marineland-the-author-of-its-own-misfortune/article37512576/ |date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marineland operates 16 rides ranging from rides for children, to thrill rides for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelandcanada.com/attractions/rides/|title=Marineland Canada - You can ride and ride and ride again|website=www.marinelandcanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marine animals perform several time daily at King Waldorf Stadium.

===Marine exhibits===
Marineland keeps [[beluga whale]]s, [[dolphin|bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[grey seal]]s, [[harbour seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[walrus]]es and one [[orca]] ('killer whale'). The belugas are kept in Arctic Cove, Friendship Cove and King Waldorf Stadium. As of August 2017, Marineland had 53 belugas.&lt;ref name="cetabase.org"/&gt;

Kiska is the only orca at Marineland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelandcanada.com/mobile/friendship_cove.html|title=Friendship Cove |website=www.marinelandcanada.com |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cetabase.org"/&gt; A 2012 report stated that Marineland was then looking for a companion for their orca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2012/11/20/marineland-looking-for-companion-to-kiska |title=Marineland looking for companion to Kiska |first=Ray |last=Spiteri |work=St. Catharines Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it appears that Kiska will be the last orca that the park will own. On May 28, 2015, the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] passed the ''Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act''. The act prohibits the possession or breeding of orcas in Ontario while allowing Marineland to keep its orca.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=3213&amp;detailPage=bills_detail_the_bill |accessdate=June 13, 2015 |title=Bill 80, Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act, 2015 |publisher=Ontario Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ont. passes killer whale ban, other animal protection measures |author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ont-passes-killer-whale-ban-other-animal-protection-measures-1.2395966 |work=CTV News|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marineland has stated its opposition to moving Kiska. A lawyer acting for the park in 2015 made the following comment: "She's very elderly, so it's the equivalent of taking someone who is 80 years old or 90 years old in an old folks' home and moving them into an apartment in the Village in New York ...   and it is entirely reasonable, achievable and appropriate to provide for her, on loan from another facility, an age-appropriate companion" but added that the 2015 Ontario Act does not allow for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/people-dont-love-marineland-anymore-ontario-law-leaves-orca-floating-alone-in-niagara-falls/wcm/96767360-5631-477d-abfd-558d68f5190f|title=‘People don’t love Marineland anymore’: Ontario law leaves orca floating alone in Niagara Falls|date=May 29, 2015|work=National Post |first=Ashley |last=Csanady}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/05/20/bob-barker-wants-marineland-killer-whale-included-in-ontario-orca-ban.html|title=Bob Barker wants Marineland killer whale included in Ontario orca ban |work=Toronto Star|date=May 20, 2015 |first=Liam |last=Casey |agency=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Friendship Cove''': This exhibit was built for the display of orcas and now also houses belugas. According to Marineland, it is the world's largest whale habitat for viewing  above ground and below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Marineland Canada - Niagara Falls Aquarium - Amusement Park |publisher = Clifton Hill Resorts | url = http://www.cliftonhill.com/niagara_falls_attractions/marineland_canada/ | accessdate = July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friendship Cove currently holds one orca: Kiska (female, estimated age 41–42 years). There are three pools in Friendship Cove. In pool A, there are 12 belugas: Burnaby, Eve, Horus, Jellybean, Orion, Qila, Neva,  Mira, Gia, Osiris, Rain, and Tuk. Pool B is the habitat for Kiska and pool C is a medical pool that Kiska uses.
*'''Arctic Cove''': Is the main beluga whale exhibit. The design of the exhibit allows viewing above and below ground. Guests also have the opportunity to pet and feed the beluga whales for a fee. These interaction sessions occur throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Marineland Canada | publisher = Destination 360 |url=http://www.destination360.com/north-america/canada/marineland |accessdate = July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three pools in Arctic Cove: two habitat pools and a medical pool. There are 24 belugas in pool A: Andre, Kodiak, Tank, Isis and Titan, Skyla and Jetta, Ivy, Acadia and Sahara, Aurora and Kharabali, Frankie, Xavier, Ruby, Yara, Wink, Gemini, Secord and Havok, Lillooet and Nahanni, and Kelowna and Skara. There are 14 belugas in pool B: Xena and Calf, Sierra and Calf, Jubilee and Calf, Meeka and Calf, Peekachu and Calf, Caspian and Calf, and Cleo and Calf.
*'''King Waldorf Stadium''': Opened on July 1, 1971, this is the main stadium where marine animals perform. The show has sea lions, walruses and bottlenose dolphins. Marineland plans to add belugas to the show. There are four habitat pools. In the left side pool are five dolphins: Tsunami, Echo, Lida, Sonar and Marina. In the right side pool, two belugas are kept: Charmin and Tofino. In the two backstage areas, there are five female California sea lions: Holly, Malibu, Sydney, Maui, and Cleveland. In the other backstage area are four walruses: Buttercup, Apollo, Zeus and Smooshi.
*'''Aquarium Dome''': This facility, opened in 1966, is now a retirement centre for the elderly sea lions and seals. It houses six harbor seals: Curry, Poppy, Baby, Squamish, Larry and Rolo; three California sea lions: Pebbles, Coral, Surfer and a grey seal named Delphine.
*'''Warehouse''':  This area has a four-quadrant pool area, along with a separate pool currently used to house dolphins during the winter months. Marineland has several animals off exhibit from King Waldorf Theatre. This structure was added in the mid-1970s. There are five California sea lions: Holly, Malibu, Sydney, Maui, Cleveland; four walruses: Apollo, Smooshi, Zeus and Buttercup and five dolphins in winter: Lida, Echo, Tsunami, Sonar, and Marina.

===Land animals===
Marineland has many animals throughout the park that are not [[cetacea]]ns or [[pinniped]]s. Marineland has carried over these animals from its days as a 'game farm'.

*Bear Country: an area featuring [[American black bear|black bears]] sits below a viewing deck, where visitors can throw Corn Pops cereal (originally marshmallows) to them.
*Deer Park: European Fallow Deer are in a fenced-in area which allows people to move about freely. Food is provided for a fee.
*Carp Pond: An area in which [[carp]] and [[koi]] gather around "deck bridges", allowing easy viewing and feeding for a fee.
*[[Red deer|Elk]] and [[American bison|Buffalo]]: allow for easy viewing of these creatures grazing. Feeding also available for a fee.

===Rides===
The major rides are the Dragon Mountain roller coaster and the Sky Screamer triple tower ride. Dragon Mountain is an [[Arrow Dynamics|Arrow Huss]] roller coaster which opened as the world's largest (not longest) non-stop roller coaster - covering {{convert|30|acre|sqft}}. It features tunnels that lead to the [[queue area]], has two consecutive vertical loops and a bow tie loop. A section of the roller coaster passes through a back section of Marineland and may not have been finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dragon Mountain Roller Coaster |publisher = ultimaterollercoaster.com |url=http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/yellowpages/coasters/dragon_marineland_ca.shtml |accessdate=July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky Screamer, a triple [[Space Shot (ride)|tower ride]], opened in 2004. It is {{convert|300|ft|m}} high, situated on a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} hill, making the total height of the ride {{convert|450|ft|m}}. Ascending riders experience 4[[G-force|Gs]], while descending riders experience a -2Gs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Thrilling Rides |publisher =visiting-niagara-falls.com |url=http://www.visiting-niagara-falls.com/marineland.html |accessdate = July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park has fifteen other rides. The children's rides are clustered in an area to the south of the main gate. Another ride, the "Topple Tower" circular gondola ride opened in 2007 but closed in 2011 for required repairs. It has not re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coaster101.com/2016/07/14/12-reasons-marineland-equally-awesome-disappointing/ |title=12 Reasons Why Marineland is Equally Awesome and Disappointing |website=coaster101.com |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recently added ride is the "Ocean Odyssey" ride added in the children's area in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Niagara Falls Review |url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2010/08/17/going-for-a-spin-at-marineland |date=August 27, 2010 |title=Going for a spin at Marineland |first=Mike |last=DiBattista |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The park was founded by [[John Holer]], a Slovenian immigrant who had worked in circuses in Europe.&lt;ref name="gm-2018-07-22"/&gt; Holer and a partner bought a portion of the [[Harry Oakes]] estate near the falls. The park opened in 1961 as "Marine Wonderland and Animal Farm".&lt;ref name=star/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Attraction is being  expanded |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19760718&amp;id=zzkjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sKAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2157,4711494 |page=52 |accessdate=October 3, 2011|newspaper=Reading Eagle |date=July 18, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holer welded two large steel tanks together and brought in three sea lions and charged one quarter for admission and another to feed the animals.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; The attraction also featured an underwater show featuring two female swimmers.&lt;ref name=windsor/&gt;

In 1963, a trained sea lion "Jeff" escaped from Marine Wonderland and made it to the Niagara River and went over the falls. Holer offered a {{CAD|50}} reward and organized a helicopter search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Trained Seal Flips Over Falls |date=May 24, 1963 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was recaptured by Holer a few days later in [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]], where it was found sunning itself with teenager Tommy Haines, who was given the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Flying Tackle Nabs Falls-Flipping Seal |date=May 27, 1963 |p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Holer added two dolphins, along with a few other animals and the attraction became known as "Marineland And Game Farm".&lt;ref name=windsor/&gt; By 1966, a 2,000-seat "aquatheatre" was completed along with a "grotto" of aquariums and shops.&lt;ref name=windsor/&gt; The grotto in the new Aquarium Dome contained eight tanks used to display fresh-water fish.&lt;ref name="star-1968-08-18"&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |first=Lotta |last=Dempsey |title=51,200 pounds of choice fish that's no fun shopping spree |date=August 18, 1968 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park became a popular family attraction and recorded an annual attendance of 250,000 for the 1967 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |first=Lotta |last=Dempsey |title=The new look at Niagara for children |date=August 17, 1968 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the park added [[alligator]]s.&lt;ref name="star-1968-08-18"/&gt; Neighbouring attraction "Niagara Falls Indian Village" closed down after the 1968 season and Marineland purchased their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Covering Niagara: Studies in Local Popular Culture |first1=Joan |last1=Nicks |first2=Barry Keith |last2=Grant |year=2010 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Marineland added orcas. "Kandu" became the park's major attraction. In 1973, the aquarium purchased "Kandy", a {{convert|4000|lb|kg}} female orca captured off Vancouver Island in 1973 to mate with Kandu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Whale by mail is bride-to-be for killer |date=October 30, 1973 |page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she died later that year. Kandu lived until 1979 and was replaced by "Nootka", captured and brought to the park in 1981. Nootka lived until 2008.&lt;ref name="cetabase.org"/&gt; By 1975, the park kept over 1,000 animals and claimed to be Niagara Falls' "most popular attraction after the falls."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Make friends with our animals in our beautiful game farm |author=Marineland |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=June 30, 1975 |pages=D18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Marineland became involved in a controversy over another orca captured off Vancouver Island. The capture of 'Kanduke' by the [[Sealand of the Pacific]] aquarium of [[Victoria, British Columbia]] for purchase by Marineland was blocked by the [[Government of British Columbia]], at the instigation of [[Greenpeace]] activists. Claimed to be property by the BC government, and resources by the [[Government of Canada]], the orca eventually was transported to Marineland after it was determined that orcas were a resource under the control of the Canadian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |first= Deborah |last=Wilson|title=B.C.'s pipeline battle has parallels in 1975 standoff over killer whale capture |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-pipeline-kinder-morgan-environment-whales-barrett-horgan-1.4538089 |date=February 18, 2018 |accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to the ending of the capture of orcas in British Columbia waters.

In 1976, Marineland announced a {{CAD|50 million}} expansion on 1,000 adjacent acres, to include a 400-acre "safari park" and amusement centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=$50 facelifting for aquatic show |date=January 15, 1976 |page=E11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began on a new 15,000 seat stadium and pool for killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |date=July 22, 1976 |title=No hardhat for friendly Freda |page=E6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marineland purchased two locomotives for a steam train railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=All A-B-O-O-O-A-R-D For Wild West in 1981 |date=July 12, 1978 |page=B8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When plans for [[Canada's Wonderland]] were announced, Holer decided to further increase the park's expansion plans, adding a Gothic castle, canals and the world's largest roller coaster, for a total cost of {{CAD|80 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=A Place to Stand .. In Line |first1=Rosie |last1=Dimanno |first2=Bill |last2=Dampier |date=May 26, 1979 |page=I14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Dragon Mountain]]" roller coaster opened in 1983 along with other rides. At a cost of {{CAD|9 million}}, the roller coaster opened without {{CAD|3 million}} reproductions of the American and Horseshoe falls, postponed to the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Marineland builds thrillseeker's dream |date=April 13, 1983 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Holer announced the postponement of part of the expansion, citing an 86% increase in municipal property taxes, and threatened to move the facility across the river to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Niagara Falls tourist dollar booty in cross-border battle |first=James |last=Gray |date=October 14, 1984 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Marineland purchased [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]], a killer whale from an aquarium in [[Hafnarfjörður]], Iceland. Keiko started performing for the public and developed skin [[lesion]]s indicative of poor health. He was then sold for $350,000{{sfn|Lemieux|2009|p=271}} to [[Reino Aventura]] (now named [[Six Flags México]]), an amusement park in Mexico City, in 1985.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Keiko was the star of the movie ''[[Free Willy]]'' in 1993. After a time at the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]], (early 1996 to late 1998) Keiko was returned to a sea pen in Iceland in and was released to the ocean in July 2002. He swam to Norway, eventually settling in the Taknes fjord in November 2002, where he was not catching fish and had little contact with wild Orcas; until his death, Keiko was fed daily by the Keiko Project group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1449436/Whale-star-of-Free-Willy-dies-after-return-to-wild.html |title=Whale star of 'Free Willy' dies after return to wild |first=Adam |last=Lusher |date=December 14, 2003 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Rekindling the Waters: The Truth about Swimming with Dolphins |first=Leah |last=Lemieux |page=271 |ref=harv |publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ8sxNizhoIC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Keiko+returned+to+the+wild+marineland+Mexico&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Keiko%20returned%20to%20the%20wild%20marineland%20Mexico&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keiko died of pneumonia in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-NMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Keiko+released+iceland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24s3ni9fVAhVo2oMKHUJhCP0Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Keiko%20released%20iceland&amp;f=false |title=Iceland |first=Andrew |last=Evans |page=67 |year=2014 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, an unidentified trainer was taken to the hospital after he fell off the park's male killer whale, Kandu 7 and was dragged by his leg around the pool during a trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matteo|first=Enzo di|title=Mayhem in Marineland|newspaper=NOW Magazine|date=October 10–16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://niagaraatlarge.com/2010/02/28/seaworld-marineland-and-the-dangers-of-keeping-whales-in-captivity/ |title=SeaWorld, Marineland And The Dangers Of Keeping Whales In Captivity |website=niagaraatlarge.com |first=Dan |last=Wilson |date=February 28, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Marineland added [[walrus]]es to the marine mammals it kept. The first walrus was "Sonja", from the [[Moscow Zoo]]. It was joined by "Zeus" and "Apollo" two months later and "Pandora", "Buttercup" and "Buddy" in 2002. Marineland brought over "Smooshi" and "Azul" in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Canadian Newswire |author=Marineland |title=Marineland Canada: Demonstrating A Commitment to Walrus Care Since 2001 |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2017/30/c1446.html |date=May 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Marineland opened the "Arctic Cove" [[beluga whale]] exhibit. Beluga whales were held in Friendship Cove from May 30, 1999, until the opening of Arctic Cove in late 2003. Belugas returned to Friendship Cove in December 2008 following the importation of eight individuals and has held belugas since. Upon the recent 2014 opening season, several belugas were switched between Arctic Cove and Friendship Cove. In 2004, Marineland opened the "Sky Screamer" triple tower ride.

In 2004, Marineland bought the Green Oaks Mobile Home Park across the street from the park with plans to relocate maintenance buildings to the site. In 2009, Marineland evicted 47 families that were tenants at the park. The tenants appealed to the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board, lost their case and were ordered off the property by March 2010. One tenant committed suicide while others continued to fight Marineland but had to leave in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gohomeless.ca/ |title=Green Oaks Homeless |accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holer was ordered to pay $11,000 each to several tenants for harassment.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Holer died on June 23, 2018, aged 82.&lt;ref name="gm-2018-07-22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc20180624"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marineland founder John Holer dead at 83 |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/marineland-john-holer-dead-1.4720149 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was praised as an "immigrant success story" by Senator Don Plett (Manitoba).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/marineland-founder-john-holer-dies-at-83-lawyer-says-1.3987059|title=Marineland founder John Holer dies at 83, lawyer says|first=Morgan|last=Lowrie|date=June 24, 2018|work=CTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holer had been seriously ill for five months, and passed away at his home on Chippewa Parkway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=St. Catharines Standard |url=https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/news-story/8691597-marineland-owner-john-holer-dies-at-83/ |title=Marineland owner John Holer dies at 83 |accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holer was survived by his wife Marie and son Peter.

The Mayor of Niagara Falls, [[Jim Diodati]], sees Marineland at a "crossroads" with three options: to continue the current business model, to sell its 1,000 acres of land to real estate developers or to become an amusement park without animals. Diodati favours the latter option.&lt;ref name="star-2018-06-24"/&gt; Marineland's lawyer Andrew Burns said that there would be no immediate changes to the business.&lt;ref name="cbc20180624"/&gt;  At the time of his death, Holer was working on a new aviary attraction for Marineland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://obittree.com/obituary/ca/ontario/niagara-falls/morse--son-funeral-home/john-holer/3541469/ |title=John Holer Obituary |publisher= |website=ObitTree |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal rights issues===
Since 2012, the park has been the subject of several allegations of poor conditions for its animals by former employees and animal activists have protested outside its gates on several occasions. The park has been inspected by the [[Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (OSPCA) and [[Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums]] (CAZA),&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-05-04"/&gt; many times over the years, some leading to orders issued by the OSPCA.&lt;ref name="star-2013-1-16"&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=OSPCA orders Marineland overhaul |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/01/16/ospca_orders_marineland_overhaul.html |first1=Linda |last1=Diebel |first2=Liam |last2=Casey |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Government of Ontario banned the practice of breeding and keeping orcas in captivity, while allowing Marineland to keep its one orca. Marineland's orca is therefore forced to live in captive social isolation, a situation with which Marineland itself has voiced displeasure. In November 2016 and January 2017, the OSPCA filed 11 animal cruelty-related charges against the park mainly related to land animals and birds.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/marineland-charged-with-five-counts-of-animal-cruelty/article33050651/|title=Marineland charged with five counts of animal cruelty|first=Liam|last=Casey|date=November 25, 2016|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News |first=Amara |last=Laughlin |date=January 9, 2017 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/marineland-charged-with-6-counts-animal-cruelty-1.3927659|title=Marineland charged with 6 new counts of animal cruelty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the OSPCA inspected Marineland again but found no issues of concern at that time.&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-05-04"/&gt; In May 2017, Marineland withdrew from CAZA claiming this was due to expansion-related work happening at the park, but stated that they would re-apply to CAZA once the work was completed. In August 2017, all of the charges were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Global News |first=Liam |last=Casey |date=August 10, 2017|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3660158/animal-cruelty-charges-dropped-against-marineland/|title=Animal cruelty charges dropped against Marineland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marineland has repeatedly stated publicly that the allegations are the work of disgruntled former employees, who have teamed up with activists wholly opposed to the keeping of animals in captivity and organizations which "seem to financially benefit from any resulting downturn in public opinion towards park operations". Marineland has further maintained that they make every effort to ensure the animals in their care are well provided for. The park employs a number of people who care for the animals day-to-day, as well as an experienced and qualified veterinary staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinelandcanada.com/education/caregivers/marine_mammal/ |title=Marine Mammal Care |website=Marineland Canada |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a private facility, Marineland must comply with federal and provincial regulations, as well as comply with several animal welfare enforcement agencies, including regular and "snap" inspections. Marineland has filed nine lawsuits against activists, former employees and the media,&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-8-10"/&gt; and a further lawsuit against the OSPCA.&lt;ref name="ts-1017-10-26"/&gt;

In 2012, articles were published by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' alleging animal mistreatment, resulting in negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hutton |first=Richard |date=May 21, 2016  |title=Hundreds turn out for opening day protest at Marineland |url=http://www.niagarathisweek.com/news-story/6566294-hundreds-turn-out-for-opening-day-protest-at-marineland/ |newspaper=Niagara This Week |location=Niagara Falls, ON |access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inspection by the OSPCA and CAZA, however, found "no issues of concern".&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-05-04"/&gt; The ''Star'' reported that the OSPCA issued orders to Marineland to improve the water conditions for animals at the park, and address specific issues with other animals and Marineland complied.&lt;ref name="star-2013-1-16"/&gt;

On November 25, 2016 and subsequently on January 9, 2017, the OSPCA charged Marineland with five counts of animal cruelty, and then another six counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sudbury.com/national/marineland-charged-with-6-new-counts-of-animal-cruelty-says-ospca-506103 |title=Marineland charged with 6 new counts of animal cruelty, says OSPCA |first=Liam |last=Casey |date=January 9, 2017 |website=Sudbury.com |publisher=Sudbury.com |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=A conviction on all counts could result in a fine up to $60,000, a lifetime ban on owning animals and up to two years in jail, according to the OSPCA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sets of charges were extensively covered by the news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Global News |first=Nick |last=Westoll |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3169440/marineland-faces-6-new-animal-cruelty-charges-ospca/ |title=Marineland charged with six new counts of animal cruelty: OSPCA |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/marineland-charged-with-6-counts-animal-cruelty-1.3927659|title=Marineland charged with 6 new counts of animal cruelty |first=Amara |last=McLaughlin |date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, the OSPCA inspected Marineland and found no areas of concern.&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-05-04"/&gt; On August 10, 2017, all of the charges were dropped because the prosecutor did not believe that the Crown could get a conviction,&lt;ref name="star-2017-8-10"/&gt; leaving the effect on the park's future uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CTV News |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/animal-cruelty-charges-dropped-against-marineland-1.3539996|title=Animal cruelty charges dropped against Marineland|first=Liam|last=Casey|date=August 10, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park subsequently filed a $21 million lawsuit against the SPCA for allegedly attempting to "destroy" the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/marineland-sues-ospca-for-21m-alleges-agency-wanted-to-destroy-theme-park-1.4374712|title=Marineland sues OSPCA alleging agency wanted to 'destroy' theme park - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marineland is not an accredited member of Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) or the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]. The company "voluntarily and temporarily" withdrew from CAZA in May 2017, stating it was expanding the area for animals and "will be continuing to work with CAZA to ensure that the expansion is successfully harmonized with CAZA principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niagarathisweek.com/news-story/7287347-park-renovations-behind-break-with-caza-marineland/|title=Park renovations behind break with CAZA: Marineland - NiagaraThisWeek.com|first=Richard|last=Hutton|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Marineland and its owner John Holer were involved in many controversies throughout the park's history. Animal rights activists have picketed regularly outside the park property for several years and continue to protest as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=St. Catharines Standard |url=https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/news-story/8620857-demonstration-at-marineland-on-opening-day/ |title=Demonstration at Marineland on opening day |date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the U.S. Department of Fisheries seized six [[bottlenose dolphin]]s that had been illegally caught by John Holer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

In 1983, Niagara Falls mayor [[Wayne Thomson]] resigned amid controversy over a vacation given as a gift by a Toronto development firm and a land purchase made by his then-fiancé Bonnie Dickson. His fiancé bought some land in Niagara Falls from a seller who did not want it to be sold to Marineland. Seven months later, she sold the plot to Marineland. Holer stated she acted as trustee and was accompanied by Thomson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Mayor's resignation puts a stop to probes of land deal, free trip  |date=December 21, 1983 |page=C10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Greenpeace]] was the first activist group to raise concerns about keeping killer whales in captivity. It objected to the keeping in principle, although it stated that Marineland was one of the better facilities. The level of concern grew in the 1990s. In 1997, a protest was held outside the park by [[Ric O'Barry]], the trainer of "[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]" of the television series. Other organizations present at the protest included Friends of the Dolphins, Zoocheck Canada and Earth Island Institute. The protesters alleged that Marineland separated mother and child killer whales too quickly and four other whales were stored in unsuitable facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Marineland picketed by Flipper's 1st trainer |date=July 6, 1997 |page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[SeaWorld]] won a court battle with Marineland over the fate of "[[List of captive orcas#Ikaika|Ikaika]]", a killer whale. Ikaika had been originally loaned to Marineland under the terms of a breeding loan agreement between the two organizations, but SeaWorld decided to terminate the agreement due to concerns about Ikaika's mental and physical well-being due to deteriorating conditions at the park. Marineland initially refused to return Ikaika, but was eventually ordered to by the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario Superior Court]] as well as pay $255,000 in compensation to SeaWorld for legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1061114--send-killer-whale-back-to-florida-court-tells-marineland |title=Send killer whale back to Florida, court tells Marineland |work=Toronto Star |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Phil Demers, trainer of the walrus "Smooshi," resigned from Marineland. He had been an employee of Marineland for 12 years and had been noted for his close relationship with Smooshi. Demers made public his concerns about Marineland and has been sued by Marineland.&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-8-10"/&gt; In Demers' version of accounts, Smooshi was moved from Marineland's barn to the Aquarium, where Demers said she deteriorated because of problems with the water. Smooshi was returned to the barn but problems returned. He asked for more walrus trainers, but his request was denied. By 2012, he had had responsibilities for hiring and training employees taken away, and he chose to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/08/15/marineland_heartache_for_smooshi_the_walrus_as_top_trainer_quits.html |title=Marineland: Heartache for Smooshi the walrus as top trainer quits |date=August 15, 2012 |first=Linda |last=Diebel |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to speak out about Marineland. According to Marineland, Demers was intending to star in a reality show as a "walrus whisperer" that was rejected by Marineland, had no management responsibilities and was not qualified to comment on marine mammal health. Marineland also alleges that Demers took drugs himself that were allocated for marine mammals. Marineland is taking legal action against Demers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Marineland - Who is Phillip Demers? |author=Marineland |publisher=Canadian Newswire |date=August 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2012, the ''Toronto Star'' published an article of Demers' account, alleging that many sea mammals at Marineland live in inhumane conditions and suffer from a variety of illnesses caused by problems with water quality and chronic understaffing. Holer denied the allegations in the report, which was largely based on interviews conducted with former Marineland employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1241961--marineland-animals-suffering-former-staffers-say |title=Marineland animals suffering, former staffers say |work= Toronto Star |date=August 15, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  declined to press charges, but did order changes in park procedures that were then implemented by Marineland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/25/marineland-charged-with-animal-cruelty.html|title=Marineland charged with animal cruelty|last=Alam|first=Hina|date=November 25, 2016 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2012, the ''Toronto Star'' published an article quoting former Marineland supervisor Jim Hammond alleging that Marineland owner, John Holer, had shot one of the baby deer in his park through the windpipe with a 12-gauge shotgun, leaving it to choke on its blood without dying.  Hammond claimed the park owner refused his pleas for humane euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1253334--marineland-allegations-of-poor-treatment-of-deer-bears |title=Marineland: Allegations of poor treatment of deer, bears |work=Toronto Star |date=September 8, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2012, the [[Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change|Ontario Ministry of the Environment]] announced an investigation into several mass animal graves at the park.  The ministry had no previous knowledge of the graves, as Marineland lacks permits for such use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1304879--marineland-environment-ministry-launches-probe-into-mass-animal-graves |title=Marineland: Environment ministry launches probe into mass animal graves &amp;#124; Toronto Star |work=Toronto Star |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an investigation by the ministry, Marineland was allowed to continue using a section of the site for animal burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Marineland  |url=http://www.marineland.ca/data/file/Marineland%20ECA%20Approval-Nov%202013-2.pdf |title=Environmental Compliance Approval |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2013, the ''Toronto Star'' published an article quoting Hammond and a local resident alleging that John Holer had shot two Labrador Retrievers that had escaped a neighbour's house and entered Marineland property. The article also mentioned that Hammond was told by Holer "to check if there were any collars . . . around their necks and if there were, to remove them." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/03/05/marineland_owner_john_holer_shot_dead_neighbours_dogs_according_to_witnesses.html |title=Marineland owner John Holer shot dead neighbours’ dogs, according to witnesses |work=Toronto Star |date=March 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, it was reported that the [[Ontario Veterinary College]] was investigating an unspecified number of veterinarians at Marineland.&lt;ref name="Diebelseptember"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/09/13/marineland_college_investigating_marineland_veterinarians.html |title=Marineland: College investigating Marineland veterinarians |last=Diebel|first=Linda |date=September 13, 2013|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, OSPCA investigated the claims of some former employees of Marineland claimed that the animals' health was being put at risk by low water quality. OSPCA used the results of the investigation to make suggestions to the subsequent provincial review of its animal welfare laws.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ospca-charges-marineland-animal-cruelty-1.3868114|title=Marineland charged with animal cruelty related to peacock, guinea hens and bears|last=McLaughlin|first=Amara|date=November 25, 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=November 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the Vancouver newspaper ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' published an article alleging that five harbour seals transferred from the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] had fell ill at Marineland due to "poor water chemistry". According to the article, one, "Pepper" died in 2006 from the conditions while the rest were blind. Marineland filed a {{CAD|600,000}} lawsuit in July 2014 against ''The Georgia Straight'' and the article's writer for defamation and damages. According to Marineland, Pepper did not die as described in the article and the others were not blind but were in fact generally healthy. It was the eighth lawsuit filed by Marineland since 2012, third against a media outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Niagara Falls Review |first=John |last=Law |title=Marineland sues Vancouver paper, eighth lawsuit since 2012 |date=November 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Government of Ontario took up debate of the keeping of orcas.&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;{{cite news |work=National Post |url=http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/people-dont-love-marineland-anymore-ontario-law-leaves-orca-floating-alone-in-niagara-falls/wcm/96767360-5631-477d-abfd-558d68f5190f |title='People don’t love Marineland anymore': Ontario law leaves orca floating alone in Niagara Falls |first=Ashley |last=Csanady |date=May 29, 2015 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Barker]] urged Ontario Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]] to order Marineland to give up Kiska and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Casey |first=Liam |work=The Canadian Press |title=Bob Barker wants killer whale included in ban |date= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2015, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the ''Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Amendment Act''. The act prohibits the possession or breeding of orcas in Ontario but allowed Marineland to keep its orca.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

On May 10, 2016, Marineland filed a lawsuit against filmmaker Zach Affolter to prevent the release of his documentary, ''Black Water''. The park alleges that the film contains footage illegally taken at Marineland, and is a violation of their policy preventing the use of footage for commercial purposes. Affolter responded by asserting that "''Black Water'' is meant as an educational, non-commercial film that dives into the moral question behind keeping cetaceans in captivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Law|first1=John |title=Marineland files lawsuit against teen filmmaker|url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2016/05/12/marineland-files-lawsuit-against-teen-filmmaker|work=Niagara Falls Review|publisher=Postmedia Network|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marineland demanded {{CAD|1}} million in damages for breach of its intellectual property rights. Affolter denied the allegations and said he had found the video of Kiska on [[Facebook]].

===Bill to ban captive cetaceans===
In 2015, the House of Commons passed Bill S-203, Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act, and sent it to the [[Senate of Canada]]. Marineland would be one of two facilities in Canada to be affected by the law after the bill is passed. Marineland, along with the Vancouver Aquarium, were opposed to the bill.

In September 2017, Green Party of Canada leader [[Elizabeth May]] filed a complaint to the Parliament of Canada's Lobbying Commissioner about Marineland's breaches of the Canadian ''Lobbying Act.'' Marineland had privately lobbied Members of Parliament and Senators without registering with the Lobbying Commissioner in efforts to stop Bill S-203. Marineland's lawyer Andrew Burns registered as a lobbyist in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/05/16/marineland-adds-its-name-to-federal-lobby-registry/ |title=Marineland adds its name to federal lobby registry |work=iPolitics.ca |first=Holly |last=Lake |accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Progressive Conservatives in the Senate, led by Sen. Don Plett, were accused of using procedural obstruction to keep the bill from moving to a vote. In June 2018, such senators added amendments intended to exclude Marineland and the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] from being covered by the bill. After three years, the eventual outcome was not yet known in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/ipolitics/federal/2018/10/04/bill-to-ban-whale-and-dolphin-captivity-is-being-stalled-in-the-senate-again.html|title=Bill to ban whale and dolphin captivity is being stalled in the Senate — again|first=Holly|last=Lake|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario SPCA charges ===

In 2012, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals received complaints of animal abuse at the park from former employees and issued orders to Marineland as to the standard of care they should be following. At that time, a full investigation was not conducted. On November 10, 2016, however, the agency received a formal 35-page complaint - compiled by a California-based group Last Chance for Animals - which included photographs and videos taken by a former Marineland employee whose identity has not been revealed to the public. ([[The Canadian Press]] obtained a copy of the complaint file which was reviewed by some members of the news media; only excerpts have been published.) At that time, the OSPCA began an investigation of possible animal abuse at the park using its staff and a veterinarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Liam Casey, The Canadian Press&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Marineland charged for five counts of animal cruelty in ongoing investigation |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/12/04/marineland-charged-for-five-counts-of-animal-cruelty-in-ongoing-investigation.html |newspaper=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |date=December 4, 2016 |access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2016, the OSPCA charged Marineland with five counts of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] under the Ontario SPCA Act over their treatment of [[peafowl]]s, [[guineafowl]]s, and [[American black bear]]s in the zoo portion of the park. The Ontario SPCA alleged that the animals were distressed and did not receive the required standard of care from Marineland. The company denied the allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hina |last=Alam |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/25/marineland-charged-with-animal-cruelty.html |title=Marineland charged with animal cruelty |work=Toronto Star |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marineland also provided a statement to The Canadian Press: "(Last Chance for Animals) is working together with the fired former employee to exact revenge over his firing and advance their radical cause and goal to shut Marineland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/complaint-alleges-animal-cruelty-at-marineland-park-denies-all-accusations-1.3188948 |title=Complaint alleges animal cruelty at Marineland; park denies all accusations |author=Liam Casey, The Canadian Press |date=December 4, 2016 |work=CTV News |access-date= |quote=The former employee, who requested anonymity for fear of being sued, said he quit on good terms and is not an animal activist and doesn't want the park to close.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also posted a commentary on their Web site indicating that it is "being attacked by disgruntled former employees again, who are working with a professional activist group that raises just under $2 million dollars per year to share their distorted view of facts about others." The post indicated that the company would "vigorously defend ourselves against these charges laid by the OSPCA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.marinelandblog.ca/ |title=What’s Really Going On At Marineland Canada |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 1, 2016 |publisher= Marineland Canada |access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A news article on August 10, 2017 stated that the park had started a lawsuit against former employee [[Philip Demers]], one of those who had filed complaints with the OSPCA, for $1.5 million and that this is only one of nine lawsuits against activists, former employees and the media since 2012. None of the suits has been resolved in court.&lt;ref name="nfr-2017-8-10"/&gt;

Six additional counts of animal cruelty were laid by the OSPCA on January 9, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/the-ontario-spca-charges-marineland-with-six-counts-of-animal-cruelty-2187043.htm |title=The Ontario SPCA charges Marineland with six counts of animal cruelty |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Marketwired |publisher=OSPCA |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=an additional 6 counts of animal cruelty under the Ontario SPCA Act; totaling 11 counts of animal cruelty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sammy |last=Hudes |title= Marineland charged with 6 new counts of animal cruelty|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/09/marineland-charged-with-6-new-counts-of-animal-cruelty.html |newspaper=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |date=January 9, 2017 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new charges related to the treatment of elk, red deer and fallow deer. Deputy chief Jennifer Bluhm of the OSPCA provided the following comment: "While the investigation is still ongoing, these are all the charges we expect to be laid in this case." On previous occasions, Marineland had stated that it would defend against charges in court. The company's first appearance to plead to the charges was set for January 26, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sudbury.com/national/marineland-charged-with-6-new-counts-of-animal-cruelty-says-ospca-506103 |title=Marineland charged with 6 new counts of animal cruelty, says OSPCA |author=Liam Casey, The Canadian Press |date=January 9, 2017 |website=Sudbury.com |publisher= |access-date=January 9, 2017 |quote=A conviction on all counts could result in a fine up to $60,000, a lifetime ban on owning animals and up to two years in jail, according to the OSPCA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Marineland posted another response on its website, critical of the OSPCA handling of the investigation and the charges, including the following comment: "We believe the OSPCA is continuing a publicity campaign at the behest of a band of discredited activists with little relevant expertise or knowledge, in an effort to avoid further embarrassment related to an ongoing investigation into the OSPCA’s perceived failure to protect animals that is being led by the same activists they are now firmly in bed with. ... We will hold the OSPCA to the high standards of Ontario’s legal system and require them to defend their charges to the fullest extent possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.marinelandblog.ca/ospca-lays-strangest-charges-yet-against-marineland-canada/ |title=OSPCA Lays Strangest Charges Yet Against Marineland Canada |author=Marineland |date=January 9, 2017 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2017, all charges were withdrawn in Niagara Falls Provincial court. The prosecutor stated that there was no likelihood of conviction and pursuit of the matters was found to not be in the public interest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/all-animal-cruelty-charges-dropped-against-marineland/article35934648/|title=All animal cruelty charges dropped against Marineland |first=Liam|last=Casey|date=August 10, 2017 |accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSPCA inspected the park a week later and did not find any issues of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CHCH-TV |url=http://www.chch.com/surprise-inspection-marineland-ospca/ |title=Surprise inspection of Marineland by the OSPCA |date=August 17, 2017 |accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Marineland filed a lawsuit against the OSPCA, alleging that the OSPCA launched its investigation purely to harm Marineland. "It was motivated by a series of improper objectives, including a desire to accomplish its own policy agenda, to mollify the animal activist community, to please its donors, and to effectively destroy Marineland." Marineland is seeking {{CAD|21 million}} in damages.&lt;ref name="ts-1017-10-26"&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=Marineland sues OSPCA, saying agency was out to ‘destroy’ theme park |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/10/26/marineland-sues-ospca-saying-agency-was-out-to-destroy-theme-park.html |date=October 26, 2017 |accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSPCA responded publicly that it "vehemently denies all of the allegations and will defend itself."&lt;ref name="ts-1017-10-26"/&gt;

A subsequent pleading by the OSPCA's stated that any losses suffered by Marineland due to the charges "are entirely the result of its own misconduct and that (Marineland) is the author of its own misfortune."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news-story/8038439-marineland-the-author-of-its-own-misfortune-ospca/|title=Marineland 'the author of its own misfortune': OSPCA|date=January 5, 2018|work=Brampton Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beluga whale deaths===

* Dee, a beluga whale imported from Russia, died in August 2000 after a petting session.&lt;ref name="whales.org"/&gt; At the time, news reports indicated that this was the third recent death; in December 1999 another female beluga died from liver failure and  in March 2000, "Malik", a three-year-old orca, died.&lt;ref name="whales.org"/&gt; This led two animal rights groups to urge the [[Government of Canada]] to issue a moratorium on the import of belugas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Record | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/therecord/doc/266899941.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+19%2C+2000&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Third+whale+dies+at+Marineland%3B+Animal+rights+groups+call+for+moratorium+on+imports | title=Abstract: Third whale dies at Marineland; Animal rights groups call for moratorium on imports | date=August 19, 2000 | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sasha, a beluga whale born in 2008 at Marineland, died around October 10, 2011, several days before the off-season.
* On May 28, 2012, a nine-month-old beluga, Skoot, born to Skyla, succumbed to its injuries after a two-hour attack by two adult males in a shared tank. Only an untrained guide was on hand to try to stop the attack and he said it took a long time for trainers to respond. By that time, the calf had already died. Marineland's John Holer told the news media that the calf died because of meningitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/08/16/marineland_baby_belugas_death_raises_as_many_questions_as_answers.html|title=Marineland baby beluga’s death raises as many questions as answers |work=Toronto Star |first=Linda |last=Diebel |date=August 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2013, an aquatic inventory website (Ceta-Base.org) reported that belugas Luna and Charlotte were both deceased and said these were the latest of 18 other beluga deaths over the years. The site's August 2017 report indicates additional beluga deaths, some without a date, with the most recent (named R1) having been on July 30, 2015.&lt;ref name="cetabase.org"/&gt; Charlotte died from a metabolic disorder; the cause of death for Luna was not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/05/31/beluga-whales-deaths-at-marineland-spark-outrage |title=Beluga whales deaths at Marineland spark outrage|work=Toronto Sun |date=May 31, 2013 |first=John |last=Law |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2017, Gia (who had been born at the park) died suddenly. A preliminary report indicated that the cause may have been a twisted small intestine that resulted in a fatal blockage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/08/14/beloved-beluga-whale-gia-has-died-says-marineland.html |title=Beloved beluga whale Gia has died, says Marineland |work=Toronto Star |author=The Canadian Press |date=August 14, 2017 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ceta-Base site indicates that Gia had been born in 2012.&lt;ref name="cetabase.org"/&gt;

===Orca deaths===
A ''Toronto Star'' report in November 2012 stated that "Marineland has had 26 killer whales over roughly three decades, according to ... Zoocheck Canada. Of these, 16 died at Marineland. ...

==Advertising==
Marineland's main advertising comes through a series of radio and television commercials with the [[jingle]] "Everyone Loves Marineland", sung by [[Suzie McNeil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Niagara Falls Review |title=Marineland jingle McNeil's biggest hit |first=John |last=Law |url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2010/03/30/marineland-jingle-mcneils-biggest-hit |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has since asked for her recording to no longer be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Toronto Star |title=‘Everyone loves Marineland!’ singer wants voice pulled from commercials |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/08/16/everyone_loves_marineland_singer_wants_voice_pulled_from_commercials.html |first=Graham |last=Slaughter |date=August 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marineland has also used other slogans over the years in its advertising:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1891">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Metope''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|t|oʊ|p|iː}} ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μετώπη}}) was a river [[nymph]], the daughter of the river [[Ladon river|Ladon]].&lt;ref name="Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 3. 12. 6"&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.12.6 3.12.6]&lt;/ref&gt; Her waters were near the town of [[Stymphalus (Arcadia)|Stymphalus]] in the [[Peloponnesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 6. 83&lt;/ref&gt; She married the river god [[Asopus]] by whom she had several (either 12 or 20) daughters, including [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], [[Salamis (mythology)|Salamis]], [[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], [[Euboea (mythology)|Euboea]], [[Tanagra]], [[Thespia (mythology)|Thespia]], [[Thebe (daughter of Asopus and Metope)|Thebe]], [[Korkyra (mythology)|Corcyra]], [[Ismene#Daughter of Asopus|Ismene]], and [[Harpina]]; and possibly sons, including [[Pelagon]] and [[Ismenus]].&lt;ref name="Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 3. 12. 6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 72. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The question of the exact parentage of these children of Asopus is very vague.

She may or may not be identical to '''Metope''', consort of the river god [[Sangarius (mythology)|Sangarius]].

'''Metope''' is also the name of the daughter of King [[Echetus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3074">The '''Negotiations of Bulgaria with the Central Powers and the Entente''' were attempts of the two belligerents in [[World War I]], the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] to involve [[Bulgaria]] in the war on their side. They are also called '''The Bulgarian summer of 1915'''.

When the war broke out the country was in an unfavourable situation - the country had just suffered a national catastrophe following the [[Second Balkan War]] in which [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] defeated Bulgaria (with the Bulgarian army being victorious) and took large territories populated mainly with [[Bulgarians]]. In August 1914, nearly a month after the war broke out the Bulgaria Prime-minister [[Vasil Radoslavov]] declared that Bulgaria would remain [[Neutral country|neutral]]. That, however, was only temporary as the Bulgarian government expected an opportune moment and favourable terms to enter the war and regain its lands. On 19 August, she signed [[Ottoman–Bulgarian alliance|an alliance with Turkey]].

Bulgaria was important for both belligerents because of its strategic geo-political position on the Balkans and its strong army. If Bulgaria entered the war on the side of the Central Powers [[Serbia]] would have been defeated which could influence the still neutral [[Romania]] and [[Greece]]. If Bulgaria allied itself with the Entente it would have disrupted the links of [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and would have taken the straits opening a sea route to [[Russia]]. The Entente offered Bulgaria Eastern [[Thrace]] to the west of the line Midia-[[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] and uncertain guarantees for [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. However, Serbia and Greece were reluctant to make any concessions to Bulgaria.

The Central Powers offered [[Vardar Macedonia]] and eastern Serbia and in case Romania or Greece enter the war [[Southern Dobrudzha]] and [[Aegean Macedonia]] respectively. Germany also guaranteed a 500 million marks military loan. In September Bulgaria signed the [[Bulgaria-German treaty (1915)|Bulgaria-German treaty]], [[Secret Bulgarian-German agreement]], the [[Military convention between Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria]] and the [[Bulgarian-Turkish convention (1915)|Bulgarian-Turkish convention]].

A '''POL valve''' (originally for Prest-O-Lite) is a gas connection fitting used on [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] cylinders.

The oldest standard for such connections, it is still the most common such fitting in some countries such as [[Australia]]&lt;ref name="elgas"&gt;[http://www.elgas.com.au/blog/467-what-are-pol-valves-a-pol-cylinders www.elgas.com]&lt;/ref&gt;. POL valves are legal and quite common in the United States, especially on larger containers, although certain uses (smaller portable containers) require a modified version of the POL valve that includes some safety features.

It was developed by the [[Prest-O-Lite]] company, hence the name, and uses a [[left-handed thread]].&lt;ref name="elgas" /&gt;

The '''Pickens Plan''' is an [[energy policy]] proposal announced July 8, 2008, by [[United States|American]] businessman [[T. Boone Pickens]]. Pickens wants to reduce American dependence on imported oil by investing approximately [[United States dollar|$US]]1 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] in new [[wind farm|wind turbine farms]] for power generation, which he believes would allow the [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas]] currently used for power generation to be shifted to fuel [[Compressed natural gas trucks|CNG trucks]] and other heavy vehicles. Pickens stated that his plan could reduce by $300 billion (43%) the amount the country spends annually on foreign oil.&lt;ref name="dp001"&gt;{{cite news

==Proposal==
The main proposals of the plan are:&lt;ref name="sbj07"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Private industry would fund and install thousands of [[wind turbine]]s in the [[Great Plains]], which Pickens refers to as the potential "wind corridor" of the United States due to favorable wind resources and geographic location. Pickens estimates that these turbines could generate enough power to provide 20 percent or more of the country's electricity supply.
# Government would pay for electric power transmission lines to connect the turbine farms to the power grid. They would provide energy to the Midwest, South and Western regions of the country.
# With wind energy providing a large portion of the nation's electricity, the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants would be used instead as a fuel for thousands of vehicles. To increase efficiency, the Plan puts an emphasis on natural gas-burning fleets of trucks and buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pickens thinks his plan that would provide 22% of electricity from wind power and the conversion for vehicles from gasoline to gas could be accomplished in less than 10 years with the right leadership.&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{cite web

===Wind power status and potential===
{{further|Wind power in the United States}}
Wind power had been experiencing [[exponential growth]] in the United States for several years when Pickens announced his plan.&lt;ref name="texas_energy_report"&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=2008-12-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wind power in [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]] grew very rapidly, 2400% from 1999 to 2007. In another large state, California, wind generation increased by 48% in the same period.&lt;ref name="texas_energy_report" /&gt; The cost of wind power generation has decreased by about 80% over the last 20 years because of technological advances and is now cost-competitive with other energy sources. Wind-generated electricity can be produced at 5 to 6 cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A yardstick used to determine locations with high potential wind energy production is referred to as [[Wind profile power law#Wind power density|Wind Power Density]] (WPD). It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location, frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are frequently prepared for a particular area described, for example, as "Mean Annual Power Density at 50 Meters." The results of the above calculation are entered into an index developed by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] and referred to as "NREL CLASS." The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class.&lt;ref&gt;Kansas Wind Energy Project, Affiliated Atlantic &amp; Western Group Inc, 5250 W 94th Terrace, Prairie Village, Kansas 66207&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pickens Plan calls for increasing the installed wind power capacity by at least a factor of ten from its 2008 level by 2018.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This would tap only a small fraction of [[Wind power in the United States#Wind power by state|total U.S. wind power potential]], which is estimated to be as much as 16 times more than the year-2005 electricity demand in the United States.&lt;ref name=Lu2009&gt;{{Cite journal

Pickens says that his plan could generate enough wind power to provide 22 percent of the country's electricity.&lt;ref name=Smith2008/&gt; The [[Institute for Energy Research]] (IER), an organization that is funded by the oil industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickens acknowledges that natural gas would still be required for peak electricity demand and additional infrastructure would be needed to distribute the wind energy across the country.&lt;ref name=Smith2008/&gt; New transmission lines, worth $64 billion to $128 billion, would be needed to carry the power from the windmills to the cities.&lt;ref name=Baker09012008&gt;{{cite news

Pickens testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and said the government should begin building transmission lines for wind-generated power in the same way that President Eisenhower did by declaring an emergency to build the interstate highway system in the 1950s and 1960s. As an alternative, Pickens proposed that the government should provide the right of way on private land and extend tax credits so the private sector can build the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Intermittency===
{{Main|Intermittent power source|Wind power#Intermittency and penetration limits|l2=Wind intermittency}}

One of the [[Wind power#Intermittency and penetration limits|challenges]] with using wind to replace natural gas is the intermittent nature of wind energy, since the same wind conditions are not always present. 
According to a 2007 study by Archer &amp; Jacobson published in the ''Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology'', interconnecting ten or more widely separated wind farms allows 33 to 47% of the total energy produced (15–20% of nominal capacity) to be used as reliable, [[baseload power|baseload electric power]], as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.&lt;ref name="connecting_wind_farms"&gt;{{cite web

To dispatch power when the wind isn't blowing, backup power plants would be needed, according to Paul Fremont, an electric-utility analyst at the investment bank Jefferies &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves2008/&gt; Natural gas plants can quickly be brought online to supply peaking capacity during periods of low wind or peak demand.&lt;ref name=Stier20080708&gt;{{cite web

According to Art Holland, a director at Pace Global Energy Services, the US will need to replace 140,000 MW of gas plant capacity over the next 10 years due to plant retirements.&lt;ref name=Platts20080710&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This translates to twice as much wind capacity due to the difference in [[capacity factor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Instead of dispatching additional power generation, energy could be conserved on demand. The [[Smart power grid]], an intelligent power distribution network currently being researched and developed, can [[Energy demand management|reduce power consumption at the client side]] during peak hours and thereby lessen our dependence on gas for [[Load following power plant|load following]].&lt;ref name=smartgrid&gt;{{cite web

[[Grid energy storage|Storing electricity]] is currently significantly more expensive than using [[dispatchable generation]], but it can be done.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Wind energy can be stored by [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumping water uphill]] when the wind is blowing, and then releasing it through turbine generators when the electricity is needed. TVA's [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant]] near Chattanooga, TN is just one example of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity#Worldwide list of pumped storage plants|many such installations]] that already exist in the US. Another option is to [[Grid energy storage#Hydroelectric dams|uprate the peak generating capacity]] of existing hydroelectric dams by adding more generator units;&lt;ref name="burec_hydro"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; this allows a hydroelectric plant to buffer the variable output of wind farms on the grid, by accumulating river water during periods of strong winds, and releasing extra water when winds are calm and power demand is high. A dam that impounds a large reservoir can store and release large amounts of water by adjusting the reservoir level within a few meters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Compressed-air energy storage]] is another energy storage mechanism. When there is excess electrical energy production, air is compressed and stored in a limestone cavern. Then when the energy is needed again, the compressed air generates electricity by blowing through a turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Vanadium redox batteries]] are being used to store energy and level loads from wind generation projects. The excess energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte. The reaction can be reversed, which allows the battery to be charged, discharged and recharged.

===Making the transition===
[[File:Solaris Urbino 12 LE CNG in Kielce, Poland.jpg|thumb|300px|CNG Powered Bus]]
Pickens' Plan proposes that the natural gas that is currently used to fuel power plants be used instead as a fuel for class 7 and 8 semis. Ken Medlock, a research fellow at the [[James Baker Institute|Baker Institute for Public Policy]] at Rice University, says that the US will continue to use natural gas for electric power generation.&lt;ref name=Baker09012008/&gt; Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, making it an increasingly popular fuel for power plants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Gas plants also produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The technology needed for [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) vehicles such as City buses, fork lifts and passenger cars with CNG drivetrains is available now. Honda sells the [[Honda Civic GX|Civic GX]], with a {{convert|170|mi|km|adj=on}} range. In addition, it is possible to convert vehicles to run on CNG in addition to leaving the conventional fuel injection intact, allowing the driver to switch back and forth at will. Kits are available for the do-it-yourselfer. One can buy a CNG compressor called Phill that hooks up to the city natural gas line making it possible to refuel a CNG car at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the other hand, the IER believes that natural gas vehicles are "a niche product."&lt;ref name="IER001"/&gt; Patricia Monahan, believes "It's going to be a big price tag" to switch to CNG vehicles. Monahan considers CNG an excellent fuel for running small fleets of vehicles which log heavy mileage per vehicle, such as buses and garbage trucks.&lt;ref name=Baker09012008/&gt; Vehicles which use large amounts of fuel realize savings more quickly from the lower price of CNG relative to diesel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Cost of wind vs. natural gas===
According to Jerry Taylor, senior fellow at the [[Cato Institute]], using wind to generate most of the nation's electricity would undoubtedly result in higher retail electric rates because wind power is twice as expensive as natural gas-fired generation "and probably more if you take out the subsidies."&lt;ref name=Platts20080710/&gt; However, the [[American Wind Energy Association]] points out that the cost of wind power has dropped by more than 90% in the last 20 years and expects the cost to continue to decline as the industry matures. In contrast, the cost of natural gas is expected to rise. Moreover, the effects on the environment and public health for natural gas are estimated to cost some 0.5 to 2.0 cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Similar costs from wind are marginal.

===Peak gas===
{{Update|this section|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Peak gas}}
[[File:US Natural Gas Production.svg|thumb|US gas production since 1900, source: US EIA]]
The use of natural gas is a key component to Picken's proposal. There are concerns, however, that gas production has already reached its maximum production rate, a point known as [[peak gas]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} US gas production peaked in 1973 at about 24.1 trillion cubic feet, declined until 1985, and has been slowly increasing over the last 23 years. (see figure on left).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]]
 |date=2008-11-26
 |accessdate=2008-12-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to peak theory, the rate of production enters a [[gas depletion|terminal decline]] after the peak. Peak gas has already been confirmed by Exxon's CEO Lee Raymond. In 2005, he said to Reuters that "Gas production has peaked in North America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2008-10-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Reuters article continues to say "While the number of U.S. rigs drilling for natural gas has climbed about 20 percent over the last year and prices are at record highs, producers have been struggling to raise output." John DeCicco, a senior fellow at [[Environmental Defense]], is critical of the plan because it assumes that gas would remain cheap despite growing demand and increasing reliance on imports as evidenced by proposals for [[LNG]] terminals.&lt;ref name=Stier20080708/&gt;

However, implementing Pickens Plan does not require an increase in the supply of natural gas; it calls for a ''shift'' in its use, rather than an ''increase''. Natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the United States for more than two decades. Proven recoverable U.S. gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since 1996 and are about the same as in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Nuclear power vs. wind power===

===Gore's Global Warming vs. Pickens Plan===
The plans of T. Boone Pickens and Al Gore have some similarities - each lessens the dependence on fossil fuels - but differ in their eventual goals. Pickens specifically wants to see [[energy security]] by increasing the use of domestic energy sources including fossil fuels while Gore wants to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels altogether to stop [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="Melcher08"/&gt; Pickens claims to have a plan that could accomplish this with existing technology, while Gore advocates new research to reduce costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} A study by the [[European Renewable Energy Council]] states that the burning of fossil fuels for energy could be eliminated globally by 2090 using existing technology, and earlier for western nations.&lt;ref name="ErecRep01"&gt;{{cite news

==Dependence on foreign fuels==
Pickens estimates that his plan would cut oil imports by 38 percent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Patricia Monahan, deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists thinks differently. She questions the wisdom of trying to replace large amounts of imported oil with another fossil fuel, especially considering that the United States already has to import 19 percent of the natural gas it uses.&lt;ref name=Baker09012008/&gt; The US has been steadily increasing its imports of natural gas since 1985 (see figure to the left),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jerry Taylor, senior fellow at the [[Cato Institute]], is that "foreign oil is not bad; it is good." The US is now importing about 70% of its oil needs annually because it is cheaper than other forms of energy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Taylor says that if compressed natural gas is the best option for transportation fuel then "the markets will see it," and over time CNG could outperform gasoline as a cheaper transportation fuel.&lt;ref name=Platts20080710/&gt;

==Questions over Pickens' motives and methods==
Many critics of the Pickens Plan highlight ways that Pickens could potentially benefit personally from the plan. For instance, Pickens owns the water rights to a huge ancient aquifer in the Texas Panhandle and overall owns more water than anyone else in the U.S.&lt;ref name="bw002"&gt;{{cite news| author = Susan Berfield| title = There will be water| url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_25/b4089040017753.htm| publisher = ''Business Week''| date = 2008-06-12| accessdate = 2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing water demands and drought may make cities in the Great Plains willing to purchase water at high prices. Implementing Pickens Plan would give him rights to build electric transmission lines, and by getting a wider right of way it would allow Pickens to build water pipelines.&lt;ref name="pm001"&gt;{{cite news| author = Michael Milstein| title = Beyond Wind Plan, Pickens Eyes Pipelines in Drought-Ridden U.S. Popular Mechanics| url = http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4275059.html| publisher = ''Popular Mechanics'' | date = 2008-07-25| accessdate = 2008-08-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar strategy was attempted in Texas, where Pickens is building a wind farm that will bring electricity to Dallas, Texas. The proposed pipeline would have followed the same {{convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} corridor as the electric transmission lines from the wind farms, which was to be seized for utility use from private owners through eminent domain. Many Texas landowners and legislators denounced the plan, particularly the fact that it allowed eminent domain to be exercised by an agency consisting only of T.

Possibly as a move against such accusations{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}, Pickens has donated over $700 million to philanthropic causes. In the last few years, he has often been on the ''Chronicle of Philanthropy'''s list of top U.S. philanthropists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS249707+21-May-2008+BW20080521 "T.

{{quote|"When it comes to the Pickens Plan, the burr under my saddle is Pickens himself. I mean, isn't an oil guy selling air and gas a little like [[Donald Trump]] pitching poverty? It's downright uncomfortable."| Jay McDonald&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/pickens-plan-needs-better-pitchman-1.aspx Pickens Plan Needs Better Pitchman] by Jay MacDonald, ''Bankrate'', January 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Real concerns over natural gas being used for both home heat and vehicle fuel are that they may create shortages every year in the winter months when demand for home heating natural gas skyrockets. Since many American home owners already use natural gas to heat their homes, a huge increase in demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel combined with the existing huge home heating demand based on harsh winter temperatures, could drive up natural gas prices ever year. This could be especially economically devastating to family budgets during the holiday months when people normally allocate more of their money for holiday shopping. Having to pay more for vehicle fuel and home heat at the same time (because both would be the same product) could have a major economic impact on the nation every year.

Another concern is that the reasoning behind the big immediate push for a natural gas future, is to lock out possible development and implementation of more viable renewable energy sources. If people can be convinced that natural gas is the best possible future, and a large expenditure can be made now for a massive natural gas infrastructure to use natural gas for vehicle fuel, it will be much more difficult to abandon natural gas as a vehicle fuel and move on to newer, less expensive renewable energy sources as they become more viable to use. If renewable fuel sources are allowed to develop before the country can be convinced to move to natural gas, the window of opportunity to addict the country to natural gas may close, and the people associated with the natural gas industry would lose a lot of money now and in the foreseeable future.

The "Pickens Plan" (which many{{who|date=July 2012}} believe is designed to make Pickens himself much more wealthy) is a "non-profit" organization.

==Support campaign==
Pickens announced that he would spend $58 million on a multi-media effort to promote his proposal, through both [[old media]] (such as newspapers and television), and new media (including [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[Twitter]], and the creation of a new social network on the Pickens Plan website).&lt;ref name="bw001"&gt;{{cite news

Pickens is aided by his spokesperson Jay Rosser and political ad firm [[Joe Slade White]] &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="forbes001" /&gt;

To raise political support, Pickens planned to organize supporters by Congressional districts.&lt;ref name="wsj001" /&gt; He also met with the main party candidates for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States Presidential election]] to discuss his plan. He met with [[John McCain]] on August 15, 2008, and with [[Barack Obama]] on August 17, 2008.&lt;ref name="pickens_meets_mccain"&gt;

The '''Pontic–Caspian steppe''', '''Pontic steppe''' or '''Ukrainian steppe''' is the vast [[steppe]]land stretching from the northern shores of the [[Black Sea]] (called ''Euxeinos Pontos'' [Εὔξεινος Πόντος] in antiquity) as far east as the [[Caspian Sea]], from [[Moldova]] and eastern [[Ukraine]] across the [[Southern Federal District]] and the [[Volga Federal District]] of [[Russia]] to western [[Kazakhstan]], forming part of the larger [[Eurasian steppe]], adjacent to the [[Kazakh steppe]] to the east. It is a part of the [[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]] temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands [[ecoregion]] of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]].

The area corresponds to [[Cimmerians|Cimmeria]], [[Scythia]], and [[Sarmatia]] of [[classical antiquity]]. Across several millennia the steppe was used by numerous tribes of nomadic horsemen, many of which went on to conquer lands in the settled regions of [[Europe]] and in western and southern Asia.

The term '''Ponto-Caspian region''' is used in [[biogeography]] for plants and animals of these steppes, and animals from the Black, Caspian, and [[Sea of Azov|Azov]] seas. Genetic research has identified this region as the most probable place where [[Domestication of the horse|horses were first domesticated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090423142541.htm|title=Mystery Of Horse Domestication Solved?|author=|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dominant [[Kurgan hypothesis]] in [[Indo-European studies]], the Pontic–Caspian steppe was the homeland of the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], and these same speakers were the original domesticators of the horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World]]| author=David W.

==Geography and ecology==
The Pontic steppe covers an area of {{convert|994000|km2}}, extending from eastern [[Romania]] across southern [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]] and northwestern [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The Pontic steppe is bounded by the East European [[Forest steppe|forest-steppe]] to the north, a transitional zone of mixed grasslands and [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]].

To the south, the Pontic steppe extends to the Black Sea, except the [[Crimean Mountains|Crimean]] and western Caucasus mountains' border with the sea, where the [[Crimean Submediterranean forest complex]] defines the southern edge of the steppes. The steppe extends to the western shore of the Caspian Sea in the [[Dagestan]] region of Russia, but the drier [[Caspian Depression|Caspian lowland desert]] lies between the Pontic steppe and the northwestern and northern shores of the Caspian. The [[Kazakh Steppe]] bounds the Pontic steppe on the southeast.

The Ponto-Caspian seas are the remains of the [[Turgai Sea]], an extension of the [[Paratethys]] which extended south and east of the Urals and covering much of today's [[West Siberian Plain]] in the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]].

==History==
On 31 January 2014, the [[Parliament of Rwanda|Rwandan parliament]] enacted a law, splitting the Energy Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA) into two separate entities: (a) the Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC) and (b) the Rwanda Energy Group Limited (REG).&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; REG was incorporated as holding company, with two subsidiaries, owned 100 percent (1) the Energy Development Corporation Limited (EDCL) and (2) the Energy Utility Corporation Limited (EUCL). REG was created in July 2014.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt;

==Operations==
EDCL is responsible for identifying energy generation sites, procuring land, contractors and necessary infrastructure to develop power stations. Its mandate includes working in close collaboration with independent power producers IPPs in the country.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; EUCL is responsible for maintaining and improving power plants, transmission and distribution networks, as well as delivery of electrical energy to consumers at a sustainable fee.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt;

REG serves as coordinator and overseer of both corporations, which are free to carry out their day-to-day operation in accordance with their business plans and mandates. REG works closely with the Rwanda Ministry of Infrastructure to set and monitor national goals and objectives.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt;

==Governance==
Rwanda Energy Group Limited is overseen by an eight-person board of directors, chaired by [[Manasse Mbonye]] and deputized by [[Alice Rwema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reg.rw/index.php/about-us/board-of-directors |title=Rwanda Energy Group Limited: Board of Directors | accessdate=13 October 2017 | date=January 2017 |publisher=Rwanda Energy Group Limited (REG) |location=Kigali |author=REG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Executive Director]] and [[CEO]] of REG is [[Ron Weiss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=REG |location=Kigali |url=http://reg.rw/index.php/about-us/management |title=Ron Weiss is the Chief Executive Officer of Rwanda Energy Group Limited  | date=13 October 2017 |accessdate=13 October 2017 |publisher=Rwanda Energy Group Limited (REG)}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly Senior Vice-President for Engineering Projects &amp; Business Development at [[Israel Electric Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.israelscienceinfo.com/en/international/la-rwanda-energy-group-reg-signe-un-memorandum-avec-lisrael-electric-corporation-iec/ |

'''Radio Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Radio International}}) is [[Sweden]]'s official [[international broadcasting]] station. It is a non-commercial and politically independent public service broadcasting company.

==History==
SR International is part of [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), Sweden's non-commercial public-radio broadcasting organization. The service was founded in 1938, at the approach of [[World War II]], as a way of keeping Swedes living abroad informed of happenings in Sweden and of Swedish opinion. Programming was at first in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] only, but in 1939 [[English language|English-]] and [[German-language]] broadcasts were added.

After the war, further language services were added: in [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. At the close of the [[Cold War]], the services in French, Portuguese, and Spanish were gradually phased out and replaced by new services in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The latter services were withdrawn once [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] had developed their own independent media and joined the [[European Union]].

Radio Sweden also operated a service in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] between 2004 and 2009.

In the 1990s Radio Sweden was merged with SR's Immigrant Languages Department to form the SR International channel. For a while, immigrant language services, such as those in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], were additionally carried on [[shortwave]].

==Programming in other languages==
The Radio Sweden English Service seeks to provide a window on the diverse perspectives and issues in [[Sweden]] today.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Its programs and website offer a ”[[Smörgåsbord#Other use of the term in English|smörgåsbord]]” of news and current affairs, science and technology, lifestyle, and culture.

In the beginning of 2016, the international service underwent a major reorganization. English language news about Sweden for overseas listeners were moved to a 30 minutes-a-week show on P2 and to social media. Minority languages service was further focused on those minorities living in Sweden and integrated with Swedish language services. 

Service in languages of the oppressed nations, such as Somali, were moved to an independent organization. News for overseas listeners in foreign languages other than English, such as Russian and German, has been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6249380&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been several foreign-leagugaes services in the history of Radio Sweden. The German Programm got disfunct after 76 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=6379933 German Service of SR&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former programs==

===''Sweden Calling DXers''===
One of the most popular programs on Radio Sweden was ''[[Sweden Calling DXers]]'', founded in 1948 by [[Arne skoog|Arne Skoog]]. He reasoned that [[shortwave listening]] or [[DXing]] was a very young hobby, and that by providing information in a weekly program for shortwave listeners about their hobby, Radio Sweden was teaching its own audience about how to listen better. While the first program was based solely on Arne's own listening, listeners were encouraged to write in with their own news, and soon virtually all of the program was based on listener's letters (an early example of interactvity).

The program was carried on Tuesdays in all of Radio Sweden's services except Swedish.

When Arne Skoog retired in connection with the program's 30th anniversary in 1978, the program was taken over by [[George Wood (Radio Sweden)|George Wood]], a member of the Radio Sweden English Service. After a number of years, as media changed, it began to cover less about shortwave, and more about satellite radio and television. Later coverage was extended to the Internet, the focus was shifted to concentrating on Swedish media, and the name of the English version of the program was changed to "MediaScan". "MediaScan" was the first English-language radio program in Europe (and the second overall in Europe) to post audio on the Internet (on the ftp sites [[funet|ftp.funet.fi]] and [[SUNET|ftp.sunet.se]], as well as via Internet Multicasting).

In 2001 the program was discontinued, but remains in a somewhat sporadic form on the Radio Sweden website.

===''The Saturday Show''===
Another popular Radio Sweden program was ''[[The Saturday Show (Radio Sweden)|The Saturday Show]]'', with [[Roger Wallis]] and Kim Loughran, which ran from 1967 to 1981. The program was launched to showcase Swedish rock and pop music in a world dominated by American and British rock. Using Radio Sweden's relatively high-powered medium wave transmitter on 1179&amp;nbsp;kHz, the entire program was 90 minutes in length, and featured many satirical sketches, often political and sometimes controversial. A 30-minute segment of the entire broadcast was the Radio Sweden shortwave program on Saturdays.

==End of radio broadcasting==
On October 20, 2010, Radio Sweden ceased broadcasts on shortwave and medium wave, as Swedish Radio's management decided that the Internet had matured enough to support international broadcasts. At the same time the English Service was extended to national broadcasts on FM, but programming on weekends was discontinued. Services in English also continue on satellite, both using Swedish Television's satellite and the [[World Radio Network]].

'''''Spoiled''''' (stylized as ''spOILed'') is a 2011 documentary film about energy [[myths]], [[environmental issues with energy]], the problems with [[alternative energy]], and the [[global warming controversy]] associated with energy. ''Spoiled'' also discusses [[wind energy]], [[solar energy]], [[fossil fuels]], [[green energy]], [[alternative energy]], and [[sustainable energy]] as a part of its [[renewable energy]] documentary scope.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spoiledthemovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Spoiled'' begins [[investigative journalism|investigating]] energy [[myths]] by asking if people today believe we are "addicted" to oil and if oil is destroying our lives the way other addictions do. The energy movie documentary explores humankind's relationship to oil addiction, and reveals a pattern of misinformation, disinformation, and deception about energy myths.
The renewable energy documentary investigates what is likely to be the greatest challenge ever faced by humanity; that of trying to run the modern world on less oil addiction.

'''Studtite''', [[chemical formula]] [(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]·2(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt; or UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O),&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; is a [[weathering|secondary]] [[uranium]] [[mineral]] containing [[peroxide]] formed by the [[alpha particle|alpha]]-[[radiolysis]] of water during formation.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;[http://www.kubatko.com/studtitestructure.pdf Studtite: The first structure of a peroxide mineral]&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs as pale yellow to white needle-like [[crystal]]s often in [[Crystal habit|acicular]], white sprays.

Studtite was originally described by Vaes in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Annales de la Société Géologique de Belgique - 1947 - pp B212 to B226- J.F. Vaes - Six nouveaux minéraux d'urane provenant de Shinkolobwe (Katanga) -&lt;/ref&gt; from specimens from [[Shinkolobwe]], Katanga Copper Crescent, [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] (Shaba), [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and has since been reported from several other localities. The mineral was named for Franz Edward Studt, an English [[Prospecting|prospector]] and [[geologist]] who was working for the Belgians.

When exposed to air studtite converts over a short time to the '''metastudtite''' UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) form. Despite their apparent chemical simplicity, these two uranyl species are the only reported peroxide minerals.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;

They may also be readily formed on the surface of [[nuclear waste]] under long-term storage and have been found on the surface of spent [[nuclear fuel]] stored at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington nuclear site]].&lt;ref name=UCD&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1090259 | volume=302 | title=Stability of Peroxide-Containing Uranyl Minerals | journal=Science | pages=1191–1193 | laysummary = http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=6810 | laysource = UC Davis | pmid=14615533 | date=November 2003 | author=Kubatko KA, Helean KB, Navrotsky A, Burns PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been reported that studtite has since formed on the [[Corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]] ''lavas'' that were created during the course of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear plant accident]].&lt;ref name=UCD/&gt;  Thus, there is considerable evidence that [[uranyl peroxide]]s such as studtite and metastudtite will be important alteration phases of [[nuclear waste]], possibly at the expense of other minerals, such as [[Uranium oxide|uranyl oxides]] and [[silicates]], which have been more thoroughly studied and are better understood. The formation of these minerals may impact the long-term performance of [[deep geological repository]] sites such as [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]].&lt;ref name=UCD/&gt; Due to insufficient information about these minerals it is unknown if they will make [[radioactive waste]]s more or less stable, but the presence of studtite and metastudtite provides a pathway for mobilizing insoluble U(IV) from the corroding fuel surface into soluble [[uranyl]] species.&lt;ref name=pnas14&gt;{{cite journal|author= Guo X., Ushakov S.V., Labs S., Curtius H., Bosbach D. and Navrotsky A.|title= Energetics of Metastudtite and Implications for Nuclear Waste Alteration|journal= Proc.

Satellite image from [[NASA]]. The yellow line encloses the two ecoregions. The green line separates the Succulent Karoo, on the west, from the [[Nama Karoo]], on the east. National boundaries are shown in black.]]
The '''Succulent Karoo''' is a [[deserts and xeric shrublands|desert]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5458/|title=Succulent Karoo Protected Areas - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The Succulent Karoo stretches along the coastal strip of southwestern Namibia and South Africa's [[Northern Cape Province]], where the cold [[Benguela Current]] offshore creates frequent fogs. The ecoregion extends inland into the uplands of South Africa's [[Western Cape Province]]. It is bounded on the south by the [[Mediterranean climate]] [[fynbos]], on the east by the [[Nama Karoo]], which has more extreme temperatures and variable rainfall, and on the north by the [[Namib Desert]].

==Flora==
The Succulent Karoo is notable for the world's richest flora of [[succulent plant]]s, and harbours about one-third of the world’s approximately 10,000 succulent species. 40% of its succulent plants are endemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://enviroliteracy.org/ecosystems/hotspots-of-biodiversity/succulent-karoo/|title=Succulent Karoo - The Environmental Literacy Council|work=The Environmental Literacy Council|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is extraordinarily rich in [[geophyte]]s, harbouring approximately 630 species.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is a centre of diversity and [[endemism]] for [[reptile]]s and many [[invertebrate]]s. Of the ecoregion’s 50 [[scorpion]] species, 22 are endemic. [[Monkey beetle]]s, largely endemic to southern Africa, are concentrated in the Succulent Karoo and are important [[pollinator]]s of the flora. So, too, are the [[Hymenoptera]] and [[Masarinae|masarine wasp]]s, and [[colletid]], [[fideliid]], and [[melittid]] bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1322|title=Southern Africa: Southern Namibia into South Africa  {{!}} Ecoregions {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Approximately 15 [[amphibian]]s are found in this ecoregion, including three endemics; among the region’s 115 reptile species, 48 are endemic and 15 are strict endemics. The [[Sperrgebiet]] region is a hotspot for an unusual tortoise, the [[Nama padloper]]. Endemism is present, but less pronounced, among the Succulent Karoo’s [[bird]] and [[mammal]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1322|name=Succulent Karoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The ecoregion has been designated a [[biodiversity hotspot]] by [[Conservation International]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37648">'''Superfluid helium-4''' is the [[superfluid]] form of [[helium-4]], an [[isotope]] of the element [[helium]]. A superfluid is a [[state of matter]] in which the matter behaves like a [[fluid]] with zero [[viscosity]]. The substance, which looks like a normal liquid, flows without friction past any surface, which allows it to continue to circulate over obstructions and through pores in containers which hold it, subject only to its own [[inertia]].

Known as a major facet in the study of [[quantum hydrodynamics]] and [[macroscopic quantum phenomena]], the [[superfluidity]] effect was discovered by [[Pyotr Kapitsa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Viscosity of Liquid Helium Below the λ-Point |doi=10.1038/141074a0|date=1938|last1=Kapitza|first1=P.|journal=Nature|volume=141|issue=3558|page=74|bibcode = 1938Natur.141...74K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John F. Allen]], and [[Don Misener]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flow of Liquid Helium II|doi=10.1038/142643a0|date=1938|last1=Allen|first1=J. F.|last2=Misener|first2=A. D.|journal=Nature|volume=142|issue=3597|page=643 |bibcode = 1938Natur.142..643A }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1937. It has since been described through [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] and microscopic theories. The formation of the superfluid is known to be related to the formation of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. This is made obvious by the fact that superfluidity occurs in liquid [[helium-4]] at far higher temperatures than it does in [[helium-3]]. Each atom of [[helium-4]] is a [[boson]] particle, by virtue of its zero spin. [[Helium-3]], however, is a [[fermion]] particle, which can form bosons only by pairing with itself at much lower temperatures, in a process similar to the electron pairing in [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/advanced.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1996 - Advanced Information|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Hall and Vinen performed experiments establishing the existence of [[quantized vortex]] lines in superfluid helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1956.0215|title=The Rotation of Liquid Helium II.

Figure 1 is the phase diagram of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.79.626|title=The Liquid-Solid Transformation in Helium near Absolute Zero|date=1950|last1=Swenson|first1=C.|journal=Physical Review|volume=79|issue=4|page=626|bibcode = 1950PhRv...79..626S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram indicating the solid and liquid regions separated by the melting curve (between the liquid and solid state) and the liquid and gas region, separated by the vapor-pressure line. This latter ends in the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] where the difference between gas and liquid disappears. The diagram shows the remarkable property that &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is liquid even at [[absolute zero]]. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is only solid at pressures above 25 bar.

Figure 1 also shows the λ-line. This is the line that separates two fluid regions in the phase diagram indicated by He-I and He-II. In the He-I region the helium behaves like a normal fluid; in the He-II region the helium is superfluid.

The name lambda-line comes from the specific heat – temperature plot which has the shape of the Greek letter λ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(35)90128-8|title=New measurements on the specific heat of liquid helium|date=1935|last1=Keesom|first1=W.H.|last2=Keesom|first2=A.P.|journal=Physica|volume=2|issue=1|page=557|bibcode = 1935Phy.....2..557K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0079-6417(08)60134-1|title=The nature of the λ-transition in liquid helium|chapter=Chapter III The Nature of the λ-Transition in Liquid Helium|series=Progress in Low Temperature Physics|date=1961|last1=Buckingham|first1=M.J.|last2=Fairbank|first2=W.M.|isbn=978-0-444-53309-8|volume=3|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; See figure 2, which shows a peak at 2.172 K, the so-called λ-point of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He.

Below the lambda line the liquid can be described by the so-called two-fluid model. It behaves as if it consists of two components: a normal component, which behaves like a normal fluid, and a superfluid component with zero viscosity and zero entropy. The ratios of the respective densities ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ and ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ, with ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) the density of the normal (superfluid) component, and ρ (the total density), depends on temperature and is represented in figure 3.&lt;ref&gt;E.L. Andronikashvili Zh. Éksp. Teor. Fiz, Vol.16 p.780 (1946), Vol.18 p. 424 (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; By lowering the temperature, the fraction of the superfluid density increases from zero at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; to one at zero kelvins.  Below 1 K the helium is almost completely superfluid.

It is possible to create density waves of the normal component (and hence of the superfluid component since ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + ρ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = constant) which are similar to ordinary sound waves. This effect is called [[second sound]]. Due to the temperature dependence of ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (figure 3) these waves in ρ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are also temperature waves.

[[File:helium-II-creep.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 4. Helium II will "creep" along surfaces in order to find its own level – after a short while, the levels in the two containers will equalize. The [[Rollin film]] also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium II would creep out and escape.]]

[[File:Liquid helium Rollin film.jpg|thumb|right|Fig. 5. The liquid helium is in the superfluid phase. As long as it remains superfluid, it creeps up the wall of the cup as a thin film. It comes down on the outside, forming a drop which will fall into the liquid below. Another drop will form – and so on – until the cup is empty.]]

== Film flow ==
Many ordinary liquids, like alcohol or petroleum, creep up solid walls, driven by their surface tension. Liquid helium also has this property, but, in the case of He-II, the flow of the liquid in the layer is not restricted by its viscosity but by a critical velocity which is about 20&amp;nbsp;cm/s. This is a fairly high velocity so superfluid helium can flow relatively easily up the wall of containers, over the top, and down to the same level as the surface of the liquid inside the container, in a siphon effect as illustrated in figure 4. In a container, lifted above the liquid level, it forms visible droplets as seen in figure 5. It was, however, observed, that the flow through nanoporous membrane becomes restricted if the pore diameter is less than 0.7&amp;nbsp;nm (i.e. roughly three times the classical diameter of helium atom), suggesting the unusual hydrodynamic properties of He arise at larger scale than in the classical liquid helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28992 | doi=10.1038/srep28992| pmid=27363671| pmc=4929499| title=Limited Quantum Helium Transportation through Nano-channels by Quantum Fluctuation| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=28992| year=2016| last1=Ohba| first1=Tomonori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Superfluid hydrodynamics ==
The equation of motion for the superfluid component, in a somewhat simplified form,&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Putterman, Superfluid Hydrodynamics (North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1974) {{ISBN|0-444-10681-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by Newton's law

:&lt;math&gt;\vec F = M_4\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec v_s}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the molar mass of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;math&gt;\vec v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the superfluid component. The time derivative is the so-called hydrodynamic derivative, i.e. the rate of increase of the velocity when moving with the fluid. In the case of superfluid &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He in the gravitational field the force is given by&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Landau, J. Phys. USSR, Vol.5 (1941) p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Khalatnikov, An introduction to the theory of superfluidity (W.A. Benjamin, Inc., New York, 1965) {{ISBN|0-7382-0300-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec F =- \vec \nabla (\mu + M_4gz).&lt;/math&gt;.

In this expression μ is the molar chemical potential, ''g'' the gravitational acceleration, and ''z'' the vertical coordinate. Thus we get
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;M_4\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec v_s}{\mathrm{d}t}=- \vec \nabla (\mu + M_4gz).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
Eq.{{EquationNote|1|(1)}} only holds if ''v''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is below a certain critical value which usually is determined by the diameter of the flow channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0031-9163(66)90958-9|title=The dependence of the critical velocity of the superfluid on channel diameter and film thickness|date=1966|last1=Van Alphen|first1=W.M.|last2=Van Haasteren|first2=G.J.|last3=De Bruyn Ouboter|first3=R.|last4=Taconis|first4=K.W.|journal=Physics Letters|volume=20|issue=5|page=474|bibcode = 1966PhL....20..474V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0079-6417(08)60052-9|title=Thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He-&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He mixtures|chapter=Chapter 3: Thermodynamics and Hydrodynamics of 3He-4He Mixtures|series=Progress in Low Temperature Physics|date=1992|last1=De Waele|first1=A.Th.A.M.|last2=Kuerten|first2=J.G.M.|isbn=978-0-444-89109-9|volume=13|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical mechanics the force is often the gradient of a potential energy. Eq.{{EquationNote|1|(1)}} shows that, in the case of the superfluid component, the force contains a term due to the gradient of the [[chemical potential]]. This is the origin of the remarkable properties of He-II such as the fountain effect.

== Fountain pressure ==
In order to rewrite Eq.{{EquationNote|1|(1)}} in more familiar form we use the general formula
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} \mu = V_m\mathrm{d}p - S_m\mathrm{d}T.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
Here ''S''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the molar entropy and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the molar volume. With Eq.{{EquationNote|2|(2)}} μ(''p'',''T'') can be found by a line integration in the p-T plane. First we integrate from the origin (0,0) to (''p'',0), so at ''T'' =0. Next we integrate from (''p'',0) to (''p'',''T''), so with constant pressure (see figure 6). In the first integral d''T''=0 and in the second d''p''=0. With Eq.{{EquationNote|2|(2)}} we obtain
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu (p,T)=\mu (0,0)+\int_{0}^{p} V_{m}(p^\prime,0)\mathrm{d}p^\prime
-\int_{0}^T S_{m}(p,T^\prime)\mathrm{d}T^\prime.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
We are interested only in cases where ''p'' is small so that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is practically constant. So
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{p} V_{m}(p^\prime,0)\mathrm{d}p^\prime = V_{m0}p&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m0&lt;/sub&gt; is the molar volume of the liquid at ''T'' =0 and ''p'' =0. The other term in Eq.{{EquationNote|3|(3)}} is also written as a product of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m0&lt;/sub&gt; and a quantity ''p''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; which has the dimension of pressure
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^T S_{m}(p,T^\prime)\mathrm{d}T^\prime=V_{m0}p_{f}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
The pressure ''p''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is called the fountain pressure. It can be calculated from the entropy of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He which, in turn, can be calculated from the heat capacity. For ''T'' =''T''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; the fountain pressure is equal to 0.692 bar. With a density of liquid helium of 125&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''g'' = 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; this corresponds with a liquid-helium column of 56 meter height. So, in many experiments, the fountain pressure has a bigger effect on the motion of the superfluid helium than gravity.

With Eqs.{{EquationNote|4|(4)}} and {{EquationNote|5|(5)}}, Eq.{{EquationNote|3|(3)}} obtains the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mu(p,T) = \mu_0 + V_{m0}(p-p_{f}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
Substitution of Eq.{{EquationNote|6|(6)}} in {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} gives
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 \frac{\mathrm{d} \vec v_s}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \vec\nabla (p + \rho_0gz-p_{f}).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
with ρ₀ = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/''V''&lt;sub&gt;m0&lt;/sub&gt; the density of liquid &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He at zero pressure and temperature.

Eq.{{EquationNote|7|(7)}} shows that the superfluid component is accelerated by gradients in the pressure and in the gravitational field, as usual, but also by a gradient in the fountain pressure.

So far Eq.{{EquationNote|5|(5)}} has only mathematical meaning, but in special experimental arrangements ''p''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; can show up as a real pressure. Figure 7 shows two vessels both containing He-II. The left vessel is supposed to be at zero kelvins (''T''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=0) and zero pressure (''p''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0). The vessels are connected by a so-called superleak. This is a tube, filled with a very fine powder, so the flow of the normal component is blocked. However, the superfluid component can flow through this superleak without any problem (below a critical velocity of about 20&amp;nbsp;cm/s). In the steady state ''v''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=0 so Eq.{{EquationNote|7|(7)}} implies
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;p_{l}+\rho_0gz_{l}-p_{fl}=p_{r}+ \rho_0gz_{r}-p_{fr}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
where the index l (r) applies to the left (right) side of the superleak. In this particular case ''p''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = ''z''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 (since ''T''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 0). Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;0=p_{r}-p_{fr}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Heat transport ==
Figure 9 depicts a heat-conduction experiment between two temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; connected by a tube filled with He-II. When heat is applied to the hot end a pressure builds up at the hot end according to Eq.{{EquationNote|7|(7)}}. This pressure drives the normal component from the hot end to the cold end according to
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta p = -\eta_nZ\dot V_n.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
Here η&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the viscosity of the normal component,&lt;ref&gt;J.C.H. Zeegers ''Critical velocities and mutual friction in &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He-&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He mixtures at low temperatures below 100 mK', thesis, Appendix A, Eindhoven University of Technology, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Z'' some geometrical factor, and &lt;math&gt;\dot V_n&lt;/math&gt; the volume flow. The normal flow is balanced by a flow of the superfluid component from the cold to the hot end. At the end sections a normal to superfluid conversion takes place and vice versa. So heat is transported, not by heat conduction, but by convection. This kind of heat transport is very effective, so the thermal conductivity of He-II is very much better than the best materials. The situation is comparable with [[heat pipe]]s where heat is transported via gas–liquid conversion. The high thermal conductivity of He-II is applied for stabilizing superconducting magnets such as in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

=== Landau two-fluid approach ===
[[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau's]] phenomenological and semi-microscopic theory of superfluidity of helium-4 earned him the Nobel Prize in physics, in 1962. Assuming that sound waves are the most important excitations in helium-4 at low temperatures, he showed that helium-4 flowing past a wall would not spontaneously create excitations if the flow velocity was less than the sound velocity. In this model, the sound velocity is the "critical velocity" above which superfluidity is destroyed. (Helium-4 actually has a lower flow velocity than the sound velocity, but this model is useful to illustrate the concept.) Landau also showed that the sound wave and other excitations could equilibrate with one another and flow separately from the rest of the helium-4, which is known as the "condensate".

From the momentum and flow velocity of the excitations he could then define a "normal fluid" density, which is zero at zero temperature and increases with temperature. At the so-called Lambda temperature, where the normal fluid density equals the total density, the helium-4 is no longer superfluid.

To explain the early specific heat data on superfluid helium-4, Landau posited the existence of a type of excitation he called a "[[roton]]", but as better data became available he considered that the "roton" was the same as a high momentum version of sound.

The Landau theory does not elaborate on the microscopic structure of the superfluid component of liquid helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alonso|first=J.

Other microscopical models have been proposed by different authors. Their main objective is to derive the form of the inter-particle potential between helium atoms in superfluid state from first principles of [[quantum mechanics]].
To date, a number of models of this kind have been proposed, including: models with vortex rings, hard-sphere models, and Gaussian cluster theories.

=== Vortex ring model ===
Landau thought that vorticity entered superfluid helium-4 by vortex sheets, but such sheets have since been shown to be unstable.
[[Lars Onsager]] and, later independently, Feynman showed that vorticity enters by quantized vortex lines. They also developed the idea of [[quantum vortex]] rings.

In these models the famous Landau (roton) spectrum of excitations is qualitatively reproduced.

=== Gaussian cluster approach ===
This is a two-scale approach which describes the superfluid component of liquid helium-4. It
consists of two [[Critical phenomena|nested models linked via parametric space]]. The short-wavelength part describes the interior structure of the [[fluid element]] using a non-perturbative approach based on the [[Logarithmic Schrödinger equation]]; it suggests the [[Gaussian]]-like behaviour of the element's interior density and interparticle interaction potential. The long-wavelength part is the quantum many-body theory of such elements which deals with their dynamics and interactions. The approach provides a unified description of the [[phonon]], [[maxon excitation|maxon]] and [[roton]] excitations, and has noteworthy agreement with experiment: with one essential parameter to fit one reproduces at high accuracy the Landau roton spectrum, [[sound velocity]] and [[structure factor]] of superfluid helium-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K.

== Background ==
Although the phenomenologies of the superfluid states of helium-4 and helium-3 are very similar, the microscopic details of the transitions are very different. Helium-4 atoms are bosons, and their superfluidity can be understood in terms of the [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] that they obey. Specifically, the superfluidity of helium-4 can be regarded as a consequence of Bose-Einstein condensation in an interacting system. On the other hand, helium-3 atoms are fermions, and the superfluid transition in this system is described by a generalization of the [[BCS theory]] of superconductivity. In it, [[Cooper pair]]ing takes place between atoms rather than [[electron]]s, and the attractive interaction between them is mediated by [[Spin (physics)|spin]] fluctuations rather than [[phonon]]s. (See [[fermion condensate]].) A unified description of superconductivity and superfluidity is possible in terms of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|gauge symmetry breaking]].

Superfluids, such as helium-4 below the lambda point, exhibit many unusual properties. (See [[Helium#Helium II state]]). A superfluid acts as if it were a mixture of a normal component, with all the properties of a normal fluid, and a superfluid component. The superfluid component has zero viscosity and zero entropy. Application of heat to a spot in superfluid helium results in a flow of the normal component which takes care of the heat transport at relatively high velocity (up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm/s) which leads to a very high effective thermal conductivity.

Another fundamental property becomes visible if a superfluid is placed in a rotating container. Instead of rotating uniformly with the container, the rotating state consists of quantized vortices. That is, when the container is rotated at speeds below the first critical angular velocity, the liquid remains perfectly stationary. Once the first critical angular velocity is reached, the superfluid will form a vortex. The vortex strength is quantized, that is, a superfluid can only spin at certain "allowed" values. Rotation in a normal fluid, like water, is not quantized. If the rotation speed is increased more and more quantized vortices will be formed which arrange in nice patterns similar to the [[Abrikosov lattice]] in a superconductor.

== Practical application ==
Recently in the field of chemistry, superfluid helium-4 has been successfully used in [[spectroscopic]] techniques as a [[quantum solvent]]. Referred to as superfluid helium droplet spectroscopy (SHeDS), it is of great interest in studies of gas molecules, as a single molecule solvated in a superfluid medium allows a molecule to have effective rotational freedom, allowing it to behave similarly to how it would in the "gas" phase.  Droplets of superfluid helium also have a characteristic temperature of about 0.4 K which cools the solvated molecule(s) to its ground or nearly ground [[rovibronic]] state.

Superfluids are also used in high-precision devices such as [[gyroscope]]s, which allow the measurement of some theoretically predicted gravitational effects (for an example, see [[Gravity Probe B]]).

The Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]], launched in January 1983 to gather infrared data was cooled by 73 kilograms of superfluid helium, maintaining a temperature of {{convert|1.6|K|C}}. When used in conjunction with helium-3, temperatures as low as 40 mK are routinely achieved in extreme low temperature experiments. The helium-3, in liquid state at 3.2 K, can be evaporated into the superfluid helium-4, where it acts as a gas due to the latter's properties as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This evaporation pulls energy from the overall system, which can be pumped out in a way completely analogous to normal refrigeration techniques.'''

Superfluid-helium technology is used to extend the temperature range of [[cryocoolers]] to lower temperatures. So far the limit is 1.19 K, but there is a potential to reach 0.7 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.1774894|chapter=Superfluid Vortex Cooler|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|date=2004|last1=Tanaeva|first1=I. A.|volume=710|page=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st-century developments ==
In the early 2000s, physicists created a [[Fermionic condensate]] from pairs of ultra-cold fermionic atoms. Under certain conditions, fermion pairs form [[diatomic molecule]]s and undergo [[Bose–Einstein condensation]]. At the other limit, the fermions (most notably superconducting electrons) form [[Cooper pairs]] which also exhibit superfluidity. This work with ultra-cold atomic gases has allowed scientists to study the region in between these two extremes, known as the [[BEC-BCS crossover]].

[[Supersolid]]s may also have been discovered in 2004 by physicists at [[Penn State University]]. When helium-4 is cooled below about 200 mK under high pressures, a fraction (≈1%) of the solid appears to become superfluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=[[Kim Eunseong|E. Kim]] and [[Moses H. W.

'''TET-1''' ({{lang-de|Technologieerprobungsträger 1}}, ''Technology Experiment Carrier'') is a [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] operated by the [[German Aerospace Center]]. It is the centre of the OOV (On Orbit Verification) Program, initiated to offer on-orbit verification possibilities to the German industrial and scientific aerospace community. TET is based on the satellite bus used for the [[BIRD (satellite)|BIRD]] satellite, which was launched in 2001.

The main contractor for Phase A (feasibility) was [[IABG]]. The final contract for Phases B, C, and D (definition/qualification, and production) and start was given to [[Kayser-Threde|Kayser-Threde GmbH]], a medium-sized aerospace company based in [[Munich]] belonging to the German [[OHB-System]] group. The environmental qualification was successfully conducted in the IABG space simulation centre in Munich.

TET-1 was carried to orbit as a secondary payload on a [[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Fregat]] carrier rocket which was launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on 22 July 2012.&lt;ref name="NSF"/&gt; The primary payload of the launch was the [[Kanopus-V1]] satellite, with the [[BelKA-2]], [[Zond-PP]] and [[exactView-1]] satellites also flying on the same rocket.

'''''The Blue Lagoon''''' is a romance novel written by [[Henry De Vere Stacpoole]] and was first published by [[T. Fisher Unwin]] in 1908. It is the first novel of the ''Blue Lagoon'' trilogy, which also includes ''[[The Garden of God]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Gates of Morning]]'' (1925). The novel has inspired several film adaptations, most notably ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' starring [[Brooke Shields]] as Emmeline and [[Christopher Atkins]] as Richard ("Dicky" in the book).

==Plot summary==
The story centers on two cousins, Dicky and Emmeline Lestrange, who are marooned with a galley cook on an island in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] following a shipwreck. The galley cook, Paddy Button, assumes responsibility for the children and teaches them how to survive, cautioning them to avoid the "arita" berries, which he calls "the never-wake-up berries."

Two-and-a-half years after the shipwreck, Paddy dies following a drinking binge. The children survive on their resourcefulness and the bounty of their remote paradise. They live in a hut and spend their days fishing, swimming, diving for pearls, and exploring the island.

As the years pass, Dicky and Emmeline grow into physically mature young adults and begin to fall in love. Ignorant of their [[human sexuality]], they do not understand or know how to express their physical attraction to one another. Eventually, they consummate their relationship. The author, [[Henry De Vere Stacpoole]], describes their sexual encounter as having been "conducted just as the birds conduct their love affairs. An affair absolutely natural, absolutely blameless, and without sin. It was a marriage according to nature, without feast or guests."&lt;ref name=bl&gt;Stacpoole, H. de Vere. 2014. ''The Blue Lagoon''. Cherry Hill Publishing. Accessed September 15. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKvcVkT7QlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|Google Book URL].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dicky becomes very attentive toward Emmeline, listening to her stories and bringing her gifts. Over several months they make love often and eventually Emmeline becomes pregnant. The couple does not understand the physical changes happening to Emmeline's body and have no knowledge of childbirth. When the day comes for delivery, Emmeline disappears into the forest and returns with a child. They discover over time that the baby requires a name and they call him ''Hannah'' because they have only ever known an infant called by that name.

Dicky and Emmeline teach Hannah how to swim, fish, throw spears, and play in the mud. They survive a violent [[tropical cyclone]] and other natural hazards of island life.

Back in [[San Francisco]], Arthur, Dicky's father and Emmeline's uncle, believes the two are still alive and is determined to find them, after recognizing a child's tea set belonging to Emmeline which was retrieved by a whaler on an island. Arthur finds a captain willing to take him to the island and they set out.

Meanwhile, Dicky, Emmeline, and Hannah row their lifeboat to the place where they had once lived with Paddy as children. Emmeline breaks a branch off the deadly arita plant as Dicky cuts bananas on the shore. While in the boat with her son, Emmeline fails to notice that Hannah has tossed one of the oars into the sea. The tide comes in and sweeps the boat into the lagoon, leaving Emmeline and Hannah stranded. As Dicky swims to them, he is pursued by a shark. Emmeline strikes the shark with the remaining oar, earning Dicky time to climb into the boat safely.

Although they are not far from shore, the trio cannot get back without the oars and they are unable to retrieve them from the water because of the shark. The boat is then caught in the current and drifts out to sea; all the while Emmeline still grasps the arita branch.

Sometime later, Arthur's ship comes across the lifeboat and finds the three unconscious but still breathing. The arita branch is now bare save for one berry. Arthur asks, "Are they dead?" and the captain replies, "No, sir. They are asleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300939.The_Blue_Lagoon|title=The Blue Lagoon|publisher=goodreads.com|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambiguous ending leaves it uncertain whether or not they can be revived.

A '''varve''' is an annual layer of [[sediment]] or [[sedimentary rock]].

The word 'varve' derives from the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word ''varv'' whose meanings and connotations include 'revolution', 'in layers', and 'circle'. The term first appeared as ''Hvarfig lera'' (varved clay) on the first map produced by the Geological Survey of [[Sweden]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Initially, "varve" referred the separate components of annual layers in [[glacial lake]] [[sediment]]s, but at the 1910 Geological Congress, the Swedish geologist [[Gerard De Geer]] (1858–1943) proposed a new formal definition, where varve means the whole of any annual sedimentary layer.&lt;ref&gt;De Geer, G. (1912). A geochronology of the last 12,000 years. Proceedings of the International Geological Congress Stockholm (1910),1, 241–257.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently introduced terms such as 'annually laminated' are synonymous with varve.

Of the many [[rhythmite]]s in the geological record, varves are one of the most important and illuminating in studies of past [[climate change]]. Varves are amongst the smallest-scale events recognised in [[stratigraphy]].

An annual layer can be highly visible because the particles washed into the layer in the spring when there is greater flow strength are much coarser than those deposited later in the year. This forms a pair of layers—one coarse and one fine—for each annual cycle. Varves form only in [[fresh water|fresh]] or [[brackish]] water, because the high levels of salt in normal sea water [[coagulate]] the clay into coarse grains. Since the saline waters leave coarse particles all year, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the individual layers in salt waters. Indeed, clay [[flocculation]] occurs at high [[ionic strength]] due to the collapse of the clay [[electrical double layer]] (EDL), which decreases the [[electrostatic repulsion]] between negatively charged clay particles.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== History of varve research ==
Although the term varve was not introduced until the late nineteenth century, the concept of an annual rhythm of deposition is at least two centuries old. In the 1840s, [[Edward Hitchcock]] suspected laminated sediment in North America could be seasonal, and in 1884 [[Warren Upham]] postulated that light-dark laminated couplets represented a single year's deposition. Despite these earlier forays, the chief pioneer and populariser of varve research was Gerard De Geer. While working for the Geological Survey of Sweden, De Geer noticed a close visual similarity between the laminated sediments he was mapping, and [[dendrochronology|tree-rings]]. This prompted him to suggest the coarse-fine couplets frequently found in the sediments of glacial lakes were annual layers.

The first varve [[chronology]] was constructed by De Geer in [[Stockholm]] in the late 19th century. Further work soon followed, and a network of sites along the east coast of Sweden was established. The varved sediments exposed in these sites had formed in glaciolacustrine and glacimarine conditions in the Baltic basin as the last ice sheet retreated northwards. By 1914, De Geer had discovered that it was possible to compare varve sequences across long distances by matching variations in varve thickness, and distinct marker laminae. However, this discovery led De Geer and many of his co-workers into making incorrect correlations, which they called 'teleconnections', between continents, a process criticised by other varve pioneers like [[Ernst Antevs]].

In 1924, the Geochronological Institute, a special laboratory dedicated to varve research was established. De Geer and his co-workers and students made trips to other countries and continents to investigate varved sediments. Ernst Antevs studied sites from [[Long Island]], U.S.A. to [[Lake Timiskaming]] and [[Hudson Bay]], Canada, and created a North American varve chronology. [[Carl Caldenius]] visited [[Patagonia]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]], and Erik Norin visited central [[Asia]]. By this stage, other geologists were investigating varve sequences, including Matti Sauramo who constructed a varve chronology of the last deglaciation in [[Finland]].

1940 saw the publication of a now classic scientific paper by De Geer, the ''Geochronologia Suecica'', in which he presented the Swedish Time Scale, a floating varve chronology for ice recession from [[Skåne]] to [[Indalsälven]]. Ragnar Lidén made the first attempts to link this time scale with the present day. Since then, there have been revisions as new sites are discovered, and old ones reassessed. At present, the Swedish varve chronology is based on thousands of sites, and covers 13,200 varve years.

In 2008, although varves were considered likely to give similar information to [[dendrochronology]], they were considered "too uncertain" for use on a long-term timescale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00394.x| author = Ramsey | pages = 249–275 | first = C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Varves form in a variety of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[Lake|lacustrine]] [[sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] from [[season]]al variation in [[clastic]], biological, and chemical sedimentary processes.

The classic varve [[archetype]] is a light / dark coloured couplet deposited in a [[glacial lake]]. The light layer usually comprises a coarser laminaset, a group of conformable laminae, consisting of [[silt]] and fine [[sand]] deposited under higher energy conditions when meltwater introduces sediment load into the lake water. During winter months, when meltwater and associated suspended sediment input is reduced, and often when the lake surface freezes, fine [[clay]]-size sediment is deposited forming a dark coloured laminaset.

In addition to seasonal variation of sedimentary processes and deposition, varve formation requires the absence of [[bioturbation]]. Consequently, varves commonly form under [[anoxic sea water|anoxic]] conditions.

A well-known marine example of varve sediments are those found in the Santa Barbara basin, off [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2271">There is often confusion between '''weather and climate'''. [[Weather]] is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place over a short period of time, whereas [[climate]] refers to the weather pattern, using statistical data, of a place over a long enough period to yield meaningful averages.&lt;ref&gt; Arthur Newell Strahler (1960). ''Physical Geography''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Second Edition, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Monkhouse (1978). ''A Dictionary of Geography''. London: Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meteorology]] studies weather, while [[climatology]] studies climate; both are [[atmospheric sciences]]. Climate is an important physical element because it indicates the atmospheric condition of heat, moisture and circulation; it plays a dominant role in shaping vegetation and soil; and it ultimately affects all forms of life, as a result of the very definition of the word, which is a scientific prediction, based on evidentiary statistics, sustained over a long period.

== Elements ==
There are many elements that make up both the weather and the climate of a geographical location. The most significant of these elements are [[temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]], [[solar irradiance]], [[humidity]], [[precipitation]], and [[topography]]. The greatest influence of climatic change is associated with not only natural, but also artificial factors, which can be measured in terms of both short-term and long-term climate change.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Modifying factors ==
The most important factors affecting climate are [[latitude]], [[altitude]], distance to the ocean or sea, orientation of mountain ranges toward [[prevailing wind]]s, and the [[ocean current]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">{{short description|An extensive report, dealing with the state of the world ocean, the interactions between the ocean and ecological, economical and sociopolitical conditions}}
The '''World Ocean Review''' is an extensive report, dealing with the state of the world ocean, the interactions between the ocean and ecological, economical and sociopolitical conditions. It is meant to inform the general public about the current state of the ocean without trying to scare and terrify anyone. There is a print and a free to download version on the official website of the project. It is published by the non-profit organization maribus, founded by the mareverlag in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].
40 Scientists from the Kiel Cluster of Excellence "[[Future Ocean]]" incorporated many studies from the fields of climate and ocean research into the report. The World Ocean Review was first published in 2010 and is supposed to be redone periodically. The scientific facts in this book are supposed to be helpful to those who want to actively participate in the current discussion about climate and ocean research.

==Chapters==

===1. The world oceans, global climate drivers===
This chapter gives a quick introduction into our complex climate system and the interactions between the [[atmosphere]], cyrosphere, [[ocean]], [[lithosphere]] and [[biosphere]] and the different factors that influence them, such as [[solar radiation]], [[wind]] and [[ocean currents]].&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 1 "The world oceans, global climate drivers", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. How climate change alters ocean chemistry===
This chapter explains the connections between [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] uptake of the ocean, [[ocean acidification]] and the thus resulting dangers for the [[ecosystem]] ocean on the basis of current scientific knowledge. Furthermore, the consequences of [[climate change]] for [[methane hydrates]] are illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 2 "How climate change alters ocean chemistry", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. The uncertain future of the coasts===
This chapter explains the [[sea level rise]] because of [[heat expansion]], the melting of land bound ice sheets and the accompanying dangers for coastal regions. The [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] influence on the world’s coasts is also part of this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 3 "The uncertain future of the coasts", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===4. Last stop: The ocean – pollution of the seas===
This chapter covers everything from over [[fertilization]] with organic contaminants to garbage and oil as hazards for the ocean and the people of our planet.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 4 "Last stop: The ocean – pollution of the seas", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===5. Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems===
Even the smallest climate changes can have enormous repercussions on many [[organisms]] of different parts of the ecosystem ocean. Such [[snowball effect]]s are exemplified in this chapter. Also part of the chapter is the response of an ecosystem to an encroaching [[alien species]].&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 5 "Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===6. Exploiting a living resource: Fisheries===
This chapter gives a brief introduction into the matter of [[Deep-sea fishing|deep-sea fishery]]. The necessity of the resource fish for mankind and the accompanying problem of [[overfishing]] are illustrated. The reasons and possible improvements to fisheries management are also part of the chapter.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 6 "Exploiting a living resource: Fisheries", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===7. Marine minerals and energy===
[[Fossil fuels]], marine minerals, methane hydrate, offshore generation of renewable energies hold great potential for mankind, but can also be endangering not just for the climate and ecology. All this is illustrated in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 7 "Marine minerals and energy", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===8. Maritime highways of global trade===
This chapter covers mainly economical aspects of the world’s maritime traffic, but also looks at the increasing dangers of [[piracy]] and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 8 "Maritime highways of global trade", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===9. Medical knowledge from the sea===
Today pharmaceutical ingredients can’t just be extracted from marine organisms (e.g. for [[cancer therapy]]) but they can also be used for cause studies for disease origins. This chapter illustrates the decoding of new substances, the research of partly very old diseases and the legal situation of marine medicine research.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 9 "Medical knowledge from the seaMedical knowledge from the sea", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===10. The law of the sea: A powerful instrument===
This chapter covers the legal system and governance of the ocean. The protection of marine mammals and the legal situation regarding the country borders in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are part of this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;maribus. "World Ocean Review", Chapter 10 "The law of the sea: A powerful instrument", mareverlag, Hamburg, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Zarzaitine is a border town between Algeria and [[Libya]], located just to the northeast of [[In Aménas]]. The [[Trapsa Oil Pipeline]] connects it to [[Edjeleh]], which is located about {{convert|30|mi}} to the south.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite book|title=Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HZKAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 January 2013|year=1964|publisher=The Institute|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[In Aménas Airport]] is in the vicinity, also known as Zarzaitine Airport. Geologically this area is known as the [[Zarzaitine Formation]], consisting mainly of red-brown sandstone,&lt;ref name="TawadrosTawadros2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tawadros|first1=E.|last2=Tawadros|first2=Ezzat|title=Geology of Egypt and Libya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBXdka5y9KwC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=19 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-90-5809-331-8|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dinosaur bones dated to the [[Triassic]] have been unearthed here. The Zarzantine (Triassic) formation is found in the [[Murzuq Desert|Marzuq Basin]]. The formation is reported to be {{convert|130|m}} thick which reduces to {{convert|90|m}} thickness towards the south because erosive action. Zarzaitine oil field is located in the south-eastern [[Illizi]] basin.

==History==
The name Zarzaitine was given to this formation by [[Albert-Félix de Lapparent]] and [[Maurice Lelubre]], in 1948.&lt;ref name="TawadrosTawadros2001 2"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E. |last1=Tawadros|first2=Ezzat |last2=Tawadros|title=Geology of Egypt and Libya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBXdka5y9KwC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=3 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-90-5809-331-8|pages=226–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and gas production took off dramatically in the 1960s, becoming [[CREP]]'s most productive site. and in 1962 alone 12 wells were drilled at Zarzaitine.&lt;ref name="Review"/&gt; In 1961, Zarzaitine was considered to be the largest oil field of the [[Sahara Desert (ecoregion)|eastern Sahara]], with primary reserves of 80 million tons.&lt;ref name="Lidgett1961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidgett|first=Albert|title=Petroleum Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=InPlAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 January 2013|year=1961|publisher=Petroleum Times|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century it is still an important oil site in Algeria; in 2002, Chinese company [[Sinopec]] signed a $525 million contract with the national Algerian oil company  [[Sonatrach]] to develop the Zarzaitine oil field.&lt;ref name="Olimat2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olimat|first=Muhamad|title=CHINA AND THE MIDDLE EAST: from Silk Road to Arab Spring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUNQBn7YYbIC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=27 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-631-0|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that Algeria produces two million tons of crude from this oil field annually.&lt;ref name="Olimat2012 2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Muhamad |last=Olimat|title=China and the Middle East: from Silk Road to Arab Spring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUNQBn7YYbIC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=3 January 2013|date=27 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-85743-631-0|pages=185–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Žemyna''' (derived from ''žemė'' – ''earth'') is the goddess of the earth in [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian religion]]. She is usually regarded as [[mother goddess]] and one of the chief Lithuanian gods similar to [[Latvian mythology|Latvian]] [[Zemes māte]]. Žemyna personifies the fertile earth and nourishes all life on earth, human, plant, and animal. All that is born of earth will return to earth, thus her cult is also related to death. As the cult diminished after [[baptism of Lithuania]], Žemyna's image and functions became influenced by the cult of [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name=balsys/&gt;

Žemyna was first mentioned by [[Jan Łasicki]] (1582). It was later also described by [[Mikalojus Daukša]] (1595), [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]] (1653), [[Matthäus Prätorius]], [[Jacob Brodowski]] (1740), and in numerous folk legends, beliefs, and prayers.&lt;ref name=balsys/&gt;  Prätorius described a ritual, called ''žemyneliauti'', performed at major celebrations (e.g. weddings) or agricultural works (e.g. harvest). The head of the household would drink a cup of beer, but first he would [[libation|spill some of the drink on the ground]] and say a short prayer. Then he would kill a rooster or a hen, which would be cooked and eaten by the entire family. Each family member would receive a loaf of bread and say prayers, blessings, and greetings. The bones and other scraps would be sacrificed to the goddess (burned or buried).&lt;ref name=balsys/&gt; Other recorded rites included burying bread baked from last crops of prior harvest in a field before new sowing and sacrifice of black piglet.&lt;ref name=gimb/&gt; People would also kiss the earth saying a short prayer thanking Žemyna for all her gifts and acknowledging that one day they will return to her.&lt;ref name=dundu/&gt; People addressed Žemyna in various affectionate [[diminutive]] names and [[epithet]]s.

The goddess is said to be married to either [[Perkūnas]] (thunder god) or Praamžius (manifestation of chief heavenly god [[Dievas]]). Thus the couple formed the typical [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] pair of mother-earth and father-sky.&lt;ref name=holi/&gt; It was believed that the earth needs to be fertilized by the heavens (rain and thunder). Thus it was prohibited to plow or sow before the first thunder as the earth would be barren.&lt;ref name=dundu/&gt;
