In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture''' (also known as the '''Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture''' or the '''evasiveness conjecture''') is a group of related [[conjecture]]s about the number of questions of the form "Is there an edge between vertex ''u'' and vertex ''v''?" that have to be answered to determine whether or not an [[undirected graph]] has a particular property such as [[planar graph|planarity]] or [[bipartite graph|bipartiteness]]. They are named after [[Stål Aanderaa]], [[Richard M. Karp]], and [[Arnold L. Rosenberg]]. According to the conjecture, for a wide class of properties, no algorithm can guarantee that it will be able to skip any questions: any [[algorithm]] for determining whether the graph has the property, no matter how clever, might need to examine every pair of vertices before it can give its answer. A property satisfying this conjecture is called [[evasive Boolean function|evasive]].

More precisely, the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture states that any [[deterministic algorithm]] must test at least a constant fraction of all possible pairs of vertices, in the [[worst case analysis|worst case]], to determine any non-trivial monotone graph property; in this context, a property is monotone if it remains true when edges are added (so planarity is not monotone, but non-planarity is monotone). A stronger version of this conjecture, called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture, states that exactly {{nowrap|''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}} tests are needed. Versions of the problem for [[randomized algorithm]]s and [[quantum algorithm]]s have also been formulated and studied.

The deterministic Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture was proven by {{harvtxt|Rivest|Vuillemin|1975}}, but the stronger Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture remains unproven. Additionally, there is a large gap between the conjectured lower bound and the best proven lower bound for randomized and quantum query complexity.

==Example==
The property of being non-empty (that is, having at least one edge) is monotone, because adding another edge to a non-empty graph produces another non-empty graph. There is a simple algorithm for testing whether a graph is non-empty: loop through all of the pairs of vertices, testing whether each pair is connected by an edge. If an edge is ever found in this way, break out of the loop, and report that the graph is non-empty, and if the loop completes without finding any edges, then report that the graph is empty. On some graphs (for instance the [[complete graph]]s) this algorithm will terminate quickly, without testing every pair of vertices, but on the [[empty graph]] it tests all possible pairs before terminating. Therefore, the query complexity of this algorithm is ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2: in the worst case, the algorithm performs ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 tests.

The algorithm described above is not the only possible method of testing for non-emptiness, but
the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture implies that every deterministic algorithm for testing non-emptiness has the same query complexity, ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2. That is, the property of being non-empty is ''evasive''. For this property, the result is easy to prove directly: if an algorithm does not perform ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 tests, it cannot distinguish the empty graph from a graph that has one edge connecting one of the untested pairs of vertices, and must give an incorrect answer on one of these two graphs.

==Definitions==
In the context of this article, all [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] will be [[simple graph|simple]] and [[undirected graph|undirected]], unless stated otherwise. This means that the edges of the graph form a set (and not a [[multiset]]) and each edge is a pair of distinct vertices. Graphs are assumed to have an [[implicit graph|implicit representation]] in which each vertex has a unique identifier or label and in which it is possible to test the adjacency of any two vertices, but for which adjacency testing is the only allowed primitive operation.

Informally, a [[graph property]] is a property of a graph that is independent of labeling. More formally, a graph property is a mapping from the set of all graphs to {0,1} such that isomorphic graphs are mapped to the same value. For example, the property of containing at least 1 vertex of degree 2 is a graph property, but the property that the first vertex has degree 2 is not, because it depends on the labeling of the graph (in particular, it depends on which vertex is the "first" vertex). A graph property is called non-trivial if it doesn't assign the same value to all graphs. For instance, the property of being a graph is a trivial property, since all graphs possess this property. On the other hand, the property of being empty is non-trivial, because the [[empty graph]] possesses this property, but non-empty graphs do not. A graph property is said to be [[Hereditary property#Monotone property|monotone]] if the addition of edges does not destroy the property. Alternately, if a graph possesses a monotone property, then every [[Glossary of graph theory#supergraph|supergraph]] of this graph on the same vertex set also possesses it. For instance, the property of being [[planar graph|nonplanar]] is monotone: a supergraph of a nonplanar graph is itself nonplanar. However, the property of being [[regular graph|regular]] is not monotone.

The [[big O notation]] is often used for query complexity. In short, ''f''(''n'') is O(''g''(''n'')) if for large enough ''n'', ''f''(''n'') ≤ ''c&amp;nbsp;g''(''n'') for some positive constant ''c''. Similarly, ''f''(''n'') is Ω(''g''(''n'')) if for large enough ''n'', ''f''(''n'') ≥ ''c&amp;nbsp;g''(''n'') for some positive constant ''c''. Finally, ''f''(''n'') is Θ(''g''(''n'')) if it is both O(''g''(''n'')) and Ω(''g''(''n'')).

==Query complexity==

The deterministic query complexity of evaluating a function on ''n'' bits (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of bits ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that have to be read in the worst case by a deterministic algorithm to determine the value of the function. For instance, if the function takes value 0 when all bits are 0 and takes value 1 otherwise (this is the [[Logical disjunction|OR]] function), then the deterministic query complexity is exactly ''n''. In the worst case, the first {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} bits read could all be 0, and the value of the function now depends on the last bit. If an algorithm doesn't read this bit, it might output an incorrect answer. (Such arguments are known as adversary arguments.) The number of bits read are also called the number of queries made to the input. One can imagine that the algorithm asks (or queries) the input for a particular bit and the input responds to this query.

The randomized query complexity of evaluating a function is defined similarly, except the algorithm is allowed to be randomized, i.e., it can flip coins and use the outcome of these coin flips to decide which bits to query. However, the randomized algorithm must still output the correct answer for all inputs: it is not allowed to make errors. Such algorithms are called [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s, which distinguishes them from [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s which are allowed to make some error. Randomized query complexity can also be defined in the Monte Carlo sense, but the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is about the Las Vegas query complexity of graph properties.

Quantum query complexity is the natural generalization of randomized query complexity, of course allowing quantum queries and responses. Quantum query complexity can also be defined with respect to Monte Carlo algorithms or Las Vegas algorithms, but it is usually taken to mean Monte Carlo quantum algorithms.

In the context of this conjecture, the function to be evaluated is the graph property, and the input is a string of size ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2, which gives the locations of the edges on an ''n'' vertex graph, since a graph can have at most ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 possible edges. The query complexity of any function is upper bounded by ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2, since the whole input is read after making ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 queries, thus determining the input graph completely.

==Deterministic query complexity==
For deterministic algorithms, {{Harvtxt|Rosenberg|1973}} originally conjectured that for all nontrivial graph properties on ''n'' vertices, deciding whether a graph possesses this property requires Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries. The non-triviality condition is clearly required because there are trivial properties like "is this a graph?" which can be answered with no queries at all.

[[File:Scorpion graph.svg|thumb|A scorpion graph. One of the three red path vertices is adjacent to all other vertices and the other two red vertices have no other adjacencies.]]
The conjecture was disproved by Aanderaa, who exhibited a directed graph property (the property of containing a "sink") which required only O(''n'') queries to test. A ''sink'', in a directed graph, is a vertex of indegree ''n''-1 and outdegree 0. This property can be tested with less than 3''n'' queries {{harv|Best|van Emde Boas|Lenstra|1974}}. An undirected graph property which can also be tested with O(''n'') queries is the property of being a scorpion graph, first described in {{harvtxt|Best|van Emde Boas|Lenstra|1974}}. A scorpion graph is a graph containing a three-vertex path, such that one endpoint of the path is connected to all remaining vertices, while the other two path vertices have no incident edges other than the ones in the path.

Then Aanderaa and Rosenberg formulated a new conjecture (the '''Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture''') which says that deciding whether a graph possesses a non-trivial monotone graph property requires Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Triesch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conjecture was resolved by {{harvtxt|Rivest|Vuillemin|1975}} by showing that at least ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/16 queries are needed to test for any nontrivial monotone graph property. The bound was further improved to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/9 by {{Harvtxt|Kleitman|Kwiatkowski|1980}}, then to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4 - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Kahn|Saks|Sturtevant|1983}}, then to (8/25)''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Korneffel|Triesch|2010}}, and then to ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3 - o(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by {{Harvtxt|Scheidweiler|Triesch|2013}}.

[[Richard Karp]] conjectured the stronger statement (which is now called the '''evasiveness conjecture''' or the '''Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture''') that "every nontrivial monotone graph property for graphs on ''n'' vertices is evasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lutz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A property is called ''evasive'' if determining whether a given graph has this property sometimes requires all ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2 queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kozlov|2008|pp=226&amp;ndash;228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture says that the best algorithm for testing any nontrivial monotone property must (in the worst case) query all possible edges. This conjecture is still open, although several special graph properties have shown to be evasive for all ''n''. The conjecture has been resolved for the case where ''n'' is a [[prime power]] by {{Harvtxt|Kahn|Saks|Sturtevant|1983}} using a [[Topological combinatorics|topological]] approach. The conjecture has also been resolved for all non-trivial monotone properties on bipartite graphs by {{harvtxt|Yao|1988}}. [[Minor (graph theory)|Minor]]-closed properties have also been shown to be evasive for large ''n'' {{harv|Chakrabarti|Khot|Shi|2001}}.

==Randomized query complexity==
Richard Karp also conjectured that Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries are required for testing nontrivial monotone properties even if randomized algorithms are permitted. No nontrivial monotone property is known which requires less than ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4 queries to test. A linear lower bound (i.e., Ω(''n'')) on all monotone properties follows from a very general [[Query complexity#Relationship between different models|relationship between randomized and deterministic query complexities]]. The first superlinear lower bound for all monotone properties  was given by {{harvtxt|Yao|1991}} who showed that Ω(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') queries are required. This was further improved by {{harvtxt|King|1988}} to Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;5/4&lt;/sup&gt;), and then by {{Harvtxt|Hajnal|1991}} to&amp;nbsp;Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;). This was subsequently improved to the current best known lower bound (among bounds that hold for all monotone properties)  of Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') by {{harvtxt|Chakrabarti|Khot|2001}}.

Some recent results give lower bounds which are determined by the critical probability ''p'' of the monotone graph property under consideration. The critical probability ''p'' is defined as the unique ''p'' such that a [[Erdős–Rényi model|random graph]] ''G''(''n'', ''p'') possesses this property with probability equal to 1/2. A random graph ''G''(''n'', ''p'') is a graph on ''n'' vertices where each edge is chosen to be present with probability ''p'' independent of all the other edges. {{Harvtxt|Friedgut|Kahn|Wigderson|2002}} showed that any monotone property with critical probability ''p'' requires &lt;math&gt;\Omega\left(\min\left\{\frac{n}{\min(p,1-p)},\frac{n^2}{\log n}\right\}\right)&lt;/math&gt; queries. For the same problem, {{Harvtxt|O'Donnell|Saks|Schramm|Servedio|2005}} showed a lower bound of Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;4/3&lt;/sup&gt;/''p''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;).

As in the deterministic case, there are many special properties for which an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound is known.  Moreover, better lower bounds are known for several classes of graph properties. For instance, for testing whether the graph has a subgraph isomorphic to any given graph (the so-called [[subgraph isomorphism]] problem), the best known lower bound is Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) due to {{harvtxt|Gröger|1992}}.

==Quantum query complexity==
For bounded-error [[quantum query complexity]], the best known lower bound is Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;1/6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'') as observed by Andrew Yao.&lt;ref&gt;The result is unpublished, but mentioned in {{Harvtxt|Magniez|Santha|Szegedy|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is obtained by combining the randomized lower bound with the quantum adversary method. The best possible lower bound one could hope to achieve is Ω(''n''), unlike the classical case, due to [[Grover's algorithm]] which gives an O(''n'') query algorithm for testing the monotone property of non-emptiness. Similar to the deterministic and randomized case, there are some properties which are known to have an Ω(''n'') lower bound, for example non-emptiness (which follows from the optimality of Grover's algorithm) and [[triangle finding problem|the property of containing a triangle]]. There are some graph properties which are known to have an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound, and even some properties with an Ω(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) lower bound. For example, the monotone property of nonplanarity requires Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries {{harv|Ambainis|Iwama|Nakanishi|Nishimura|2008}} and the monotone property of containing more than half the possible number of edges (also called the majority function) requires Θ(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) queries {{Harv|Beals|Buhrman|Cleve|Mosca|2001}}.

'''Ali Al'amin Mazrui''' (24 February 1933 – 12 October 2014), was an academic professor, and political writer on [[African studies|African]] and [[Islamic studies]] and North-South relations. He was born in [[Mombasa]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]]. His positions included Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at [[Binghamton University]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], and Director of the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Early life==
Mazrui was born on 24 February 1933 in [[Mombasa]], [[Kenya Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/thecounties/article/2000138049/professor-ali-mazrui-is-dead|title=Professor Ali Mazrui is dead |author= Cyrus Ombati|date= 13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Al-Amin Bin Ali Mazrui, the Chief Islamic Judge in [[Kadhi courts]] of Kenya Colony. His father was also a scholar and author, and one of his books has been translated into English by [[Hamza Yusuf]] as "The Content of Character", to which Ali supplied a foreword. The Mazrui family was a historically wealthy and important family in Kenya, having previously been the rulers of Mombasa. Ali's father was the Chief Kadhi of Kenya, the highest authority on Islamic law.  Mazrui credited his father for instilling in him the urge for intellectual debate, as his father not only participated in court proceedings but also was a renowned pamphleteer and public debater.  Mazrui would, from a young age, accompany his father to court and listen in on his political and moral debates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Ali Mazrui: A Confluence of Three Cultures" from April/May 1982 Research News, Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 9, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;
Mazrui initially intended to follow the path of his father as an Islamist and pursue his study in [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=newsletter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adem|first=Seifudein|date=Spring 2008|title=Ali A. Mazrui, Witness to History?|journal=Institute of Global Cultural Studies Newsletter|location=[[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[New York City|New York]]|publisher=Institute of Global Cultural Studies, [[Binghamton University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor performance in the Cambridge School Certificate examination in 1949, Mazrui was refused entry to Makerere College (now [[Makerere University]]), the only tertiary education institute in East Africa at that time. He then worked in the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education (now [[Technical University of Mombasa]]).&lt;ref name=newsletter/&gt;

==Education==
Mazrui attended primary school in Mombasa, where he recalled  having learned English specifically to participate in formal debates, before he turned the talent to writing.  Journalism, according to Mazrui, was the first step he took down the academic road. In addition to English, Mazrui also spoke Swahili and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Family Obituary of Ali Mazrui, Cornell University. http://www.asrc.cornell.edu/people/upload/Family-Obituary-of-Ali-Mazrui-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After getting a Kenyan Government scholarship,&lt;ref name=newsletter/&gt; Mazrui furthered his study and obtained his B.A. with Distinction from [[Manchester University]] in Great Britain in 1960, his M.A. from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 1961, and his doctorate ([[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]]) from [[Oxford University]] ([[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]]) in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=14 October 2014|url=http://observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4764:ali-mazrui-in-his-own-words&amp;catid=53:interview&amp;Itemid=67|title=Ali Mazrui - In His Own Words|date=19 August 2009|first=Diana|last=Nabiruma|newspaper=[[The Observer (Uganda)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by [[Kwame Nkrumah]]'s ideas of pan-Africanism and consciencism, which formed the backbone of his discussion on Africa's Triple Heritage (Africanity, [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]).&lt;ref name=newsletter/&gt;

==Academic career==
Mazrui began his academic career at the University of Makerere in Uganda, where he had dreamed of attending since he was a child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  At Makerere, Mazrui served as a professor of political science, and began drawing his international acclaim.  Mazrui felt that his years at Makerere were some of the most important and productive of his life.  He told his biographer that 1967, when he published three books, was the year that he had made his declaration to the academic world  "that I planned to be prolific - for better or for worse!"  During his time at Makerere, Mazrui also directed the World Order Models Project in the Department of Political Science, a project which brought together political scientists from across the world to discuss what an international route to lasting peace might be.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence with Hasu Patel, Conference Organiser, of conference on Africa In World Affairs in the Next Thirty Years, December 1969.  Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 7, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazrui reflected that he felt forced to leave the University of Makerere.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Ali Mazrui to Merrick Posnansky. Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 7, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt; His departure was likely the result of his desire to remain a neutral academic in the face of pressures to attach his growing prestige as a political thinker to one of the regional factions. 
His first solicitation was from John Okello, the leader of the Zanzibar Revolution, who came to Mazrui's house in 1968 to urge Mazrui to join his cause.  Okello originally tried to convince Mazrui to become an advisor to him and then simply tried to enlist Mazrui's assistance in writing a constitution for Zanzibar.  Mazrui told Okello that, while he was inclined to sympathize with the cause, it would be a violation of the moral duty of a professor and an academic to join with a political agenda. This incident shows the level of international prestige that Mazrui had already accumulated. Okello had sought him out specifically because he knew and valued Ali's reputation as an anti-imperialist intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Report to the Principle Mekere Univ 6 November 1968. Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 8, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazrui was later approached by Idi Amin who was the president of Uganda at the end of Mazrui's time at Makerere.  Amin, according to Mazrui, wanted Mazrui to become his special adviser.  Mazrui declined this invitation, for fear that it would be unsafe, and by doing so lost his political standing in Uganda.  This would be what Mazrui ultimately felt forced him to leave the University of Makerere.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Herbert Mitgang, "Looking At Africa Through an African’s Eyes" New York Times, 5 October 1986. https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/movies/looking-at-africa-through-an-african-s-eyes.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;   Mazrui often said that he would like to return to Uganda, but cited his strained relationship with the Ugandan government, as well as the unfriendliness of the Ugandan people towards a Kenyan political scientist as the factors keeping him away.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mazrui correspondence with Ann Gourlay, Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 7, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Mazrui was hired as a professor of political science at the [[University of Michigan]].  During his time at Michigan, Mazrui also held a professorship at the University of Jos in Nigeria. He held that spending time teaching and being part of the discourse in Africa was important to not losing his understanding of the African perspective.
From 1978 until 1981 Mazrui served as the Director of the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan.  While he had a relatively quiet tenure in the chair, his presence there was important for a couple reasons.  First, it was a central view of Mazrui's that the African American and the African connection had to be strengthened.  He believed the way to better Africa was to educate African Americans in global politics and to strengthen their connection with Africa, all things that could be under the purview of CAAS. However he also seemed to doubt the ability of a program like CAAS to accomplish anything.  During his earlier years at U of M he criticized such programs saying that, in response to black activism, "some universities just established a black-studies program with a kind of political cynicism which I found rather difficult to admire, to say the very least."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ali Mazrui, "Race Relations in the United States."  Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 7, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazrui taught at the University of Michigan until 1989, when he took a two-year leave of absence to accept the Albert Schweitzer professorship at SUNY Binghamton. Mazrui's departure from U of M was no less eventful than his departure from Makerere.  Mazrui announced his resignation from the University of Michigan on 29 May 1991.  Leading up to this point, there had been a highly publicized bidding war between U of M and SUNY.  Reportedly, SUNY offered Mazrui a $500,000 package which included a $105,000 salary (as compared to his $71,500 salary at U of M) as well as the funds for three professors of Mazrui's choosing, three graduate assistants, a secretary, and travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Wiernik, "African expert quits U-M for SUNY post" The Ann Arbor News, Thurs, 30 May 1991. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;   The University of Michigan reportedly matched this offer, but Mazrui decided it was too little too late.  He stated that he was unconvinced by U of M's commitment to the study of political science in the third world.  Both governor Mario Cuomo from New York and Governor James Blanchard from Michigan gave Mazrui personal calls to convince him to choose the University in their states.  The whole affair sparked questions about the commodification as well as the celebrity of university professors.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Leslie, "Let’s Buy a Physicist or Two", ''Newsweek'' 12 February 1990. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;

His departure also caused a conversation about racial diversity at the University of Michigan; a conversation he had not been a huge part of for the fifteen years while he was on the U of M campus. In spite of the University of Michigan's efforts to retain Ali Mazrui, James Duderstadt, the president of the university at the time, came under heavy fire for not being proactive enough in the retention of an esteemed black professor.  Mazrui had been hired in 1974, while the university was under heavy criticism, especially from the second Black Action Movement, for not keeping its promises for diversity in the student body and among the faculty.  In contrast, Duderstadt argued that, by 1989, the University was doing a much better job of diversifying.  They had added 45 minority faculty that year, 13 more than the year before and the College  of Literature,  Science and the Arts had seen "skyrocketing minority recruitment."&lt;ref&gt;"LS&amp;A’s skyrocketing minority recruitment" Ann Arbor Observer, September 1989. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;   Even still there was a worry that the university was focusing only on recruiting minorities, and not on making them stick around.&lt;ref&gt;Taraneh Shafii, ‘U’ adds 45 new minority to faculty, ''Michigan Daily'', Monday 2 October 1989. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"U-M can make fitting pledge to pluralism" Joe Stroud, Detroit News, 5/14/89.

News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointments==
In addition to his appointments as the Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities, Professor in Political Science, African Studies, Philosophy, Interpretation and Culture and the Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS), Mazrui also held three concurrent faculty appointments as [[Albert Luthuli]] Professor-at-Large in the Humanities and Development Studies at the [[University of Jos]] in [[Nigeria]], Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large Emeritus and Senior Scholar in Africana Studies at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York and Chancellor of the [[Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology]], [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. In 1999, Mazrui retired as the inaugural [[Walter Rodney]] Professor at the [[University of Guyana]], [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]]. Mazrui has also been a Visiting Scholar at [[Stanford University]], The [[University of Chicago]], [[Colgate University]], [[McGill University]], [[National University of Singapore]], Oxford University, [[Harvard University]], [[Bridgewater State College]], [[Ohio State University]], and at other institutions in [[Cairo]], [[Australia]], [[Leeds]], [[Nairobi]], [[Teheran]], [[Denver]], [[London]], [[Baghdad]], and [[Sussex]], amongst others. In 2005, Ali Mazrui was selected as the 73rd topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of [[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]] by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'' ([[UK]]) and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29599933|title=Kenya's Ali Mazrui: Death of A Towering Intellectual|date=13 October 2014| 
accessdate=13 October 2014|first=Frenny|last=Jowi|
publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central views ==
=== Africa’s Triple Heritage ===
The inspiration for his documentary series ''[[The Africans: A Triple Heritage]]'' was Ali's view was that much of modern Africa could be described by its three main influences:

# the colonial and imperialist legacy of the West, 
# the spiritual and cultural influence of Islam spreading from the east, and 
# Africa's own indigenous legacy.

This trinity was illustrated in Mazrui's own life. He spoke English, Arabic, and Swahili from a young age.

=== The Paradoxes of Africa ===
Mazrui believed there were six paradoxes that are central to understanding Africa:

# Africa was the birthplace of humankind, but it is the last continent (besides Antarctica) to be made habitable in a modern sense. 
# Although Africans have not been the most abused group of people in modern history, they have been the most humiliated. 
# Africa is the most different from the West culturally, but is westernizing very quickly. 
# Africa possesses extreme natural wealth, but its people are very poor. 
# Africa is huge, yet very fragmented.  
# Africa is geographically central, but politically marginal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== The Problem of Africa’s Dependency ===
Mazrui argued that, as long as Africa remained dependent on the developed world, no relationship between the developed world and Africa would be beneficial to Africa.  In the face of [[détente]] between the US and the USSR, Mazrui was quoted as saying, "When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers. When elephants make love, however, it is also the grass that suffers."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gilbert, News and Information Services, U/K Supplement 5/22/88. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa’s Greatest Resource ===
Mazrui believed the greatest resource that Africa possessed was the African people.  In particular, he pointed to African Americans, arguing that they must remember their African heritage and find a way to exert their influence over U.S. foreign policy if Africa ever hopes to climb out of its marginal position. Ali explained to a friend that his joint professorship at Michigan and Jos was his attempt to be a part of such a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Mazrui to Mr. Kipyego Cheluget 19 June 1984. Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 9, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==
Some of Mazrui's work has been translated into English by [[Poetry Translation Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetrytranslation.org/poets/alamin-mazrui|title=Alamin Mazrui|website=www.poetrytranslation.org|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
In addition to his academic appointments, Mazrui also served as President of the [[African Studies Association]] (USA) and as Vice-President of the [[International Political Science Association]] and has also served as Special Advisor to the [[World Bank]]. He has also served on the Board of the [[American Muslim Council]], [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Works==
Mazrui's research interests included African politics, international political culture, political Islam and North-South relations. He is author or co-author of more than twenty books. Mazrui has also published hundreds of articles in major scholastic journals and for public media. He has also served on the editorial boards of more than twenty international scholarly journals. Mazrui was widely consulted by heads of states and governments, international media and research institutions for political strategies and alternative thoughts.

He first rose to prominence as a critic of some of the accepted orthodoxies of African intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s. He was critical of [[African socialism]] and all strains of [[Marxism]]. He argued that [[communism]] was a Western import just as unsuited for the African condition as the earlier colonial attempts to install European type governments. He argued that a revised [[liberalism]] could help the continent and described himself as a proponent of a unique ideology of ''African liberalism''.

At the same time he was a prominent critic of the current world order. He believed the current [[capitalism|capitalist]] system was deeply exploitative of Africa, and that the West rarely if ever lived up to their liberal ideals and could be described as [[global apartheid]]. He has opposed Western interventions in the developing world, such as the [[Iraq War]]. He has also long been opposed to many of the policies of [[Israel]], being one of the first to try to [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|link the treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/10/an-intellectual-giant-ali-mazru-201410177120665454.html |title=An intellectual giant: Ali Mazrui (1933-2014) |author=Hatem Bazian |date=18 October 2014 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in recent years, Mazrui has also become a well known commentator on [[Islam]] and [[Islamism]]. While rejecting violence and terrorism Mazrui has praised some of the anti-imperialist sentiment that plays an important role in modern Islamic fundamentalism. He has also argued, controversially, that [[sharia]] law is not incompatible with democracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to his written work, Mazrui was also the creator of the television series ''[[The Africans: A Triple Heritage]]'', which was jointly produced by the [[BBC]] and the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (WETA, Washington) in association with the [[Nigerian Television Authority]], and funded by the Annenberg/CPB Project. A book by the same title was jointly published by BBC Publications and Little, Brown and Company.

==Controversy==
''The Africans'' was a controversial series for some.  In the UK, where it aired on the BBC, it slid more or less under the radar.  In the United States however, where it aired on some PBS channels, ''The Africans'' drew a great amount of scrutiny for being allegedly anti-western.  According to critics, ''The Africans'' blames too many of Africa's problems on the negative influences of Europe and America, and the loudest criticisms came for the portrayal of Muammar el-Qaddafi as a virtuous leader.

The loudest critic of the documentary series was [[Lynne Cheney]], who was at the time the chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH).  The endowment had put $600,000 toward the funding of ''The Africans'' and Lynne Cheney felt that Mazrui had not held to the conditions on which the endowment had granted the funding.  Cheney said that she was promised a variety of interviews presenting different sides of the story, and was outraged when there were no such interviews in the show.  Lynne Cheney demanded that the NEH name and logo be removed from the credits.  She also had the words "A Commentary" added to the American version of the series, alongside Ali Mazrui's credits.

In defense of ''The Africans'' and its alleged bias, Mazrui made the statement "I was invited by PBS and the BBC to tell the American and British people about the African people, a view from the inside.  I am surprised, then, that people are disappointed not to get an American view.  An effort was made to be fair but not to sound attractive to Americans."  Ward Chamberlain, the president of series co-producer [[WETA-TV|WETA]], also stepped in to publicly defend the series and Mazrui by saying that, in a fair telling of history, the western world shouldn’t be expected to come out looking good from the African perspective.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gilbert, The University Record, 13 Oct 1986. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, "U.S. Aide Assails TV Series on Africa" The New York Times, 5 September 1986. . News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other academic controversies===
His experience as a controversial figure was different in the two continents.  While he was surrounded by controversy at U of M (he has been accused of being anti-Semitic, anti-American, and generally radical) he wrote to his African colleagues saying that the debate had remained remarkably civil and academic.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mazrui letter to George Mendenhall, 4 December 1984. Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 9, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;   On the other hand, in Jos, things got so heated that the university faculty once put out a flyer threatening to punish anti-Mazrui libel "in the pugilist style."   Ironically, the libeler was a socialist accusing Mazrui of being overly imperialist for participating in western dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;Pamphlet by Raphaels Donjur, Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 9, Bentley Library&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel-Palestine====
Probably the most fire Mazrui came under during his tenure at the University of Michigan was in response to his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.  Mazrui was an outspoken supporter of Palestine and, more than that, an outspoken critic of the state of Israel. Mazrui made the argument that Israel and the Zionist movement behaved in an imperialist fashion and that they used their biblical beliefs and the events of the holocaust for political gain .  He went so far as to call the Israeli government "fascist" in its behavior.&lt;ref name="Marc Brennan 1988"&gt;Marc Brennan, ''Michigan Daily'', Opinion Piece. 26 September 1988. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  Needless to say, this sparked a great deal of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Weisbrot, ''The Michigan Daily'', 23 September 1988. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The large Jewish population at the University of Michigan was highly critical of these remarks, accusing him of anti-Semitism.  In the campus newspaper, ''The Michigan Daily'',  there was a prolonged back-and-forth in 1988.  One student wroth "Mazrui is completely ignorant regarding Jewish faith and history.  To compare Israel to Nazi Germany is the ultimate racial slur … To digress from politics to anti-Semitic tones only fuels the fire of hatred."&lt;ref name="Marc Brennan 1988"/&gt;

On the other hand, in a joint letter to the ''Michigan Daily'', members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee wrote "A recent letter has accused Dr. Ali Mazrui and his supporters of anti-Semitism… we categorically reject this vicious slander."&lt;ref&gt;"Judaism is not Zionism" Dallas Kenny, Chuck Abookire, Nuha Khoury, et al. (as members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee), letter to the Daily, 10/18/1988. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;    Mazrui, in his own defense, stated unequivocally that he was anti-Zionist, but that that was a fundamentally different thing from anti-Semitism.  He admitted to having problems with the Israeli government and the Zionist movement, but said that he held these views independent of any views about the Jewish people as an ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;"A struggle for common ground" Victoria Bauer, ''Michigan Daily'' Weekend Magazine, 17 March 1989. News and Information Services Faculty and Staff Files, Box 85, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear proliferation====
Throughout his career Mazrui held the controversial position that the only way to prevent a nuclear holocaust was to arm the third world (Africa in particular) with nuclear weapons. This was a view spotlighted in "The Africans."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Speaking largely with a mind to cold war international politics, Mazrui argued that the world needed more than two sides holding nuclear arms. By virtue of the continent's central location and relative non-alignment, he argued that Africa would be the perfect keeper of the peace between the East and the West.  Furthermore, as long as the third world didn’t have nuclear capabilities, it would continue to be marginalized on the global stage.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mazrui, "Lecture 6: In Search of Pax Africana", Reith Lectures 1979: The African Condition, 12 December 1979. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/1979_reith6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This view encountered heavy criticism from those who believed that the more countries with nuclear capabilities, and the more unstable those countries are politically, the greater the risk of some leader or military organization launching nuclear missiles.&lt;ref&gt;Oyvind Osterun, Article in  Dagbladet, 4 August 1981. Ali Mazrui Papers, Box 9, Bentley Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Argument Clinic'''" is a sketch from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', written by [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. The sketch was originally broadcast as part of the television series and has subsequently been performed live by the group. It relies heavily on wordplay and dialogue, and has been used as an example of how language works.

==Plot==
[[Michael Palin]] pays a receptionist (played by Rita Davies) to have a five-minute [[argument]]. The receptionist directs him to Chapman's room, but when he walks in, Chapman hurls abuse at him. Palin interrupts, saying he wants an argument, and Chapman says he is in the wrong room, apologises and directs him to another room. As Palin leaves, Chapman calls him a "stupid [[git (slang)|git]]".&lt;ref name="script"/&gt;

Palin then enters Cleese's room, where Cleese immediately starts an argument, claiming that Palin has already been told that it is the right room. The argument is petty, and consists primarily of the two men [[contradiction|contradicting]] each other. Eventually, Cleese rings a bell signifying the end of the argument, and after Palin pays for another five minutes, Cleese claims that he hasn't. Palin leaves in frustration.

In the version as originally broadcast, Palin leaves for Eric Idle's room to complain, only to have to listen to him ranting about his shoes; he moves on to Terry Jones' room, where Jones hits him on the head with a large wooden mallet, and instructs him on how to properly receive the blow. Jones clarifies the room that Palin just entered does not house the complaints department, but "being-hit-on-the-head" lessons. Soon enough, Inspector Fox (Chapman) enters to arrest both of them for participating in a strange sketch. A second policeman, Inspector Thomson's-Gazelle (Idle) then arrives to arrest the entire show on three counts: being overly self-referential, saying "[name] of the Yard?!" every time a policeman enters, and repeatedly getting out of sketches without a [[punch line|punchline]] by having a member of the forces arrest everybody. Inspector Thomson's-Gazelle himself is arrested by a third policeman (Cleese) for the latter crime, who is then arrested in turn by a hand (presumably belonging to Terry Gilliam).&lt;ref name="script"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume 2|author=Monty Python|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1989|page=86|isbn=9780679726487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
The sketch parodies modern consumer culture, implying that anything can be purchased, even absurd things such as arguing, abuse, or being hit over the head.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=376}}
The sketch was typical for Cleese's and Chapman's writing at the time, as it relied on verbal comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-SLkIap93wC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=cleese+chapman+dialogue+writing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2dc1UsbcF9CKhQfEmoGQDw&amp;ved=0CEMQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=cleese%20chapman%20dialogue%20writing&amp;f=false|title=Best of the Britcoms: From Fawlty Towers to The Office|page=18|first=Garry|last=Berman|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781589795662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python author Darl Larsen believes the sketch was influenced by [[music hall]] and radio comedy, particularly that of [[the Goons]], and notes that there is little camera movement during the original television recording.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=376}}

One line in the middle of the sketch, ''"An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition"'' was taken almost verbatim from the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=376}}

==Performances==
The sketch originally appeared in the 29th episode of the original television series, entitled "[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#3. The Money Programme|The Money Programme]]",{{sfn|Brighouse|2013|p=50}} and was released (in audio only) on the LP ''[[Monty Python's Previous Record]]'', on [[Charisma Records]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monty Python: a chronological listing of the troupe's creative output, and articles and reviews about them, 1969–1989|page=60|first=Douglas|last=McCall|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780899505596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch was subsequently performed live at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in September 1980, which was filmed and released as ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/25/movies/python-in-hollywood.html|title='Python' in Hollywood|first=Vincent|last=Canby|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 June 1982|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch features the discussion with the receptionist (played here by [[Carol Cleveland]]), the abuse from Chapman, and most of the argument between Cleese and Palin. It is then ended abruptly by the entrance of [[Terry Gilliam]], on wires, singing "[[I've Got Two Legs]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969–2012|first=Douglas|last=McCall|publisher=McFarland|year=2013|p=88|isbn=978-0-786-47811-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further live performance occurred in 1989 at the [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]], where Cleveland's and Chapman's roles were replaced by [[Dawn French]] and [[Chris Langham]]. This performance was subsequently released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readexpress.com/2009/01/the_secret_policemans_balls/|title=The Secret Policemens Balls|work=Read Express|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was performed again in July 2014 during ''[[Monty Python Live (Mostly)]]'', with [[Terry Jones]] filling in for Chapman's role and Gilliam reprising "I've Got Two Legs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10940401/The-almost-definitive-guide-to-Monty-Python-Live-Mostly.html|title=The (almost) definitive guide to Monty Python Live (Mostly)|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|first=Dominic|last=Cavendish|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The sketch has been frequently used as an example of how not to argue, because, as Palin's character notes, it contains little more than [[ad hominem]] attacks and [[contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wired for Survival: The Rational (and Irrational) Choices We Make, from the Gas Pump to Terrorism|first=Margaret|last=Polski|page=50|publisher=FT Press|year=2008|isbn=9780138140595}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not contribute to [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FOCUS on College and Career Success|first1=Constance|last1=Staley|first2=Steve|last2=Staley|pages=109–110|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9781439083901}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as a "classical case in point" of dialogue where two parties are unwilling to co-operate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogue and Instruction: Modelling Interaction in Intelligent Tutoring Systems|page=22|editor1-first=Robbert-Jan|editor1-last=Beun|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Baker|editor3-first=Miriam|editor3-last=Reiner|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=9783540588344}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an example of flawed [[logic]], since Palin is attempting to argue that Cleese is not arguing with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9g5HrmcLaIC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22argument+clinic%22+critical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ucw2UoXjKqWu4ASIkIHAAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQuwUwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22argument%20clinic%22%20critical&amp;f=false|title=Philosophy Goes to the Movies: An Introduction to Philosophy|page=218|first=Christopher|last=Falzon|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9780415357258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the argument has been presented as a good example of the workings of [[English grammar]], where sentences can be reduced to simple subject/verb pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysing English Grammar: A Systemic Functional Introduction|page=115|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|first=Lise|last=Fontaine|isbn=9780521190664}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been included as an example of analysing English in school textbooks.&lt;ref name="mullany-stockwell"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing English Language: A Resource Book for Students|first=Louise|last=Mullany|first2=Peter|last2=Stockwell|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|page=175|isbn=9780203858110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch has become popular with [[philosophy]] students, who note that arguing is "all we are good at", and wonder about the intellectual exercise one could get from paying for a professional quality debate.{{sfn|Brighouse|2013|p=52}}

The [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] has an internal-only module called "Argument Clinic" to pre-process Python files.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0436/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cabre''' (Cabere, Cávere) is an extinct [[Arawakan language]] of [[Colombia]]. Speakers lived along the Teviare and Zama rivers among speakers of Western Nawiki (Upper Amazonian) languages, but not enough is known to classify it well. Gilij (see Campbell) cited:

{{Party politics}}
'''Centre-left politics''' or '''center-left politics''' ([[American English]]), also referred to as '''moderate-left politics''', are political views that lean to the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] on the [[left–right political spectrum]], but closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] than other left-wing politics. Those on the centre-left believe in working within the established systems to improve [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver H. Woshinsky. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The centre-left promotes a degree of social equality that it believes is achievable through promoting [[equal opportunity]].&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;Oliver H. Woshinsky. ''Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior''. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The centre-left has promoted [[luck egalitarianism]], which emphasizes the achievement of equality requires personal responsibility in areas in control by the individual person through their abilities and talents as well as social responsibility in areas outside control by the individual person in their abilities or talents.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Armstrong. ''Rethinking Equality: The Challenge of Equal Citizenship''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre-left opposes a wide gap between the rich and the poor and supports moderate measures to reduce the economic gap, such as a [[progressive income tax]], laws prohibiting [[child labour]], [[minimum wage]] laws, laws regulating working conditions, limits on working hours and laws to ensure the workers' right to organize.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; The centre-left typically claims that complete [[equality of outcome]] is not possible, but instead that equal opportunity improves a degree of equality of outcome in society.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

In [[Europe]], the centre-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]], [[Green politics|greens]] and the [[Christian left]]. Some [[Social liberalism|social liberals]] are described as centre-left, but many social liberals are in the centre of the [[political spectrum]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.columbia.edu/pub/papers/CioffiHopner.pdf|title=Interests, Preferences, and Center-Left Party Politics in Corporate Governance Reform|author=John W. Cioffi and Martin Höpner|date=21 April 2006|publisher=Council for European Studies at Columbia University|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,650812,00.html|date=24 September 2009|title=The Credibility Trap – Europe's Center-Left Parties Stuck in a Dead End|author=Manfred Ertel, Hans-Jürgen Schlamp and Stefan Simons|publisher=Der Spiegel|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions associated with the centre-left ==
The main ideologies of the centre-left are [[social democracy]], [[social liberalism]] (when paired with other ideologies), [[progressivism]], [[democratic socialism]] and [[green politics]] (also known as the [[red–green alliance]]).
 
Throughout the world, centre-left groups generally support:
* A [[mixed economy]] consisting of both publicly owned or subsidized programmes of education, universal health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.
* A system of [[social security]], with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the general public against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement (national Insurance contributions)
* Government bodies that regulate [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labour rights (eg. supporting worker access to [[trade unions]], [[Co-determination|workers participation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer protections]] and fair market competition).
* A [[progressive taxation]] that includes [[tax breaks]] and [[subsidies]] for those under poverty extended from government.

The term "centre-left" appeared during the French "[[July Monarchy]]" in 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|URL=https://books.google.it/books?id=BS2z3iGPCigC&amp;pg=PA742&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;dq=centre-left+adolphe+thiers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YmE5_eQ4A0&amp;sig=ND_ppLBczDWN6P-CAmfJz2KUuZI&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC-O3D2rXSAhUEchQKHWBNDZAQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=centre-left%20adolphe%20thiers&amp;f=false|title=The Transformation of European Politics, 1763-1848|author=[[Paul W. Schroeder]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Claredon]]|date=1996|page=742}}&lt;/ref&gt; a political-historical phase during the [[Kingdom of France]] when the [[House of Orléans]] reigned under an almost [[parliamentary system]]. The centre-left was distinct from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], composed of [[Republicanism in France|republicans]], as well as the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], composed of the Third Party and the liberal-conservative [[Doctrinaires]].

During this time, the centre-left was led by [[Adolphe Thiers]] (head of the liberal-nationalist [[Movement Party (France)|Movement Party]]) and [[Odilon Barrot]], who headed the [[populist]] "Dynastic Opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|URL=https://books.google.it/books?id=OTZaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=centre-left+adolphe+thiers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=unT-PPqicw&amp;sig=tbhvhjNSIfqwMCs1D7W6vNzjBBY&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC-O3D2rXSAhUEchQKHWBNDZAQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=centre-left%20adolphe%20thiers&amp;f=false|title=Tocqueville, Democracy and Social Reform|author=Michael Drolet|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|date=11 August 2003|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre-left was [[Orléanist]], but supported a liberal interpretation of the [[Charter of 1830]], more power to the [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], [[manhood suffrage]] and support to [[Nationalism#19th century|rising European nationalisms]]. Adolphe Thiers served as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] for King [[Louis Philippe I]] twice (in 1836 and 1840), but he then lost the King's favour, and the centre-left rapidly fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 fiches d'histoire du XIXe siècle|author1=Alice Primi|author2= Sophie Kerignard|author3=Véronique Fau-Vincenti|publisher=Bréal|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] the centre-left was not strong or organised, but became commonly associated with the [[Moderate Republicans (France)|moderate republicans]]' group in Parliament. Finally, in 1871 the Second Empire fell as consequence of the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and Adolphe Thiers re-established the centre-left after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This time the centre-left was constituted of moderate republicans, then called "[[Opportunist Republicans|Opportunists]]", anti-royalist [[liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] and radicals from the [[Republican Union (France)|Republican Union]]. During the Third Republic, the centre-left was led by political and intellectual figures like [[Jules Dufaure]], [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]], [[Charles de Rémusat]], [[Léon Say]], [[William Waddington]], [[Jean Casimir-Perier]], [[Edmond Henri Adolphe Schérer]] and [[Georges Picot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Léon Say et le centre gauche: 1871-1896 : la grande bourgeoisie libérale dans les débuts de la Troisième République|author=Unknown|date=1993|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Europe, centre-left movements appeared from the 1860s, mainly in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. In Italy, the centre-left was born as coalition between the liberal [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]] and the progressive [[Urbano Rattazzi]], the heads respectively of the [[Historical Right|Right]] and [[Historical Left|Left]] groupings in Parliament. This alliance was called "''connubio''" ("marriage") for its opportunist characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire de l'Europe contemporaine: le XIXe siècle (1815-1919)|author1=Serge Berstein|author2=Pierre Milza|publisher=[[Hatier]]|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, centre-left positions were expressed by people and parties who believed in [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], but also some liberals or [[Christian democracy|Christian-democrat]]s were associated with the centre-left. Currently, the centre-left parties in Europe are united in the social democratic [[Party of European Socialists]] and ecologist [[European Green Party|European Green Party.]]

Despite the rise of centre-left politics in continental Europe, Britain and its colonies along with the United States only saw the rise of the centre-left in the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The prevalence of the position occurred mainly due to the rise of [[socialism]] caused Liberals to move away from ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies to more [[Interventionism (economics)|interventionist]] policies, which created the [[Social Liberalism#History|New Liberal]] movement. Currently, the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-sphere]] major centre-left parties are the following:
* [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] {{Flag|Australia}}
* [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] {{Flag|Canada}}

The '''comma''' {{not a typo|( , )}} is a [[punctuation]] mark that appears in several variants in different languages. It has the same shape as an [[apostrophe]] [[Apostrophe|( ' )]] or single closing [[quotation mark]] in many [[typeface]]s, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in {{not a typo|figure ''9''|reason=This is, very specifically, about the numeral/glyph/figure "9", not the word or concept "nine".}}.

The comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly for separating parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] such as [[clause]]s, and items in lists, particularly when there are three or more items listed. The word ''comma'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|κόμμα}} ({{grc-transl|κόμμα}}), which originally meant a cut-off piece; specifically, in grammar, a short clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|comma|id=36944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Comma|volume=6|page=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comma-shaped mark is used as a [[diacritic]] in several writing systems, and is considered distinct from the [[cedilla]]. The [[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]s ({{lang|grc|ἁ, ἀ}}) appear above the letter in [[Ancient Greek]], and the [[#Diacritical usage|comma diacritic]] appears below the letter in [[Latvian orthography|Latvian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]], and [[Livonian orthography|Livonian]].

==History==

In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented a system of single [[Interpunct|dots]] (''distinctiones'') that separated verses (colometry) and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when [[Reading (process)|reading]] aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoot &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line.  For a short passage (a ''komma''), a ''media distinctio'' dot was placed mid-level (&amp;nbsp;'''·'''&amp;nbsp;).  This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.

The mark used today is descended from a diagonal [[slash (punctuation)|slash]], or ''virgula suspensiva'' (&amp;nbsp;'''/'''&amp;nbsp;), used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by [[Aldus Manutius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf Reading Before Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902185038/http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf |date=September 2, 2006 }} – ''Introduction to Latin Literature'' pamphlet, [[Haverford College]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/punc.htm#mtop Manuscript Studies, Medieval and Early Modern] – [[Palaeography]]: Punctuation glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in English==
In general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked [[grammar|grammatically]] to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in [[English language|English]] writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage – and their rigidity – vary from language to language.

===In lists===
Commas are placed between items in lists, as in ''They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice.'' Some English style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] (''and'', ''or'', ''nor'') in a list of more than two elements. A comma used in such a position is variously called a [[serial comma]], an Oxford comma, or a Harvard comma (after the [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Harvard University Press]], both prominent advocates of this style). Such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity:

* The sentence ''I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom'' could mean either ''I spoke to the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people) or ''I spoke to the boys, who are Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to two people);
* ''I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom'' – must be ''the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people).

The serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:
*''I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas.'' This could mean either ''my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas'' (three people) or ''my mother, who is Anne Smith; and Thomas'' (two people). This sentence might be recast as "my mother (Anne Smith) and Thomas" for clarity.
* ''I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas.'' Because the comma after "mother" is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an [[apposition|apposite phrase]] – that is, a renaming of or further information about a noun – this construction suggests that my mother's name is "Anne Smith and Thomas". Compare "I thank my friend, Smith and Wesson", in which the ambiguity is obvious.

As a [[rule of thumb]], ''[[The Guardian]] Style Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/o |title=Guardian and Observer style guide: O|accessdate=April 1, 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that straightforward lists (''he ate ham, eggs and chips'') do not need a comma before the final "and", but sometimes it can help the reader (''he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea''). ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', and other academic writing guides, require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the "and" prefacing the last item in a series.

If the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, [[semicolon]]s may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]].

In [[News style#Headline|news headlines]], a comma might replace the word "and", even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-handshake-idUSKBN18L1OB|title=Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy|date= 2017-05-25|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy.''

===Separation of clauses===
Commas are often used to separate [[clause]]s. In English, a comma is used to separate a [[dependent clause]] from the [[independent clause]] if the dependent clause comes first: ''After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.'' (Compare this with ''I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.'') A [[relative clause]] takes commas if it is non-[[restrictiveness|restrictive]], as in ''I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.'' (Without the comma, this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two [[independent clause]]s joined by a coordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] (''for'', ''and'', ''nor'', ''but'', ''or'', ''yet'', ''so'') must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.&lt;ref name=Fowler3rev1&gt;{{Cite book | author=[[Henry Watson Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]]; [[Robert Burchfield|Burchfield, R. W.]]| authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The New Fowler's Modern English Usage | edition = Third, revised | year=2000 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-860263-4 | page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="getitwriteonline1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nancy Tuten |url=http://www.getitwriteonline.com/archive/020204WhenCommaBfAnd.htm |title="When to Use a Comma before "And"" |work=Getitwriteonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:
* ''Mary walked to the party, but she was unable to walk home.''
* ''Designer clothes are silly, and I can't afford them anyway.''
* ''Don't push that button, or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!''
In the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause (because it does not contain an explicit [[subject (grammar)|subject]]), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:
* ''Mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home.''
* ''I think designer clothes are silly and can't afford them anyway.''
However, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an [[imperative mood|imperative]],&lt;ref name="Fowler3rev1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="getitwriteonline1"/&gt; as in:
* ''Sit down and shut up.''
The above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. Long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swan |first=Michael |year=2006 |title=Practical English Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''She had very little to live on, but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers.''

In some languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.

The joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in "It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.") is known as a [[comma splice]] and is sometimes considered an error in English;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=May  2007|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.|isbn=978-1-59986-933-9|page=12|quote=Do not join independent clauses by a comma.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with [[asyndeton]], a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.

===Certain adverbs===
Commas are always used to set off certain [[adverb]]s at the beginning of a sentence, including ''however'', ''in fact'', ''therefore'', ''nevertheless'', ''moreover'', ''furthermore'', and ''still''.

* ''Therefore, a comma would be appropriate in this sentence.''
* ''Nevertheless, I will not use one.''

If these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two below examples, if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb, then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.

* ''In this sentence, furthermore, commas would also be called for.''
* ''This sentence is similar; however, a semicolon is necessary as well.''

Using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including ''then'', ''so'', ''yet'', ''instead'', and ''too'' (meaning ''also'').

* ''So, that's it for this rule.'' or
* ''So that's it for this rule.''
* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence, too.'' or
* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence too.''

=== Parenthetical phrases ===
{{anchor|Parenthetical phrase}}
Commas are often used to enclose [[parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthetical]] words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:
*Introductory phrase: Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.&lt;ref&gt;''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interjection: My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!
*Aside: My father, if you don't mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.
*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.
*Absolute phrase: My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.
*Free modifier: My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.
*Resumptive modifier: My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.
*Summative modifier: My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.

===Between adjectives===
A comma is used to separate ''coordinate adjectives'' (i.e., [[adjective#Adjective order|adjectives]] that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if ''and'' were placed between them. For example:
*''The dull, incessant droning'' but ''the cute little cottage.''
*''The devious lazy red frog'' suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious), while ''the devious, lazy red frog'' does not carry this connotation.

===Before quotations===
Some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in ''Mr. Kershner says, "You should know how to use a comma."'' Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] rather than a comma.

Other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus they would write ''Mr. Kershner says "You should know how to use a comma."''

===In dates===

====Month day, year====
When a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English. The comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: December 19&amp;nbsp;1941.
Most style manuals, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style:
"It's conventional to put a comma after the year. The commas are like parentheses here, so it doesn't make sense to have only one."&lt;/ref&gt;
and the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'',&lt;ref&gt;
"When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with commas... ''Feb. 14, 1987, was the target date''." {{cite web |url=http://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |title=Ask the Editor |accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=AP Stylebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after it: ''"Feb. 14, 1987, was the target date."''

If just month and year are given, no commas are used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terriblywrite.wordpress.com/terribly-right-writing-for-the-web/top-5-comma-errors|title=Top 5 Comma Errors|date=30 June 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Her daughter April may return in June 2009 for the reunion."

====Day month year====
When the day precedes the month, the month name separates the numeric day and year, so commas are not necessary to separate them: "The [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]] was carried out on 19&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1941."

===In geographical names===
Commas are used to separate parts of geographical references, such as city and state (''Dallas, Texas'') or city and country (''Kampala, Uganda''). Additionally, most style manuals, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''&lt;ref&gt;
"Mary traveled to Seattle, Washington, before going on to California." {{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Commas/Commas29.html |title=Chicago Style Q&amp;A: Commas |accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=The Chicago Manual of Style Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the ''AP Stylebook'',&lt;ref&gt;
"Acme Pens was founded in Padua, Italy, in 2004." {{cite web |url=http://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |title=Ask the Editor |accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=AP Stylebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: ''"The plane landed in Kampala, [[Uganda]], that evening."''&lt;ref&gt;
''Chicago Manual of Style'', 14th ed., §5.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usps.com/ship/preparing-domestic-shipments.htm|title=Preparing Shipments|publisher=The United States Postal Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Royal Mail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/81|title=How to address your mail|publisher=Royal Mail (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder [[optical character recognition]].

===In numbers===
{{main|Decimal mark}}
In representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, English texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal. This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, [[Full stop|period]]s or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in English of the [[decimal mark|decimal point]]. In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the [[International System of Units#Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities|SI writing style]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/section6.html#695 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.

===In names===
Commas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: ''Smith, John.'' They are also used before many titles that follow a name: ''John Smith, Ph.D.''

Similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: ''...; socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1''.

===Ellipsis===
Commas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Tips: Comma Use|url=http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/tips/commas/|website=Center for Writing Studies|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]|accessdate=12 March 2017|quote=A comma is sometimes used to indicate the omission of one or more words.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''The cat was white; the dog, brown.'' (Here the comma replaces ''was''.)

===Vocative===
Commas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place or thing:
*''I hope, John, that you will read this.''

===Between the subject and predicate===
In his 1785 essay ''An Essay on Punctuation'', [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.
*''The good taste of the present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English language.''
*''Whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit, is an enemy to society.''

===Differences between American and British usage===
The comma and the [[quotation mark]] pairing can be used in several ways. In American English, the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WilbersonChicago14"/&gt;
*My mother gave me the nickname "Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy," which really made me angry.
In Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks  |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association  |year=2011 |format=blog  |accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WilbersonChicago14"&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.wilbers.com/FAQPunctuation.htm  |author=Stephen Wilbers |title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Punctuation |format=web site |accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SSF&gt;{{cite web
  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=%22quotation+marks%22+%22according+to+sense%22+British&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2Vlh-GBz0j&amp;sig=SrMxN2GNFZ2Zhmk2n3hou-65Y3Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwA2oVChMIl5O7tazbxwIVizw-Ch2woQ2U#v=onepage&amp;q=%22quotation%20marks%22%20%22according%20to%20sense%22%20British&amp;f=false |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors and Publishers |location=Cambridge, U.K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002  |format=PDF |quote=In the British style (OUP 1983), all signs of punctuation used with words and quotation marks must be placed ''according to the sense''.   |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*My mother gave me the nickname "Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy", which really made me angry.

There is also some difference regarding the use of the [[serial comma]], which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items:

*They served apples, peaches, and bananas. (serial comma used)
*We cleaned up cores, pits and skins. (serial comma omitted)

The serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. It is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an Americanism{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, but its usage occurs within both American and British English.  It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name=OxfordD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = What is the 'Oxford comma'? | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | accessdate = 2015-09-15 | url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma?q=oxford+comma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma. A majority of American style guides mandate use of the serial comma, including ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', [[William Strunk, Jr.|Strunk]] and [[E. B. White|White]]'s ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', and the ''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]] Style Manual''. The ''AP Stylebook'' for journalistic writing advises against it. It is used less often in British English, but some British style guides require it, including the [[Oxford University Press]] style manual and [[Henry Watson Fowler|Fowler]]'s ''[[Modern English Usage]]''. Some writers of British English use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity.

According to ''New Hart's Rules'', "house style will dictate" whether to use the serial comma, and "The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently."  No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritter|first1=R. M.|title=New Hart's Rules|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|pages=77, 300|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Child advises that "it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series", but claims that in the [[United States]] there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Child|first1=Barbara|title=Drafting Legal Documents: Principles and Practices|date=1992|publisher=West Pub|isbn=9780314003256|page=398|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced by an article by [[Robert J. Samuelson]] in ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref name="Comma"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Sad Fate of the Comma|author=Robert J. Samuelson|publisher=''Newsweek''|page=41|date=22 July 2007|url=http://www.newsweek.com/samuelson-commas-fate-104335}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynne Truss]] says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the UK, where it has been a slow, steady trend for at least a century:

{{quote|Nowadays&amp;nbsp;... A passage peppered with commas—which in the past would have indicated painstaking and authoritative editorial attention—smacks simply of no backbone. People who put in all the commas betray themselves as moral weaklings with empty lives and out-of-date reference books. (Truss, 2004, pp. 97–98)}}

During the [[Second World War]], the British carried the comma over into abbreviations. Specifically, "Special Operations, Executive" was written "S.O.,E.".  Nowadays, even the [[full stop]]s are frequently discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lovell|first=Stanley P.|year=1963|title=Of Spies and Stratagems|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|Englewood Cliffs]], [[New Jersey]]|asin=B000LBAQYS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other languages==
Punctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it, including a number of different comma forms. European languages like German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese use the same comma as English with similar spacing, though usage may be somewhat different. For instance, in Standard German, subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas.

{{anchor|Greek comma|komma}}
[[Greek language|Modern Greek]] uses the same [[Unicode]] comma for its ''kómma'' ({{lang|el|κόμμα}})&lt;ref name=nicky&gt;Nicolas, Nick. "[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |date=2012-08-06 }}". 2005. Accessed 7 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is officially [[romanization of Greek|romanized]] as a Latin comma,&lt;ref name=elot&gt;{{lang|el|Ελληνικός Οργανισμός Τυποποίησης}} [''Ellīnikós Organismós Typopoíīsīs'', "[[Hellenic Organization for Standardization]]"]. {{lang|el|ΕΛΟΤ 743, 2η Έκδοση}} [''ELOT 743, 2ī Ekdosī'', "ELOT 743, {{nowrap|2nd ed.}}"]. ELOT (Athens), 2001. {{el icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former [[hypodiastole]], a curved [[interpunct]] used to disambiguate certain homonyms. The comma therefore functions as a [[silent letter]] in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{lang|el|{{linktext|ό,τι}}}} (''ó,ti'', "whatever") from {{lang|el|{{linktext|ότι}}}} (''óti'', "that").&lt;ref name=nicky/&gt;

The '''enumeration''' or '''ideographic comma'''—{{unichar|3001|ideographic comma}}—is used in [[Chinese punctuation|Chinese]], [[Japanese punctuation]], and somewhat in Korean punctuation. In the [[People's Republic of China]] and in North/South Korea, this comma (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|頓號}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|顿号}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dùnhào'') is usually used only to separate items in lists, while in [[Japan]] it is the more common form of comma ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|読点}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[rōmaji|r]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''tōten'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"clause mark"). In documents that mix [[Japanese script|Japanese]] and [[Latin script]]s, the '''full-width comma''' ({{unichar|FF0C|fullwidth comma}}) is used; this is the standard form of comma (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|逗號}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|逗号}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dòuhào'') in [[China]]. Since East Asian typography permits commas to join clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought, commas may separate subjects and predicates and constructions that would be considered a "[[comma splice]]" in English are acceptable and commonly encountered.

[[Korean punctuation]] uses both commas and [[interpunct]]s for lists.

In Unicode 5.2.0 "numbers with commas" ({{unichar|1F101|size=100%}} through {{unichar|1F10A|size=100%}}) were added to the [[Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement]] block for compatibility with the [[ARIB STD B24 character set]].&lt;ref name="N3397"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Suignard |first1=Michel |title=Japanese TV Symbols – ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N 33 97 – UTC L2/08 - 077 R 2 |url=http://unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3397.pdf |publisher=[[The Unicode Consortium]] |accessdate=2018-11-20 |page=6 |format=PDF |date=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unicode5.2.0Ch15.9"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Unicode Standard, Version 5.2: Chapter 15.9 – Symbols – Enclosed and Square |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch15.pdf#G37643 |publisher=[[The Unicode Consortium]] |accessdate=2018-11-20 |page=490 (PDF: 33) |format=PDF |date=December 2009 |ISBN=9781936213009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comma in the [[Arabic script]] (used by [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], and [[Persian language|Persian]], etc.) is inverted, upside-down: '{{lang|ar|،}}' ({{unichar|060C|Arabic comma}}), in order to distinguish it from the [[Arabic diacritic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}'' ({{lang|ar|ُ }}), representing the vowel {{IPA|/u/}}, which is similarly comma-shaped.&lt;ref name="AbiFarès2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Huda Smitshuijzen AbiFarès|title=Arabic Typography: A Comprehensive Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UacVAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Saqi Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-86356-347-8| page=106|quote= The comma used in Arabic script is not only a mirror image of its Latin counterpart, but its tail is also turned upwards in order to avoid any possibility of confusing it with the ''Dammah'', the ''u'' short vowel mark.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Arabic texts, Western-styled comma ({{lang|ar|٫}}) is used as a [[decimal point]].

Reversed comma ({{unichar|2E41|Reversed comma}}) is used in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] when written in Arabic script. It is different from the standard Arabic comma.

[[Hebrew script]] is also written from right to left. However, [[Hebrew punctuation]] includes only a regular comma ({{lang|he|,}}).

[[Dravidian languages]] such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], and [[Malayalam]] also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of European languages with similar spacing.&lt;ref name="ta.wiki"&gt;[[:ta:கால்புள்ளி (தமிழ் நடை)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing==
In the common [[character (computing)|character]] encoding systems [[Unicode]] and [[ASCII]], character 44 ([[hexadecimal|0x2C]]) corresponds to the comma symbol. The [[HTML]] [[numeric character reference]] is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#44;&lt;/code&gt;.

In many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a [[Subroutine|function]], to separate elements in a [[Array data type|list]], and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once.

In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] the comma symbol is an [[Comma operator|operator]] which evaluates its first [[Parameter (computer programming)|argument]] (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument. This is useful in ''for'' [[statement (programming)|statement]]s and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].

In [[Smalltalk]], the comma operator is used to [[Concatenation|concatenate]] collections, including strings.

In [[Prolog]], the comma is used to denote [[Logical Conjunction]] ("and").

The [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.

==Diacritical usage==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Romance languages]] --&gt;
{{main|D-comma|S-comma|T-comma}}
The comma is used as a [[diacritic]] mark in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] under the ''s'' (''Ș'', ''ș''), and under the ''t'' (''Ț'', ''ț''). A [[cedilla]] is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol ''d̦'' ([[D-comma|''d'' with comma below]]) was used as part of the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian transitional alphabet]] (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter ''[[z]]'' or letters ''dz'', where derived from a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] ''[[Dze|ѕ]]'' ({{IPA|/dz/}}). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive ''z'' (ʒ) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, ''ș'', ''ț'', and ''d̦'' could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for ''sz'', ''tz'', and ''dz'' respectively.

In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the comma is used on the letters ''ģ'', ''ķ'', ''ļ'', ''ņ'', and historically also ''ŗ'', to indicate [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]. Because the lowercase letter ''g'' has a [[descender]], the comma is rotated 180° and placed over the letter. Although their [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[glyph]] names are commas, their names in the [[Unicode]] Standard are ''g'', ''k'', ''l'', ''n'', and ''r'' with a [[cedilla]]. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered.

In [[Livonian language|Livonian]], whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] alphabets, the comma is used on the letters ''ḑ'', ''ļ'', ''ņ'', ''ŗ'', ''ț'' to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses ''ḑ'' and ''ț'' represent the same [[palatal consonant|palatal]] [[plosive consonant|plosive]] phonemes which Latvian writes as ''ģ'' and ''ķ'' respectively.

In [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the diacritic in the characters ''ď'', ''ť'', and ''ľ'' resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a [[caron]] because the letter has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]. Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters ''ȟ'' (used in [[Finnish Kalo language|Finnish Romani]] and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]) and ''ǩ'' (used in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]]), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.

In 16th-century [[Guatemala]], the archaic letter [[cuatrillo]] with a comma (Ꜯ, ꜯ) was used to write Mayan languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Everson|title=N3028: Proposal to add Mayanist Latin letters to the UCS|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06028-n3028-tresillo.pdf|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Common Locale Data Repository''' Project, often abbreviated as '''CLDR''', is a project of the [[Unicode Consortium]] to provide [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] data in the [[XML]] format for use in [[computer application]]s. CLDR contains locale-specific information that an [[operating system]] will typically provide to applications. CLDR is written in [[LDML]] (Locale Data Markup Language). The information is currently used in [[International Components for Unicode]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]], [[LibreOffice]], [[MediaWiki]], and [[IBM]]'s [[IBM AIX|AIX]], among other applications and operating systems.

Among the types of data that CLDR includes are the following:

* Translations for language names.
* Translations for territory and country names.
* Translations for currency names, including singular/plural modifications.
* Translations for [[weekday]], [[month]], [[era]], period of day, in full and abbreviated forms.
* Translations for timezones and example cities (or similar) for timezones.
* Translations for calendar fields.
* Patterns for formatting/parsing dates or times of day.
* Exemplar sets of characters used for writing the language.
* Patterns for formatting/parsing numbers.
* Rules for language-adapted [[collation]].
* Rules for formatting numbers in traditional numeral systems (like Roman numerals, Armenian numerals, …).
* Rules for spelling out numbers as words.
* Rules for [[transliteration]] between scripts. A lot of it is based on [[BGN/PCGN romanization]].

It overlaps somewhat with [[ISO/IEC 15897]] (POSIX locales). POSIX locale information can be derived from CLDR by using some of CLDR's conversion tools.

CLDR is maintained by the CLDR technical committee, which includes employees from IBM, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and some government-based organizations. The committee is currently chaired by John Emmons (IBM), with [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] (Google) as vice-chair.&lt;ref&gt;http://cldr.unicode.org/index/process#TOC-Officers&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotics]], the '''commutation test''' is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, [[value (Semiotics)|value]] and significance.

==The commutation test==
This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per [[Roman Jakobson]]). Its primary uses are to: 
*identify distinctive signifiers,
*define their significance, and
*divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong ([[Roland Barthes]]).
The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.

==The process==
The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different [[mise en scène]]s or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.

According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:
*Paradigmatic transformations
**[[:wikt:substitution|substitution]];
**[[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]
*Syntagmatic transformations
**[[addition]];
**[[wikt:deletion|deletion]].

==An example==
Take the phrase:
:the man hit the boy.
Now substitute "boy" with "baby", "girl", "child", "pansy", "thief". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A "man" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has [[pejorative]] connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. 

If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.

==Discussion==
The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of [[language]]. Later, it was expanded to cover all [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] systems that have an [[information]]al content. As [[Umberto Eco]] says, "A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else." (1976)

Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the ''signifier'') and the [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] expressed (the ''signified''), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating [[understanding]]. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common [[code (semiotics)|code]], Hence, language evolves dynamically. The [[community]] will identify a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a ''signal'') will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and ''encoded'', i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] or associated with the sign within the broader framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] systems available within the community. When the [[audience]] is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As [[Roman Jakobson]] adds, there will also be an [[emotion]]al element or [[value (Semiotics)|value]] which represents the addresser's [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards the ''thing''. This will either become a [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. 

In [[lexicography]], the fact that a  [[neologism]] is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a [[community]] have a shared [[memory]] of language [[pattern]]s and [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. [[Individual]]s are therefore able to build up a [[cognitive]] framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.

{{Tort law}}

'''False arrest''' is a [[common law]] [[tort]], where a [[plaintiff]] alleges they were held in [[police custody|custody]] without [[probable cause]], or without an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Although it is possible to sue law enforcement officials for false arrest, the usual defendants in such cases are [[private security]] firms.

==Overview==
After an arrest, if the charges are dropped, a person will sometimes file legal action or a complaint against the appropriate arresting agency.
In most jurisdictions, the arrest powers of [[police]] and police agents are in excess of those afforded to ordinary citizens (see [[citizen's arrest]]). However, the powers of police officers to arrest are not unlimited. Generally speaking:

#Anyone may arrest a person if in possession of an [[arrest warrant]] issued by an appropriate court. In the United States, this includes [[bounty hunters]] (agents of [[Bail bondsman|bail bondsmen]]) acting under the authority of a [[bench warrant]] to bring a criminal defendant who has [[skipped bail]] to court for trial.
#A police officer, or a person authorized by a jurisdiction's police powers act, may arrest anyone whom the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe has committed any [[Crime|criminal]] offence. However, in the case of a [[misdemeanour]], [[summary conviction]] offence, or non-criminal offence (such as a municipal [[by-law]] offence) the officer may arrest the suspect only long enough to [[Identification of human individuals|identify]] the suspect and give the suspect a [[summons]] to appear in court, unless there is reason to believe they will not appear in answer to the summons.
#Any person may arrest someone suspected of committing a [[felony]] or [[indictable offence]], as long as the arresting person believes the suspect is attempting to flee the scene of the felony. A person cannot be arrested on suspicion of committing a felony well after the fact unless the arresting officer possesses an arrest warrant.

==Citizens and businesses==
Most cases of false arrest involve accusations of [[shoplifting]], and are brought against [[security guards]] and retail stores. A guard cannot arrest someone merely on the suspicion that person is going to commit a theft. In most jurisdictions, there must be some proof that a criminal act has ''actually'' been committed. For example, a guard does not have reasonable and probable cause if a shopper has not yet paid for merchandise they are carrying in the belief that the person intends to leave without making payment.  Instead, there must be an actual act committed{{spaced ndash}}the person ''must'' make an actual attempt to leave the store without paying for the merchandise.

==Police officers==
In the United States and other jurisdictions, police officers and other government officials are liable for clear deprivation of rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983 |title=42 U.S. Code § 1983 - Civil action for deprivation of rights |quote=Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are partially shielded from false arrest lawsuits through the doctrine of [[qualified immunity]], when such a violation qualifies as "not obvious," by a [[US Supreme Court]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/800/case.html |title= Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 |year=1982 |publisher=US Supreme Court |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This doctrine can protect officials from liability when engaged in legal grey areas including qualifying discretionary actions in the arrests of suspects.  However, the officer's actions must still not violate "clearly established law," or this protection is void.  This includes executing an arrest warrant against the wrong person. False statements by public servants to justify or cover up an illegal arrest are another violation of federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001 |title=18 U.S. Code § 1001 - Statements or entries generally |quote=a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully— (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the matter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B, 110, or 117, or section 1591, then the term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this doctrine being tested is Sorrell v. McGuigan ([[4th Cir.]] 2002).  A police officer (McGuigan) detained a man shopping at a mall (Sorrell) based on the description of a suspect who had committed a theft at a store nearby, and proceeded to do a [[Terry_stop|routine search for weapons]].  The store owner who reported the theft arrived at the scene and stated Sorrell and his friends were not the ones who had stolen from him.  However, the officer still arrested Sorrell  for possession of a concealed weapon, because he was carrying a folding knife with a 3 inch long blade in his pocket.  In Maryland, non-automatic folding knives are not considered weapons under state law regardless of their length, and the lack of length limit had been upheld multiple times in the state's [[Maryland_Court_of_Appeals|highest court]].  However, the officer erroneously believed the knife to be a weapon.  Sorrell was released immediately after booking and was never prosecuted as there was technically no crime, and sued the police officer for false arrest.  The officer's qualified immunity was denied by the court, and this decision was upheld in the US Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/011565.U.pdf |title=Sorrell v. McGuigan  |format=PDF |work=United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bounty hunters==
[[Bounty hunter]]s have been subject to suits for false arrest after attempting to execute [[bench warrant]]s outside of the [[United States]]—where they have no extra powers beyond those of ordinary citizens and only police officers may execute warrants. In at least two prominent cases, bounty hunters were charged with [[kidnapping]] after taking custody of a bail jumper outside of the United States and bringing them back to the court that issued the warrant. One of them, [[Daniel Kear]], was extradited from the US and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20030710_covey.html |title=The Perils of Bounty Hunting: Duane Lee "Dog" Chapman's Possible Extradition Fight |publisher=FindLaw |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some cases where police officers or bounty hunters have executed valid arrest warrants against the wrong person.  Although many false arrest suits result in only [[nominal damages]], such mistakes usually result in large awards against the arresting officers.

==Resisting unlawful arrest==
{{see also|Use of force}}
Individuals who realize that they are the target of false arrest might attempt to resist or flee. A few jurisdictions (i.e., 14 U.S. states, {{as of|2012}}) recognize the target's [[right of self-defense]] so as to resist unlawful arrest.  Typically, this ''only'' applies when:
* the arresting officer used more force than necessary to effect the arrest, ''and''
* the resistance is ''only'' to such an extent as necessary to protect oneself from great bodily harm or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=[[Plummer v. State]] |vol=34 |reporter=N.E. |opinion=968 |pinpoint= |court=Ind. |date=1893 |url= |accessdate=14 October 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such jurisdictions – and under the narrowly-defined circumstances described above – resisting unlawful arrest may be used as a [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] for such resistance where it would otherwise be a crime (i.e. [[resisting arrest]], flight to avoid prosecution, [[assault]], etc). There are rare cases in which a murder charge had been reduced to [[manslaughter]] for this reason.

Justification for such action is often hard to prove in court, and only justified in certain circumstances.  Simple [[mistake of fact]] situations would generally not warrant attempting to elude law enforcement.  However, there are some that would, such as:
*the person making the arrest never identifying themselves, causing the defendant to believe they are the target of [[kidnapping]] or [[robbery]].
*the reasonable belief that the person making the arrest is an [[impersonator]] with the intent of victimizing the defendant.

A '''graviquake''' is an [[earthquake]] occurring in an extensional tectonic setting, where the [[gravitational energy]] stored during the interseismic period is delivered by the collapse of a brittle upper crustal volume, slipping along a normal fault and generating the double couple recorded in the moment tensor solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12110 |title=Normal fault earthquakes or graviquakes &amp;#124; Scientific Reports |website=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the major languages of the Philippines belong to the Greater Central Philippine subgroup: [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the [[Visayan languages]] [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Waray language|Waray]]; [[Central Bikol language|Central Bikol]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]] and [[Magindanao language|Magindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/16/show_country/PH/|title=Ethnologue report for Philippines|website=www.ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia, [[Gorontalo language|Gorontalo]] is the third-largest language by number of speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/16/show_country/IDL/|title=Ethnologue report for Indonesia (Sulawesi)|website=www.ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Blust, the current distribution of the Greater Central Philippine languages is the result of an expansion that occurred around 500 B.C. and which led to levelling of much of the linguistic diversity in the central and southern Philippine area, leaving [[Ati language|Ati]], the [[Northern Mindoro languages|North Mangyan languages]], the [[Kalamian languages]] and the [[South Mindanao languages]] as remnants of this earlier diversity.&lt;ref name="Blust1991" /&gt;

==Classification==
The Greater Central Philippine subgroup comprises the following microgroups:&lt;ref name="Blust1991" /&gt;
*[[Central Philippine languages]] (including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Bikol languages]], and [[Visayan languages]])
*[[Southern Mindoro languages|South Mangyan languages]]
*[[Palawan languages]]
*[[Subanon language|Subanen languages]]
*[[Danao languages]] (including [[Maranao language|Maranao]] and [[Magindanao language|Magindanao]])

[[File:Hermandad - friendship.jpg|thumb|Two people shaking hands]]

A '''''handshake''''' is a globally widespread, brief [[greeting]] or [[parting tradition]] in which two people grasp one of each other's like hands, in most cases accompanied by a brief up-and-down movement of the grasped hands.

Using the right hand is generally considered proper etiquette. Customs surrounding handshakes are specific to cultures. Different cultures may be more or less likely to shake hands, or there may be different customs about how or when to shake hands.&lt;ref name="germ-latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-fist-bump-handshake-germs-20140728-story.html |title= Fist bumps, high-fives spread fewer germs than handshakes, study says |work= Los Angeles Times |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate= 7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="germ-abcnews"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/attention-germaphobes-icky-alternative-handshake/story?id=24854753 |title= Attention Germaphobes: A Less Icky Alternative to the Handshake |publisher=ABC News |accessdate= 7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="germ-cbc"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/21/calgary-handshake-fist-bump-pound-flu.html Fist bump can pound out flu transmission] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120022645/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/21/calgary-handshake-fist-bump-pound-flu.html |date=20 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various customs surrounding handshakes, both generically and specific to certain cultures:

The handshake is commonly done upon meeting, greeting, parting, offering [[wiktionary:congratulations|congratulations]], expressing gratitude, or completing an [[Contract|agreement]]. In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good [[sportsmanship]]. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality. If it is done to form an agreement, the agreement is not official until the hands are parted.&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite web

Unless health issues or local [[Tradition|custom]]s dictate otherwise, usually a handshake is made with bare hands. However, it depends on the situation.&lt;ref name="Emily Post"&gt;{{Cite book

* In [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, handshaking is common in business situations. In casual non-business situations, men are more likely to shake hands than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whydopeople.net/why-do-people-shake-hands/ |title=Why Do People Shake Hands? &amp;#124; Why Do People |publisher=whydopeople.net |year=2012 |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], handshakes are done more often, especially on meetings.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"&gt;[http://theconnectedwoman.com/files/Handshakes%20from%20around%20the%20World.pdf Theconnectedwoman.com – "Handshakes from Around the World"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=PHR3102 |title=Shaking Hands Around the World |publisher=wisc-online.com |year=2012 |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Switzerland, it may be expected to shake the women's hands first.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
* [[Austrians]] shake hands when meeting, often including with children.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
* In Russia, a handshake is performed by men and rarely performed by women.
* In some countries such as [[Turkey]] or the [[Arabic]]-speaking [[Middle East]], handshakes are not as firm as in the West. Consequently, a grip which is too firm is rude.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt; Hand shaking between men and women is not encouraged in the Arabic world. You should only use your right hand as well.
* [[Moroccans]] also give one kiss on each cheek (to corresponding genders) together with the handshake. Also, in some countries, a variation exists where instead of kisses, after the handshake the palm is placed on the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* In [[China]], where a weak handshake is also preferred, people shaking hands will often hold on to each other's hands for an extended period after the initial handshake.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
* In [[Japan]], it is appropriate to let the Japanese initiate the handshake, and a weak handshake is preferred.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
* In [[India]] and several nearby countries, the respectful [[Namaste]] gesture, sometimes combined with a slight bow, is traditionally used in place of handshakes. However, handshakes are preferred in business and other formal settings.
* In [[Norway]], where a firm handshake is preferred, people will most often shake hands when agreeing on deals, both in private and business relations.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
* In [[South Korea]], a senior person will initiate a handshake, where it is preferred to be weak. It is a sign of respect to grasp the right arm with the left hand when shaking hands. It is also disrespectful to have your free hand in your pocket while shaking hands.&lt;ref name="Handshakes"/&gt;
*  Related to a handshake but more casual, some people prefer a [[fist bump]]. Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand.  Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.
* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of "cocoon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |date=7 November 1996
  |isbn = 978-90-5617-910-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another version popular with politicians is a "photo-op handshake" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds.
* Scouts will [[Scout handshake|shake hands]] with their left hand as a gesture of trust, which originated when the founder of the movement, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell of Gillwell]], then a British cavalry officer, met an African tribesman.
*In some areas of Africa, handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.
* [[Maasai people|Masai]] men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.
* In Liberia, the [[Liberian snap handshake|snap handshake]] is customary, where the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.

== Germ spreading ==
Handshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as [[scabies]] are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that [[fist bumps]] and [[high five]]s spread fewer germs than handshakes.&lt;ref name="germ-latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="germ-abcnews"/&gt;

In light of the [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]], the dean of medicine at the [[University of Calgary]], [[Tomas Feasby]], suggested that fist bumps may be a "nice replacement of the handshake" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.&lt;ref name="germ-cbc"/&gt;

Following a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at [[UCLA]] hospital, decided to test a "a handshake-free zone" as a method  for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/880856 Handshake-Free Zone: Stopping the Spread of Germs in the Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; However, UCLA didn’t allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact [[Namaste]] gestures.

==Chemosignaling==
It has been discovered as a part of a research in the [[Weizmann Institute]], that human handshakes serve as a means of transferring social chemical signals between the shakers. 
It appears that there is a tendency to bring the shaken hands to the vicinity of the nose and smell them. They may serve an evolutionary need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or [[Rural area|rural]] Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).

==World records==

[[List of mayors of Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City, New Jersey Mayor]] [[Joseph Lazarow]] was recognized by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for a July 1977 publicity stunt, in which the mayor shook more than 11,000 hands in a single day, breaking the record previously held by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had set the record with 8,510 handshakes at a [[White House]] reception on 1 January 1907. This had already been broken, in 1963, by Lance Dowson in Wrexham, N. Wales who shook 12,500 individuals hands in 10 1/2 hours. This was recognised by the Guinness World Records Organisation and published in their 1964 publication. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}} WSAI DJ Jim Scott broke the record at Northgate Mall, Cincinnati, Oh {{citation needed|reason=Cincinnati Inquirer 8 Sep 1977, page 77|date=August 2017}}. On 31 August 1987 Stephen Potter from St Albans Round table shook 19,550 hands at the St Albans Carnival to take the World record for shaking most hands verified by the Guinness Book of records. The record has since been exceeded but has been retired from the book. Stephen Potter still holds the British and European record.

On August 15, 2008 Kirk Williamson and Richard McCulley broke the Guinness Book's World Record for the World's Longest Handshake (single hand) when they met at [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] and shook hands for 10 hours besting the previous record of 9 hours and 19 minutes set in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In June 2016, an Algerian woman married to a Frenchman took part in a [[naturalization]] ceremony (cérémonie d’accueil dans la citoyenneté française&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F15868 ''En quoi consiste la cérémonie d'accueil dans la citoyenneté française ?'']&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Departments of France|Département]] where the couple lives. She refused to give a handshake to the prefect and to a local representative and claimed her religious faith would ban her from touching foreign men. Thereupon, she did not receive the [[French nationality law|French nationality]]. On 20 April 2017, [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Bernard Cazeneuve]] signed a decree approving that decision.&lt;ref name="figaro"&gt;lefigaro.fr: [http://leparticulier.lefigaro.fr/jcms/p1_1715524/pas-de-poignee-de-main-au-prefet-pas-de-nationalite-francaise ''Pas de poignée de main avec le préfet, pas de nationalité française'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Algerian woman filed a suit.

The poem deals with the subject of a child struggling single-handedly to keep his family alive in the Ghetto by smuggling provisions from the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|"Aryan" side]] at the risk of his own life. A poem begins with the stanza also known from [[Untranslatability#Adaptation|an adaptive]] translation provided by [[Richard C. Lukas]]. It reads as follows:

The original text of the poem, together with translations in English and in Hebrew, is today inscribed on the Memorial to the Child Victims of the Holocaust ([[:pl:Pomnik Pamięci Dzieci – Ofiar Holokaustu|Pomnik Pamięci Dzieci]] in [[Warsaw]]), serving as the [[epitaph]] for the million children murdered in the [[Holocaust]].

==Life==
Henryka Łazowertówna was the daughter of Maksymilian Łazowert and his wife Bluma.  Her mother was a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="Smólski"&gt;[[Władysław Smólski]], "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' (Warsaw), vol.&amp;nbsp;20, No.&amp;nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Łazowertówna studied [[Polish studies|Polish]] and [[Romance studies|Romance]] [[philology]] at the [[University of Warsaw]], and subsequently [[French literature]] at the [[University of Grenoble]] on a scholarship funded by the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish interwar]] Government.&lt;!--WP:BALASPS--&gt;&lt;ref name="Koz424" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt;

She was a very active member of the Warsaw section of the [[Polish Writers' Union]], participating in the events organized by the institution, such as for example the conference commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of the writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] in December 1935, an event during which she read from her works alongside such famous poets as [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Juljan Tuwim]], and [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]].&lt;ref&gt;"Uroczysta akademja ku czci Stefana Żeromskiego" (A Solemn Ceremony in Honour of [[Stefan Żeromski]]), ''Tygodnik Illustrowany'' (Warsaw), vol.&amp;nbsp;76, No.&amp;nbsp;49 (3,965), December 8, 1935, p.&amp;nbsp;976.  [http://cyfrowa.chbp.chelm.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=7324 (See online.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[literary magazine]]s of the day Łazowertówna collaborated principally with the literary journals ''Droga'' and ''Pion''.  She was seen as being poetically close to the [[Skamander]] circle, publishing in her short life of 33&amp;nbsp;years two collections of poetry, ''Zamknięty pokój'' ("A Closed Room"), in which the Closed Room of the title poem is self-avowedly a [[metaphor]] for the person of the poet herself,&lt;ref&gt;Henryka Łazowertówna, ''Zamknięty pokój'', Warsaw, Nasza Bibljoteka, 1930, p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Imiona świata'' ("The Names the World is Known By"), whose programmatic poem fulfills the poet's promise of the earlier collection to sound a voice uniquely her own among the women poets of the [[interbellum]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski]], "Noty", ''Kamena'', vol.&amp;nbsp;1, No.&amp;nbsp;9, May 1934, pp.&amp;nbsp;170{{ndash}}171.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Zamknięty pokój'' ("A Closed Room") was – in the words of the writer and a stern [[literary critic]] [[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński]] (1890{{ndash}}1949) – a manifestation of a particularly subtile poetic talent and an extraordinary intelligence, both struggling to break free of the magic circle of [[subjectivism]] and onto the rough and tough ferment of the world (''zamęt życia'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Karol Wiktor Zawodziński]], ''Opowieści o powieśći'', ed. Cz.&amp;nbsp;Zgorzelski, Kraków, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;261.  Cf. Władysław Smólski, "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' (Warsaw), vol.&amp;nbsp;20, No.&amp;nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically speaking, Henryka Łazowertówna was known for her left-wing sympathies, a point on which she differed – in the opinion of [[Józef Łobodowski]] – from another famous poet of her generation, [[Zuzanna Ginczanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Łobodowski]], "O cyganach i katastrofistach" (About the Bohemians and the Catastrophists), ''[[Kultura]]'' (Paris), No.&amp;nbsp;9, 1964, pp.&amp;nbsp;59{{ndash}}68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, her [[leftism]] was a condition of her sensitivity to social injustice and her moral rejection of all forms of oppression rather than an outcome of a political ideology.&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt; In contradistinction to [[Lucjan Szenwald]], her contemporary, she remained fundamentally a [[lyric poet]] to the end.&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt;

Also unlike [[Zuzanna Ginczanka|Ginczanka]] Łazowertówna was not a woman of extraordinary physical beauty, but she possessed charm and grace which, coupled with her simplicity of demeanour and straightforward attitude, made her in the eyes of those who knew her personally the embodiment of femininity.&lt;ref name="Gierymski"&gt;Tadeusz K. Gierymski, "O tym nie można ani mówić, ani milczeć" (A Subject Unfit to be Talked About or to be Passed Over in Silence), ''Spojrzenia'' ([[ezine]]), No.&amp;nbsp;123, April 28, 1995.  ISSN 1067-4020.  [http://www.andsol.org/cudze/Spojrzenia/spoj123 (See online.)]&lt;/ref&gt; A certain simplicity and straightforwardness of style characterizes also her poetry.&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt; Łazowertówna never tried to project herself as other than she was.&lt;ref name="Koz425"&gt;Edward Kozikowski, ''Więcej prawdy niż plotki: wspomnienia o pisarzach czasów minionych'', Warsaw, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;425.&lt;/ref&gt;  She lived in Warsaw with her mother in the [[street|ulica]] Sienna.&lt;ref name="Koz425" /&gt; She loved books, which she bought at a considerable harm to her meagre budget rather than using libraries because, as she explained, "when I tackle a book I do not part with it until I am finished, reading at meals, in bed... The book is with me at all times, I do not take a single step away from it, and such close companionship is possible only where a book does not repulse by its physical appearance [''[[sc.]]'' as many library books do].  I do prefer to read a book untouched by the hands of others, to cut the pages, to rejoice in the peculiar fragrance of the printer's ink."&lt;ref name="Gierymski" /&gt;

===Identity===
Biographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of [[Jagiellonian University]] asserts that it is the active [[antisemitism]] of the Polish society (''Gazeta Warszawska'') in the 1930s that ultimately forced the writers and poets like Henryka Łazowertówna who never espoused any particular aspect of specifically Jewish identity while working in the [[Polish language]], to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time during either [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the Interbellum]] or the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Prokop-Janiec"&gt;[[Eugenia Prokop-Janiec]], [https://books.google.ca/books?id=25sfhJOplxoC&amp;pg=PA109 ''Polish–Jewish Literature in the Interwar Years''] tr. A.&amp;nbsp;Shenitzer, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]], Syracuse University Press, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;94{{ndash}}95, 109. {{ISBN|0815629842}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the hostility obtaining between the Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Poland receives an eloquent treatment in Łazowertówna's own fictional short story ''Wrogowie'' ("The Enemies"), published in 1938 – sixteen months before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] – where she tells the story of two child [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] of [[pretzels]], the one Jewish the other Gentile, who with great animosity towards each other aggressively compete for custom until common misfortune counsels them to join forces in the cause of common good (see [[#Prose|Works in Prose]]).&lt;ref name="Prokop-Janiec" /&gt;

Other established Jewish writers enjoyed the utmost prestige in the country, such as [[Bolesław Leśmian]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Antoni Słonimski]] as well as other Jewish members and celebrated recipients of the Golden Laurel from the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] (PAL),&lt;ref name="portalwiedzy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/29184,,,,polska_akademia_literatury,haslo.html | title=Polska Akademia Literatury | publisher=''Encyklopedia [[Onet.pl]]'', Grupa Onet.pl SA | year=2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making Łazowertówna's biography somewhat unusual.&lt;ref name="Gierymski" /&gt;

{{See also|The Little Smuggler}}
During the [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 part of Łazowertówna's Warsaw apartment in the ulica Sienna, which she shared with her mother, was destroyed in the [[strategic bombing]] conducted by the [[Luftwaffe]], but it was found possible to make the remaining quarters habitable again.&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt; (Łazowertówna's father had died of natural causes before the War.)

A year after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Henryka Łazowertówna found herself suddenly interned in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], like other residents of Jewish origin in the city, though without [[forced resettlement]] {{mdash}} the ulica Sienna of her residence having been simply encircled by the borders of the so-called "Little Ghetto" (of the Ghetto's two parts, the North Side and the South Side, this was the South Side).&lt;ref name="Gierymski" /&gt; As observed by Władysław Smólski (1909–1986), who visited her often during the first year of the War, the drama unfolding around her proved for Łazowertówna an opportunity to rise to the occasion displaying unhoped-for reserves of determination and strength.&lt;ref name="Smólski" /&gt; She immediately began collaboration with the Jewish charitable organization [[CENTOS (charity)|CENTOS]] whose mission was the care for orphan&amp;shy;ed or homeless children.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz K. Gierymski, "O tym nie można ani mówić, ani milczeć" (A Subject Unfit to be Talked About or to be Passed Over in Silence), ''Spojrzenia'' ([[ezine]]), No.&amp;nbsp;123, April 28, 1995.  ISSN 1067-4020.  [http://www.andsol.org/cudze/Spojrzenia/spoj123 (See online.)] On CENTOS (''or'' Centos; "The Central Organization for Orphan Care"), see Barbara Engelking &amp; Jacek Leociak, ''The Warsaw Ghetto: A&amp;nbsp;Guide to the Perished City'', tr. E.&amp;nbsp;Harris, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven (Connecticut)]], Yale University Press, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;341.  {{ISBN|9780300112344}}, {{ISBN|0300112343}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here she was recruited by [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] as a worker at his social-aid organization, the [[Żydowska Samopomoc Społeczna]] or ''Aleynhilf''.  Her duties were those of a [[copywriter|copy-writer]] for the various ''ad hoc'' utilitarian publications of that charitable institution (information leaflets, appeals for donations, etc.).&lt;ref name="Kassow181"&gt;Samuel D. Kassow, ''Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive'', [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington (Indiana)]], Indiana University Press, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;181. {{ISBN|9780253349088}}, {{ISBN|0253349087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was subsequently recruited by Ringelblum to staff the [[Oyneg Shabbos|Oyneg Shabbos Archives]] {{mdash}} also known as the [[Emanuel Ringelblum Archives]] in the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]]'s [[Memory of the World Register – Europe and North America|Memory of the World Register]] {{mdash}} where she distinguished herself in her work documenting the tragic vicissitudes of fate of refugees from various parts of Poland, having been praised by Ringelblum for her remarkable ability to bring to life and instill with vivid actuality the dry statistical facts recorded for the posterity by the organization about individual human beings.&lt;ref name="Kassow181/2"&gt;Samuel D. Kassow, ''Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive'', [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington (Indiana)]], Indiana University Press, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;181{{ndash}}182. {{ISBN|9780253349088}}, {{ISBN|0253349087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]] she continued to write poetry.  Apart from the testimony to the realities of Ghetto life memorialized in the famous poem "[[Mały szmugler]]" ([[The Little Smuggler]]), there also survives (preserved in the [[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]] of [[Warsaw]]) the letter of Łazowertówna addressed to the poet [[Roman Kołoniecki]] (1906{{ndash}}1978) and dated September 6, 1941, a moving lyrical account of the Ghetto streets and the passersby to be encountered in them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature, Warsaw|The Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature]], [[Library classification|shelf mark]]&amp;nbsp;2235, vol.&amp;nbsp;2.  Cf. [[Piotr Matywiecki]], ''Kamień graniczny'', [[Warsaw]], Latona, 1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;196 &amp; 276.  {{ISBN|8385449205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Łazowertówna had apparently no illusions that she needed outside help in order to survive: already in February or March 1940 (''[[i.e.]]'', many months before the creation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]]), she enlisted the services of Ludwik Brandstaetter, the father of the well-known writer [[Roman Brandstaetter]], in approaching a mutual Polish poet-friend with a request for assistance with resettlement in [[Cracow]], a city which she believed would offer her anonymity and hence greater security.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kozikowski, ''Więcej prawdy niż plotki: wspomnienia o pisarzach czasów minionych'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;431.&lt;/ref&gt; One last (bitter) comment on the ultimate fate of Łazowertówna is offered by [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] himself:
:&lt;span style="font-size:95%; line-height: 1.7em;"&gt;Łazowertówna was ill with a lung condition; however without a substantial amount of money in cash, without some ten thousand [[Polish złoty|zlotys]] or so, one could not dream of [crossing over to] the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|Aryan side]]... she had lots of Polish friends, after all they honoured her with many an authorial evening reception, she was a member of the [[Polish Writers' Union]] {{mdash}} despite all this there wasn't anyone in the end to save her...&lt;ref name="Gierymski" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

However, Władysław Smólski reports that when it became clear in the course of 1941 that the Ghetto would be eventually closed off from the outside world, many of Łazowertówna's friends counselled her to leave the precinct (together with her mother) while this was still possible, offering to find a [[safe house]] for the two of them.  She apparently refused to do so, arguing that she was needed by the most unfortunate of beings, the children, orphaned or homeless, from whom she cared at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Smólski, "Tragiczny los poetki" (The Tragic Fate of a Poetess), ''Stolica'' ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&amp;nbsp;20, No.&amp;nbsp;14 (904), April 4, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;16. Cf. Barbara Engelking, ''Zagłada i pamięć: doświadczenie Holocaustu i jego konsekwencje opisane na podstawie relacji autobiograficznych'', [[Warsaw]], Wydawnictwo IFiS PAN [Instytutu Filozofii i Socjologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk], 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;129.  {{ISBN|8385194983}}.  (Engelking (b.&amp;nbsp;1962) claims that Łazowertówna "refused to cross over to the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|Aryan side]] because she did not want to be separated from her mother".)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the so-called ''[[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|Großaktion Warschau]]'', the mass deportations of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] population to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] conducted by the [[Nazis]] between July and September 1942, Henryka Łazowertówna of her own free will accompanied her mother to the [[Umschlagplatz (Warsaw Ghetto)|Umschlagplatz]] or the railway loading-dock that served as a point of departure for the victims being sent to their deaths at Treblinka gas chambers some 84&amp;nbsp;kilometres to the north-east [[as the crow flies]].  The organization that employed her, the ''Aleynhilf'', attempted to rescue Łazowertówna from being included in the transport, but when she learned that she would have to leave her mother behind Łazowertówna declined the assistance being offered to her alone.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Kassow, ''Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive'', [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington (Indiana)]], Indiana University Press, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;182. {{ISBN|9780253349088}}, {{ISBN|0253349087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Mandarin, officially [[Standard Chinese|Modern Standard Chinese]], is the [[official language]] used by the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and [[Singapore]].

== Before Mandarin ==

Since ancient history, the [[Chinese language]] has always consisted of a wide variety of dialects; hence prestige dialects and [[lingua franca|linguae francae]] have always been needed. [[Confucius]], for example, used ''yǎyán'' (雅言), or "elegant speech", rather than colloquial regional dialects; text during the [[Han dynasty]] also referred to ''tōngyǔ'' (通語), or "common language". [[Rime dictionary|Rime dictionaries]], which were written since the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], may also have reflected one or more systems of standard [[pronunciation]] during those times. However, all of these standard dialects were probably unknown outside the educated elite; even among the elite, pronunciations may have been very different, as the unifying factor of all Chinese dialects, [[Classical Chinese]], was a written standard, not a spoken one.

== Adoption of Mandarin ==
The [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]] (1644–1912) began to use the term ''guānhuà'' (官話), or "official speech", to refer to the speech used at the [[court (royal)|courts]]. It seems that during the early part of this period, the standard was based on the Nanjing dialect, but later the [[Beijing dialect]] became increasingly influential, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking various dialects in the capital, [[Beijing]].

The existence of ''Guanhua''  became known to Europeans already by the time of [[Matteo Ricci]] (who worked in China in 1582-1610), who wrote of "a spoken language common to the whole Empire, known as the Quonhua,&lt;ref&gt;''Guanhua'' is transcribed by Ricci and other early European writers as ''Quonhua'', in accordance with Ricci's transcription system that remained in use by [[Jesuits]] for a long time after his death.&lt;/ref&gt; an official language for civil and forensic use".&lt;ref&gt;Pages 28-29 in the English translation, "China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ original Latin],  ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]] suscepta ab Societate Jesu'' (1617), vol. 1, p. 31: "Præter hunc tamen cuique Provinciæ vernaculum sermonem, alius est universo regno communis, quem ipsi ''Quonhua'' vocant, quod curialem vel forensem sonat."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the Empire had set up [[Orthoepy]] Academies (正音書院, Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn) in an attempt to make pronunciation conform to the Beijing standard. But these attempts had little success. As late as the 19th century the emperor had difficulty understanding some of his own ministers in court, who did not always try to follow any standard pronunciation.  As late as the early 20th century, the position of Nanjing Mandarin was considered higher than that of Beijing by some and the [[postal romanization]] standard set in 1906 included spellings with elements of Nanjing pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;From Louis Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TEcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPR4,M1 ''L. Richard's comprehensive geography of the Chinese empire and dependencies.''] Translated into English, revised and enlarged by M. Kennelly, S.J. [Translation of "Geographie de l'empire de Chine," Shanghai, 1905.] Shanghai: T'usewei Press, 1908. p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, by 1909, the dying Qing dynasty had established the Beijing dialect as ''guóyǔ'' (国语/國語), or the "national language".

After the Republic of China was established in 1912, there was more success in promoting a common national language. A [[Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation]] was convened with delegates from the entire country, who were chosen based as often on political considerations as often as on linguistic expertise. The conference deadlocked between promoters of northern and southern pronunciation standards and as a result, a compromise was produced. The ''Dictionary of National Pronunciation'' (國音詞典) was published, which was based on the Beijing dialect, but with added features, such as a fifth tone, believed to be more faithful to historical Chinese pronunciation. Meanwhile, colloquial literature continued to develop apace vernacular Chinese, despite the lack of a standardized pronunciation. Gradually, the members of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect which became the major source of standard national pronunciation, due to the status of that dialect as a prestigious dialect. In 1932, the commission published the ''Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use'' (國音常用. 字彙), with little fanfare or official pronunciation. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one, now known as the [[Old National Pronunciation]] (老國音), except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Despite efforts by some factions to recognize and promote southern Chinese varieties as well, the Kuomintang strongly promoted Guoyu as the one national language and censored and arrested opponents of this movement, continuing this through the wartime years. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;ref name = "Ramsey"&gt;Title:The languages of China, Author:S. Robert Ramsey, Publisher:Princeton University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-691-06694-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-06694-3}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the People's Republic of China, established in 1949, continued the effort. In 1955,  ''guóyǔ'' was renamed ''pǔtōnghuà'' (普通話), or "common speech". (The name change was not recognized by the Republic of China, which has governed only Taiwan and some surrounding islands since 1949.)  Since then, the standards used in [[mainland China]] and Taiwan have diverged somewhat, though they continue to remain essentially identical.

After the [[handover]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], the term "Putonghua" is used in those [[special administrative region]]s of China and [[pinyin]] is widely used for teaching of Putonghua.

In both [[mainland China]] and Taiwan, the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken fluently by most people in mainland China and in Taiwan. However, in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], due to historical and linguistic reasons, the language of education and both formal and informal speech remains [[Cantonese]] but Mandarin is becoming increasingly influential.

== Modern Mandarin vs. historical Mandarin ==
Historically, and properly speaking, the word "Mandarin" (官話) refers to the language spoken in the 19th century by the upper classes of [[Beijing]] as well as by the higher civil servants and military officers of the imperial regime serving in Beijing or in the provinces.

This Mandarin language is quite close to modern-day Mandarin (普通话 / 普通話/ 國語), but there exist some differences. The Mandarin language used many honorifics which have mostly disappeared in modern-day Mandarin daily speech, such as jiàn (賤 "my humble"), guì (貴 "your honorable"), bì (敝 "my humble"), etc.

The grammar of the Mandarin language was almost identical to the grammar of modern-day Mandarin, with sometimes very slight differences in the choice of grammatical words or the positioning of words in the sentence. The vocabulary of the Mandarin language was also largely the same as the vocabulary of modern-day Mandarin, although some vocabulary items have now disappeared.

[[File:original face enso.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ensō]], the Zen Circle.]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Hitsuzendō'''''|筆禅道|"way of Zen through brush"}} is believed by [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhists]] to be a method of achieving [[samādhi]] (Japanese: 三昧 ''sanmai''), which is a unification with the highest reality. Hitsuzendo refers specifically to a school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] calligraphy to which the rating system of modern [[calligraphy]] (well-proportioned and pleasing to the eye) is foreign. Instead, the calligraphy of Hitsuzendo must breathe with the vitality of eternal experience.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

==Origins==
[[Yokoyama Tenkei]] (1885–1966), inspired by the teachings of [[Yamaoka Tesshu]] (1836–1888), founded the Hitsuzendo line of thought as a "practice to uncover one's [[Buddha nature|original self]] through the brush." This was then further developed by [[Omori Sogen]] Roshi as a way of Zen practice. Hitsuzendo is practised standing, using a large brush and ink, usually on newspaper roll. In this way, the whole body is used to guide the brush, in contrast to writing at a table.

==History==
{{Main|Japanese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy was brought to Japan from China and Chinese masters such as [[Wang Xizhi]] 王羲之 (Jp: Ou Gishi; 303-361) have had a profound influence, especially on the ''karayō'' style which is still practiced today. The indigenous Japanese ''wayō tradition'' (和様書道, wayō-shodō) only appeared towards the end of the [[Heian era]]. However, the calligraphy of Zen scholars was often more concerned with spiritual qualities and individual expression and shunned technicalities which led to unique and distinctly personal styles.&lt;ref name="Nakata_73"&gt;Nakata, Yujiro. ''The Art of Japanese Calligraphy'', Weatherhill/Heibonsha, New York/Tojyo, 1973. {{ISBN|0-8348-1013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese calligraphy has three basic styles: Kaisho 楷書, Gyōsho 行書, and Sōsho 草書.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qg7RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=An Introduction to Japanese Kanji Calligraphy|last=Kunii|first=Takezaki|last2=Godin|first2=Bob|date=2013-01-29|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462905928|location=|pages=8|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
True creativity is not the product of consciousness but rather the "phenomenon of life itself."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} True creation must arise from mu-shin 無心, the state of "no-mind," in which thought, emotions, and expectations do not matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Truly skilful Zen calligraphy is not the product of intense "practice;" rather, it is best achieved as the product of the "no-mind" state, a high level of [[spirituality]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and a heart free of disturbances.

To write Zen calligraphic characters that convey truly deep meaning, one must focus intensely and become one with the meaning of the characters they create.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In order to do this, one must free one's mind and heart of disturbances and focus only on the meaning of the character. Becoming one with what you create, essentially, is the philosophy behind Zen Calligraphy and other Japanese arts.

== Early life ==
Hillis Miller was born in [[Newport News, Virginia]].  He is the son of [[J. Hillis Miller Sr.]], a Baptist minister,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hillis Miller Jr., ''On Literature'' (Routledge, 2002), p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; university professor and administrator who served as the president of the [[University of Florida]].  Miller graduated from [[Oberlin College]] (B.A. ''summa cum laude'', 1948) and [[Harvard University]] (M.A. 1949, Ph.D. 1952).  Miller is married and has three children.

== Career ==

Miller has been an important humanities and literature scholar specializing in Victorian and Modernist literature, with a keen interest in the ethics of reading and reading as a cultural act.  From 1952 to 1972, Miller taught at [[Johns Hopkins University]].  During this time, Miller was heavily influenced by fellow Johns Hopkins professor and Belgian literary critic [[Georges Poulet]] and the [[Geneva School]] of literary criticism, which Miller characterized as "the consciousness of the consciousness of another, the transposition of the mental universe of an author into the interior space of the critic's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent B. Leitch, ed., (2001).  ''The Norton Anthology of Literary Criticism''. "Georges Poulet."  New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company,  pp. 1318&amp;ndash;1319.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1972, he joined the faculty at [[Yale University]] where he taught for fourteen years.  At Yale, he worked alongside prominent literary critics [[Paul de Man]] and [[Geoffrey Hartman]], where they were collectively known as the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]] of deconstruction, in contention with prominent Yale influence theorist [[Harold Bloom]]. As a prominent American deconstructionist, Miller defines the movement as searching for "the thread in the text in question which will unravel it all,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent B. Leitch (Ed.). (2001). ''The Norton Anthology of Literary Criticism''. "Cleanth Brooks" 1352.&lt;/ref&gt; and cites that there are multiple layers to any text, both its clear surface and its deep countervailing subtext:&lt;blockquote&gt; On the one hand, the "obvious and univocal reading" always contains the "deconstructive reading" as a parasite encrypted within itself as part of itself. ON the other hand, the "deconstructive" reading can by no means free itself from the metaphysical reading it means to contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/4F70/host.html Synopsis of Miller's "The Critic as Host"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1986, Miller left Yale to work at the [[University of California Irvine]], where he was later followed by his Yale colleague [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cjr.org/year/91/5/deconstruction.asp Deconstruction, by Mitchell Stephens - CJR, Sept/Oct 91&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003000804/http://archives.cjr.org/year/91/5/deconstruction.asp |date=2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same year he served as President of Modern Language Association, and was honored by the MLA with a lifetime achievement award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060201031819/http://today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1417 Today@UCI: Press Releases:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Both at Yale and UC Irvine, Miller mentored an entire generation of American literary critics including noted queer theorist [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.uci.edu/english/j/aboutjhm.html About J.

Currently, he is Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the [[University of California Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.uci.edu/scripts/UCIFacultyProfiles/english/faculty/profile.cfm?ID=2786 UCI E&amp;CL Faculty Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Critic as Host ==
{{Section OR|date=March 2014}}

Miller's "The Critic as Host" could be viewed as a reply to [[M.H. Abrams]], who presented a paper, "The Deconstructive Angel," at a session of the [[Modern Language Association]] in December 1976, criticizing deconstruction and the methods of Miller. Miller presented his paper just after Abrams's presentation at the same session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leitch|first1=Vincent B.|title=Literary Criticism in the 21st Century: Theory Renaissance|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London|isbn=978-1472527707|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYXhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24&amp;lpg=PT24&amp;dq=j.+hillis+miller+m.+h.+abrams+modern+language+association&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mU4qCdIEAg&amp;sig=nvW3U7j4cxLBHcDva8A8SLBBqTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWmI_QqvfYAhVIX60KHXW4AIsQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=j.%20hillis%20miller%20m.%20h.%20abrams%20modern%20language%20association&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "The Deconstructive Angel," Abrams argued that there is a fixed univocal meaning for a text and if we use deconstructive strategies History will become impossibility. Miller replied that univocal and determinate meaning is impossibility and history is also impossibility. Every text is a vocalization of a vocalization. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

Miller asks a vital question at the beginning of his essay: when a text contains a citation from another text, is it like a parasite in the main text or is it the main text that surrounds and strangles the citation? Many people tend to see the deconstructionist reading as a parasite on its host, the univocal reading. Miller argues that deconstructionist reading is an essential and thoroughly naturalized ingredient in every reading, such that we cannot identify its presence. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

The word 'parasite' evokes the image of an ivy tree, the deconstructive reading that feeds on a mighty masculine oak, the univocal reading, and finally destroys the host. Miller rejects this view and calls this image inappropriate. Deconstructive reading is an essential and naturalized ingredient of every reading that we cannot identify its presence. He undertakes a brilliant etymological investigation of the word 'parasite' to prove his critics wrong. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

The word 'parasite' contains within itself its opposite. The prefix 'para' in the word parasite has many contradictory meanings. It simultaneously signifies proximity and distance. The word 'parasite' originated etymologically from the Greek 'parasitos'. The root means 'beside the grain'. 'Para' means beside and 'sitos' means grain or food. Originally 'parasite' was something positive. It simply meant someone who shares food with you, a fellow guest. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

The word 'host' has a more complex derivation. It meant a guest and a stranger, a friend with whom you have a reciprocal duty of hospitality, and a stranger and an enemy, and of course the holy Host. Miller shows that each word has a reciprocal, antithetical meaning built in, that these words are all intertwined in their etymology. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

The antithetical nature of the words 'host' and 'guest' shows the great complexity and equivocal richness of the apparently obvious and univocal language. The complexity and equivocal richness resides in the fact that language is basically figurative and metaphorical and hence it cannot represent reality directly and immediately. Deconstruction is an investigation of what is implied by this inherence of figure, concept and narrative in one another. Deconstruction is, therefore, a rhetorical discipline. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

There is a common view that a poem has a true original univocal reading and the secondary or the deconstructive reading is always parasitical on the first one. Miller, however, claims that there is no difference between both these readings. In his conception there is the poem and its various readings, all of which are equally valid or non-valid. The poem is the food and the two readings, both univocal and equivocal, are fellow guests near the food. Thus we get a triangular relation between the poem and its two readings, or the relation could be like a chain without a beginning or an end. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

Miller argues that an obvious univocal reading in the conventional sense is a myth. There is only deconstructive reading and it generates new meanings. The poem invites endless sequence of commentaries, which never arrives at a ‘correct’ or final reading and meaning. [[Harold Bloom]] has formed a concept of the anxiety of influence to clarify the indebtedness of poets of a generation to the older generations. No poem can stand on its own, but always in relation to another. {{OR|date=March 2014}}

'''Juncture''', in [[linguistics]], is the manner of moving (transition) or mode of relationship between two consecutive sounds.  It is the relationship between two successive [[syllable]]s in speech.{{sfn|Nicolosi|Harryman|Kresheck|2004|p=166}}  A juncture is, formally, a [[Segment (linguistics)|suprasegment]]al [[phoneme|phonem]]ic cue, a means by which a listener can distinguish between two otherwise identical sequences of sounds that have different meanings.{{sfn|Nicolosi|Harryman|Kresheck|2004|p=166}}

== Typology ==
There are several kinds of juncture, the most widely used typology of which is:
;plus juncture:Also known as '''open juncture''', this is subdivided into '''internal open juncture''' and '''external open juncture'''.  It is the juncture that occurs at word boundaries.{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}}  In phonetic transcription open juncture is transcribed {{IPA|/+/}}, hence the name ''plus'' juncture.{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}}
;close juncture:Also known as a '''normal transition''', this is a transition between segments (sounds) within a word.{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}}
;terminal juncture:Also known as '''falling''',{{sfn|Crystal|2011|p=238}} '''clause terminal''' or '''terminal contour''',{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} this is the juncture at the end of a clause or utterance with falling pitch before a silence.{{sfn|Crystal|2011|p=238}}

Other less common typologies exist,{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}} such as the division (favoured by American [[Structural linguistics|Structuralist linguist]]s in the middle twentieth century) into '''plus''', '''single bar''', '''double bar''', and '''double cross''' junctures, denoted {{IPA|/+/}}, {{IPA|/{{!}}/}}, {{IPA|/{{!}}{{!}}/}}, and {{IPA|/#/}} respectively.{{sfn|Rajimwale|2006|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|Trask|1996|loc="double-bar juncture"}}{{sfn|Trask|1996|loc="double-cross juncture"}}  These correspond to syllabification and differences in intonation, single bar being a level pitch before a break, double bar being an upturn in pitch and a break, and double cross being a downturn in pitch that usually comes at the end of an utterance.{{sfn|Trask|1996|loc="double-bar juncture"}}{{sfn|Trask|1996|loc="double-cross juncture"}}{{sfn|Trask|1996|loc="single-bar juncture"}}{{sfn|Malmkjaer|2002|p=409}}

== Examples from English ==
In English, a syllable break at the plus juncture sometimes distinguishes otherwise homophonic phrases.

* "a name" {{IPAc-en|ə|.|n|eɪ|m}} and "an aim" {{IPAc-en|ən|.|eɪ|m}}{{sfn|Nasr|1997|p=45}}
* "that stuff" {{IPAc-en|ð|æ|t|.|s|t|ʌ|f}} and "that's tough" {{IPAc-en|ð|æ|t|s|.|t|ʌ|f}}{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}}{{sfn|Rajimwale|2006|pp=119}}

A word boundary preceded or followed by a syllable break is called an ''external open juncture''. If there is no break, so that words on either side of the juncture are run together, the boundary is called an ''internal open juncture''.{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}}

The distinction between open and close juncture is the difference between "[[wikt:night#English|night]] [[wikt:rate#English|rate]]", {{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|t|.|r|eɪ|t}} with the open juncture between {{IPAc-en|t}} and {{IPAc-en|r}}, and "[[wikt:nitrate#English|nitrate]]", {{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|.|t|r|eɪ|t}} with close juncture between {{IPAc-en|t}} and {{IPAc-en|r}}.{{sfn|Skandera|Burleigh|2011|p=62}} In some [[varieties of English]], only the latter involves an [[affricate]].

== Oronyms ==
In [[recreational linguistics]], an ''oronym'' is a pair of phrases which are [[homophone|homophonic]]. When pronounced without a pause between words (internal open juncture), phrases which differ in meaning and spelling may share a similar pronunciation. An example is "ice cream" {{IPA|/aɪs+kriːm/}} and "I scream" {{IPA|/aɪ+skriːm/}} (which is employed in the chant "I scream; you scream; we all scream for ice cream" that is familiar to many English-speaking children.{{sfn|Goldstein|2010|p=321}}). The label ''oronym'' was suggested by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and first published in his book ''The Joy of Lex'' (1980).
''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' comedy sketch "[[Four Candles]]" is entirely built around oronyms, including a taciturn customer's request for "fork handles" being misheard as "four candles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four candles|url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=two+ronnies+four+candles|accessdate=28 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older meaning of the word ''oronym'', used in the context of topographical nomenclature, is: [[toponym]] of a mountain.

[[File:Varghese Mappillai.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Kandathil  Varghese  Mappillai''' (1857-1904&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kandathil.org/ |title=Kandathil Family History |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the founder of the newspaper [[Malayala Manorama]] and the magazine Bhashaposhini.

==Early life==
In 1857 Varghese Mappillai was born as the fourth son of Karuthalil Eapen Mappillai. With the financial support of his father, Varghese Mappilai was fortunate to get access to English education and studied up to F.A. After studies Varghese Mappillai joined as Treasury Officer (Muthalpadikkaran). Later, he took up a job of ‘Munshi’ (Malayalam teacher) in CMS School for a short period. He was the editor of ‘Keralamithram’which was published in 1881 from Cochin. His journalistic mind and love for literature paved way for establishing the [[Malayala Manorama]] Company in 1888.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; On 22 March 1890 (M.E 1065, Meenam 10th) the first issue of ''Malayala Manorama'' was published.

==Literary contributions==
The [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]] and journalism were the soul and spirit of Varghese Mappillai. Under his leadership and  vision ''Malayala Manorama'' progressed. He utilized the media to nourish and flourish Malayalam language and literature. O M Cherian, Kattakkayathil Cherian Mappillai, Kottarathil Shankunni, K C Keshava Pillai and C S Subramaniam Potti were his close associates.  Varghese Mappillai became an established writer at his young age.  The Malayalam Primer for Children written by Varghese Mappillai was not known to many.

The drama ''Abrayakutty'', an independent Malayalam translation of [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', and ''Keerthanamala'' were  some of the contributions by him to Malayalam literature. Varghese Mappillai formed an association for Malayalam Writers, Kavisamajam. He also formed an association called Bhashaposhini, and later on it turned into a magazine encouraging literature and language.

Varghese Mappillai also made noteworthy contributions in reforming the [[Malayalam alphabet]].

      <comment>I added more information on Shelta on this page for my Wikipedia Editing project. This included information on it being a secret language, non-travellers being referred to as Buffers, and how it is disguised when in Buffers' presence. I also added the fear of further discrimination, and I also tagged the wikipedia page on Irish Travellers alongside the Shelta article so people would know to check out the Travellers article for futher clarification on Travellers.</comment>

There are a number of languages used in [[Ireland]]. Since the late eighteenth century, [[English language|English]] has been the predominant first language, displacing [[Irish language|Irish]]. A large minority claims some ability to use Irish, and it is the first language for a small percentage of the population.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], under the [[Constitution of Ireland]], both languages have official status, with Irish being the national and first official language. [[Northern Ireland]] has no official language, but English is the ''de facto'' official language of the [[United Kingdom]] and Irish and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]] are recognised regional languages.
{{Culture of Ireland}}

==Languages==
=== Prehistoric languages ===
The earliest linguistic records in Ireland are of [[Primitive Irish]], from about the 5th century AD. Languages spoken in [[Iron Age Ireland]] before then are now irretrievable, although there are some claims of traces in Irish [[toponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Ó Corrain, 'A future for Irish placenames', in: A. Ó Maolfabhail, ''The placenames of Ireland in the third millennium'', Ordnance Survey for the Place names Commission, Dublin (1992), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern languages ==
[[File:Catch and Release sign Ireland multiple languages.jpg|thumb|A [[catch and release]] sign in Ireland. As well as Ireland's official languages (English and Irish), it also displays other European languages (French, German, Swedish, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Czech, Polish, as well as transliterated Russian). However, perhaps reflecting Ireland's recent transition to multilingualism, many translations are imperfect and [[diacritics]] are mostly absent.]]

=== English ===
{{Main article|English language|Hiberno-English|Mid-Ulster English}}
[[Middle English]] was first introduced by the Cambro-Norman settlers in the 12th century. It did not initially take hold as a widely spoken language, as the Norman élite spoke [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. In time, many Norman settlers intermarried and assimilated to the [[Irish culture]]s and some even became "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]". Following the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] and the 1610–15 [[Ulster Plantation]], particularly in the old Pale, Elizabethan English became the language of court, justice, administration, business, trade and of the [[landed gentry]]. Monolingual Irish speakers were generally of the poorer and less educated classes with no land. Irish was accepted as a vernacular language, but then as now, fluency in English was an essential element for those who wanted social mobility and personal advancement. After the legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland's succession of Irish Education Acts that sponsored the [[National school (Ireland)|Irish national schools]] and provided free public primary education, Hiberno-English replaced the Irish language. Since the 1850s, [[English medium education]] was promoted by both the UK administration and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. This greatly assisted the waves of immigrants forced to seek new lives in the US and throughout the Empire after the Famine. Since then the various local Hiberno-English dialects comprise the vernacular language throughout the island.

The 2002 census found that 103,000 British citizens were living in the Republic of Ireland, along with 11,300 from the US and 8,900 from Nigeria, all of whom would speak other dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/threemon_printable.php?id=59|title=It's in the blood. The Citizenship referendum in Ireland|date=1 June 2004|website=Threemonkeysonline.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 census listed 165,000 people from Great Britain{{clarify|post-text = – does Britain mean Great Britain or UK?|date=October 2012}} and 22,000 from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final+Principal+Demographic+Results+2006.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=25 March 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005303/http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irish ===
{{Main article|Irish language|List of Irish-language media|Gaelic revival}}
The original [[Primitive Irish]] was introduced by Celtic speakers. Primitive Irish gradually evolved into [[Old Irish]], spoken between the 5th and the 10th centuries, and then into [[Middle Irish]]. Middle Irish was spoken in Ireland, [[Scotland]], and the [[Isle of Man]] through the 12th century, when it began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland, [[Scottish Gaelic]] in Scotland, and the [[Manx language]] in the Isle of Man. Today, Irish is recognised as the first official language of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and is officially recognised in [[Northern Ireland]] and in the [[European Union]]. Communities that speak Irish as their first language, generally in sporadic regions on the island's west coast, are collectively called the [[Gaeltacht]]. According to more detailed census data, in 2011, there has been an increase of 5,000 in the number of daily Irish speakers since the previous census. There are 77,185 daily speakers, a third of which are located in the Gaeltacht and the remaining 55,554 are located in the rest of the country as well as another estimated 109,663 weekly speakers.

In the over 80 years since the independence of the South, efforts to revive Irish as an active daily vernacular of most of the nation have relied on compulsion and have generally failed. More and more people are becoming [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]] of Irish (who watch Irish-language TV, listen to Irish-language radio, read Irish-language newspapers and magazines) with an estimated 10% (400,000+) of the population of the Republic who would be classified as fluent, near fluent or reasonably good passive speakers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Although the use of Irish in educational and broadcasting contexts has soared with the 600 plus Irish-language primary/secondary schools and creches, English is still overwhelmingly dominant in almost all social, economic and cultural contexts. In the media, there is an Irish-language TV station [[TG4]], [[Cúla 4]] a children's channel on satellite, 5 radio stations such as the national station [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]], [[Raidió na Life]] in Dublin, [[Raidió Fáilte]] in Belfast, Raidió na dTreabh in Galway as well as a youth radio station [[Raidió Rí-Rá]]. There are also several newspapers, such as [[Tuairisc.ie]], Meon Eile, Seachtain a weekly supplement in the Irish Independent and a number of Magazines including Comhar, Feasta and An Timire. There are also occasional columns written in Irish in English-language newspapers, including [[The Irish Times]], [[The Irish News]], [[The Irish Examiner]], [[Metro Éireann]], [[Irish Echo]], [[Evening Echo]] and [[Andersonstown News]]. All of the 40 or so radio stations in the Republic have to have some weekly Irish-language programming to obtain their broadcasting licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/documents/2001act.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=14 October 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014221732/http://www.bci.ie/documents/2001act.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[RTÉ]] runs Nuacht, a news show, in Irish and Léargas, a documentary show, in Irish with English subtitles. The [[Official Languages Act 2003]] gave many new rights to Irish citizens with respect to the Irish language, including the use of Irish in court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2003/a3203.pdf |title=OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ACT 2003 |date=30 October 2003 |accessdate=8 June 2011 |publisher=Oireachtas na hÉireann }}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[Dáil]] debates are to be recorded in Irish also. In 2007, Irish became the 21st official language of the European Union.

=== Ulster Scots ===
{{Main article|Ulster Scots dialects}}
Ulster Scots sometimes called [[Ullans]] is a dialect of [[Scots language|Scots]] spoken in some parts of [[County Donegal]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It is promoted by the [[Ulster Scots Agency]], a cross-border body. Its status as an independent language as opposed to a dialect of Scots has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scots-online.org/articles/contents/awaeoo.pdf|format=PDF|title=Aw Ae Oo—Scots in Scotland and Ulster |website=Scots-online.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shelta ===
{{Main article|Shelta|Irish Travellers}}
Shelta is a [[cant (language)|cant]], based upon both Irish and English, generally spoken by the [[Irish Traveller]] community. It is known as Gammon to Irish speakers and Shelta by the linguistic community. It is a mixture of English and Irish, with Irish being the lexifier language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sign languages ===
{{Main article|Irish Sign Language|Northern Ireland Sign Language}}
Irish Sign Language (ISL) is the sign language of most of Ireland. It has little relation to either spoken Irish or English, and is more closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) than to [[British Sign Language]] (BSL).

[[Northern Ireland Sign Language]] is used in Northern Ireland, and is related to both ISL and BSL in various ways. ISL is also used in Northern Ireland.

=== Latin ===
[[Late Latin]] was introduced by the early Christians by c. 500. It remained a church language, but also was an official language after the Norman conquest in 1171. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] was used by the [[Roman Catholic]] church for services until the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] reforms in 1962–65. Latin is still used in a small number of churches in Dublin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stkevinsdublin.ie|title=The Parish of St Kevin, Harrington Street - Archdiocese of Dublin|website=Stkevinsdublin.ie|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cork, Limerick and [[Stamullen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinmassireland.com/mass-listings/|title=The Latin Mass Society of Ireland   » Mass Listings|website=Latinmassireland.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norman language ===
[[Normans|Norman]] settlers introduced the [[Norman language|Norman]] or [[Anglo-Norman language]] during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] of 1169. From it derived [[Law French#Survivals in modern legal terminology|"Law French"]], that continues to be used today for certain legal purposes in both jurisdictions on the island.

[[Fingalian]] was similar to Yola but spoken in [[Fingal]] up until the mid-19th century.

== Language education ==
=== Republic of Ireland ===
In primary schools, most pupils are taught to speak, read and write in [[Irish language|Irish]] and English. The vast majority of schools teach through English, although a growing number of ''[[gaelscoil]]eanna'' teach through Irish and English. Most students at second level choose to study English as an [[first language|L1 language]] and Irish and other Continental European languages as [[foreign language|L2 languages]]. Irish is not offered as an L1 language by the Department of Education. Prof. David Little (November 2003) said that there was an urgent need to introduce an L1 Irish Gaelic Curriculum. He quoted from a report by An Bord Curaclaim agus Scrúduithe (The Curriculum and Examinations Board) Report of the Board of Studies for Languages, Dublin 1987: "It must be stressed … that the needs of Irish as L1 at post-primary level have been totally ignored, as at present there is no recognition in terms of curriculum and syllabus of any linguistic differences between learners of Irish as L1 and L2.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.ie/uploadedfiles/Publications/Plecaipeis.pdf|format=PDF|title=TEANGACHA SA CHURACLAM IAR-BHUNOIDEACHAIS : plécháipéis : Samhain 2003|website=Ncca.ie|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continental European languages available for the [[Junior Certificate]] and the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] include French, German, Italian and Spanish; Leaving Certificate students can also study [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Japanese and Russian. Some schools also offer [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew Studies]] and [[Latin]] at second level.

Students who did not immigrate to Ireland before the age of ten may receive an exemption from learning Irish. Pupils with learning difficulties can also seek exemption. A recent study has revealed that over half of those pupils who got exemption from studying Irish went on to study a Continental European language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/irish-language-optouts-soar-1306997.html|title=Irish language opt-outs soar|website=Independent.ie|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Pakistan}}

'''Pakistan''' is home to many dozens of languages spoken as first languages. Five languages have more than 10 million speakers each in [[Pakistan]] – [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] and [[Urdu]]. Almost all of Pakistan's languages belong to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] group of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].

Pakistan's national language is [[Urdu]], which, along with [[Pakistani English|English]], is also the official language.

The country also has several regional languages, including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Hindko]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Balti language|Balti]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]],   
[[Dhatki language|Dhatki]], [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]], [[Marwari language|Marwari]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] and [[Burushaski]]. Four of these are [[Provincial languages of Pakistan|provincial languages]] – [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]].

The number of individual languages listed for Pakistan is 74. All are living languages. Of these, 66 are indigenous and 8 are non-indigenous. Furthermore, 7 are 'institutional', 17 are 'developing', 39 are 'vigorous', 9 are 'in trouble', and 2 are 'dying'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==National language==
[[File:Urdu couplet.svg|thumb|An example of the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script used for writing [[Urdu language|Urdu]]]]
[[Urdu]] ({{Nastaliq|اردو}}) is the [[national language]] ({{Nastaliq|قومی زبان}}), ''lingua franca'' and one of two official languages of Pakistan (the other currently being English). Although only about 8% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language, it is widely spoken and understood as a second language by the vast majority of Pakistanis and is being adopted increasingly as a first language by urbanized Pakistanis. It was introduced as the [[lingua franca]] upon the capitulation and annexation of [[Sindh]] (1843) and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] (1849) with the subsequent ban on the use of [[Persian language|Persian]]. According to the linguistic historian [[Tariq Rahman]], however, the oldest name of what is now called Urdu is [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] or Hindvi and it existed in some form at least from the 14th century if not earlier (Rahman 2011). It was probably the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] of the area around Delhi that absorbed words of Persian, Arabic, and [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] (a Turkic language)—in a process like the one that created modern English. This language, according to Rahman, is the ancestor of both modern [[Hindi]] and Urdu. These became two distinct varieties when Urdu was first Persianized in the 18th century and then Hindi was Sanskritized from 1802 onwards.

The name Urdu is a short form of 'Zuban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla' i.e. language of the exalted city. In India the term Urdu, although it means 'military camp' in most [[Turkic languages]], was used for the capital city of the king. In other words, the language of the king's capital was a Persianized form of the language known only by its previous and currently less common name [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. This was shortened to 'Urdu' and this term was used for the first time in written records by the poet Mushafi in 1780 (Rahman 2011: 49). It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] ([[Muslim]] refugees who fled from different parts of [[India]] after independence of Pakistan in 1947), who form nearly 8% of Pakistan's population, and is an acquired second language for the rest. As Pakistan's national language, Urdu has been promoted to promote national unity. It is written with a modified form of the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic alphabet]]—usually in [[Nastaliq script]].

==Provincial languages==
{{Main article|Provincial languages of Pakistan}}

===Punjabi===
[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (پنجابی) is spoken as a first language by more than 44% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. Speakers of [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] and [[Hindko language|Hindko]] have previously been included in the Punjabi totals. The standard Punjabi variety is from the [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujranwala]] and [[Sheikhupura]] districts and it is written in the [[Shahmukhi]] script with the [[Urdu]] alphabet.

===Pashto===
[[Pashto language|Pashto]] (پښتو) is spoken as a first language by more than 15.42% (c. 29 million) of Pakistanis, mainly in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA) and in northern [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] as well as in ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] communities in the cities of [[Karachi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Lahore]]. Karachi is one of the most Pashto speaking cities in the world.&lt;ref name="thefridaytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20110715&amp;page=5 |title=Demographic divide |work=Zia Ur Rehman, a journalist and a researcher based in Karachi |publisher=thefridaytimes |date=July 15–21, 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pashto is also widely spoken in neighboring Afghanistan where it has official language status.

Pashto has rich written literary traditions as well as an oral tradition. There are three major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern ([[Peshawar]]) variety, and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613–1689) and [[Rahman Baba]] (1633–1708) were famous poets in the Pashto language. In the last part of 20th century, Pakhto or Pashto has produced some great poets like [[Ghani Khan]], [[Khatir Afridi]] and [[Amir Hamza Shinwari]]. They are not included in the overall percentage.

===Sindhi===
The [[Sindhi language]] (سنڌي) is spoken as a first language by at most 14.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Sindh province]], parts of Balochistan, Southern Punjab and Balochistan. It has a rich literature and is taught in schools.  It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) language, derived from [[Sanskrit]], and influenced by [[Arabic languages]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]] ruled Sindh province for more than 150 years after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered it in 712 AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 53.4 million people in Pakistan and some 5.8 million in India as well as  some 2.6 million in other parts of the world. It is the official language of Sindh province and  is one of the scheduled languages officially recognized by the federal government in India. It is widely spoken in the [[Lasbela District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] (where the [[Lasi]] tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the [[Nasirabad District|Naseerabad]], [[Rahim Yar Khan District|Rahim Yar Khan]] and [[Dera Ghazi Khan District|Dera Ghazi Khan]] districts in Sindh and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] districts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. Sindhi language has six major [[dialect]]s: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the [[Arabic script]] with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]] and [[Nawabshah]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is also spiritual in nature. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i]] (1689–1752) is one of its greatest poets; he wrote the famous poetic compendium ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]'' which includes the folk stories "[[Sassi Punnun]]" and "[[Umar Marvi]]".

===Balochi===
[[Balochi language|Balochi]] (بلوچی)  is spoken as a first language by about 4% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province. Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. Sarhaddi is a sub-dialect of Rakshani. Other sub-dialects are Kalati (Qalati), Chagai-Kharani and Panjguri. Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi is very different from the rest. The name ''Balochi'' or ''Baluchi'' is not found before the 10th Century. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since [[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a very poetic and rich language and has a certain degree of affinity to [[Urdu language|Urdu]], Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well and [[Ata Shaad]], [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] and [[Noon Meem Danish]] are excellent examples of this.

==Sub-provincial regional languages==
===Saraiki===
[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] (Sarā'īkī, also spelt Siraiki, or less often Seraiki) is an Indo-Aryan language of the [[Lahnda]] group, spoken in the south-western half of the province of Punjab. Saraiki is to a high degree mutually intelligible with Standard Punjabi and shares with it a large portion of its vocabulary and morphology. At the same time in its phonology it is radically different (particularly in the lack of tones, the preservation of the voiced aspirates and the development of implosive consonants), and has important grammatical features in common with the Sindhi language spoken to the south. Saraiki is the first language of about 20 million people in Pakistan, its territory ranges across southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], parts of southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], and some border regions of northern [[Sindh]] and eastern [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].

===Brahui===
[[Brahui language|Brahui]] (براھوی) is a [[Dravidian language]] of central and east-central [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The language has been influenced by neighboring [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and to a lesser extent by [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. 1% of the Pakistani population has Brahui as their first language. It is one of the nine distinguished{{clarify|date=October 2012}} languages of [[Pakistan]]. The [[Brahui people]] have traditionally been taken as a relict population, suggesting that [[Dravidian languages]] were formerly more widespread but were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mallory|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea has fallen out of favor; Brahui appears to have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE, as evidenced by the absence of [[Avestan language|Avestan]] loanwords. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] that moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Elfenbein, A periplous of the ‘Brahui problem’, ''Studia Iranica'' vol. 16 (1987), pp. 215-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shina===
[[Shina language|Shina]] (شینا) (also known as Tshina) is a [[Dardic languages|Dardic language]] spoken by a plurality of people in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] of [[Pakistan]]. The valleys in which it is spoken include [[Astore Valley|Astore]], [[Chilas]], [[Dareil]], [[Tangeer]], [[Gilgit]], [[Ghizer]], and a few parts of [[Kohistan District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Kohistan]]. It is also spoken in the [[Gurez]], [[Drass]], [[Kargil district|Kargil]], [[Karkit Badgam]] and [[Ladakh]] valleys of Kashmir. There were 321,000 speakers of Gilgiti Shina in 1981. The current estimate is nearly 600,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Kashmiri===
[[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] (كأشُر) is a [[Dardic language]] spoken in [[Azad Kashmir]], about 124,000 speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/PK/languages|title=Pakistan|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2% of the Azad Kashmir population).

==Other languages==

===English (previous colonial and co-official language)===
[[English language|English]] is a co-official language of Pakistan and is widely used in the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as to some extent in the officer ranks of Pakistan's armed forces. Pakistan's [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] and laws were written in English and are now being re-written in the local languages. It is also widely used in [[List of schools in Pakistan|schools]], [[List of colleges in Pakistan|colleges]] and [[List of universities in Pakistan|universities]] as a [[medium of instruction]]. English is seen as the language of upward mobility, and its use is becoming more prevalent in upper social circles, where it is often spoken alongside native Pakistani languages. In 2015, it was announced that there were plans to promote Urdu in official business, but Pakistan's Minister of Planning Ahsan Iqbal stated,"Urdu will be a second medium of language and all official business will be bilingual." He also went on to say that English would be taught alongside Urdu in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pakistan to replace English with Urdu as official language - The Express Tribune|url = http://tribune.com.pk/story/928480/pakistan-to-replace-english-with-urdu-as-official-language/|website = The Express Tribune|accessdate = 2016-01-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic (historical official language, religious and minor literary language)===
In the history, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (عربي) was the official language when the [[History of Pakistan#Arab Caliphate|territory]] of the modern state [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] was a part of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] between 651 and 750.

The Arabic language is mentioned in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution of Pakistan]]. It declares in article 31 No. 2 that ''"The State shall endeavour, as respects the [[Muslim]]s of [[Pakistan]] (a) to make the teaching of the [[Quran|Holy Quran]] and [[Islamic studies|Islamiat]] compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of Arabic language ..."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Pakistan]]: [https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-31-islamic-way-of-life ''Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 - Article: 31 Islamic way of life''], 1973, retrieved 28 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic is the religious language of Muslims. The [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and [[Muslim]] theology is taught in Arabic with [[Urdu language|Urdu]] translation. The Pakistani diaspora living in the [[Middle East]] has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in [[mosque]]s, [[school]]s, [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] and [[Madrasah|madrassahs]]. A majority of Pakistan's [[Muslim]] population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]] as part of their religious education.

The National Education Policy 2017 declares in article 3.7.4 that: “''Arabic as compulsory part will be integrated in Islamiyat from Middle to Higher Secondary level to enable the students to understand the Holy Quran.''“ Furthermore, it specifies in article 3.7.6: “''Arabic as elective subject shall be offered properly at Secondary and Higher Secondary level with Arabic literature and grammar in its course to enable the learners to have command in the language.''“ This law is also valid for private schools as it defines in article 3.7.12: “''The curriculum in Islamiyat, Arabic and Moral Education of public sector will be adopted by the private institutions to make uniformity in the society.''“&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training]]: [http://www.moent.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/National%20Educaiton%20Policy%202017.pdf ''National Education Policy 2017''], p. 25, retrieved 28 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian (previous colonial and literary language)===
{{Main article|Persian language in South Asia}}
{{See also|Persian and Urdu}}
[[Persian language|Persian]] (فارسی) was the official and cultural language of the [[Mughal Empire]], a continuation since the introduction of the language by [[Central Asian]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] invaders who migrated into the Indian Subcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQJHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=ghaznavids+brought+persian+to+south+asia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WSamVIHeGNLiavmygKAL&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ghaznavids%20brought%20persian%20to%20south%20asia&amp;f=false|title=South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the patronisation of it by the earlier Turko-Persian Delhi Sultanate. Persian was officially abolished with the arrival of the British: in [[Sindh]] in 1843 and in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 1849. It is today spoken primarily by the [[Dari language|Dari]] speaking refugees from [[Afghanistan]] and the Hazara community of Quetta.

===Bengali (previous regional and immigrant language)===
{{Main article|Bengali language movement}}
{{See also|Bengalis in Pakistan}}
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] (بنگالی) is not an official language in Pakistan, but a significant number of Pakistani citizens have migrated from [[East Bengal]] and live in West Pakistan or East Pakistan prior to 1971. Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali".&lt;ref name="Pakspace"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.therepublicofrumi.com/chronicle/1954.htm| title = UF elections victory| work = Chronicles of Pakistan| accessdate = 2011-12-11| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214900/http://www.therepublicofrumi.com/chronicle/1954.htm| archivedate = 18 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include illegal immigrants who migrated from Bangladesh after 1971. Most Pakistani Bengalis, are bilingual speaking both Urdu and Bengali, and are mainly settled in Karachi.

===Turkic languages (previous colonial and immigrant languages)===
[[Turkic languages]] were used by the ruling [[Turkic peoples|Turco-Mongols]] such as the [[Mughals]] and earlier [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultans]] of the subcontinent. There are small pockets of Turkic speakers found throughout the country, notably in the valleys in the countries northern regions which lie adjacent to [[Central Asia]], western Pakistani region of [[Waziristan]] principally around [[Kanigoram]] where the [[Burki|Burki tribe]] dwells and in Pakistan's urban centres of [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]] and [[Islamabad]]. The autobiography of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]], [[Baburnama|Tuzk Babari]] was also written in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. After returning from exile in [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Persia]] in 1555, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Humayun]] further introduced [[Persian language]] and culture in the court and government. The [[Chaghatai language]], in which Babur had written his memoirs, disappeared almost entirely from the culture of the courtly elite, and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] could not speak it. Later in life, Humayun himself is said to have spoken in Persian verse more often than not.

A number of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speaking refugees, mostly [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]] from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Uyghurs]] from [[China]] have settled in [[Pakistan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Minor languages===
Other languages spoken by linguistic minorities include the languages listed below, with speakers ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands. A few are highly [[endangered languages]] that may soon have no speakers at all.&lt;ref name="Gordon, Raymond 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Pakistan |accessdate=2009-03-17 |year=2005 |author=Gordon, Raymond |deadurl=yes |archivedate=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Indo-Iranian languages derive from a reconstructed common [[proto-language]], called [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]].

===Indo-Iranian===
Most of the languages of Pakistan belong to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] (more commonly known as '''Indo-Iranic'''&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Arienne M. "The texture of tongues: Languages and power in China." Nationalism and Ethnic Politics 4.1-2 (1998): 68-85.&lt;/ref&gt;) branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;Marian Rengel ''Pakistan: A Primary Source Cultural Guide'' page 38 {{ISBN|0823940012}}, 9780823940011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mukhtar Ahmed ''Ancient Pakistan - an Archaeological History'' pages 6-7 {{ISBN|1495966437}}, 9781495966439&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided between two or three major groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] (the majority, including Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Hindko, and Saraiki, among others), [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] (or '''Iranic'''&lt;ref&gt;Yagmur, Kutlay. "Languages in Turkey." MULTILINGUAL MATTERS (2001): 407-428.&lt;/ref&gt;) (the major ones being Pashto, Balochi, and Khowar, among others) and [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] (the major one being [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]). At times Dardic is considered another branch of Indo-Iranian, but many linguists term Dardic as individual Indo-Aryan languages that do not form any subgrouping within Indo-Aryan.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World (page 283)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nuristani language]], considered another individual branch of Indo-Iranian, is spoken by the [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] minority in Afghanistan near the Afghan-Pakistani border, but not known to be spoken indigenously in Pakistan.

Some of the important languages in the Indo-Aryan group are [[dialect continuum]]s. One of these is [[Lahnda languages|Lahnda]],&lt;ref&gt;[[silcode:lah|ISO 639 code sets]]. Sil.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes Western Punjabi (but not standard [[Panjabi language|Punjabi]]), Northern Hindko, Southern Hindko, Khetrani, Saraiki, and Pahari-Potwari, plus two more languages outside of Pakistan. The other is Marwari, and includes Marwari of Pakistan and several languages of India (Dhundari, Marwari, Merwari, Mewari, and Shekhawati).&lt;ref&gt;[[silcode:mwr|ISO 639 code sets]]. Sil.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A third is [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], and consists of [[Bagri language|Bagri]], [[Gujari]] in Pakistan and several others in India: Gade Lohar,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ethnologue:gda|Ethnologue report for language code: gda]]. Ethnologue.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harauti]] (Hadothi), [[Malvi language|Malvi]], and Wagdi.

Although Urdu is not a dialect continuum, it is a major dialect of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and somewhat differs from [[Hindi]], another dialect of Hindustani which is not spoken in Pakistan.

There are several dialects continuums in the Iranian group as well: [[Balochi language|Balochi]], which includes Eastern, Western and Southern Balochi;&lt;ref&gt;[[silcode:bal|ISO 639 code sets]]. Sil.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pashto, and includes Northern, Central, and Southern [[Pashto language|Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;[[silcode:pus|ISO 639 code sets]]. Sil.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The following three languages of Pakistan are not part of the Indo-European language family:

* [[Brahui language|Brahui]] (spoken in central Balochistan province) is a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]]. Its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by Balochi. It is an individual language in the Dravidian language family and does not belong to any subgrouping in that language family. 
* The [[Balti dialect]] of [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] (spoken in an area of southern [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]) is a [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan language]] of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] language family&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/family/sinotibetan WALS – Sino-Tibetan]. Wals.info. Retrieved on 2011-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Burushaski]] (spoken in Hunza, Nagar, Yasin, and Ishkoman valleys in Gilgit–Baltistan) is a [[language isolate]] with no indiginious written script and instead currently uses Urdu script, based on the Perso-Arabic script.

==Writing systems==
{{Main article|Nasta'liq script|Urdu alphabet}}
[[File:nastaliq.jpg|thumb|left|Chalipa panel, [[Mir Emad]]]]

All languages of Pakistan, besides English, are written in [[Nastaʿlīq]], a modified [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]]. The [[Mughal Empire]] adopted [[Persian language|Persian]] as the court [[language]] during their rule over [[South Asia]] as did their predecessors, such as the Ghaznavids. During this time, {{transl|Arab|Nastaʿlīq}} came into widespread use in [[South Asia]]. The influence remains to this day. In Pakistan, almost everything in Urdu is written in the script, concentrating the greater part of Nastaʿlīq usage in the world.

[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|right|Arabic manuscript from the Abbasid-era]]

The [[Urdu alphabet]] is the [[right-to-left]] [[alphabet]]. It is a modification of the Persian alphabet, which is itself a derivative of the [[Arabic alphabet]]. With 38 letters, the Urdu alphabet is typically written in the [[calligraphic]] [[Nasta'liq script]], whereas [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is more commonly in the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] style.

[[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] adopted a variant of the [[Persian alphabet]] as well, in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan today. It has a total of 52 letters, augmenting the Urdu with [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and eighteen new letters ({{lang|sd|ڄ ٺ ٽ ٿ ڀ ٻ ڙ ڍ ڊ ڏ ڌ ڇ ڃ ڦ ڻ ڱ ڳ ڪ}}) for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or Persian are [[homophone]]s in Sindhi.

[[Balochi language|Balochi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] are written in [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]]. The [[Shahmukhī script]], a variant of the [[Urdu alphabet]], is used to write the [[Punjabi language]] in Pakistan.

Usually, bare transliterations of Urdu into Roman letters, [[Roman Urdu]], omit many [[phoneme|phonemic]] elements that have no equivalent in English or other languages commonly written in the [[Latin script]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[National Language Authority]] of [[Pakistan]] has developed a number of systems with specific notations to signify non-English sounds, but these can only be properly read by someone already familiar with Urdu.

This is a list of '''[[Australian Aboriginal languages]]''' and dialects. Many, but not all, of these languages are endangered. An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]].

[[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

'''Malaysian Cantonese''' ({{zh|t=馬來西亞廣東話|cy=Máhlòihsāia Gwóngdūng wá|j=Maa5loi4sai1aa3 Gwong2dung1 waa2}}) is a local variety of [[Cantonese]] spoken in [[Malaysia]]. It is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] throughout much of the central portion of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], being spoken in the capital [[Kuala Lumpur]], southern [[Perak]], [[Pahang]], [[Selangor]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]], it is also widely understood to varying degrees by many Chinese throughout the country, regardless of their ancestral [[Varieties of Chinese|dialect]].

Malaysian Cantonese is not uniform throughout the country, with variation between individuals and areas. It is mutually intelligible with Cantonese spoken in both [[Hong Kong Cantonese|Hong Kong]] and [[Guangzhou]] in Mainland China but has distinct differences in vocabulary and pronunciation which make it unique.

It is also widely spoken in the town of [[Sekinchan]] in the
[[Sabak Bernam]] district of northern [[Selangor]]. It is also used in central and southern [[Perak]], especially in the state capital [[Ipoh]] and the surrounding towns of the [[Kinta Valley]] region ([[Gopeng]], [[Batu Gajah]] and [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]]) as well as the towns of [[Tapah]] and [[Bidor]] in the [[Batang Padang]] district of southern [[Perak]].

Due to its predominance in the capital city, Cantonese is highly influential in local Chinese-language media and is used in commerce by Malaysian Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/topic/9443-malaysian-cantonese/ Malaysian Cantonese] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20140527184424/http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/topic/9443-malaysian-cantonese/ |date=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tze Wei Sim, ''Why are the Native Languages of the Chinese Malaysians in Decline''. Journal of Taiwanese Vernacular, p. 74, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Cantonese is widely understood and spoken with varying fluency by Chinese throughout Malaysia, regardless of their dialect group. This is in spite of [[Hokkien]] being the most widely spoken variety and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the medium of education at [[Malaysian Chinese#Education system and languages literacy|Chinese-language schools]]. The widespread influence of Cantonese is also due in large part to the popularity of [[Hong Kong popular culture|Hong Kong media]], particularly [[TVB]] dramas.

==Phonological Differences==
A sizeable portion of Malaysian Cantonese speakers, including native speakers, are not of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese ancestry]], with many belonging to different ancestral dialect groups such as [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew]]. The historical and continued influence of their original dialects has produced variation and change in the pronuncation of particular sounds in Malaysian Cantonese when compared to "standard" Cantonese.&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wee Kek Koon|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2171053/why-cantonese-spoken-malaysia-sounds-different|title=Why Cantonese spoken in Malaysia sounds different to Hong Kong Cantonese, and no it’s not ‘wrong’|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2018-11-01|accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on their [[Malaysian Chinese#Ancestral origin|ancestral origin]] and [[Malaysian Chinese#Education system and languages literacy|educational background]], some speakers may not exhibit the unique characteristics described below.

*Many Malaysians have difficulty with the {{angle bracket|eu}} sound and will substitute it with other sounds where it occurs. Often these changes brings the pronunciation of most words in line with their Hakka pronunciation, and for many words their Hokkien pronunciations as well.
**Words that end with {{angle bracket|-eung}} &amp; {{angle bracket|-euk}} (pronounced [œːŋ] &amp; [œːk̚] in ''standard'' Cantonese) such as 香 ''hēung'', 兩 ''léuhng'', 想 ''séung'' and 著 ''jeuk'', 腳 ''geuk'', 約 ''yeuk'' may be pronounced as [iɔŋ] &amp; [iɔk̚], which by local spelling conventions may be written as {{angle bracket|-iong/-eong}} &amp; {{angle bracket|-iok/-eok}} respectively, e.g. 香 ''hīong'', 兩 ''líohng'', 想 ''síong'' and 著 ''jiok'', 腳 ''giok'', 約 ''yok''.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; This change brings the pronunciation of most words in line with their Hakka pronunciation, and for many words their Hokkien pronunciations as well.
**Words with final {{angle bracket|-eun}} &amp; {{angle bracket|-eut}} (pronounced [ɵn] &amp; [ɵt̚] in "Standard" Cantonese) such as 春 ''chēun'' and 出 ''chēut'' may be pronounced as {{angle bracket|-un}} [uːn] &amp; {{angle bracket|-ut}} [uːt̚] respectively.
**Words with final {{angle bracket|-eui}} (pronounced [ɵy] in "Standard" Cantonese) such as 水 ''séui'' and 去 ''heui'' may be pronounced as {{angle bracket|-oi}} [ɔːy], {{angle bracket|-ui}} [uːy] or even {{angle bracket|-ei}} [ei] depending on the word.
*Many Malaysians also have difficulty with the {{angle bracket|yu}} sound (pronounced as [yː] in "Standard" Cantonese) which occurs in words such as 豬 ''jyū'', 算 ''syun'', 血 ''hyut''. This sound may be substitued with [iː] which in the case of some words may involve [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of the preceeding initial [◌ʲiː].
*Some speakers, particularly non-native speakers may not differentiate the long and short vowels, such as {{angle bracket|aa}} [aː] and {{angle bracket|a}} [ɐ].
*Due to the influence of Hong Kong media, Malaysian Cantonese is also affected by so called "[[Proper Cantonese pronunciation|Lazy Sounds]]" (懶音 ''láahn yām'') though to a much lesser degree than Hong Kong Cantonese.
**Many younger and middle-aged speakers pronounce some {{angle bracket|n-}} initial words with an {{angle bracket|l-}} initial. For many, this process is not complete, with the initial {{angle bracket|n-/l-}} distinction maintained for other words. e.g. 你 ''néih'' → ''léih''.
**Generally, the ⟨ng-⟩ initial has been maintained, unlike in Hong Kong where it is being increasingly dropped and replaced with the null initial. Instead, among some speakers, Malaysian Cantonese exhibits the addition of the {{angle bracket|ng-}} initial for some words that originally have a null initial. This also occurs in Hong Kong Cantonese as a form of [[Hypercorrection#Chinese|hypercorrection]] of "Lazy Sounds", e.g. 亞 ''a'' → ''nga''.
**Some speakers have lost labialisation of the {{angle bracket|gw-}} &amp; {{angle bracket|kw-}} initials, instead pronouncing them as {{angle bracket|g-}} &amp; {{angle bracket|k-}}, e.g. 國 ''kwok'' → ''kok''.

==Vocabulary Differences==
Malaysian Cantonese is in contact with many other Chinese dialects such as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] as well other languages such Malay and English.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; As a result it has absorbed many loanwords and expressions that may not be found in Cantonese spoken elsewhere. Malaysian Cantonese also preserves some vocabulary which would be considered old fashioned or unusual in Hong Kong but may be preserved in other Cantonese speaking areas such as Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wee Kek Koon|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2088859/southeast-asian-cantonese-why-hongkongers-should|title=Southeast Asian Cantonese – why Hongkongers should not ridicule it|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2017-04-20|accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the examples below are used throughout Malaysia, with differences in vocabulary between different Cantonese speaking areas such as Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur and Sandakan.
(Educational background, Native dialect)

*Use of 愛/唔愛 ''oi/mh oi'' instead of 要/唔要 ''yiu/mh yiu'' to refer to want/don't want, also meaning love/like. Also used in Guangzhou and is similar to the character's usage in Hakka.
*More common use of 曉 ''híu'' to mean "to be able to/to know how to" where commonly than 會 ''wúi''/識 ''sīk'' would be more commonly used in Hong Kong. Also used in Guangzhou and is similar to the character's usage to Hakka.
*Use of 冇 “móuh” at the end of sentences to create questions, e.g. 你愛食飯冇? ''néih oi sihk faahn móuh?'', "Do you want to eat?"
*Some expressions have under gone a change in meaning such as 仆街 pūk gāai, literally "fall on the street" which is commonly used in Malaysia to mean "broke/bankrupt" and is not considered a profanity unlike in Hong Kong where it is used to mean "drop dead/go to hell".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/words/1679/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some English educated speakers may use 十千 ''sahp chīn'' instead of 萬 ''maahn'' to express 10,000, e.g. 14,000 might be expressed as 十四千 ''sahp sei chīn'' instead of 一萬四 ''yāt maahn sei''.
*Use of expressions which would sound outdated to speakers in Hong Kong, e.g. 冇相干 ''móuh sēung gōn'' to mean "Never mind/It doesn't matter", whereas 冇所謂 ''móuh só waih''/唔緊要 ''mh gān yiu'' would be more commonly used in Hong Kong. Some of these expressions are still in current use in Guangzhou.
*Word order, particularly the placement of certain grammatical particles may differ, e.g. 食飯咗 ''sihk faahn jó'' instead of 食咗飯 ''sihk jó faahn'' for "Have eaten."
*Unique expression's such as 我幫你講 ''ngóh bōng néih góng'' to mean "I'm telling you" where 我同你講 ''ngóh tùhng neih góng''/我俾你知 ''ngóh béi néih jī'' would be used in Hong Kong.
*Malaysian Cantonese is also characterised by the extensive use of sentence ending particles, to an even greater extent than occurs in Hong Kong Cantonese.

Born to a poor family in a remote village of [[Odisha]], she fought successfully the widely prevalent social [[taboo]] against educating women, walked 15&amp;nbsp;km daily amidst hilly terrain and swamp to the only [[high school]] in the entire region to emerge as first woman [[matriculate]] of her village and subsequently the first woman law graduate of her region. The inspiring life story of Manasi Pradhan has been adopted as documentaries in [[United States]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rapidleaks.com/featured/manasi-pradhan-unsung-hero/

==Early life and education==
Pradhan was born to a very poor family in a remote village called Ayatapur in [[Banapur]] block of  [[Khordha district]], [[Odisha]].&lt;ref name="Statesman" /&gt; She was the eldest among two daughters and a son born to Hemalata Pradhan and Godabarish Pradhan. Her father was a farmer and mother a house wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://bharatduniya.com/2017/12/women-achiever-series-manasi-pradhan-worked-for-women-empowerment/
 | title=महिला हिंसा के खिलाफ आवाज़ उठाती मानसी प्रधान
 |publisher= Lok Bharat Media Network | access-date=3 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female education]] was considered a major [[taboo]] in most [[rural]] areas of [[Banapur]] then. Girls were rarely allowed to attend [[high school]]. After completing her [[middle school]] in the village, there was strong pressure to end her studies. Further, there was no [[high school]] in the nearby areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://fsfoundationindia.org/share-your-story-of-happiness/happiness-stories/happiness-story-manasi-pradhan/ | title=Story of Manasi Pradhan |publisher= First Stone Foundation | access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She walked 15&amp;nbsp;km daily, amidst hilly terrain and [[swamp]], to the only [[high school]] in the entire region, to emerge as the first woman to pass high school examination in her village.&lt;ref name="Statesman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.janmanchtv.com/2017/06/06/manasi-pradhan-a-social-reformer-whose-discussion-is-not-only-in-india-but-also-in-the-world/ | title=Manasi Pradhan – The Social Reformer |publisher= JanManch TV | access-date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing her schooling from Patitapaban High School in Gambharimunda, the family shifted to [[Puri]] for her college [[education]]. With little earning from the village farmland, it became difficult to sustain and the burden of the entire family fell on her shoulder. Soon after passing the intermediate examination, she had to work to support her family and her studies. She earned a B.A. in [[Economics]] from Government Women’s College, [[Puri]], and M.A. in [[Odia literature]] from [[Utkal University]]. She obtained [[Bachelor of Laws]] from G.M. Law College, [[Puri]].&lt;ref name="orissapost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orissapost.com/epaper/080314/p2.htm|title=Manasi Pradhan wins Rani Laxmibai Puraskar|publisher=Orissa Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.theypfoundation.org/news/2017/4/20/an-interview-with-manasi-pradhan | title=An interview with Manasi Pradhan |publisher= The YP Foundation | access-date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.notedlife.com/hi/Manasi-Pradhan-biography-in-hindi | title=Manasi Pradhan biography |publisher= www.notedlife.com | access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Manasi Pradhan as an entrepreneur.jpg|thumb|left|Manasi Pradhan as an woman entrepreneur in 1998]]
She worked with the [[finance]] department, Govt. of [[Odisha]] and  [[Andhra Bank]] for a short period but left both to pursue her own passion. In October 1983, at the age of 21, she began her own [[printing]] business and a literary journal. In few years time, the [[business]] grew exponentially, putting her in the league of few successful women [[entrepreneur]]s of her time.&lt;ref name="orissapost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.womensdaycelebration.com/blog/5-most-inspiring-women-social-workers-around-the-world/ | title=5 Most Inspiring Women Social Workers around the World |publisher= Women’s Day | access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dewaninstitutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Women-Entrepreneur-contribution-to-Indian-Economy.pdf |title=Women Entrepreneur contribution to Indian Economy |author= |publisher=DVS International Journal of Multi-Disciplinary Research, ISSN No.2454-7522, Issue: 08 Vol:02, No.4 April–June 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

[[File:Manasi Pradhan addressing the Oxford Union, University of Oxford.jpg|thumb|Manasi Pradhan addressing the [[Oxford Union]], [[University of Oxford]], on 24 October 2018 at the historic Oxford Union Debating Chamber]]

In 1987, she founded [[OYSS Women]]. The initial motive was to help girl [[student]]s achieve higher [[education]] and develop them as future [[leader]]s in the [[society]]. [[OYSS Women]] has been organizing [[leadership]] workshops, [[education]] and [[vocational]] training camps, [[legal awareness]] and [[self-defense]] camps, nurturing thousands of young women as prospective [[leader]]s in their chosen field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/ncw-chief-inaugurates--womens-rights-stall-at-puri.html |title=Women’s Rights Stall at Puri |newspaper=The Pioneer |date=4 July 2014 |access-date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the above, the organization undertakes numerous activities and events and is widely credited for pioneering contribution in empowering women. The organization is also spearheading the [[Honour for Women National Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/roadmap-drawn-for-rural-women-empowerment.html |title=Roadmap drawn for rural women empowerment |date=26 June 2013 |access-date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honour for Women National Campaign==
In November 2009, she launched the [[Honour for Women National Campaign]], a nationwide movement to end [[violence against women]] in [[India]]. The movement has been instrumental in galvanizing the nation against women atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/print.php?printFOR=storydetail&amp;story_url_key=three-strategies-to-curb-violence-against-women&amp;section_url_key=state-editions|title=Three strategies to cut violence against women|publisher=The Pioneer | date= 13 April 2015 | access-date= 28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://thehinduimages.com/details-page.php?id=151551141#tabs1-html
 | title=Manasi Pradhan |first=|last=|publisher= The Hindu | access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement employs a multi-pronged [[strategy]] to fight the menace of [[violence against women]] in [[India]].

It uses a plethora of vehicles i.e. [[women’s rights]] stall, [[women’s rights]] festival, [[women’s rights]] meets, [[women’s rights]] literature, audio-visual displays, street plays etc. to raise awareness on [[legal]] and institutional provisions to fight atrocities on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/at-chilika-meet-rural-women-vow-to-fight-against-violence.html |title=Rural women vow to fight against violence|newspaper=The Pioneer |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it puts pressure on the state by mobilizing [[public opinion]] and sustained campaigning for [[institutional]] changes and correctional measures to contain [[violence against women]].&lt;ref name="newindianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Three-pronged-Strategy-to-Curb-Crime-Against-Women/2015/04/12/article2760160.ece|title=Three-pronged Strategy to Curb Crime Against Women|publisher=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manasi Pradhan inaugurating the Joy of Giving Week at BITS Pilani.jpg|thumb|Manasi Pradhan inaugurating the Joy of Giving Week at [[Bits-pilani]] on September 4, 2017]]
In 2013, after a four year long churning involving a series of national seminars, workshops and consultations involving stakeholders from across [[India]], the movement came up with a detailed draft charting its fight to end [[violence against women]].

[[File:Manasi Pradhan delivering TEDx talk at IIM.jpg|thumb|Manasi Pradhan giving [[TEDx]] talk at [[Indian Institutes of Management]] Ranchi on January 28, 2018]]
In 2014, the movement released a Four-Point Charter of Demand for all [[state government]]s of [[India]]. In the same year, it launched [[Nirbhaya Vahini]], consisting of over 10,000 [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s spread across [[India]] to mobilize [[public opinion]] and engage in a sustained campaign for implementation of its four-point charter of demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhopal/nirbhaya-vahini-to-fight-violence-against-women-in-odisha.html |title=Nirbhaya Vahini to fight violence against women |newspaper= The Pioneer |date=21 December 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four-Point Charter of Demand==
In 2014, the [[Honour for Women National Campaign]] headed by Manasi Pradhan released a four-point charter of demand for all [[state government]]s of [[India]]. The charter forms a [[cornerstone]] of the movement and has led several [[state government]]s to make suitable [[amendments]].

'''Mir Anvar Pashayev''' ({{lang-az|Mir Cəlal Paşayev}}; 26 April 1908, [[Khalkhal, Ardabil|Khalkhal]], [[Iran]] – 28 September 1978, [[Baku]]), known by his literary pen-name Mir Jalal, was an [[Azerbaijan]]i writer and literary critic. He was the grandfather of Azerbaijan's current First Lady [[Mehriban Aliyeva]].

==Education and career==
Mir Jalal, who had received his degree in education in 1928 in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], two years later studied at [[Kazan University]] in [[Tatarstan]], where [[Lenin]] once had been a student. Later on Mir Jalal enrolled in the Institute of Higher Education of Baku. While studying, he was doing research and writing for various newspapers. Among them the most notable was Young Worker for which many outstanding literary men of Azerbaijan contributed early in their lives. In 1933 he was working as researcher of Azerbaijani literary history at the [[State University of Azerbaijan]]. After writing a book on the Poetry of [[Fuzûlî]], the famous fifteenth century Azeri poet, as his Master’s thesis, in 1947 he completed his doctoral dissertation on Literary Schools in Azerbaijan with special emphasis on the famous satirical journal [[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasreddin]] and its writers. It was in the same year that he became a professor at the State University of Baku and devoted his life to teaching and writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.org/Azeri/az_latin/latin_lit/az_literature/short_stories/pashayev_mir_jalal/mir_jalal_eng/intro_life_works.html The Life and Works of Mir Jalal (1908–1978)] by Hasan Javadi. Azeri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Mir Jalal Pashayev is best remembered for his satirical short stories, which poked fun at [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[bureaucracy]] which had established itself in Azerbaijan when he was a mere boy of 12 years old. His glimpses of everyday life are informative and, on occasion, hilariously exaggerated, but they document the psychological transformation of a society that for generations was rewarded for denying common sense and for stifling personal intuition and initiative. Mir Jalal did not live to see the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai121_folder/121_articles/121_short_story_mir_jalal.html Mir Jalal Pashayev, Dried up in the Meetings]. Azerbaijan International. Spring 2004, #12.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashayev co-authored the three-volume, "History of Azerbaijani Literature" (1957–1960) and wrote more than 50 books. ''İclas Qurusu'' (Dried Up in Meetings) is one of his most famous works describing how the main character's obsession with bureaucratic procedures makes him totally out of touch with the realities of his family life. His most popular books are:
*Dirilən adam (Resurrection Man, 1936)
*Bir gəncin manifesti (Manifest of a Young Man, 1938)
*Yolumuz hayanadır? (Where Are We Going?, 1957)
*Yaşıdlar (People of the Same Age, 1984).
Pashayev’s honors include: [[Honorary Art Worker]] of Azerbaijan (1969) and Laureate of Azerbaijan [[Komsomol Award]] (1968).

'''Mowni''' was the pen name of [[Tamil fiction]] writer '''S. Mani Iyer''' (1907&amp;ndash;1985). Born at [[Semmangudi]], Mowni, was one  of  the few writers of Tamil fiction. He had his high school education in [[Kumbakonam]] and lived there for fourteen years after marrying.  Then he moved to [[Chidhambaram]] permanently to look after his family properties. He initially had 5 children. There were 4 boys and 1 girl. Two of his sons died when they were very young. One other son passed on due to an accident. His remaining son lives in America while his daughter lives in his house.

Mowni had a Bachelor's degree in [[Mathematics]], but he did not take up  any job. He was very fond of [[European classical music]] and he also had very strong exposure to [[Western literature]], and showed deep interest in [[Indian philosophy]]. Mowni wrote 24 short stories from around 1934, some of which have been translated into English.Mowni's stories are based on the uncertainties of human life, relationships and their manifestations. His pen name and the titles of his stories were given to him by his mentor. His stories came out in Tamil magazines such as ''Theni.'' He was fondly called by pudhumaipithan ( contemporary writer of his age)as " sirukathaiyin thirumular". Mowni died in Chidambaram on June 6, 1985.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">The composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|f|ɡ|æ|ŋ|_|æ|m|ə|ˈ|d|eɪ|ə|s|_|ˈ|m|oʊ|t|s|ɑr|t}}; {{respell|MOHT|sart}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɔlfɡaŋ amaˈdeːʊs ˈmoːtsaʁt|lang|De-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.ogg}}) went by many different names in his lifetime. This resulted partly from the church traditions of the day, and partly from the fact that Mozart was multilingual and freely adapted his name to other languages.

==Baptismal record==
Mozart was baptized on 28 January 1756, the day after his birth, at [[Salzburg Cathedral|St. Rupert's Cathedral]] in [[Salzburg]] as "Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart". The baptismal register of the cathedral parish contains the entry shown below, written down in [[Latin]] by city chaplain Leopold Lamprecht. A transcriptions with editorial additions by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] follows.
[[File:Mozart Taufeintrag.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Mozart's baptismal record]]

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
| [Januarius] 28. med[ia hora] 11. merid[iana] baptizatus est : natus pridie h[ora] 8. vesp[ertina]

| Nob[ilis] D[ominus] Joannes Theophilus Pergmaÿr Senator et Mercator civicus p[ro] t[empore] sponsus
| Idem [= Leopoldus Lamprecht Capellanus Civicus]
|}

Mozart's father Leopold announced the birth of his son in a letter to the publisher Johann Jakob Lotter with the words "... the boy is called Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb" ("''der Bub heißt Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb''" in German). The baptismal names "Joannes" and "Chrysostomus" also have German equivalents, namely "Johann" and "Chrysostomos" (or less frequently, "Chrysostom"). The widely used ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' employs these versions in the heading name for its Mozart article, which parenthesizes the little-used baptismal names: "(Johann Chrysostom) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."

Here are the details of the various names given on the register:
*Mozart's first two baptismal names, "Joannes Chrysostomus", represent his [[saint's name]], following the custom of the [[Catholic Church]]. They result from the fact that his birthday, 27&amp;nbsp;January, was the feast day of St. [[John Chrysostom]]. The document also records that Mozart was of legitimate birth and gives the names of his parents and his father Leopold's occupation as court musician. The first paragraph indicates that the baptism took place at 10:30 in the morning, and that Mozart had been born at 8:00 the night before. The baptismal name "Joannes Chrysostomus" was in conformance to Catholic custom and was not used by Mozart in everyday life. "[[Chrysostomus (disambiguation)|Chrysostomus]]" means "golden mouth."
*"Wolfgangus" is "[[Wolfgang]]", adapted to the Latin used in the parish register. The composer used "Wolfgang" in German-speaking contexts. "Wolfgang," which means "wolf's path," was the name of the composer's maternal grandfather.
*"[[Theophilus (disambiguation)|Theophilus]]" comes from Greek and is variously rendered as "lover of God" or "loved by God." "Gottlieb" is its German form, and the familiar "Amadeus" is its Latin form. "Theophilus" was a name of Mozart's godfather, the merchant Joannes Theophilus Pergmayr, whose presence is recorded in the fourth paragraph.

==Later life==
Austrian musicologist [[Otto Erich Deutsch]], who studied all available letters and documents about the composer, arrived at the following conclusion about what the composer called himself: "In Italy, from 1770, Mozart called himself 'Wolfgango Amadeo', and from about 1777, 'Wolfgang Amadè'."

The use of multiple language versions of the same name was perhaps common in Mozart's day. [[Haydn's name|Joseph Haydn]] went by "Joseph" (German, English and French), "Josephus" (Latin) and "Giuseppe" (Italian); and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published his works as "Luigi" (Italian) and as "Louis" (French).

Mozart's preference for "Wolfgang Amadè" can be seen on the wedding contract for his marriage to [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze Weber]], dated August 3, 1782, where the composer's signature is "Wolfgang Amade Mozart". In the parish register entry for the marriage, dated August 4, Mozart is referred to as "Herr Wolfgang Adam Mozart".

Mozart spelled "Amadè" variously in regard to the accent on the final letter.  Robert Spaethling, who translated many of the composer's letters, writes, "[Mozart] is especially nonchalant in his placement of Italian and French accents:  sometime he writes 'chèr papa', at other times 'chér papa,'&lt;ref&gt;French for 'Dear papa'.  Modern French usage is accentless. It is possible that Mozart wrote an accent by analogy to the feminine form, which is spelled 'chère'.&lt;/ref&gt; and even his own name appears variously as 'Amadé', 'Amadè', and plain 'Amade'."&lt;ref&gt;Spaethling (2000:xii)&lt;/ref&gt; As a web search indicates, modern usage also varies among these three alternatives.

Mozart's preference for "Amadè" was not in general respected by others. Frequently, he was called either "Wolfgang Amadeus" or "Wolfgang Gottlieb". Here are examples:
*The day Mozart died, his name was entered in the death records of the Vienna Magistrate as "Wolfgang Amadeus". This is the earliest posthumous source that uses the Latin version of his name.
*In a letter dated December 11, 1791, Mozart's widow [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]], in severe financial straits, asked to be given a pension by the Emperor (the appeal was ultimately successful). She signed herself "Konstantia Mozart, [[née]] Weber, widow relict of the late Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart." Imperial officials, replying to her request, used the same name.
*A [[benefit concert]] for Mozart's family was held in [[Prague]] on December 28, 1791, billed as "Concert in memory of Wolfgang Gottlieb Mozart".

==The rise of "Amadeus"==
It is possible that the now-standard "Amadeus" originated as a facetious name. He signed some letters in [[mock Latin]] as "Wolfgangus Amadeus Mozartus";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=1996|title=Austria and Other Margins: Reading Culture|author1=Katherine Arens|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-109-6|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shBHp2fyn1YC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22Wolfgangus+Amadeus+Mozartus%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsymphony.org/music/ProgramNotes.aspx?id=37928|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070718/http://www.sfsymphony.org/music/ProgramNotes.aspx?id=37928|title=Program Notes: MOZART: Concerto No. 24 in C minor for Piano and Orchestra, K.491|last=Keller|first=James M.|website=San Francisco Symphony|archivedate=June 29, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=For the Love of Music: Invitations to Listening|author1=Michael Steinberg|author1link=Michael Steinberg (music critic)|author2=Larry Rothe|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=9780198036739|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep8fSTCwP74C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=legend}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was certainly no accident as in one letter he did the same to the date of the letter as well: adding [[Latin declension#Second declension (o)|"-us"]] to the end of each word.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Mozart's only mention as "Wolfgang Amadeus" in an official document made during his lifetime was found in 1998 by Mozart scholar [[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]] in the registers of the Lower Austrian Governorship, where in May 1787 "Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus" is referred to as having applied for the return of his written surety for his friend {{ill|Franz Jakob Freystädtler|de}}. Other uses of "Amadeus", from immediately after Mozart's death in 1791, are given above.

The 19th century saw the gradual victory of "Amadeus" over alternative middle names. The earliest (18th century) biographers of Mozart, such as [[Friedrich Schlichtegroll]] and [[Franz Xaver Niemetschek|Franz Niemetschek]], used "Gottlieb". However, in 1798 the publishing firm of [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] began to issue a (partial) Complete Works edition under the name "Amadeus". The dominance of "Amadeus" began around about 1810; Romanticism, notably in the person of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], "seized upon this name to proclaim its veneration for Mozart". Although various scholars since that time have made use of "Amadè" or "Gottlieb", "Amadeus" remains by far the most familiar term for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph: Braunbehrens, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facetious names==
In the frequently playful letters of his youth Mozart would sometimes spell his name backwards, [[viz.]], "Mozart Wolfgang" or "Trazom". See above for the possible origin of "Amadeus" as facetious.

The '''Mundart des Ostgebiets''' is a [[subdialect]] of [[Low Prussian]], a dialect of [[Low German]].  It was spoken around Insterburg (now [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Russia]]), the Memel ([[Klaipėda]], [[Lithuania]]), and [[Tilsit]] ([[Sovyetsk]], [[Russia]]). Many speakers of this subdialect were [[Prussian Lithuanians]].

'''Old Hindi''' ({{lang-hi|पुरानी हिंदी|translit=Purānī Hindī}}) was the earliest stage of the [[Khariboli]] dialect of the [[Hindi language]], and so the ancestor of Modern Standard Hindi. It was spoken by the peoples of the [[Hindi belt]], especially around [[Delhi]], in roughly the 13th–15th centuries. It is attested in only a handful of literature, including some works by the poet [[Amir Khusrau]] and some verses by the Sufi saint [[Baba Farid]] in the ''[[Adi Granth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masica|first1=Colin P.|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521299442}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} The works of [[Kabir]] also may be included, as they use a Khariboli-like dialect.

The language ultimately gave way to [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

'''Philippine English''' is any [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[English language|English]] (similar and related to English) native to the [[Philippines]], including those used by the media and the vast majority of educated [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. [[English language learning and teaching|English is taught]] in schools as one of the two [[official language]]s of the country, the other being [[Filipino language|Filipino]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]). [[Code-switching]] is prevalent in informal situations.

==Orthography and grammar==
Philippine laws and court decisions, with extremely rare exceptions, are written solely in English. English is also used in [[higher education]], religious affairs, print and broadcast media, and business. Most educated Filipinos are bilinguals and speak English as one of their languages. For highly technical subjects such as nursing, medicine, computing and calculus, English is the preferred medium for textbooks, communication, etc. Very few would prefer highly technical books in the vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Author David Crystal remarks that English is used in technical contexts for intelligibility, and [[Taglish]] is used in social contexts for identity, noting that similar situations exist in other countries (e.g., as with [[Singlish]]). See {{Cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=English as a Global Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6jPAKxTHRYC&amp;pg=PA189 |page=189|edition=2, illustrated, revised|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-53032-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Because English is part of the [[curricula]] from [[primary education|primary]] to [[secondary education]], many Filipinos write and speak in fluent Philippine English, although there might be differences in [[diction]] and [[pronunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Education in the Philippines|schools in the Philippines]], however, are staffed by teachers who are speakers of Philippine English and hence notable differences from the American English from which it was derived are observable.

Philippine English traditionally follows [[American English]] spelling and grammar,&lt;ref name="gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, A. (2009) The Transplantation of American English in Philippine Soil, in A Companion to the History of the English Language (eds H. Momma and M. Matto), Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK. {{doi|10.1002/9781444302851.ch31}}&lt;/ref&gt; except when it comes to punctuation as well as date notations. For example, a comma almost never [[serial comma|precedes the final item]] in an enumeration (much like the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'' and other style guides used in the [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking]] world). Except for some very fluent speakers (like news anchors), even in English-language media, dates are also often read with a cardinal instead of an ordinal number (e.g. "January one" instead of "January first") even if the written form is the same.  This is mostly because educated Filipinos were taught to count English numbers cardinally, thus it carried over to their style of reading dates. In military-style (or sometimes officialese) date notation (e.g. 1 January) the American standard is mostly followed, that is "one January".

[[Tautology (grammar)|Tautologies]] like [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] and [[pleonasm]] are common despite the emphasis on brevity and simplicity in making sentences; they are common to many speakers, especially among the older generations. The possible explanation is that the English language teachers who came to the Philippines were taught old-fashioned grammar, thus they spread that style to the students they served. Examples are "At this point in time" and ".. will be the one ..." (or "... will be the one who will ...") instead of "now" and "... will ..." respectively - e.g., "I will be the one who will go ...", rather than "I will go ...".&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;Examples:

==Phonology==
{{Refimprove|section|date=September 2018}}
Philippine English is a [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic accent]] due to heavy [[American English]] influence, contrary to most [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]] variants spoken in neighboring countries such as [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]] or [[Singapore English|Singapore]]. The only exception to this rule is the word ''[[wikt:Marlboro|Marlboro]]'', which is frequently read as ''Malboro''. Therefore, {{IPA|/r/}} phonemes are pronounced in all positions.&lt;ref name="pell" /&gt; Native and well-educated speakers may also feature [[flapping]] and vowel sounds resembling the [[California English#California vowel shift|California vowel shift]] due to the influence of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood movies]] and [[Call center industry in the Philippines|call center]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-philippines-economy-20150202-story.html| title=The Philippines has become the call-center capital of the world| first=Don| last=Lee| date=2015-02-01| publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-native speakers, Philippine English phonological features are heavily dependent on the speaker's mother tongue, although foreign languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] also influenced many Filipinos on the way of pronouncing English words. This is why approximations are very common and so are [[hypercorrection]]s. The most distinguishable feature is the lack of fricative consonants, particularly {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}. Another feature is the general absence of the schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}, and therefore pronounced by its respective full equivalent vowel although the r-colored variant {{IPA|[ɚ]}} is increasingly popular in recent years.

===Consonants===
The following consonant changes apply for most non-native speakers of the language:
*The rhotic consonant {{IPA|/r/}} may vary between a trill {{IPA|[r]}}, a flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and an approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}}. The English approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}} is pronounced by many speakers in the final letters of the word or before consonants, while the standard dialect prefers to pronounce the approximant in all positions of {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;ref name=pell&gt;Bautista, L. and Bolton, K. (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YnUgBAAAQBAJ Philippine English: Linguistic and Literary]'' Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. Retrieved October 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fricatives {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are approximated into the stop consonants {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=pell /&gt;
*[[Th-stopping]]: The consonants {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} becomes {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, respectively. This can be also observed from speakers of [[Hiberno-English]] dialects and a number of American English speakers.
*[[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|Yod-coalescence]]: Like most Commonwealth English variants, the [dj], [tj] and [sj] clusters becomes into [dʒ], [tʃ] and [ʃ] respectively. This makes the words ''dew'', ''tune'' and ''pharmaceutical'' are pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|uː|n}} and {{IPA|[pärmɐˈʃuːtikäl]}}, respectively. For some cases, the use of yod-coalescence is another case of approximation for [[aspirated consonant]]s which [[Philippine languages]] lack in general in words such as ''twelve''.
*The fricative {{IPA|[ʒ]}} may be [[consonant voicing and devoicing|devoiced]] into {{IPA|[ʃ]}} in words such as ''mea'''s'''ure'' or [[Affricate consonant#Affrication|affricated]] into {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in words such as ''bei'''g'''e''.
*The {{IPA|/z/}} phoneme is devoiced into an {{IPA|/s/}}. This also includes intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} which is usually pronounced as a {{IPA|[z]}} in most other accents of English.&lt;ref name=pell /&gt;
*Older speakers tend to add an ''i'' or ''e'' sound to the cluster ''st-'' due to Spanish influence, so the words ''star'' and ''lipstick'' sounds like ''(i/e)star'' and ''lipistick'' respectively.
*Like most non-native speakers of English elsewhere, the "[[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants#Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark ''l'']]" ({{IPA|[ɫ]}}) is merged into the usual "[[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants#Alveolar|light]]" {{IPA|/l/}} equivalent.

===Vowels===
Vowels in Philippine English are pronounced according to the letter they symbolize, so that {{Angle bracket|a, e, i, o, u}} are generally pronounced as {{IPA|[a, ɛ, i, o, u]}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=pell /&gt; The schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}, which has various interpretations in English, is somewhat rare in Philippine languages and usually exists in minority languages such as [[Karay-a language|Kinaray-a]] or the ''Abagatan'' (Southern) dialect of [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]]. 
*The following are the various approximations of the schwa:
**Words that end in ''-le'' that succeeds a consonant (such as ''Google'') are generally pronounced with an {{IPA|[ɛl]}}, except for words that end ''-ple'', ''-fle'' or ''-ble'' (''apple'', ''waffle'' and ''humble''), which are pronounced with an {{IPA|[ol]}}.
**The {{IPA|[ɨ]}} in words such as ''knowl'''e'''dge'' or ''coll'''e'''ge'', it is pronounced as a [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, making it rhyme with ''age''.
**The r-colored vowel {{IPA|[ɚ]}} may be pronounced as an {{IPA|[ɛr]}} (command''er''), {{IPA|[ir]}} (c''ir''cle) or an {{IPA|[or]}} (doct''or''), usually by non-native speakers outside urban areas or the elderly.
*The {{angle bracket|a}} pronunciations {{IPA|[æ, ʌ, ɑ]}} are pronounced as central vowels {{IPA|[ä]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. In the standard dialect, the open front {{IPA|[a]}} may be pronounced as a variant of the near-open {{IPA|[æ]}}.
*The {{IPA|[ɪ]}} phoneme may be merged or replaced by the longer {{IPA|/i/}} for some speakers. The words ''peel'' and ''pill'' might sound the same.&lt;ref name=pell /&gt;
*The {{IPA|[ɒ]}} may be pronounced as an {{IPA|[o]}} (c''o''lor) or an {{IPA|[ɐ]}} ().
*The ''u'' sound from the digraph ''qu'' may be dropped before ''e'' and ''i'' in some words such as ''conquest'' and ''liquidity''.

===Other features===
*Non-standard emphasis or stress is common. For example, the words ''ceremony'' and ''[[Arabic]]'' are pronounced on the second syllable as another result of Spanish influence. The words mentioned above are pronounced as {{IPA|[sɛˈɾɛmoni]}} and {{IPA|[aˈɾabik]}} respectively.

===Non-native pronunciation===
Monolingual [[Filipino language|Filipino-language-speakers]] often have non-standard pronunciations; a number of other indigenous languages, employ phonemes such as {{IPA|[f]}}, {{IPA|[v]}}, and {{IPA|[z]}}. This form of mispronunciation, caused by the limited sound inventories of most Philippine languages compared to [[English language|English]] (which has more than 40 phonemes), is generally frowned upon by [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] Filipinos, in particular, and businesses dealing with international clients.

Some examples of non-native pronunciation include:

*Awry = {{IPA|[ˈari]}}
*Filipino = {{IPA|[piliˈpino]}}
*Victor = {{IPA|[bikˈtor]}}
*Family = {{IPA|[ˈpɐmili]}} or {{IPA|[ˈpamili]}}
*Varnish = {{IPA|[ˈbarnis]}}
*Fun = {{IPA|[ˈpɐn]}} or {{IPA|[ˈpan]}}
*Vehicle = {{IPA|[ˈbɛhikel]}} or {{IPA|[ˈbɛhikol]}}
*Lover = {{IPA|[ˈlɐber]}}
*Find = {{IPA|[ˈpaɪnd]}}
*Official = {{IPA|[oˈpisʲɐl]}} or {{IPA|[oˈpiʃɐl]}}
*Very = {{IPA|[ˈbɛri]}} or {{IPA|[ˈbeɪri]}}
*Guidon = {{IPA|[ɡiˈdon]}}
*Hamburger = {{IPA|[ˈhɐmburgɛr]}}
*High-tech = {{IPA|[ˈhaɪtɛk]}}
*Hubcap = {{IPA|[ˈhabkab]}}
*Margarine = {{IPA|[mɐrɡɐˈrin]}}
*Seattle = {{IPA|[ˈsʲatel]}}
*Shako = {{IPA|[sʲaˈko]}} or {{IPA|[ʃaˈko]}}
*Daniel/Danielle = {{IPA|[ˈdeɪnjel]}} or {{IPA|[ˈdanjel]}}
*February = {{IPA|[(f/p)ebˈwari]}} or {{IPA|[(f/p)ebˈrari]}}
*Janice = {{IPA|[dʒaˈnis]}}
*January = {{IPA|[dʒanˈwari]}}
*Rachel/Rachelle = {{IPA|[ˈreɪʃel]}}
*Stephen, Stephen- in ''Stephens'', ''Stephenson'' = {{IPA|[(i/ɛ)ˈstifɛn]}} or {{IPA|[(i/ɛ)ˈstipɛn]}}&lt;br&gt;(the ''ph'' digraph has an ''eff'' sound rather than a ''vee'', even in standard Philippine English)
*Special (some speakers) = {{IPA|[(i/ɛ)ˈspeɪʃal]}} or {{IPA|[ˈspeɪʃal]}} ''rhymes with spatial'' 
*Twenty- (one, two, etc.) (many speakers) = {{IPA|[ˈtweɪnti]}}
*-ator in ''senator'', ''predator''  = {{IPA|[ˈeɪtor]}} (by analogy with ''-ate'')

==History==
Philippine English has evolved tremendously from where it began decades ago. Some decades before English was officially introduced, if not arguably forced, to the Philippines, the nation had been subject to Spanish rule and thus Spanish was the language of power and influence. However, in 1898, when the Spanish gave the United States control of the nation, the English language, although initially disfavored, became widely used in a matter of years. This was catalyzed by the coming of American teachers called ‘[[Thomasites]]’ (Bolton &amp; Bautista, 2004). Before gaining independence, language policy makers had already started discussing formation of a common language for the Philippines that today is known as Filipino. Filipino became the national language, and English was given the status of an official language of the Philippines; English is the dominant [[superstrate]] language, as it is perceived by many as a symbol of status and power, replacing Spanish as the dominant superstate language. With the English language highly embedded in Philippine society, it was only a matter of time before the language was indigenized to the point that it became differentiated from English varieties found in the United States, United Kingdom, or elsewhere. This, along with the formal introduction of the World Englishes (WE) framework to English language scholars in the Philippines by renowned linguist [[Braj Kachru|Braj B. Kachru]], which occurred at a conference in Manila, opened the floodgates to research on this new emerging English, which has since been branded as Philippine English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kachru|first1=Braj|last2=Kachru|first2=Yamuna|last3=Nelson|first3=Cecil|title=The Handbook of World Englishes : Volume 48 of Blackwell Handbooks in Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpeXINCnDbIC|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8831-9|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=PpeXINCnDbIC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22philippine%20english%22 240]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2298">The '''planetarium hypothesis''', conceived in 2001 by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], attempts to provide a solution to the [[Fermi paradox]]  by holding that our astronomical observations represent an illusion, created by a [[Kardashev scale|Type III civilization]] capable of manipulating matter and energy on galactic scales. He postulates that we do not see evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] because the [[universe]] has been engineered so that it appears empty of other life.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Stephen, 2001, The Planetarium Hypothesis: A Resolution of the Fermi Paradox, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol. 54, no. 5/6, pp. 210–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architecture]], '''post and lintel''' (also called '''prop and lintel''' or a '''trabeated system''')  is a building system where strong horizontal elements are held up by strong vertical elements with large spaces between them. This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed for.  The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including [[lintel]], header, [[architrave]] or beam, and the supporting vertical elements may be called [[column]]s, [[wikt:pillar|pillars]], or [[wikt:post|posts]].  The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], to help spread the load, is common to many traditions. 

The trabeated system is a fundamental principle of [[Neolithic architecture]], [[Indian architecture|ancient Indian architecture]], [[ancient Greek architecture]] and [[ancient Egyptian architecture]]. Other trabeated styles are the [[Persian architecture|Persian]], Lycian, [[Japanese architecture|Japanese]], traditional [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]], and [[Ancient Chinese wooden architecture|ancient Chinese]] architecture, especially in northern China,&lt;ref&gt;Post and lintel is the main structural system in Northern China, the southern traditional timber buildings which use a column-and-tie structural system. "Structural Mechanism Of Southern Chinese Traditional Timber Frame Buildings" SCIENCE CHINA Technological Sciences.2011, Vol 54(7) http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112427956/structural-mechanism-of-southern-chinese-traditional-timber-frame-buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly all the [[Indian architecture|Indian]] styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by [[Mayan architecture]], and in South America by [[Inca architecture]].  In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timber framing]], also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day.

The biggest disadvantage to a post and lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the small distances required between the posts. [[Ancient Roman architecture]]'s development of the [[arch]] allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post and lintel trabeated system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel [[girder]] beams in the industrial era.  As with the [[Roman temple]] [[portico]] front and its descendents in later [[classical architecture]], trabeated features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice.  The [[classical order]]s of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually had little or no structural role.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lintel beams==
{{Further|Beam (structure)}}
In architecture, a post-and-lintel or trabeated system refers to the use of horizontal beams or [[lintel]]s which are borne up by [[column]]s or posts.  The name is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''trabs'', ''[[Beam (structure)|beam]]''; influenced by ''trabeatus'', clothed in the ''trabea'', a ritual garment.

A noteworthy example of a trabeated system is in [[Volubilis]], from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, where one side of the [[Decumanus Maximus]] is lined with trabeated elements, while the opposite side of the roadway is designed in arched style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India the style was used originally for wooden construction, but later the technique was adopted for stone structures for decorated load-bearing and purely ornamented non-structural purposes.

==Engineering==
Post and lintel construction is one of four ancient structural methods of building, the others being the [[corbel]], [[Arch and Vault|arch-and-vault]], and [[truss]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague De Camp, Ancient Engineers: Technology &amp; Invention from the Earliest Times to the Renaissance (U.S.A.: Barnes and Noble, 1993 edition), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main force vectors acting upon the post and lintel system: weight carrying [[compression (physical)|compression]] at the joint between lintel and post, and [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] induced by deformation of self-weight and the load above between the posts.&lt;!-- {{Clarify|date=March 2008}} Statics / Engineering 101---&gt; The two posts are under compression from the weight of the lintel (or beam) above. The lintel will deform by sagging in the middle because the underside is under tension and the topside is under compression.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Engineering 101 again, rigid members twist and bend... watch any local tree in a breeze --&gt;

'''Sindhi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|d|i}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|sd-Arab|سنڌي}}, {{lang|sd-Deva|सिन्धी}}, [[File:Sindhi khudabadi.svg|31px]], ਸਿੰਧੀ), is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] of the historical [[Sindh]] region in the northern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]], spoken by the [[Sindhi people]]. It is the official language of the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In [[India]], Sindhi is one of the [[languages with official status in India|scheduled languages]] officially recognized by the central government, though Sindhi is not an official language of any of the states in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajbhasha.nic.in/en/languages-included-eighth-schedule-indian-constution|title=Languages Included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constution {{!}} Department of Official Language {{!}} Ministry of Home Affairs {{!}} GoI|website=www.rajbhasha.nic.in|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/languages/sindhi-language.html|title=Sindhi Language, Sindhi Dialects, Sindhi Vocabulary, Sindhi Literature, Sindhi, Language, History of Sindhi language|website=www.indianmirror.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Sindhi speakers are concentrated in [[Pakistan]] in the [[Sindh]] province, and in [[India]], the [[Kutch]] region of the state of [[Gujarat]] and in the [[Ulhasnagar]] region of the state of [[Maharashtra]]. The remaining speakers in India are composed of the [[Sindhi Hindus]] who migrated from Sindh, which became a part of Pakistan and settled in India after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947 and the [[Sindhi diaspora]] worldwide. Sindhi language is spoken in [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] provinces of [[Pakistan]] as well as the states of [[Rajasthan]],  [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]] in India as well as immigrant communities in [[Spain]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Oman]],  [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[UAE]], [[Russia]], [[UK]], [[Caribbean Islands]] and the [[United States of America|US]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Status and use==
Indian Government has legislated Sindhi as a language of option and as medium of study in India, so that students can choose to learn Sindhi. Sindhi is an optional third language in the Indian states of Rajasthan, [[Gujarat]] and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM47thReport.pdf# |title=National Committee for Linguistic Minorities |access-date=2018-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513161847/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM47thReport.pdf# |archive-date=2012-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajasthan Sindhi Academy has been set up for the promotion of Sindhi Language in Rajasthan.

The language is included as one of the official languages into Indian Constitution by Government of India in the 21st Amendment in 1967.

The Sindhi language and other native languages of Pakistan are struggling to be officially given the status of national language in [[Pakistan]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Before the inception of Pakistan, Sindhi was the national language of Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Language and Politics in Pakistan|title=THE SINDHI LANGUAGE MOVEMENT 103 103 7The Sindhi Language Movement |url=https://www.academia.edu/7588035/Language_and_Politics_in_Pakistan|website=academia.edu|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Imposition Of Urdu|url=http://nation.com.pk/editorials/10-Sep-2015/the-imposition-of-urdu|accessdate=12 September 2015|publisher=NAWAIWAQT GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS|date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnaorg.com/research-papers-pdf/rahman-3.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Teaching of Sindhi &amp; Sindhi ethnicity.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tariqrahman.net/content/scholorly_articles/sindhi_lang_mov.pdf|title=404 – tariqrahman|website=tariqrahman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many Sindhi language television channels broadcasting in Pakistan such as [[Kawish Television Network|KTN]], [[Sindh TV]], [[Awaz Television Network]], [[Mehran TV]] and [[Dharti TV]].

==History==
[[File:Dodo Chanesar Khudabadi script.png|thumb|right|Cover of a book containing the epic Dodo Chanesar written in the [[Khudabadi script]]]]
The name "Sindhi" is derived from ''Sindhu'', the local name of the [[Indus River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Sindhi.html |title=Sindhi |author= |date= |work= The Languages Gulper|publisher= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other languages of this family, Sindhi has passed through Old Indo-Aryan ([[Sanskrit]]) and Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and [[Apabhramsha]]) stages of growth, and it entered the New Indo-Aryan stage around the 10th century CE.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/545670/Sindhi-language|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|author= |date=|work= |publisher= |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/sindhi|title=Sindhi - About World Languages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1868, the [[Bombay Presidency]] assigned ''Narayan Jagannath Vaidya'' to replace the [[Abjad]] used in Sindhi, with the ''[[Khudabadi script]]''. The script was decreed a standard script by the [[Bombay Presidency]] thus inciting anarchy in the [[Muslim]] majority region. A powerful unrest followed, after which Twelve [[Martial Law]]s were imposed by the British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sindhi.htm |title=Sindhi alphabets, pronunciation and language |publisher=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic Sindhi tradition, the first translation of the [[Quran]] into Sindhi was completed in the year 883 [[Common Era|CE]] / 270 [[Hijri year|AH]] in [[Mansura, Sindh]]. The first extensive Sindhi translation was done by [[Akhund Azaz Allah Muttalawi]] (1747–1824 CE / 1160–1240 AH) and first published in [[Gujarat]] in 1870. The first to appear in print was by Muhammad Siddiq (Lahore 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=1391|title=The Holy Qur'an and its Translators -- Imam Reza (A.S.) Network|work=imamreza.net|accessdate=29 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115045637/http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=1391|archive-date=15 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sindh was occupied by British army and was annexed with Bombay, governor of the province Sir George Clerk ordered to make Sindhi the official language in the province in 1848. Sir Bartle Frere, the then commissioner of Sindh, issued orders on August 29, 1857 advising civil servants in Sindh to qualify examination in Sindhi. He also ordered Sindhi to be used in all official communication. Seven-grade education system commonly known as Sindhi-Final was introduced in Sindh. Sindhi Final was made a prerequisite for employment in revenue, police and education departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/declaring-major-languages-as-national-languages/#.U0oQ-VWSygQ |title=The language link |author= Naseer Memon |date= April 13, 2014 |work= The News on Sunday |publisher= |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Sindhi has a relatively large inventory of both consonants and vowels compared to other languages.  Sindhi has 46 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s and 16 [[vowel]]s. The consonant to vowel ratio is around average for world's languages at 2.8.&lt;ref&gt;Nihalani, Paroo. (1999). ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' (Sindhi). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All [[plosive]]s, [[affricate]]s, [[nasal stop|nasals]], the [[retroflex flap]] and the [[lateral approximant]] /l/ have [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[breathy voice]]d counterparts. The language also features four [[implosive]]s.

The retroflex consonants are [[Apical consonant|apical]] [[postalveolar]] and do not involve curling back of the tip of the tongue,{{sfn|Nihalani|1974|p=207}} so they could be transcribed {{IPA|[t̠, t̠ʰ, d̠, d̠ʱ n̠ n̠ʱ s̠ ɾ̠ ɾ̠ʱ]}} in phonetic transcription. The dental implosive is sometimes realized as retroflex {{IPA|[ɗ̠]}}~&lt;span title="U+1D91"&gt;{{IPA|[ᶑ]}}&lt;/span&gt; The affricates {{IPA|/tɕ, tɕʰ, dʑ, dʑʱ/}} are laminal post-alveolars with a relatively short release. It is not clear if {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is similar, or truly palatal.&lt;ref&gt;The IPA ''Handbook uses the symbols {{IPA|c, cʰ, ɟ, ɟʱ}}, but makes it clear this is simply tradition and that these are neither palatal nor stops, but "laminal post-alveolars with a relatively short release". Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson (1996:83) confirm a transcription of {{IPA|[t̠ɕ, t̠ɕʰ, d̠ʑ, d̠ʑʱ]}} and further remarks that "{{IPA|/ʄ/}} is often a slightly creaky voiced palatal approximant" (caption of table 3.19).&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ʋ/}} is realized as labiovelar {{IPA|[w]}} or labiodental {{IPA|[ʋ]}} in free variation, but is not common, except before a stop.

===Vowels===

[[File:Sindhi vowel chart.svg|thumb|The vowel phonemes of Sindhi on a [[vowel chart]]]]

The vowels are modal length {{IPA|/i e æ ɑ ɔ o u/}} and short {{IPA|/ɪ̆ ʊ̆ ɐ̆/}}. (Note {{IPA|/æ ɑ ɐ̆/}} are imprecisely transcribed as {{IPA|/ɛ a ə/}} in the chart.) Consonants following short vowels are lengthened: {{IPA|[pɐ̆tˑo]}} 'leaf' vs. {{IPA|[pɑto]}} 'worn'.

==Vocabulary==
Sindhi has borrowed from English and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. Today, Sindhi in Pakistan is slightly influenced by Urdu, with more borrowed Perso-Arabic elements, while Sindhi in India is influenced by Hindi, with more borrowed [[tatsama|tatsam]] Sanskrit elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cole|2001|pp=652–653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khubchandani|2003|pp=624–625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example extract===
''The following extract is from the [[:sd:سنڌي ٻولي|Sindhi Wikipedia]] about the Sindhi language and is written in the 52-letter Sindhi-Arabic script, Devanagari and transliterated to Latin.''

'''Sindhi-[[Arabic script]]:''' &lt;span dir="rtl"&gt;{{lang|sd-Arab|سنڌي ٻولي انڊو يورپي خاندان سان تعلق رکندڙ آريائي ٻولي آھي، جنھن تي عربي ٻوليءَ جو بہ تمام وڏو اثر آهي. هن وقت سنڌي ٻولي سنڌ جي مک ٻولي ۽ دفتري زبان آھي.}}&lt;/span&gt;

'''[[Devanagari script]]:''' {{lang|sd-Deva|सिन्धी ॿोली इण्डो यूरपी ख़ान्दान सां ताल्लुक़ु रखन्दड़ आर्याई ॿोली आहे, जंहिन ते कुझ द्राविड़ी उहुञाण पण मौजूद आहिनि। हिन वक़्तु सिन्धी ॿोली सिन्ध जी मुख ॿोली ऐं दफ़्तरी ज़बान आहे।}}

'''Transliteration ([[IAST]])''': &lt;span style="font-size:105%"&gt;{{IAST|sindhī b̤olī iṇḍo yūrapī &lt;u&gt;kh&lt;/u&gt;āndān sā̃ taʿlluqu rakhandaṛ āryāī b̤olī āhe, janhin te drāvidi boli-a jo tamaam waddo asar-u aahe. hin-a vaqtu sindhī b̤olī sindh jī mukh b̤olī ãĩ daftarī zabānā āhe.}}&lt;/span&gt;

==Dialects==
The dialects of Sindhi include Vicholi, Lari, Lasi, Kathiawari Katchi, Thareli, Macharia, Dukslinu and Muslim Sindhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{e19|Sindhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Siraiki" dialect in northern Sindh is distinct from the [[Saraiki language]] of South Punjab&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Masica| first = Colin P.| title = The Indo-Aryan languages| series = Cambridge language surveys| date = 1991| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-23420-7| page = 443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has variously been treated either as a dialect of it, or as a dialect of Sindhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Rahman| first = Tariq| title = The Siraiki Movement in Pakistan| journal = Language Problems &amp; Language Planning| date = 1995| volume = 19| issue = 1| doi = 10.1075/lplp.19.1.01rah| page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sindhi dialects previously known as "Siraiki" are nowadays more commonly referred to as "Siroli".{{sfn|Shackle|2007|p=114}}

==Writing system==

Written Sindhi is mentioned in the 8th century, when references to a Sindhi version of the [[Mahabharata]] appear. However, the earliest attested records in Sindhi are from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

Before the standardisation of Sindhi orthography, numerous forms of the [[Devanagari]] and [[Laṇḍā|Lunda (Laṇḍā)]] scripts were used for trading. For literary and religious purposes, an [[Perso-Arabic script|Arabic-Persian alphabet]] known as ''Ab-ul-Hassan Sindhi'' and [[Gurmukhi]] (a subset of Laṇḍā) were used. Another two scripts, ''[[Khudabadi alphabet|Khudabadi]]'' and ''Shikarpuri'', were reforms of the Landa script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Khubchandani|2003|p=633}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/landa.html|title=Ancient Scripts: Landa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During British rule in the late 19th century, a Persian alphabet was decreed standard over Devanagari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cole|2001|p=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Sindhi devotional literature (1500–1843) comprises Sufi poetry and Advaita Vedanta poetry. Sindhi literature flourished during the modern period (since 1843), although the language and literary style of contemporary Sindhi writings in Pakistan and India were noticeably diverging by the late 20th century; authors from the former country were borrowing extensively from Persian and Arabic vocabulary, while those from the latter were highly influenced by Hindi.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

===Laṇḍā scripts===

[[Laṇḍā script|Laṇḍā]]-based scripts, such as [[Gurmukhi]], [[Khojki]] and the [[Khudabadi script]] were used historically to write Sindhi.

===Khudabadi===

 }}
The Khudabadi alphabet was invented in 1550 CE, and was used alongside other scripts by the Hindu community until the colonial era, where the sole usage of the Arabic script for official purposes was legislated.

The script continued to be used in a smaller scale by the trader community until the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=sindhiscript&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sindhilanguage.com/script.html |title = Sindhi Language: Script |accessdate= 15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khojki===

[[Khojki script|Khojki]] was employed primarily to record Muslim Shia Ismaili religious literature, as well as literature for a few secret Shia Muslim sects.&lt;ref&gt;http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3978.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gurmukhi===

The [[Gurmukhi]] script was also used to write Sindhi, mainly in the North of Sindh, and also by Hindu women.&lt;ref name="sindhiscript"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3871.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic script===
{{Arabic-script sidebar|Sindhi}}

During British rule in India, a variant of the [[Persian alphabet]] was adopted for Sindhi in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan today. It has a total of 64 letters, augmenting the Persian with [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and eighteen new letters (&lt;big&gt;{{lang|sd|ڄ ٺ ٽ ٿ ڀ ٻ ڙ ڍ ڊ ڏ ڌ ڇ ڃ ڦ ڻ ڱ ڳ ڪ}}&lt;/big&gt;) for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.

===Devanagari script===

In India, the [[Devanagari]] script is also used to write Sindhi. &lt;ref&gt;p.2 [http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3871.pdf Proposal to Encode the Sindhi Script in ISO/IEC 10646]&lt;/ref&gt; A modern version was introduced by the government of India in 1948; however, it did not gain full acceptance, so both the Sindhi-Arabic and [[Devanagari]] scripts are used. In India a person may write a Sindhi language paper for a Civil Services Examination in either script
[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=201]. [[Diacritic]]al bars below the letter are used to mark implosive consonants, and [[dot (diacritic)|dots]] called ''[[nukta]]'' are used to form other additional consonants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8239">The imitation of [[natural sounds]] in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system ([[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures). It may serve also such practical goals as luring in the hunt;&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; or entertainment ([[katajjaq]]s of [[Inuit]]).&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;&lt;ref name=desch/&gt;

Among some peoples of the [[Altai-Sayan region]], including [[Tofalar|Tofa]], the ability to mimic sounds of the environment includes hunting calls, and is present also in a traditional singing tradition preserved only by some old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song ond sound mimesis|publisher=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url=http://www.ogmios.org/164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shamanism ===
{{Main|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
[[Shamanism]] in various cultures shows great diversity.&lt;ref name=div&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the music or songs related to shamanistic practice may mimic natural sounds, sometimes with [[onomatopoiea]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

The intention to mimic natural sounds is not necessarily linked to shamanistic beliefs or practice alone. [[Katajjaq]] (a "genre" of [[Inuit music|music of some Inuit groups]]) is a game played by women, for entertainment. In some instances, [[natural sounds]] (mostly those of animals, e.g. geese) are imitated.&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luring animals ===

The kind of [[katajjaq]] mentioned above, which mimics the cry of geese, shows some similarities with the practice of the hunters to lure game.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

Some Eskimo peoples used a tool (shaped like a claw) to scratch the ice of the frozen sea in order to attract seals.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birket-Smith 1969: 127&lt;/ref&gt;

It is spoken natively in [[Wales]], by some in [[England]], and in ''[[Y Wladfa]]'' (the Welsh colony in [[Chubut Province]], [[Argentina]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards |first=Huw |authorlink=Huw Edwards (journalist) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z9kr9j6 |title=Why do they speak Welsh in South America? |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC iWonder |access-date=2017-09-16 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, it has also been known in English as "Cambrian",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan |first=Edward Henry |title=Great Britain As It Is |year=1859 |page=47 |publisher=[[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane &amp; Co]] |location=[[London]] |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=78gHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22Great%20Britain%20As%20It%20Is%22&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Britain%20As%20It%20Is%22&amp;f=false |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cambric"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=John |title=Chronological Antiquities |volume=Volume III |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_VvlAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Chronological%20Antiquities%22%20cambric&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chronological%20Antiquities%22%20cambric&amp;f=false |year=1752 |page=143 |publisher=J Noon |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cymric".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author-last1=Walter Thomas |author-first1=Mrs D |author-last2=Hughes |author-first2=Edward |title=The Cymric Language |year=1879 |publisher=D Duncan &amp; Sons |location=[[Cardiff]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of usual residents in Wales aged three and over, 19.0% were able to speak Welsh according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011]]. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], 20.8 per cent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh. This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011 – from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively. However, according to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013–15, 24 per cent of people aged three and over living in Wales were able to speak Welsh, implying a possible increase in the prevalence of the Welsh language since the 2011 census.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Welsh Language Commissioner|Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011]] gave the Welsh language official status in Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/mwa/2011/1/contents |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |work=[[legislation.gov.uk]] |title=Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 |access-date=2016-05-30 |df=dmy-all ||quote=The Welsh language has official status in Wales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the only language that is ''[[de jure]]'' official in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being ''[[de facto]]'' official. The Welsh language, along with English, is also a ''de jure'' official language of the National Assembly for Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2012/1 |title=National Assembly for Wales (Official Languages) Act 2012 |website=www.[[legislation.gov.uk]] |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |access-date=2018-04-19 |df=dmy-all |quote=The official languages of the Assembly are English and Welsh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the Welsh developed from the language of [[Celtic Britons|Britons]], according to academic [[Thomas Charles-Edwards|T. M. Charles-Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AK_yn7Q3_x0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Wales%20and%20the%20Britons%2C%20350%E2%80%931064&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Wales and the Britons, 350–1064 |page=75 |chapter=2: Britons and their Languages |last=Charles-Edwards |first=Thomas M |authorlink=Thomas Charles-Edwards |date=2013 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-821731-2 |edition=1st |oclc=823319671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Welsh was not instantaneous and clearly identifiable. Instead, the shift occurred over a long period of time, with some historians claiming that it had happened by as late as the 9th century, with a watershed moment being that proposed by Kenneth H. Jackson, the [[Battle of Deorham|Battle of Dyrham]], a military battle between the West Saxons and the Britons in 577 AD.&lt;ref name="koch" /&gt;, which split the South Western British from direct overland contact with the Welsh.

Four periods are identified in the history of Welsh, with rather indistinct boundaries: Primitive Welsh, Old Welsh, Middle Welsh, and Modern Welsh. The period immediately following the language's emergence is sometimes referred to as Primitive Welsh,&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;{{cite book |last= Koch |first= John T. |authorlink=John T. Koch |title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] |year=2006 |page=1757 |isbn= 9781851094400 |oclc= 266510465}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Old Welsh]] period – which is generally considered to stretch from the beginning of the 9th century to sometime during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="koch"/&gt; The [[Middle Welsh]] period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when the [[History of the Welsh language|Modern Welsh]] period began, which in turn is divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.

The name ''Welsh'' originated as an [[exonym and endonym|exonym]] given to its speakers by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], meaning "foreign speech" (see [[Walhaz|Walha]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The native term for the language is {{lang|cy|Cymraeg}}: North/Central Wales pronunciation /kɘm'raɪg/, South Wales pronunciation /kɘm'ra:g/.

===Origins===
{{see also|Celtic languages#Classification}}
Welsh evolved from Common Brittonic, the Celtic language spoken by the ancient [[Celtic Britons]]. Classified as [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], the British language probably arrived in [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[Bronze Age]] or [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref name="KochBritons"&gt;Koch, pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Early Middle Ages]] the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation, thus evolving into Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. It is not clear when Welsh became distinct.&lt;ref name="koch" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=32WuBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Welsh Language: A History |last=Janet |first=Davies |isbn=978-1-78316-019-8 |publisher=[[University of Wales Press]] |location=[[Cardiff]] |oclc=878137213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Higham |first=Nicholas |date=1 April 2014 |title=T. M. Charles-Edwards. ''Wales and the Britons, 350–1064'' |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/119/2/578/45108 |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=578–579 |doi=10.1093/ahr/119.2.578 |issn=0002-8762 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth H. Jackson]] suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around 550, and labelled the period between then and about 800 "Primitive Welsh".&lt;ref name="Koch1757"&gt;Koch, p.&amp;nbsp;1757.&lt;/ref&gt; This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the [[Hen Ogledd]] ("Old North") – the Brittonic-speaking areas of what is now [[northern England]] and southern [[Scotland]] – and therefore may have been the ancestor of Cumbric as well as Welsh. Jackson, however, believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time.&lt;ref name=koch/&gt; The earliest Welsh poetry – that attributed to the {{lang|cy|[[Cynfeirdd]]}} or "Early Poets" – is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period. However, much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd, raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed.&lt;ref name=koch/&gt; This discretion stems from the fact that Cumbric was widely believed to have been the language used in Hen Ogledd. An 8th-century inscription in [[Tywyn]] shows the language already dropping [[inflection]]s in the declension of nouns.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Jenkins |title=Wales: Churches, Houses, Castles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFk3AQAAIAAJ |year=2008 |publisher=[[Allen Lane (imprint)|Allen Lane]] |page=244 |isbn=9780141024127 |oclc=751732135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet Davies proposed that the origins of Welsh language were much less definite; in ''The Welsh Language: A History'', she proposes that Welsh may have been around even earlier than 600 AD. This is evidenced by the dropping of final syllables from Brittonic: ''*bardos'' "poet" became ''bardd'', and ''*abona'' "river" became ''afon''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though both Davies and Jackson cite minor changes in syllable structure and sounds as evidence for the creation of Old Welsh, Davies suggests it may be more appropriate to refer to this derivative language as {{lang|la|Lingua Brittanica}} rather than characterising it as a new language altogether.

=== Primitive Welsh ===
The argued dates for the period of "Primitive Welsh" are widely debated, with some historians' suggestions differing by hundreds of years.

===Old Welsh===
{{main|Old Welsh}}
The next main period is [[Old Welsh]] ({{lang|cy|Hen Gymraeg}}, 9th to 11th centuries); [[poetry]] from both Wales and [[Scotland]] has been preserved in this form of the language. As [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Germanic]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] colonisation of Britain proceeded, the Brittonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking Cumbric, and those in the southwest, speaking what would become Cornish, and so the languages diverged. Both the works of [[Aneirin]] ({{lang|cy|Canu Aneirin}}, c. 600) and the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]'' ({{Lang|cy|Canu Taliesin}}) were during this era.

===Middle Welsh===
{{main|Middle Welsh}}
[[Middle Welsh]] ({{lang|cy|Cymraeg Canol}}) is the label attached to the Welsh of the 12th to 14th centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing [[Welsh law]] manuscripts.  Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible to a modern-day Welsh speaker.

The famous cleric [[Gerald of Wales]] tells, in his ''[[Descriptio Cambriae]]'', a story of King [[Henry II of England]]. During one of the King's many raids in the 12th century, Henry asked an old man of [[Pencader, Carmarthenshire]] whether the Welsh people could resist his army.  The old man replied:

{{quote|It can never be destroyed through the wrath of man, unless the wrath of God shall concur.  Nor do I think that any other nation than this of Wales, nor any other language, whatever may hereafter come to pass, shall in the day of reckoning before the Supreme Judge, answer for this corner of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prys-Jones |first=Arthur G. |date=1955 |title=Gerald of Wales |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[George G. Harrap and Co.]] |page=125 |oclc=562036518}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Modern Welsh ===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
Modern Welsh is subdivided into Early Modern Welsh and Late Modern Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whywelsh.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/welsh-is-the-oldest-language/ |title=Is Welsh the oldest language? |last=Llŷr |first=Dylan |date=2013-08-20 |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all |website=Why Welsh?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Modern Welsh ran from the 15th century through to the end of the 16th century, and the Late Modern Welsh period roughly dates from the 16th century onwards. Contemporary Welsh differs greatly from the Welsh of the 16th century, but they are similar enough for a fluent Welsh speaker to have little trouble understanding it. During the Modern Welsh period there has been a decline in the popularity of the Welsh language: the number of Welsh speakers declined to the point at which there was concern that the language would become extinct. Welsh government processes and legislation have worked to increase the proliferation of the Welsh language, e.g. through education.

===Welsh Bible===
[[File:1588 First Welsh Bible.jpg|thumb|The 1588 Welsh Bible]]

The [[Bible translations into Welsh]] helped maintain the use of Welsh in daily life. The [[New Testament]] was translated by [[William Salesbury]] in 1567, and the complete Bible by [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] in 1588.

==Geographic distribution==

=== Wales ===
[[File:Welsh speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|left|upright=1.59|The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census who said they could speak Welsh]]
Welsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, but by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5 per cent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the start of the 21st century, numbers began to increase once more, at least partly as a result of the increase in [[Welsh medium education]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7 per cent of the population of Wales spoke Welsh,&lt;ref name="2004Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20&amp;%20Report%2004.pdf|title=2004 Welsh Language Use Survey: the report|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211017/http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20%26%20Report%2004.pdf|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with 20.8 per cent in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], and 18.5 per cent in 1991 Census.

The census also showed a "big drop" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50 per cent in [[Ceredigion]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Davies, [[University of Wales Press]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (1993). ''The Welsh Language'', page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population "all but disappeared", but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gpt9T53DDqiPiAfZu4mbCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;f=false | pages = 38–41 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Most Welsh-speaking people in Wales also speak English (while in [[Chubut Province]], Argentina, most speakers can speak Spanish – see [[Y Wladfa]]). However, many Welsh-speaking people are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context, even within a single [[discourse]] (known in linguistics as [[code-switching]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Welsh speakers are largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales, principally [[Gwynedd]], [[Conwy (county borough)|Conwy]], [[Denbighshire]] (''Sir Ddinbych''), [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn''), Carmarthenshire (''Sir Gâr''), north [[Pembrokeshire]] (''Sir Benfro''), Ceredigion, parts of [[Glamorgan]] (''Morgannwg''), and north-west and extreme south-west [[Powys]]. However, first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Outside Wales ===
Welsh-speaking communities persisted well into the modern period across the border in England. [[Archenfield]] was still Welsh enough in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] for the [[Bishop of Hereford]] to be made responsible, together with the four Welsh bishops, for the translation of the Bible and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Welsh. Welsh was still commonly spoken here in the first half of the 19th century, and churchwardens' notices were put up in both Welsh and English until about 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, 1887, page 173&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the earliest works of [[phonetics]], ''On Early English Pronunciation'' in 1889, [[Alexander John Ellis]] identified a small part of [[Shropshire]] as still speaking Welsh, and plotted a Celtic border that passed from [[Llanymynech]] to [[Chirk]] through [[Oswestry]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Early English Pronunciation, Part V. The existing phonology of English dialects compared with that of West Saxon speech'', page 14,  A.J. Ellis, Truebner &amp; Co, London, 1889 http://www.openlibrary.org/details/onearlyenglishpr00elliuoft&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Welsh-speaking people in the rest of Britain has not yet been counted for statistical purposes. In 1993, the Welsh-language television channel [[S4C]] published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh, which estimated that there were around 133,000 Welsh-speaking people living in England, about 50,000 of them in the Greater London area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/archives/welsh-l/welsh-l/1993/Mar/More-Welsh-Speakers|title=Nigel Callaghan (1993).

Although Welsh is a minority language, support for it grew during the second half of the 20th century, along with the rise of organisations such as the [[Welsh nationalism|nationalist]] political party {{lang|cy|[[Plaid Cymru]]}} from 1925 and [[Welsh Language Society]] from 1962.

The [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector, as far as is reasonable and practicable. Each public body is required to prepare for approval a [[Welsh Language Scheme]], which indicates its commitment to the equality of treatment principle. This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three-month period, whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version. It requires the final approval of the now defunct [[Welsh Language Board]] ({{lang|cy|Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg}}). Thereafter, the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme. The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales, from 1993–1997, by way of [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]]. Subsequent to the forming of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] in 1997, the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed statutory instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes. Neither the 1993 Act nor secondary legislation made under it covers the private sector, although some organisations, notably banks and some railway companies, provide some of their information in Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hsbc.co.uk/help/hsbc-in-wales/cymru/ |title=Croeso i HSBC yng Nghymru |trans-title=Welcome to HSBC in Wales |website=[[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC Bank]] |lang=cy |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/Homepage.aspx?langtype=1106 |title=Eich cysylltu â'r hyn sy'n bwysig |trans-title=Connecting you to what's important |lang=cy |website=[[Arriva Trains Wales]] |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2010, the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.wales/NAfW%20Documents/welsh_language_measure_as_passed-e.pdf%20-%2014122010/welsh_language_measure_as_passed-e-English.pdf|title=Proposed Welsh Language (Wales) Measure &amp;#91;As Passed&amp;#93; Accessed 12 September 2016|author=|date=|website=assembly.wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnews2010"&gt;{{cite news |title='Historic' vote for language law |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11934239 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2010-12-07 |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all |quote=A new law to promote the Welsh language has been unanimously passed by the Welsh Assembly. The measure makes Welsh an official language in Wales, and obliges public bodies and some private companies to provide services in it.

Ministers hailed the vote as a "historic step forward for the Welsh language."}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2011 this measure, the Proposed [[Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011]], was passed and received Royal Assent, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales. The Measure:
* confirms the official status of the Welsh language;
* creates a new system of placing duties on bodies to provide services through the medium of Welsh;
* creates a Welsh Language Commissioner with strong enforcement powers to protect the rights of Welsh-speaking people to access services through the medium of Welsh;
* establishes a Welsh Language Tribunal;
* gives individuals and bodies the right to appeal decisions made in relation to the provision of services through the medium of Welsh
* creates a Welsh Language Partnership Council to advise Government on its strategy in relation to the Welsh language;
* allows for an official investigation by the Welsh Language Commissioner of instances where there is an attempt to interfere with the freedom of Welsh-speaking people to use the language with one another.&lt;ref name="wales.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/welshlanguage/2011/110211welshlang/?lang=en|title=Welsh Government – Welsh Measure received Royal Assent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922140142/http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/welshlanguage/2011/110211welshlang/?lang=en|archive-date=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passing of this measure, public bodies and some private companies are required to provide services in Welsh. The Welsh government's Minister for Heritage at the time, [[Alun Ffred Jones]], said, "The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales, whether they speak it or not, and I am delighted that this Measure has now become law. I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language; which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh. I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so, and that is what this government has worked towards. This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language, its speakers and for the nation."&lt;ref name="wales.gov.uk"/&gt; The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters: Bethan Williams, chairperson of the Welsh Language Society, gave a mixed response to the move, saying, "Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed. But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas. It doesn't give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives. Despite that, an amendment to that effect was supported by 18 Assembly Members from three different parties, and that was a significant step forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/royal-assent-official-status-welsh-1852353| title=Royal Assent for official status of Welsh language |website=[[Wales Online]] |location=[[Cardiff]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |date=2011-02-12 |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all |quote=Powers confirming the official status of Welsh received Royal Assent yesterday.

On 5 October 2011, Meri Huws, Chair of the [[Welsh Language Board]], was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-15186747 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Language board chief Meri Huws is Welsh commissioner |date=2011-10-05 |access-date=2018-09-10 |df=dmy-all |quote=The chairwoman of the Welsh Language Board has been appointed the first Welsh language commissioner.

I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive." First Minister [[Carwyn Jones]] said that Meri would act as a champion for the Welsh language, though some had concerns over her appointment: [[Plaid Cymru]] spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said, "I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws's role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner, and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed. We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest, and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role." Ms Huws started her role as the Welsh Language Commissioner on 1 April 2012.

Local councils and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] use Welsh, issuing Welsh versions of their literature, to varying degrees.

Most road signs in Wales are in English and Welsh.

Since 2000, the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16. That has had an effect in stabilising and reversing the decline in the language. It means, for example, that even the children of non-Welsh-speaking parents from elsewhere in the UK grow up with a knowledge of, or complete fluency in, the language.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The wording on currency is only in English, except in the legend on Welsh pound coins dated 1985, 1990 and 1995, which circulate in all parts of the UK. The wording is {{lang|cy|Pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad}}, ({{langnf||Welsh|True am I to my country|links=no}}), and derives from the national anthem of Wales, {{lang|cy|[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]}}.

Some shops employ bilingual signage. Welsh rarely appears on product packaging or instructions.

The UK government has ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in respect of Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1 |title=List of declarations made with respect to treaty No. 148 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |access-date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has greatly increased its prominence since the creation of the television channel [[S4C]] in November 1982, which until [[Digital television transition|digital switchover]] in 2010 broadcast 70 per cent of Channel 4's programming along with a majority of Welsh language shows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/abouts4c/corporate/e_index.shtml Welsh language provision] at S4C Analogue&lt;/ref&gt; during peak viewing hours. The all-Welsh-language digital station S4C Digidol is available throughout Europe on satellite and online throughout the UK. Since the digital switchover was completed in South Wales on 31 March 2010, S4C Digidol became the main broadcasting channel and fully in Welsh. The main evening television news provided by the [[BBC]] in Welsh is available for download.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/live/newyddion.ram BBC website] (Real Media).&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Welsh-language radio station, [[BBC Radio Cymru]], which was launched in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conboy|first=Martin|title=Journalism in Britain: A Historical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efTqgnFP9hAC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=BBC+Radio+Cymru+1977&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klARR4KG5B&amp;sig=dGdJie_GJnn-yYx73JnqgujyUnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnjYXLvs3LAhWCPhQKHdCcBag4ChDoAQgqMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=BBC%20Radio%20Cymru%201977&amp;f=false|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|page=188|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4462-0972-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===
{{Main|Welsh medium education}}

The decade around 1840 was a period of great social upheaval in Wales, manifested in the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement. In 1839, 20,000 people marched on [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], resulting in a riot when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel, and the [[Rebecca Riots]] where [[Toll road|tollbooth]]s on [[turnpikes]] were systematically destroyed.

This unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment since social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems.

In July 1846, three commissioners, [[Ralph Lingen, 1st Baron Lingen|R.R.W. Lingen]], Jellynger C. Symons and H.R. Vaughan Johnson, were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and thus presumed unsympathetic to the [[nonconformist]] majority in Wales. The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as the [[Treachery of the Blue Books]] ({{lang|cy|Brad y Llyfrau Gleision}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Treacherous' Blue Books online |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/4555702.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2005-12-23 |access-date=2017-01-21 |df=dmy-all |quote=A 19th Century report that became controversial for condemning the Welsh language has been published online by the National Library of Wales. The government report about Welsh education in 1847 was dubbed the Treachery of the Blue Books ({{lang|cy|Brad y Llyfrau Gleision}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; since, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, [[Nonconformity in Wales|nonconformity]], and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was that ordinary Welsh people began to believe that the only way to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as "the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe]] and the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar]] of Welsh history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |title=A History of Wales |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19ThaoZRcqEC|year=1993 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=[[London]] |isbn=978-0-14-014581-6 |oclc= 925144917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welshclass.jpg|thumb|left|Welsh language as the medium of instruction]]

In the later 19th century, virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English, even in areas where the pupils barely understood English. Some schools used the [[Welsh Not]], a piece of wood, often bearing the letters "WN", which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh. The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh, with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating. One of the most famous Welsh-born pioneers of higher education in Wales was [[Hugh Owen (educator)|Sir Hugh Owen]]. He made great progress in the cause of education, and more especially the [[Aberystwyth University|University College of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]], of which he was chief founder. He has been credited {{By whom|date=November 2009}} with the [[Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889]] (52 &amp; 53 Vict c 40), following which several new Welsh schools were built. The first was completed in 1894 and named [[Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen]].

Towards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change, partly owing to the efforts of [[Owen Morgan Edwards|O.M. Edwards]] when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in 1907.

The [[Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth Welsh School]] ({{lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth|italics=no}}) was founded in 1939 by [[Ifan ab Owen Edwards|Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards]], the son of O.M. Edwards, as the first Welsh Primary School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-29360528 |title=Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth celebrates 75th anniversary |date=2014-09-25 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2016-10-03 |df=dmy-all |quote=Former pupils and teachers of Wales' first Welsh-medium school will gather to celebrate its 75th anniversary. {{lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth|italics=no}} was opened in September 1939 by Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards, who feared children's spoken Welsh was being tarnished by the English language.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headteacher was [[Norah Isaac]]. {{lang|cy|Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth|italics=no}} is still a very successful school, and now there are Welsh-language primary schools all over the country. {{lang|cy|[[Ysgol Glan Clwyd]]|italics=no}} was established in [[Rhyl]] in 1956 as the first Welsh-medium secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysgolglanclwyd.co.uk/welcome |title=Welcome |website=[[Ysgol Glan Clwyd]] |access-date=2016-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005105133/http://www.ysgolglanclwyd.co.uk/welcome |archive-date=2016-10-05|df=dmy-all |quote=The school was established in 1956 and was the first Welsh-medium secondary school in Wales.

Specialist teachers of Welsh called {{lang|cy|Athrawon Bro}} support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum. Welsh is also taught in adult education classes. The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults, with centres in North Wales,&lt;ref&gt;learncymraeg.org&lt;/ref&gt; Mid Wales, South West, Glamorgan, Gwent. and Cardiff.

The ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is desirable for certain career choices in Wales, such as teaching or customer service.&lt;ref&gt;More information can be found at [http://www.welshforadults.org Welsh for Adults.org]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All universities in Wales teach courses in the language, with many undergraduate and post-graduate degree programs offered in the medium of Welsh, ranging from law, modern languages, social sciences, and also other sciences such as biological sciences. Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Bangor, and Swansea have all had chairs in Welsh since their virtual establishment, and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature, offering a BA in Welsh as well as post-graduate courses. At all Welsh universities and the [[Open University]], students have the right to submit assessed work and sit exams in Welsh even if the course was taught in English (usually the only exception is where the course requires demonstrating proficiency in another language). Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru, the [[Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol]] (Welsh Language National College) was established. The purpose of the federal structured college, spread out between all the universities of Wales, is to provide and also advance Welsh medium courses and Welsh medium scholarship and research in Welsh universities. There is also a Welsh-medium academic journal called ''Gwerddon'' ("Oasis"), which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly. There have been calls for more teaching of Welsh in English-medium schools.

===In warfare===
Secure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime.  [[Cryptography]] can be used to protect messages, but codes can be broken. Therefore, lesser-known languages are sometimes encoded, so that even if the code is broken, the message is still in a language few people know. For example, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] [[code talker]]s were used by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] during [[World War II]]. Similarly, the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]],&lt;!-- "Welch" is not a typo; see their article --&gt; a Welsh regiment serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Heath | first = Tony | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/welsh-speak-up-for-their-ancient-tongue-1311562.html| title = Welsh speak up for their ancient tongue|work = [[The Independent]] | page = 6 | date = 26 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been reported that Welsh speakers from Wales and from [[Patagonia]] fought on both sides in the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Christopher|title=Argentina turns to Wales for help with Falkland Islands|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9344922/Argentina-holds-talks-with-Welsh-nationalists-over-its-claim-on-the-Falkland-Islands.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 June 2012|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use within the British parliament ===
In 2017, parliamentary rules were amended to allow the use of Welsh when the Welsh Grand Committee meets at [[British parliament|Westminster]]. The change did not alter the rules about debates within the House of Commons, where only English can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welsh language to be allowed in MPs' Welsh Grand Committee|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-39043308|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 February 2018|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Welsh was first used when the Welsh Secretary, [[Alun Cairns]], delivered his welcoming speech at a sitting of the committee. He said, "I am proud to be using the language I grew up speaking, which is not only important to me, my family and the communities Welsh MPs represent, but is also an integral part of Welsh history and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPs speak Welsh in parliamentary debate for first time|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42967899|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 February 2018|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=David |title=A historic first for Welsh at Westminster as language officially used for first time |url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/historic-first-welsh-westminster-language-14258799 |work=dailypost.co.uk |date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=David |title=MPs use first ever bilingual debate in Westminster |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/historic-moment-welsh-spoken-houses-14258358 |work=WalesOnline |date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use at the European Union===
In November 2008, the Welsh language was used at a meeting of the European Union's [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] for the first time. The Heritage Minister [[Alun Ffred Jones]] addressed his audience in Welsh and his words were interpreted into the EU's 23 official languages. The official use of the language followed years of campaigning.  Jones said "In the UK we have one of the world's major languages, English, as the mother tongue of many. But there is a diversity of languages within our islands. I am proud to be speaking to you in one of the oldest of these, Welsh, the language of Wales." He described the breakthrough as "more than [merely] symbolic" saying "Welsh might be one of the oldest languages to be used in the UK, but it remains one of the most vibrant. Our literature, our arts, our festivals, our great tradition of song all find expression through our language. And this is a powerful demonstration of how our culture, the very essence of who we are, is expressed through language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Williamson |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/11/21/breakthrough-as-minister-uses-welsh-at-eu-council-91466-22307749/ |title=Walesonline.co.uk |publisher=Walesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by the Voyager program===
A greeting in Welsh is one of the [[Contents of the Voyager Golden Record#Greetings|55 languages]] included on the [[Voyager Golden Record]] chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA's [[Voyager program]] launched in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/languages/languages.html |title=Greetings to the Universe in 55 Different Languages |accessdate=10 May 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greetings are unique to each language, with the Welsh greeting being {{lang|cy|Iechyd da i chwi yn awr ac yn oesoedd}}, which translates into English as "Good health to you now and forever".&lt;!--Please do not edit the Welsh greeting or the translation. Both are correct.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/languages/welsh.html |title=Welsh greetings |accessdate=10 May 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/welsh-message-hurtling-through-space-1826813|title=The Welsh message hurtling through space 10 billion miles from its home|first=|last=WalesOnline|date=10 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Welsh vocabulary draws mainly from original Brittonic words ({{lang|cy|wy}} "egg", {{lang|cy|carreg}} "stone"), with some loans [[:wikt:Category:cy:Latin derivations|from Latin]] ({{lang|cy|ffenestr}} "window" &lt; Latin {{lang|la|fenestra}}, {{lang|cy|gwin}} "wine" &lt; Latin {{lang|la|vinum}}), and [[English language|English]] ({{lang|cy|silff}} "shelf", {{lang|cy|giât}} "gate").

==Phonology==
{{Main|Welsh phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
The [[phonology]] of Welsh includes a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are [[linguistic typology|typologically]] rare in [[Languages of Europe|European languages]]. The [[voiceless dental and alveolar lateral fricatives|voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, the [[voiceless nasal]]s {{IPA|[m̥]}}, {{IPA|[n̥]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ̊]}}, and the [[voiceless alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r̥]}} are distinctive features of the Welsh language. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words, and the word-final unstressed syllable receives a higher [[pitch (music)|pitch]] than the stressed syllable.

==Orthography==
{{Main|Welsh orthography}}

Welsh is written in a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] of 29 letters, of which eight are [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s treated as separate letters for [[collation]]:

: a, b, c, ch, d, dd, e, f, ff, g, ng, h, i, j, l, ll, m, n, o, p, ph, r, rh, s, t, th, u, w, y

In contrast to English practice, "w" and "y" are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u".

The letter "j" was not used traditionally, but is now used in many everyday words borrowed from English, like ''jam'', ''jôc'' "joke" and ''garej'' "garage". The letters "k", "q", "v", "x", and "z" are used in some technical terms, like ''kilogram'', ''volt'' and ''zero'', but in all cases can be, and often are, replaced by Welsh letters: ''cilogram'', ''folt'' and ''sero.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Peter Wynn (1996) ''Gramadeg y Gymraeg.'' Cardiff: University of Wales Press: 757.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter "k" was in common use until the 16th century, but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh, as [[William Salesbury]] explained: "C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth". This change was not popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohiyimir.typepad.com/eng_wel_tolkien.pdf|title=English and Welsh, an essay by J. R. R. Tolkien|author=|date=|website=typepad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common [[diacritic]] is the [[circumflex]], which disambiguates [[vowel length|long vowels]], most often in the case of homographs, where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other: e.g. ''man'' "place" vs ''mân'' "fine", "small".

==Morphology==
{{Main|Colloquial Welsh morphology|Literary Welsh morphology}}
{{anchor|mutation|mutations}}
Welsh [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] has much in common with that of the other modern [[Insular Celtic languages]], such as the use of initial [[consonant mutation]]s and of so-called "[[inflected preposition|conjugated prepositions]]" ([[preposition]]s that fuse with the [[personal pronoun]]s that are their [[object (grammar)|object]]). Welsh nouns belong to one of two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine, but they are not inflected for [[grammatical case|case]]. Welsh has a variety of different endings and other methods to indicate the plural, and two endings to indicate the [[grammatical number|singular]] of some nouns. In spoken Welsh, verbal features are indicated primarily by the use of [[auxiliary verb]]s rather than by the [[grammatical conjugation|inflection of the main verb]]. In literary Welsh, on the other hand, inflection of the main verb is usual.

==Syntax==
{{Main|Welsh syntax}}

The canonical word order in Welsh is [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO).

Colloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs, as in English. The present tense is constructed with {{lang|cy|bod}} ("to be") as an [[auxiliary verb]], with the main verb appearing as a [[verbnoun]] (used in a way loosely equivalent to an infinitive) after the particle ''yn'':
:{{lang|cy|Mae Siân yn mynd i Lanelli}}
:Siân is going to Llanelli.
There, ''mae'' is a third-person singular present indicative form of ''bod'', and ''mynd'' is the verbnoun meaning "to go". The [[imperfect]] is constructed in a similar manner, as are the [[periphrastic]] forms of the [[future tense|future]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]] tenses.

In the [[preterite]], future and conditional mood tenses, there are [[inflected language|inflected]] forms of all verbs, which are used in the written language. However, speech now more commonly uses the verbnoun together with an inflected form of {{lang|cy|gwneud}} ("do"), so "I went" can be {{lang|cy|Mi es i}} or {{lang|cy|Mi wnes i fynd}} ("I did go"). ''Mi'' is an example of a preverbal particle; such particles are common in Welsh.

Welsh lacks separate pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses; instead, special verb forms or relative pronouns that appear identical to some preverbal particles are used.

===Possessives as direct objects of verbnouns===
The Welsh for "I like Rhodri" is {{lang|cy|Dw i'n hoffi Rhodri}} (word for word, "am I in [the] liking [of] Rhodri"), with ''Rhodri'' in a possessive relationship with ''hoffi''. With personal pronouns, the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used, as in "I like ''him''": [Dw i'n ''ei'' hoffi], literally, "am I ''his'' liking" – "I like ''you''" is [Dw i'n ''dy'' hoffi] ("am I ''your'' liking").

===Pronoun doubling===
In colloquial Welsh, possessive pronouns, whether they are used to mean "my", "your", etc. or to indicate the direct object of a verbnoun, are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbnoun: {{lang|cy|''ei dŷ'' e|italic=unset}} "his house" (literally "his house ''of him''"), {{lang|cy|''Dw i'n dy hoffi'' di|italic=unset}} "I like you" ("I am [engaged in the action of] your liking ''of you''"), etc. It should be noted that the "reinforcement" (or, simply, "redoubling") adds no emphasis in the colloquial register. While the possessive pronoun alone may be used, especially in more formal registers, as shown above, it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun. Such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech, mainly among young speakers: {{lang|cy|Ble 'dyn ni'n mynd? Tŷ ti neu dŷ fi?}} ("Where are we going? Your house or my house?").

==Counting system==
{{Main|Welsh numerals}}
The traditional counting system used in the Welsh language is [[vigesimal]], i.e. it is based on twenties, as in standard French numbers 70 ({{lang|fr|soixante-dix}}, literally "sixty-ten") to 99 ({{lang|fr|quatre-vingt-dix-neuf}}, literally "four score nineteen"). Welsh numbers from 11 to 14 are "''x'' on ten" (e.g. {{lang|cy|un ar ddeg}}: 11), 16 to 19 are "''x'' on fifteen" (e.g. {{lang|cy|un ar bymtheg}}: 16), though 18 is {{lang|cy|deunaw}}, "two nines"; numbers from 21 to 39 are "1–19 on twenty"(e.g. {{lang|cy|deg ar hugain}}: 30), 40 is {{lang|cy|deugain}} "two twenties", 60 is {{lang|cy|trigain}} "three twenties", etc. This form continues to be used, especially by older people, and it is obligatory in certain circumstances (such as telling the time, and in ordinal numbers).&lt;ref&gt;King, G. ''Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar'', published by Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-09269-8}} p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a decimal counting system, which has become relatively widely used, though less so in giving the time, ages, and dates (it features no ordinal numbers). This system is in especially common use in schools due to its simplicity, and in Patagonian Welsh. Whereas 39 in the vigesimal system is {{lang|cy|pedwar ar bymtheg ar hugain}} ("four on fifteen on twenty") or even {{lang|cy|deugain namyn un}} ("two score minus one"), in the decimal system it is {{lang|cy|tri deg naw}} ("three tens nine").

Although there is only one word for "one" ({{lang|cy|un}}), it triggers the [[Welsh morphology|soft mutation]] ({{lang|cy|treiglad meddal}}) of feminine nouns, where possible, other than those beginning with "ll" or "rh". There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers "two" ({{lang|cy|dau}} and {{lang|cy|dwy}}), "three" ({{lang|cy|tri}} and {{lang|cy|tair}}) and "four" ({{lang|cy|pedwar}} and {{lang|cy|pedair}}), which must agree with the [[grammatical gender]] of the objects being counted. The objects being counted appear in the singular, not plural form.

==Dialects==
Currently, there is no standardised or definitive form of the Welsh language, with significant differences in [[dialect]] marked in pronunciation, vocabulary and in points of grammar.

For example: consider the question "Do you want a cuppa ''[a cup of tea]''?" In Gwynedd this would typically be {{lang|cy|Dach chi isio panad?}}  while in Glamorgan one would be more likely to hear {{lang|cy|Ych chi'n moyn dishgled?}} (though in other parts of the South one would not be surprised to hear {{lang|cy|Ych chi isie paned?}} as well, among other possibilities). An example of a pronunciation difference is the tendency in some southern dialects to palatalise the letter "s", e.g. {{lang|cy|mis}} ({{langnf||Welsh|month|links=no}}), usually pronounced {{IPA-cy|miːs|IPA}}, but as {{IPA-cy|miːʃ|IPA}} in parts of the south. This normally occurs next to a high front [[vowel]] like /i/, although exceptions include the pronunciation of {{lang|cy|sut}} "how" as {{IPA-cy|ʃʊd|IPA}} in the southern dialects (compared with northern {{IPA-cy|sɨt|IPA}}).

===The four traditional languages===
Although popular understanding often splits Welsh into northern (Gogledd) and southern (De) Welsh, in reality significant variation exists within these areas. The traditional classification of four Welsh 'languages', remains the most academically useful:

*{{lang|cy|Y Wyndodeg}}, the language of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]
*{{lang|cy|Y Bowyseg}}, the language of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] 
*{{lang|cy|Y Ddyfedeg}}, the language of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]]
*{{lang|cy|[[Gwenhwyseg|Y Wenhwyseg]]}}, the language of [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] and [[Morgannwg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kimkat.org/amryw/1_cymraeg/cymraeg_tafodieitheg_gymraeg_mynegai_1385e.htm |title=Index to Welsh dialects |publisher=Kimkat.org |date=20 April 2006 |access-date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth 'language' is [[Patagonian Welsh]], which has developed since the start of {{lang|cy|[[Y Wladfa]]|italics=no}} (the [[Welsh settlement in Argentina]]) in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut valley and in the Andes.

Dialectal classifications exist within the 'languages' (such as the [[Cofi dialect]]). The book {{lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: Cyflwyno'r Tafodieithoedd}} ({{langnf||Welsh|''Welsh, Welsh, Welsh: Introducing the Dialects''|links=no}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Beth |last2=Thomas |first2=Peter Wynn | title={{lang|cy|Cymraeg, Cymrâg, Cymrêg: Cyflwyno'r Tafodieithoedd}} |lang=cy |trans-title=Welsh, Welsh, Welsh: Introducing the Dialects |publisher=Gwasg Taf |year=1989 |isbn=0-948469-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different area dialects. The book also refers to the earlier ''Linguistic Geography of Wales''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Alan R |year=1973 |title=Linguistic Geography of Wales |publisher=[[University of Wales Press]] for Board of Celtic Studies |location=[[Cardiff]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions. 

In the 1970s, there was an attempt to standardise the Welsh language by teaching {{lang|cy|Cymraeg Byw}} ("Living Welsh") – a colloquially-based generic form of Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madog.org/dysgwyr/adolygiadau/adolygu1.html|title=Teach Yourself Welsh|publisher=Cymdeithas Madog|date=15 March 2000|access-date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the attempt largely failed because it did not encompass the regional differences used by speakers of Welsh.

==Registers==
Modern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]—Colloquial Welsh ({{lang|cy|Cymraeg llafar}}) and Literary Welsh ({{lang|cy|Cymraeg llenyddol}}). The grammar described here is that of Colloquial Welsh, which is used in most speech and informal writing. Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers, including much literature. As a standardised form, literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh. Some differences include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Literary Welsh
! Colloquial Welsh
|-
| Can omit subject pronouns ([[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]])
| Subject pronouns rarely omitted
|-
| More extensive use of simple verb forms
| More extensive use of [[periphrastic]] verb forms
|-
| No distinction between simple present and future&lt;br&gt; (e.g. ''af'' "I go"/"I shall go")
| Simple form most often expresses only future&lt;br&gt; (e.g. ''af i'' "I'll go")
|-
| Subjunctive verb forms
| Subjunctive in fixed idioms only
|-
| 3rd.pl ending and pronoun ''–nt hwy''
| 3rd.pl ending and pronoun ''–n nhw''
|}

Amongst the characteristics of the literary, as against the spoken, language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms, different usage of some of the tenses, less frequent use of pronouns (since the information is usually conveyed in the verb/preposition inflections) and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words. In addition, more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh.

===Examples of sentences in literary and colloquial Welsh===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English
! Literary Welsh
! Colloquial Welsh
|-
| I get up early every day.
| {{lang|cy|Codaf yn gynnar bob dydd}}.

| {{lang|cy|Ni chysgant ond pan fo angen}}.
| {{lang|cy|Fyddan nhw'n cysgu ddim ond pan fydd angen}}.
|}

In fact, the differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary language. The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in [[Welsh Bible|Welsh translations]] of the [[Bible]], amongst other things - although the 2004 {{lang|cy|Beibl Cymraeg Newydd}} ({{langnf||Welsh|''New Welsh Bible''|links=no}}) is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible.  Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes that "The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King |first=Gareth |title=Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |edition=3rd |year=2016 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0DY-CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Welsh%3A%20A%20Comprehensive%20Grammar&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=Modern%20Welsh:%20A%20Comprehensive%20Grammar&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-138-82629-8 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in ''A Grammar of Welsh'' by Stephen J.

'''West Kilimanjaro''', or '''West Chaga''', is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language of [[Tanzania]] spoken by the [[Chaga people]].

There are several dialects:&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;
