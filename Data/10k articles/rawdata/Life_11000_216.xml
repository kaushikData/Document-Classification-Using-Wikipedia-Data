'''Abu Abdallah Mohammed II''',  Al-Mutawakkil, often simply '''Abdallah Mohammed''' (died 4 August 1578) was [[Sultan of Morocco]] from  1574 to 1576. He was the oldest son of [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] and became Sultan after his father's death.

Immediately after his accession to the throne he had one of his brothers executed and another (Mulay en-Naser, the governor of Tadla) imprisoned.

Abu Abdallah's uncle [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I|Abd al-Malik]], who was like [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] a son of [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]], had already fled to [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1574.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h97ivaPeOx8C&amp;pg=PA277 ''Cervantes in Algiers: a captive's tale'' by María Antonia Garcés, p.277 note 39]&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Ottoman [[Algeria]], Abd al-Malik succeeded in organising his own army, consisting of Ottoman soldiers, and in 1576 he invaded Morocco and conquered [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] from his nephew, in the [[Capture of Fez]]. The first battle  was in [[al-Rukn]] in the lands of [[Banu waritin]], near Fez. In a second battle near Salé (Rabat) in [[Jandaq al-Rayhan]], Abd al-Malik also defeated his nephew. A third battle, also won by Abd al-Malik, took place in [[Taroudannt]].

Both Abd al-Malik and Abu Abdallah died two years later in the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]], in 1578. In that battle, Abu Abdallah fought his last battle against his uncle Abd al-Malik with the help of his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] allies.

'''Sabri Khalil al-Banna''' (May 1937&amp;nbsp;– 16 August 2002), known as '''Abu Nidal''', was the founder of Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, a militant [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] splinter group more commonly known as the [[Abu Nidal Organization]] (ANO).&lt;ref name=Melman1987p213&gt;[[Yossi Melman|Melman, Yossi]] (1987) [1986].

==Early life==
===Family, early education===
[[File:Jaffaview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=photograph|Abu Nidal was born in [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]], where he was raised in a large stone house near the beach.]]
Abu Nidal was born in [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]], on the Mediterranean coast of what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. His father, Hajj Khalil al-Banna, owned 6,000 acres (24&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of orange groves situated between Jaffa and Majdal, today [[Ashkelon]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 45–46; for orange groves, Seale 1992, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in luxury in a three-storey stone house near the beach, later used as an Israeli military court.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 45–46; for the military court, image between 122 and 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Khalil al-Banna, Abu Nidal's brother, told [[Yossi Melman]]:

{{quote|My father&amp;nbsp;... was the richest man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and afterwards Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

|source= — Muhammad al-Banna, brother of Abu Nidal&lt;ref name=Melman1987p47&gt;Melman 1987, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Khalil al-Banna's wealth allowed him to take several wives. According to Abu Nidal in an interview with ''Der Spiegel'', his father had 13 wives, 17 sons and eight daughters. Melman writes that Abu Nidal's mother was the eighth wife.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p46&gt;Melman 1987, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been one of the family's maids, a 16-year-old [[Alawite]] girl. The family disapproved of the marriage, according to [[Patrick Seale]], and as a result Abu Nidal, Khalil's 12th child, was apparently looked down on by his older siblings, although in later life the relationships were repaired.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p58&gt;Seale 1992, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 or 1945, his father sent him to [[Collège des Frères de Jaffa]], a French mission school, which he attended for one year.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p47/&gt; When his father died in 1945, when Abu Nidal was seven years old, the family turned his mother out of the house.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p58/&gt; His brothers took him out of the mission school and enrolled him instead in a prestigious, private Muslim school in Jerusalem, now known as [[Umariya Elementary School]], which he attended for about two years.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p48&gt;Melman 1987, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948 Palestine War===
{{further|1948 Palestine War|1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Palestinian exodus}}
On 29 November 1947, the United Nations resolved to [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition Palestine]] into an Arab and Jewish state. Fighting broke out immediately, and the disruption of the citrus-fruit business hit the family's income.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p48/&gt; In Jaffa there were food shortages, truck bombs and an [[Irgun]] mortar bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]] (2004). ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Melman writes that the al-Banna family had had good relations with the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Melman1987pp48-49/&gt; Abu Nidal's brother told Melman that their father had been a friend of Avraham Shapira, a founder of the Jewish defense organization, [[Hashomer]]: "He would visit [Shapira] in his home in Petah Tikva, or Shapira riding his horse would visit our home in Jaffa. I also remember how we visited Dr. Weizmann [later first president of Israel] in his home in Rehovot." But it was war, and the relationships did not help them.&lt;ref name=Melman1987pp48-49&gt;Melman 1987, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli troops in April 1948, the family fled to their house near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, and they had to flee again. This time they went to the [[Bureij]] refugee camp in the [[Gaza Strip]], then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, dependent on [[UNRWA]] for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p49&gt;Melman 1987, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 49; Seale 1992, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Nablus and Saudi Arabia===
The al-Banna family's commercial experience, and the money they had managed to take with them, meant they could set themselves up in business again, Melman writes.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p49/&gt; Their orange groves had gone, now part of the new state of [[Israel]], which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948. The family moved to [[Nablus]] in the [[West Bank]], then under Jordanian control.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p46/&gt; In 1955, Abu Nidal graduated from high school, joined the Arab nationalist [[Ba'ath party]],&lt;ref name=Hudson1999p100/&gt; and began a degree course in engineering at [[Cairo University]], but he left after two years without a degree.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he made his way to Saudi Arabia, where he set himself up as a painter and electrician, and worked as a casual laborer for [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]].&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 50; Seale 1992, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother told Melman that Abu Nidal would return to Nablus from Saudi Arabia every year to visit his mother. It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. The marriage produced a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Abu Nidal was often in poor health, according to Seale, and tended to dress in zip-up jackets and old trousers, drinking whisky every night in his later years. He became, writes Seale, a "master of disguises and subterfuge, trusting no one, lonely and self-protective, [living] like a mole, hidden away from public view".&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Acquaintances said that he was capable of hard work and had a good financial brain.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salah Khalaf]] (Abu Iyad), the deputy chief of Fatah who was assassinated by the ANO in 1991, knew him well in the late 1960s when he took Abu Nidal under his wing.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p69&gt;Seale 1992, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Seale:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He had been recommended to me as a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p69/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Seale suggests that Abu Nidal's childhood explained his personality, described as chaotic by Abu Iyad and as psychopathic by [[Issam Sartawi]], the late Palestinian heart surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 3, 51; Seale 1992, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirst20Aug2002/&gt; His siblings' scorn, the loss of his father, and his mother's removal from the family home when he was seven, then the loss of his home and status in the conflict with Israel, created a mental world of plots and counterplots, reflected in his tyrannical leadership of the ANO. Members' wives (it was an all-male group) were not allowed to befriend each another, and Abu Nidal's wife was expected to live in isolation without friends.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
===Impex, Black September===
[[File:Hussein of Jordan 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|[[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan in 1997]]
In Saudi Arabia Abu Nidal helped found a small group of young Palestinians who called themselves the Palestine Secret Organization. The activism cost him his job and home: Aramco fired him, and the Saudi government imprisoned then expelled him.&lt;ref name=Hudson1999p100&gt;Hudson 1999, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Nablus with his wife and family, and joined Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO. Working as an odd-job man, he was committed to Palestinian politics but was not particularly active, until Israel won the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], capturing the [[Golan Heights]], the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Melman writes that "the entrance of the Israel Defense Forces tanks into Nablus was a traumatic experience for him. The conquest aroused him to action."&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1986, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to [[Amman]], Jordan, he set up a trading company called Impex, which acted as a front for Fatah, serving as a meeting place and conduit for funds. This became a hallmark of Abu Nidal's career. Companies controlled by the ANO made him a rich man by engaging in legitimate business deals, while acting as cover for arms deals and mercenary activities&gt;&lt;ref name=Seale1992p69&gt;Seale 1992, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:King Hussein 1970.ogv|thumb|alt=video|1970 Echo newsreel about the situation in Jordan]]
When Fatah asked him to choose a ''[[nom de guerre]]'', he chose Abu Nidal ("father of struggle") after his son, Nidal.&lt;ref name=AbuKhalil2005/&gt; Those who knew him at the time said he was a well-organized leader, not a guerrilla; during fighting between the [[Palestinian fedayeen|Palestinian ''fedayeen'']] and King Hussein's troops, he stayed in his office.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 513; Seale 1992, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Abu Iyad appointed him as the Fatah representative in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) to the same position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]], when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian ''fedayeen'' out of Jordan, with the loss of thousands of lives. Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, Seale writes, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that he was interested only in saving himself.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p78&gt;Seale 1992, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First operation===
Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began accusing the PLO, over his Voice of Palestine&lt;!--note: this is not the same as [[Voice of Palestine]]--&gt; radio station in Iraq, of cowardice for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p78/&gt; During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, he joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and [[Abu Daoud]] (leader of the [[Black September Organization]] responsible for the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]]) in calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahmoud Abbas September 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|[[Mahmoud Abbas]], [[President of the Palestinian Authority]], in 2014]]
In February 1973, Abu Daoud was arrested in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name ''Al-Iqab'' ("the Punishment"). On 5 September 1973, five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and threatened to blow up the building if Abu Daoud was not released.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 69; Seale 1992, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, Henry (6 September 1973). [https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/06/archives/gunmen-hold-15-hostages-in-saudi-embassy-in-paris-apologize-to.html "Gunmen Hold 15 Hostages In Saudi Embassy in Paris"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p91/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, Henry (7 September 1973). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9504E6D8113DE63ABC4F53DFBF668388669EDE "Commandos leave Embassy in Paris"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p91&gt;Seale 1992, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the attack, 56 heads of state were meeting in [[Algiers]] for the 4th conference of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. According to Seale, the Saudi Embassy operation had been commissioned by Iraq's president, [[Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr]], as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference. Seale writes one of the hostage-takers admitted that he had been told to fly the hostages around until the conference was over.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p92/&gt;

Abu Nidal had carried out the operation without the permission of Fatah.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Iyad]] (Arafat's deputy) and [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (later [[President of the Palestinian Authority]]), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! We asked him to mount it for us." Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as under the control of the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p92&gt;Seale 1992, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion from Fatah===
Two months later, in November 1973 (just after the [[Yom Kippur War]] in October), the ANO hijacked [[KLM Flight 861]], this time using the name Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. Fatah had been discussing convening a peace conference in Geneva; the hijacking was intended to warn them not to go ahead with it. In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 70; Seale 1992, 97–98 (Melman writes that it was March 1974, Seale that it was July).&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1974 Abu Nidal formed the ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p99/&gt; In November that year a Fatah court sentenced him to death ''in absentia'' for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Seale writes that it is unlikely that Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but it was clear that he had become ''persona non grata''.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p99&gt;Seale 1992, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ANO==
===Nature of the organization===
In addition to Fatah: The Revolutionary Council, the ANO called itself the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Black June (for actions against Syria), Black September (for actions against Jordan), the Revolutionary Arab Brigades, the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims, the Egyptian Revolution, Revolutionary Egypt, ''Al-Asifa'' ("the Storm," a name also used by Fatah), ''Al-Iqab'' ("the Punishment"), and the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p213/&gt;

The group had up to 500 members, chosen from young men in the [[Palestinian refugee camp]]s and in Lebanon, who were promised good pay and help looking after their families.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For up to 500 members, Harvey W. Kushner, "Abu Nidal Organization," in ''Encyclopedia of Terrorism'', Sage Publications, 2002, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; They would be sent to training camps in whichever country was hosting the ANO at the time (Syria, Iraq or Libya), then organized into small cells.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner 2002, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in, [[As`ad AbuKhalil]] and Michael Fischbach write, they were not allowed to leave again.&lt;ref name=AbuKhalil2000p12&gt;AbuKhalil and Fischbach 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; The group assumed complete control over the membership. One member who spoke to Patrick Seale was told before being sent overseas: "If we say, 'Drink alcohol'", do so. If we say, 'Get married,' find a woman and marry her. If we say, 'Don't have children,' you must obey. If we say, 'Go and kill King Hussein,' you must be ready to sacrifice yourself!"&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seale writes that recruits were asked to write out their life stories, including names and addresses of family and friends, then sign a paper saying they agreed to execution if discovered to have intelligence connections. If suspected, they would be asked to rewrite the whole story, without discrepancies.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 7, 13–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ANO's newspaper ''Filastin al-Thawra'' regularly announced the execution of traitors.&lt;ref name=AbuKhalil2000p12/&gt; Abu Nidal believed that the group had been penetrated by Israeli agents, and there was a sense that Israel may have used the ANO to undermine more moderate Palestinian groups. Terrorism experts regard the view that Abu Nidal himself was such agent as "far-fetched".&lt;ref name=Patrick1997/&gt;&lt;!--use Seale as source for this instead--&gt;

===Committee for Revolutionary Justice===
{{main|Abu Nidal Organization internal executions}}
There were reports of purges throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Around 600 ANO members were killed in Lebanon and Libya, including 171 in one night in November 1987, when they were lined up, shot and thrown into a mass grave. Dozens were kidnapped in Syria and killed in the Badawi refugee camp. Most of the decisions to kill, Abu Daoud told Seale, were taken by Abu Nidal "in the middle of the night, after he [had] knocked back a whole bottle of whiskey."&lt;ref name=Seale1992pp287-289&gt;Seale 1992, 287–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The purges led to the defection from the ANO in 1989 of Atif Abu Bakr, head of the ANO's political directorate, who returned to Fatah.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 307, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members were routinely tortured by the "Committee for Revolutionary Justice" until they confessed to disloyalty. Seale writes that reports of torture included hanging a man naked, whipping him until he was unconscious, reviving him with cold water, then rubbing salt or chili powder into his wounds. A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tyre with his legs and backside in the air, then whipped, wounded, salted and revived with cold water. A member's testicles might be fried in oil, or melted plastic dripped onto his skin. Between interrogations, prisoners would be tied up in tiny cells. If the cells were full, Seale writes, they might be buried with a pipe in their mouths for air and water; if Abu Nidal wanted them dead, a bullet would be fired down the pipe instead.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligence Directorate===
The Intelligence Directorate was formed in 1985 to oversee special operations. It had four subcommittees: the Committee for Special Missions, the Foreign Intelligence Committee, the Counterespionage Committee and the Lebanon Committee. Led by Abd al-Rahman Isa, the longest-serving member of the ANO—Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and shabby, but charming and persuasive—the directorate  maintained 30–40 people overseas who looked after the ANO's arms caches in various countries. It trained staff, arranged passports and visas, and reviewed security at airports and seaports. Members were not allowed to visit each other at home, and no one outside the directorate was supposed to know who was a member.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Nidal demoted Isa in 1987, believing he had become too close to other figures within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, he insisted that Isa remain in the Intelligence Directorate, where he had to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told to treat him with contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee for Special Missions===
The job of the Committee for Special Missions was to choose targets.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p183&gt;Seale 1992, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; It had started life as the Military Committee, headed by Naji Abu al-Fawaris, who had led the attack on [[Heinz Nittel]], head of the Israel-Austria Friendship League, who was shot and killed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the committee changed its name to the Committee for Special Missions, headed by Dr. Ghassan al-Ali, who had been born in the [[West Bank]] and educated in England, where he obtained a BA and MA in chemistry and married a British woman (later divorced).&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; A former ANO member told Seale that Ali favoured "the most extreme and reckless operations."&lt;ref name=Seale1992p183/&gt;

==Operations and relationships==
{{further|List of attacks attributed to Abu Nidal}}
===Shlomo Argov===
[[File:The Dorchester, Mayfair, London, UK - 20100501.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|[[Shlomo Argov]] was shot in the head as he left the [[Dorchester Hotel]], [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]], London.]]
On 3 June 1982, ANO operative Hussein Ghassan Said shot [[Shlomo Argov]], the Israeli ambassador to Britain, once in the head as he left the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London. Said was accompanied by Nawaf al-Rosan, an Iraqi intelligence officer, and Marwan al-Banna, Abu Nidal's cousin. Argov survived, but spent three months in a coma and the rest of his life disabled, until his death in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe, Lawrence (25 February 2003). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/25/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon "Shlomo Argov"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; The PLO quickly denied responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Cobban|Cobban, Helena]] (1984). ''The Palestinian Liberation Organisation''. Cambridge University Press, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ariel Sharon]], then Israel's defence minister, responded three days later by [[1982 Lebanon War|invading Lebanon]], where the PLO was based, a reaction that Seale argues Abu Nidal had intended. The Israeli government had been preparing to invade and Abu Nidal provided a pretext.&lt;ref name=Seale1992pp223-224&gt;Seale 1992, 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Spiegel'' put it to him in October 1985 that the assassination of Argov, when he knew Israel wanted to attack the PLO in Lebanon, made him appear to be working for the Israelis, in the view of Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p120&gt;Melman 1987, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; He replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Arafat says about me doesn't bother me. Not only he, but also a whole list of Arab and world politicians claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.&amp;nbsp;... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.&lt;ref name=Melman1987p120/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rome and Vienna===
{{main|Rome and Vienna airport attacks}}
Abu Nidal's most infamous operation was the 1985 attack on the Rome and Vienna airports.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p246&gt;Seale 1992, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December, at 08:15 GMT, four gunmen opened fire on the [[El Al]] ticket counter at the [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport]] in Rome, killing 16 and wounding 99. In [[Vienna International Airport]] a few minutes later, three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv, killing four and wounding 39.&lt;ref name=Suro132Feb1988/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/27/newsid_2545000/2545949.stm "Gunmen kill 16 at two European airports"], BBC News, 27 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Seale, the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the check-in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p244&gt;Seale 1992, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria and Italy had both been involved in trying to arrange peace talks. Sources close to Abu Nidal told Seale that Libyan intelligence had supplied the weapons. The damage to the PLO was enormous, according to [[Abu Iyad]], Arafat's deputy. Most people in the West and even many Arabs could not distinguish between the ANO and Fatah, he said. "When such horrible things take place, ordinary people are left thinking that all Palestinians are criminals."&lt;ref name=Seale1992p245&gt;Seale 1992, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States bombing of Libya===

On 15 April 1986, the US launched bombing raids from British bases against [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]], killing around 100, in retaliation for the bombing of a [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|Berlin nightclub]] used by US service personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_3975000/3975455.stm "US launches air strikes on Libya"], BBC News, 15 April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malinarich, Natalie (13 November 2001).

[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/23/alec-collett-remains-found-lebanon "Remains of British journalist Alec Collett found in Lebanon"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of two British teachers, Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield, and an American, Peter Kilburn, were found in a village near Beirut on 17 April 1986; the Arab Fedayeen Cells, a name linked to Abu Nidal, claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner 2002, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[John McCarthy (journalist)|John McCarthy]] was kidnapped the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/17/newsid_4693000/4693188.stm "1986: British journalist McCarthy kidnapped"], BBC On This Day, 17 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindawi affair===
{{main|Hindawi affair}}
On 17 April 1986—the day the bodies of the teachers were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in [[Heathrow airport]] with a [[Semtex]] bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé [[Nizar Hindawi]], who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1986, 170–174.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Melman, Abu Nidal had recommended Hindawi to Syrian intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1986, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Seale writes that the bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack was in response to Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan Am Flight 73===
{{main|Pan Am Flight 73}}
On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at [[Karachi Airport]] on its way from Mumbai to New York, holding 389 passengers and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the tarmac before detonating grenades inside the cabin. [[Neerja Bhanot]], the flight's senior purser, was able to open an emergency door, and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Melman 1987, 190; Seale 1992, 252–254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajghatta, Chidanand (17 January 2010).

[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1052614.ece "Revealed: Gaddafi's air massacre plot"], ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Gaddafi===
[[File:Muammar al-Gaddafi-09122003.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Muammar Gaddafi]]]]
Abu Nidal began to move his organization out of Syria to Libya in the summer of 1986,&lt;ref name=Seale1992p255/&gt; arriving there in March 1987. In June that year the Syrian government expelled him, in part because of the Hindawi affair and Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly took credit during this period for operations in which he had no involvement, including the 1984 [[Brighton hotel bombing]], 1985 [[Bradford City stadium fire]], and 1986 assassination of [[Zafer al-Masri]], the mayor of Nablus (killed by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], according to Seale). By publishing a congratulatory note in the ANO's magazine, he also implied that he had been behind the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], writes Seale.&lt;ref name=Seale1992p254&gt;Seale 1992, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Nidal and Libya's leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], allegedly became great friends, each holding what [[Marie Colvin]] and Sonya Murad called a "dangerous combination of an inferiority complex mixed with the belief that he was a man of great destiny". The relationship gave Abu Nidal a sponsor and Gaddafi a mercenary.&lt;ref name=ColvinMurad2002&gt;[[Marie Colvin|Colvin, Marie]] and Murad, Sonya (25 August 2002). "Executed," ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Seale reports that Libya brought out the worst in Abu Nidal. He would not allow even the most senior ANO members to socialize with each other; all meetings had to be reported to him. All passports had to be handed over. No one was allowed to travel without his permission. Ordinary members were not allowed to have telephones; senior members were allowed to make local calls only.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; His members knew nothing about his daily life, including where he lived. If he wanted to entertain, Seale writes, he would take over the home of another member.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 258–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Abu Bakr, speaking to ''Al Hayatt'' in 2002, Abu Nidal said he was behind the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]], which exploded over [[Lockerbie]], Scotland, on 21 December 1988; a former head of security for [[Libyan Arab Airlines]] was later convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2211327.stm "Abu Nidal 'behind Lockerbie bombing'"], BBC News, 23 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: "We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill him with my own hands!" Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it; one of Abu Nidal's associates told him, "If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe, Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work."&lt;ref name=Seale1992p255&gt;Seale 1992, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banking with BCCI===
In the late 1980s British intelligence learned that the ANO held accounts with the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) in London.&lt;ref name=Walsh2004&gt;Walsh, Conal (18 January 2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20040818181959/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/economics/story/0,11268,1125478,00.html "What spooks told Old Lady about BCCI"], ''The Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, Sarah; Bates, James (11 July 1991). [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-11/news/mn-2869_1_independence-bank "BCCI Case May Be History's Biggest Bank Fraud Scandal"], ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Nidal himself was said to have visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James; Frantz, Douglas (1992). ''A Full Service Bank''. Simon and Schuster, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Frantz 1992, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact, half the shipment went to the police in [[East Germany]] and half to Abu Nidal.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Frantz 1992, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination of Abu Iyad===
On 14 January 1991 in Tunis, the night before US forces moved into Kuwait, the ANO assassinated [[Abu Iyad]], head of PLO intelligence, along with Abu al-Hol, Fatah's chief of security, and Fakhri al-Umari, another Fatah aide; all three men were shot in Abu Iyad's home. The killer, Hamza Abu Zaid, confessed that an ANO operative had hired him. When he shot Abu Iyad, he reportedly shouted, "Let Atif Abu Bakr help you now!", a reference to the senior ANO member who had left the group in 1989, and whom Abu Nidal believed had been planted within the ANO by Abu Iyad as a spy.&lt;ref&gt;Seale 1992, 32, 34, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Iyad had known that Abu Nidal nursed a hatred of him, in part because he had kept Abu Nidal out of the PLO. But the real reason for the hatred, Abu Iyad told Seale, was that he had protected Abu Nidal in his early years within the movement. Given his personality, Abu Nidal could not acknowledge that debt. Seale writes that the murder "must therefore be seen as a final settlement of old scores".&lt;ref name=Seale1992p312&gt;Seale 1992, 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

After Libyan intelligence operatives were charged with the Lockerbie bombing, Gaddafi tried to distance himself from terrorism. Abu Nidal was expelled from Libya in 1999,&lt;ref name=StJohn2011p187&gt;St John, Ronald Bruce (2011). ''Libya and the United States, Two Centuries of Strife'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 he returned to Iraq. The Iraqi government later said he had entered the country using a fake Yemeni passport and false name.&lt;ref name=Arraf2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Najib23Aug2002&gt;Najib, Mohammed (23 August 2002).

On 19 August 2002, the Palestinian newspaper [[Al-Ayyam (Ramallah)|''al-Ayyam'']] reported that Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds at his home in Baghdad, a house the newspaper said was owned by the ''[[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]]'', the Iraqi secret service.&lt;ref name=ColvinMurad2002/&gt; Two days later Iraq's chief of intelligence, [[Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti|Taher Jalil Habbush]], handed out photographs of Abu Nidal's body to journalists, along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull. Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments. After saying he needed a change of clothes, he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth, according to Habbush. He died eight hours later in hospital.&lt;ref name=Arraf2002&gt;Arraf, Jane (21 August 2002). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050819133048/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/08/21/iraq.nidal/ "Iraq details terror leader's death"], CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jane's Information Group|Jane's]]'' reported in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents in his home about a US attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told ''Jane's'' that he had been shot several times. ''Jane's'' suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him in the event of an American invasion.&lt;ref name=Najib23Aug2002/&gt;

In 2008 [[Robert Fisk]] obtained a report written in September 2002, for Saddam Hussein's "presidency intelligence office," by Iraq's "Special Intelligence Unit M4." The report said that the Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States, and that he had been asked by the Kuwaitis to find links between Iraq and [[Al-Qaeda]]. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went into his bedroom and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.&lt;ref name=Fisk25Oct2008/&gt;

==Early life and amateur career==
Stevenson's known name is an inversion of his family name and given name.&lt;ref name="presse1"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.lapresse.ca/sports/sports-de-combat/201311/25/01-4714284-adonis-stevenson-la-vraie-histoire-de-superman.php | title = Adonis Stevenson: La vraie histoire de Superman (La Presse) | work=La Presse | date=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="presse2"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://blogues.radio-canada.ca/bloguesportif/2013/12/02/adonis-stevenson-nest-pas-une-victime/ | title = Adonis Stevenson n'est pas une victime (Radio-Canada) | work=Radio-Canada | date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="presse3"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/125209/Stevenson-De-lombre-a-la-lumiere.html | title = Stevenson: de l'ombre à la lumière (Le Nouvelliste (Haiti)) | work=Le Nouvelliste (Haiti) | date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Stevenson moved to Montreal, Quebec with his family when he was seven. By 14 years old, he was living on the streets and soon fell into a violent gang which drew him into a criminal lifestyle.  In his early twenties, after a criminal trial in 1998 in Quebec, Stevenson served 18 months of a four-year prison sentence for managing prostitutes, assault, and issuing threats. While in prison, he also pleaded guilty to aggravated assault after putting a fellow inmate into a coma.  After leaving prison in 2001, Stevenson vowed he would never return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2014/12/03/boxer-adonis-stevenson-fighting-his-past/ Boxer Adonis Stevenson fighting his past by Steve Buffery of the Toronto Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson became Quebec Middleweight champion in 2004, and best amateur fighter of the country in 2005–2006. He also grabbed the Canada national title in 2005 and 2006. Stevenson competed in the [[Boxing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|XVIII Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia in 2006 and won the silver medal losing to local Australian [[Jarrod Fletcher]] in the final. It was also the only medal a Canadian boxer received at the games.

==Professional career==
===Super-middleweight===
====Early career====
A 29-year-old Stevenson turned professional in September 2006. His opponent was Mike Funk, another boxer making his debut, at the [[Montreal Casino]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. Stevenson knocked Funk out with a hook in twenty-two seconds.

On August 1, 2009, at [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Stevenson defeated [[Anthony Bonsante]] by first round [[knockout]]. The two fighters came out of their corners for the fight with Bonsante launching the first attack, but just moments after the assault, Stevenson landed a left hand that sent Bonsante down to the canvas. Bonsante sprawled out on the canvas with his eyes closed, while the referee reached the count of six before stopping the fight. Bonsante had begun to get up at the count of six, but it was too late, leaving Bonsante livid with the decision as he chased the referee around the ring in an attempt to protest the decision, but to little avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Henderson, Jr.| first =Benny| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Bonsante tells the Doghouse, I was down but not out!| work =| publisher =Doghouse Boxing| date =2008-08-02| url =http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Henderson/DHBenny080208.htm| doi =| accessdate =2008-08-02 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; He also won a fifth-round TKO decision against [[Jermain Mackey]] on September 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Diana Kate|title=Adonis Stevenson vs Jermain Mackey 2009 09 25|date=2015-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfHLK8bcWsQ|accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Boone====
On April 17, 2010, in his first fight in the United States, which also was his first time fighting for promoter [[Lou DiBella]], he suffered his first defeat being stopped in the second round by [[Darnell Boone]]. Boone had been knocked down on the canvas twice in the first round, however, in the second round, Stevenson rushed to Boone without maintaining his defense and he got caught by a solid right sending him on the canvas for the first time in his career. Stevenson managed to get back on his feet inside the count of 10, however, the referee waved the fight off as he deemed Stevenson unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Adonis Superman|title=Stevenson Adonis vs Boone Highlights|date=2013-03-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4zqJTYnOc|accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Return to title contention====
Nonetheless, Stevenson resumed with GYM Promotions and won the North American title NABA on April 8, 2011 at the expense of Derek Edwards by KO in the third round. He then won by referee stoppage in the first round against Dion Savage (Shujaa El-Amin) on September 17, 2011, and retained his title against Aaron Pryor Jr on December 10, 2011 by referee stoppage in the ninth round. Stevenson jumped from 15th to 2nd position for the IBF title, winning by KO in the first round duel against [[Jesús González (boxer)|Jesús González]] on February 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tvasports.ca/video/1460429621001 |title=TVASports February 18, 2012 (French) |access-date=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720201616/http://tvasports.ca/video/1460429621001 |archive-date=2012-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tvasports.ca/video/1464794765001 |title=TVASports February 21, 2012 (French) |access-date=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723014811/http://tvasports.ca/video/1464794765001 |archive-date=2012-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then fought [[Noe Gonzalez Alcoba|Noe Gonzalez]] on April 20, 2012 and won the fight at 1:40 in the second round when the referee stopped the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boxing: Canada's Stevenson overpowers Gonzalez|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/boxing-canadas-stevenson-overpowers-gonzalez/article4101541/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=2013-06-14|location=Toronto|date=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next fight originally set to be against [[Don George (boxer)|Don George]] with the winner getting a shot at the IBF champion. The fight was originally scheduled to be a co-main event of a [[fight card]] also including a match between [[Jean Pascal]] and [[Tavoris Cloud]] on August 11, 2012 but the even was cancelled due to an injury suffered by Pascal. The Stevenson fight was then moved up to August 17, 2012 and was set to be part of [[ESPN Friday Night Fights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adonis Stevenson fights Don George in IBF 168 lb eliminator on August 17th|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2012/adonis-stevenson-fights-don-george-in-ibf-168-lb-eliminator-on-august-17th/|work=East Side Boxing|accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stevenson later injured his hand cancelling the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2012/08/adonis-stevenson-injures-hand-fridays-fight-with-don-george-off/ |title=Adonis Stevenson injures hand, Friday's fight with Don George off |publisher=Boxingnews24.com |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was then rescheduled to October 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/8/28/3275679/adonis-stevenson-vs-don-george-rescheduled-october-12-2012-montreal-wealth-tv-boxing-news |title=Adonis Stevenson vs Don George Set For October 12 |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fight Stevenson knocked George down twice in the fifth and once in the sixth round before winning the fight with a 12th-round TKO after knocking him down twice more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/canadas-stevenson-stops-george-in-12th-round-to-win-wild-ibf-eliminator/article4611140/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Canada's Stevenson stops George in 12th round to win wild IBF eliminator | date=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light-heavyweight===
====Stevenson vs. Boone II====
On February 4, 2013 it was announced that Stevenson would get the chance to avenge his only loss as a professional against [[Darnell Boone]] (19-20-3, 8KOs) with the fight taking place on March 22 at the [[Bell Centre]]. With this fight, Stevenson was risking his IBF mandatory status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-darnell-boone-ii-set-march-22--62069|title=Adonis Stevenson-Darnell Boone II Set For March 22|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson avenged his only loss, knocking out [[Darnell Boone]] with a pair of lefts in the sixth round in March 22, 2013 at the [[Bell Center|Bell Centre]]. Stevenson, fighting at 171.9 pounds, forced Boone to take a knee with a right hook to the body early in the sixth, then stunned him coming out of a corner with a left uppercut, followed with a straight left that sent Boone on the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-stops-boone-alvarez-hughie-fury-win--63642|title=Adonis Stevenson Stops Boone: Alvarez, Hughie Fury Win|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Dawson====
Stevenson moved up to light heavyweight to challenge [[lineal championship|Lineal]]/[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' champion [[Chad Dawson]] (31-2, 17 KOs) on June 8, 2013 at the Bell Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2013/03/adonis-stevenson-vs-chad-dawson-in-june/|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Chad Dawson in June » Boxing News|date=2013-03-14|work=Boxing News 24|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press conferences leading up to the fight, Dawson called the fight a tune-up, also claiming that he had to [[Google Search|Google]] Stevenson because he had never heard of him. Stevenson hit Dawson with a left hook that dropped him very early in the first round of the fight, and though Dawson got up before the count of eight the referee stopped the fight, giving Stevenson an unexpected knockout victory. Stevenson's victory was his eighth straight since his only career defeat, all coming by knockout. At 174 1/4 lbs., Stevenson was fighting at the heaviest weight of his professional career to date. In the post-fight, Stevenson told HBO's Max Kellerman, "I caught him, and that's a beautiful punch." Dawson admitted, "It was a punch I didn't see. He caught me. That's it. He caught me with a good punch." Dawson suffered his second consecutive stoppage loss. In the 76 seconds the fight lasted, Dawson landed 2 of 16 punches thrown and Stevenson landed 3 of his 15 thrown. Stevenson stated the reason he moved up was due to not being able to secure a world title fight at super middleweight, accusing [[Carl Froch]] and [[Mikkel Kessler]] of ducking him and fighting each other instead in a rematch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/9357218/adonis-stevenson-shows-hands-mass-destruction-vs-chad-dawson|title=Stevenson shows hands of mass destruction|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mickey Gohou|title=Adonis Stevenson vs Chad Dawson full fight HD|date=2014-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-83G4GV7srQ|accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/fights/2013/06-08-chad-dawson-vs-adonis-stevenson/index.html|title=Chad Dawson vs. Adonis Stevenson {{!}} HBO Boxing|website=HBO|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knockout was voted as [[The Ring magazine Knockout of the Year|Ring Magazine Knockout of the Year]] for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/10219799/adonis-stevenson-chad-dawson|title=KO of the year: Stevenson-Dawson|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Cloud, Bellew====
The WBC originally ordered Stevenson to face mandatory challenger [[Tony Bellew]], but then allowed him to make a voluntary defense first against [[Tavoris Cloud]], where the winner of the fight must face Bellew at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2013/wbc-gives-permission-for-adonis-stevenson-v-tavoris-cloud-fight-to-go-ahead/ |title=WBC gives permission for Adonis Stevenson v.

He was also cut on the left eyelid in the opening round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/9741820/adonis-stevenson-stops-tavoris-cloud-retain-wbc-title|title=Stevenson stops Cloud to retain WBC crown|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-dominates-stops-tavoris-cloud--70066|title=Adonis Stevenson Dominates and Stops Tavoris Cloud - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms were agreed for the fight on July 25, 2013. On November 30, Stevenson defended his light heavyweight title against [[Tony Bellew]] (20-1-1, 12 KOs) at the [[Colisée Pepsi]]. Stevenson became the first boxer to stop Bellew winning the fight via TKO. In round 6, Stevenson put Bellew down with a left hand, he beat the count and the referee let the fight go on. Bellew was then knocked out standing by another pair of left hands before the referee could get in and put a stop to the bout. At the time of stoppage, Stevenson was ahead on the scorecards 50-45, 49-46, 50-45.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-2516331/Tony-Bellew-loses-world-title-fight-Adonis-Stevenson-wants-Carl-Froch.html|title='Superman' Stevenson stops brave Brit Bellew in sixth round to retain world title before calling out Froch and Hopkins|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/9051880/wbc-light-heavyweight-champion-adonis-stevenson-became-first-to-stop-tony-bellew|title=WBC light-heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson became first to stop Tony Bellew|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2013|website=[[Sky Sports]]|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/25173669|title=Tony Bellew beaten by Adonis Stevenson in WBC title fight|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2013|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellew contemplated moving up to cruiserweight after the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/25219334|title=Tony Bellew: Adonis Stevenson defeat prompts cruiserweight move|last=|first=|date=December 5, 2013|website=BBC Boxing|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nielsen Media Research firm, the fight attracted an average of 1.3 million viewers on the HBO network, making it the 5th most watched bout of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/nielsen-ratings-1-3-million-tune-into-stevensonkovalev-twinbill-on-hbo-during-thanksgiving-weekend-232498 | title=Nielsen Ratings: 1.3 million tune into Stevenson/Kovalev twinbill on HBO during Thanksgiving Weekend. | accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Fonfara, Sukhotsky====
In January 2014, 26 year old [[Andrzej Fonfara]] (25-2, 15 KOs) notified the IBF, who had ordered him to fight [[Dmitry Sukhotsky]] in a final eliminator, that he would pass on the opportunity because he had agreed a deal to fight lineal/WBC/''The Ring'' champion Stevenson. IBF would instead order Sukhotsky to fight their #3 ranked [[Cedric Agnew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-face-andrzej-fonfara-next--73746|title=Adonis Stevenson To Face Andrzej Fonfara Next|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Stevenson signed a deal with boxing adviser [[Al Haymon]].The fight was scheduled for May 24 on HBO, until HBO cancelled the date from their boxing schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-inks-agreement-with-al-haymon--74799|title=Adonis Stevenson Inks Agreement With Al Haymon|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/hbo-withdraws-4-26-date-from-its-boxing-schedule--75558|title=HBO Withdraws 4/26 Date From Its Boxing Schedule|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, Michel confirmed the fight would take place on Showtime instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/stevensons-promoter-on-leaving-hbo-showtime--76017|title=Stevenson's Promoter on Leaving HBO For Showtime|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson started off very well, dropping his opponent twice with sharp lefts and appeared close to stopping his opponent. Fonfara however, recovered very well, even dropping Stevenson in the ninth round. Stevenson similarly recovered quickly. The two fighters exchanged punches in a good-action final round and the crowd gave the fight a standing ovation. Stevenson won the fight as the judges scored it 116-109, 115-110 &amp; 115-110. CompuBox Stats showed over the 12 rounds, Stevenson landed 329 of 790 punches thrown (42%) and Fonfara landed 217 of his 613  thrown (35%). In the post-fight interview, Stevenson claimed he hurt his left hand in the second round.

He stated the Pascal fight would likely take place in the Spring of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/stevensons-promoter-says-pascal-happens-next-spring--83823|title=Stevenson's Promoter Says Pascal Happens Next Spring|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his fourth defense of his titles. Stevenson retained his belts via a fifth round stoppage following a one punch knockout. Stevenson was in control from the opening bell, throwing minimal punches as the crowd started to boo. In round 2, he managed to floor Sukhotsky with a left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/12055762/adonis-stevenson-finishes-dmitry-sukhotsky-one-punch-ko|title=Adonis Stevenson KO's Sukhotsky|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2014|website=ESPN|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-steamrolls-dmitry-sukhotsky-five--85553|title=Adonis Stevenson Steamrolls Dmitry Sukhotsky In Five|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CompuBox Stats, Stevenson landed 80 of 272 punches thrown (29%) and Sukhotsky landed only 23 oh his 136 thrown (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/forums/view.php?pg=stevenson-sukhotsky-compubox|title=Stevenson vs. Sukhotsky - CompuBox|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Bika, Karpency====
On February 28, 2015 ''[[Premier Boxing Champions]]'' announced that Stevenson would defend his titles against 35 year old former WBC super middleweight champion [[Sakio Bika]] (32-6-3, 21 KOs) on April 4 at the [[Colisée Pepsi|Pepsi Coliseum]] in [[Quebec City]]. It was the first fight to headline PBC on [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2015/2/28/8126685/stevenson-vs-bika-fight-officially-announced-for-pbc-on-cbs|title=Stevenson-Bika set for Quebec City|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson dropped Bika in rounds 6 and 9 en route to winning the fight on the scorecards after 12 rounds, retaining his world titles. The judges scored the fight (115–110, 116–110, 115–110). ESPN's Dan Rafael scored the fight 120-106 for Stevenson, who dominated the fight using his left hand. Bika failed to make an adjustment and get in much offence of his own. In round 5, Stevenson landed a left which dropped Bika, but referee Michael Griffin ruled it a slip. Bika however appeared hurt. In the post-fight interview, Stevenson said, "I knew he is a tough guy, so I prepared for 12 rounds and I put on a good show. He's never been knocked out, but I dropped him." Stevenson admitted he felt Bika's power and was able to withstand anything that came his way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/12618932/light-heavyweight-adonis-stevenson-dominates-sakio-bika-retain-world-title|title=Adonis Stevenson outpoints Sakio Bika to retain light heavyweight crown|last=|first=|date=April 4, 2015|website=|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2420257-adonis-stevenson-vs-sakio-bika-winner-scorecard-and-reaction|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Sakio Bika: Winner, Scorecard and Reaction|last=Mazique|first=Brian|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2015 [[Premier Boxing Champions]] announced that Stevenson would headline a card on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] on September 11 against WBC #9 ranked [[Tommy Karpency]] (25-4-1, 14 KOs) at the [[Ricoh Coliseum]] in [[Toronto]]. Karpency, previously coming off the biggest win of his career, a split decision win against Chad Dawson, the man who Stevenson beat to win the light heavyweight championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-face-tommy-karpency-on-sept-11--93991|title=Adonis Stevenson To Face Tommy Karpency on Sept. 11|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/stevenson-karpency-razor-ruddock-added-card--94326|title=Stevenson-Karpency: Razor Ruddock Added To The Card|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karpency was thought to be a stepping stone for Adonis, and he was.

He immediately knocked Karpency down after he got up, and the referee called a halt to the bout, awarding Stevenson a TKO victory in round 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/13634852/adonis-stevenson-defeats-tommy-karpency-defend-light-heavyweight-title|title=Stevenson overpowers Karpency in 3rd-round TKO|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight averaged 581,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/stevenson-karpency-pbc-on-spike-rating-581k--95821|title=Stevenson-Karpency PBC on Spike Rating at 581K|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, citing the fact that Stevenson hadn't faced a top-ranked opponent in the last two years, The Ring Magazine stripped Stevenson of his belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2015/11/24/9792818/adonis-stevenson-and-yoan-pablo-hernandez-stripped-of-ring-titles|title=Adonis Stevenson and Yoan Pablo Hernandez stripped of RING titles|last=Stumberg|first=Patrick L.|date=2015-11-24|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Fonfara II====
Undefeated Colombian boxer [[Eleider Álvarez]] (22-0, 11 KOs) became mandatory challenger following his win over [[Isaac Chilemba]] in November 2015. He then knocked out former super-middleweight world champion [[Lucian Bute]] in February 2017 in a final eliminator to become mandatory challenger once again for the WBC light heavyweight title. On February 27, 2017 the WBC ordered negotiations to begin between Stevenson and Álvarez, who are both managed by Al Haymon and promoted by [[Yvon Michel]] of GYM for a deal to be reached within 30 days or they would force a purse bid on March 24. Stevenson had a return date scheduled for April 29 at the newly renovated [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Nassau Coliseum]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/18786163/wbc-orders-deontay-wilder-adonis-stevenson-mandatory-defenses|title=WBC mandates Wilder, Stevenson defenses|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-vs-eleider-alvarez-purse-bid-set-march-24--114047|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Eleider Alvarez - Purse Bid Set For March 24 - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter Yvon Michel, stated on behalf of Álvarez, that he had averted from his mandatory position to allow Stevenson a voluntary defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/eleider-alvarez-steps-aside-to-allow-adonis-stevenson-another-voluntary-world-title-defence/|title=Eleider Alvarez steps aside to allow Adonis Stevenson another voluntary world title defence - Boxing News|date=2017-03-16|work=Boxing News|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, Stevenson revealed on social media that he had finalized a deal to fight [[Andrzej Fonfara]] (29-4, 17 KOs) in a rematch from their first fight in 2014. Yvon Michel later told ESPN that the fight would take place in Canada, at the [[Bell Centre|Centre Bell]] in Montreal Quebec on June 3, 2017. The last time Stevenson fought at that arena was in 2014 against Fonfara. Michel didn't go into detail around why a fight with [[Sean Monaghan]], who he was tipped to fight originally in New York, never materialized, but said, if he continues winning, the fight could still happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/19111255/light-heavyweight-world-champion-adonis-stevenson-face-andrzej-fonfara-rematch-june-3|title=Stevenson-Fonfara rematch set for June 3|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-vs-andrzej-fonfara-rematch-on-june-3--115420|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Andrzej Fonfara Rematch on June 3 - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fonfara started the fight well in round 1, connecting with the jab. Stevenson, who was patient with his left hand, eventually landed a left hook to the head of Fonfara, dropping him to the canvas. Fonfara beat the count, but was on steady legs and when he got backed up to in the corner, the bell saved him from an onslaught. Round 2 opened with Stevenson carrying on where he left of, pummeling Fonfara with huge lefts. The fight came to an abrupt end, when Fonfara's trainer, Virgil Hunter stepped up on the apron after just 28 seconds, motioning to the referee to stop the bout, which referee Michael Griffin did. Stevenson retained his WBC and Lineal world titles. When asked who Stevenson would fight next, he replied, "I'm the greatest at 175. I don't have to call out anybody," On the same card, Eleider Álvarez defeated Jean Pascal via majority decision to remain mandatory to Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-demolishes-andrzej-fonfara-two-results--117220|title=Adonis Stevenson Demolishes Andrzej Fonfara in Two Rounds - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/502038-adonis-stevenson-makes-quick-work-andrzej-fonfara-rematch/|title=Adonis Stevenson makes quick work of Andrzej Fonfara in rematch - The Ring|date=2017-06-03|work=The Ring|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/eleider-alvarez-decisions-jean-pascal-retain-mandatory-results--117218|title=Eleider Alvarez Decisions Jean Pascal To Retain Mandatory Spot - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stevenson vs. Jack====
After [[Badou Jack]] (21-1-3, 13 KOs) [[Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor|defeated Nathan Cleverly]] in August 2017, to win the WBA 'Regular' light heavyweight title, he began to call out Stevenson, knowing that Stevenson had a mandatory challenger. Stevenson shrugged it off, claiming he was ready for anyone, "It was a good performance. He beat Cleverly now. So now he called me out and I'm ready. I'm ready to fight and I'm ready to unify the title. For [[Andre Ward]] or him, I'm ready. It doesn't matter to me [which one]. It's great for me to unify and add another title to my collection.

On April 11, news broke out from Álvarez's manager, Stephane Lepine that a deal was yet to be reached with Álvarez to be properly compensated.

Kovalev was originally scheduled to fight contender [[Marcus Browne]] in the summer of 2018, however due to having been arrested for domestic violence, Kovalev's promoter, [[Kathy Duva]] of Main Events got in contact with Álvarez's manager Lepine about a potential fight. Due to Álvarez fighting Kovalev, this meant the announcement of Stevenson vs. Jack would be imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/kovalev-fight-eleider-alvarez-not-browne-date-venue-tba--127290|title=Kovalev To Fight Eleider Alvarez, Not Browne; Date, Venue TBA|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/sergey-kovalev-promoter-details-eleider-alvarez-deal--127301|title=Sergey Kovalev's Promoter Details The Eleider Alvarez Deal|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 23, the card was moved from Montreal and instead scheduled to take place at the [[Air Canada Centre|Air Canada Center]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/stevenson-vs-jack-now-heads-toronto-not-montreal--127475|title=Stevenson vs. Jack Now Heads To Toronto, Not Montreal|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, the official press conference was held to announce the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/photos-adonis-stevenson-badou-jack-face-face-montreal--127534|title=Photos: Adonis Stevenson, Badou Jack - Face To Face in Tortonto|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson and Jack fought to a majority draw in a competitive bout. One judge scored the fight 115-113 in favor of Jack, whilst the remaining two judges overruled the decision, scoring the fight 114-114. Stevenson outpointed Jack in the early rounds being more active, however from round 5, it was Jack who was the busier and accurate of the two. From rounds 7 through 10, Jack out landed Stevenson 114-40 in total shots landed. It was in round 10 were Jack was hurt from multiple body shots from Stevenson's right hand. Stevenson carried the momentum into round 11 but it was Jack who finished the fight stronger. In round 7, Stevenson complained to referee Ian John Lewis about low blows and in round 8, Jack was warned. Jack later explained Stevenson's cup was low, hence why the shots looked like low blows. With the draw, Stevenson retained his WBC and Lineal titles for the ninth time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/23551419/adonis-stevenson-fights-badou-jack-majority-draw-retains-light-heavyweight-title|title=Stevenson fades, keeps title with draw vs. Jack|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11379248/stevenson-vs-jack-adonis-stevenson-and-badou-jack-battle-to-a-majority-draw|title=Stevenson vs Jack: Adonis Stevenson and Badou Jack battle to a majority draw|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post fight interviews, Stevenson told Steve Gray, "I won the fight because I hurt him in the body. I hurt him in the body and he got slowed down. I kept the pressure on him. He was moving and moving – slick, slick – but I touched him more of the time and I think I won this fight." Speaking on the 3rd draw in his last 4 fights (before Bute was DQ'd for failed drug test), Jack stated, "I have no idea. It could be they're jealous of Floyd (Mayweather). I'm one of Floyd's top fighters. Maybe they don't like Floyd. Maybe they're trying to – you know, I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. I've gotta thank God for everything. … I can't do anything about it. I thought I definitely won the fight, definitely won the fight. Nobody's complaining and no judge had him winning." According to CompuBox Stats, Stevenson landed 165 of 622 punches thrown (27%), 87 of which where power shots landed to the body and Jack landed 209 of his 549 thrown (38%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-badou-jack-majority-draw-results--128325|title=Adonis Stevenson, Badou Jack Battle To a Majority Draw|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-vs-badou-jack-compubox-punch-stats--128346|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Badou Jack - CompuBox Punch Stats|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight averaged 535,000 viewers and peaked at 611,000 viewers on Showtime.

==== Stevenson vs. Gvozdyk ====
On June 18, 2018 the WBC ordered Stevenson to make a mandatory defence against interim champion [[Oleksandr Gvozdyk]] (15-0, 12 KOs). In case a deal could not be reached, purse bids were set for July 2, where the split of 65-35 would be in favour of Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/6/18/17475752/stevenson-vs-gvozdyk-ordered-by-wbc|title=Stevenson vs Gvozdyk ordered by WBC|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvon Michel of GYM won the rights to promote the fight with the winning bid of $2.1 million. He stated the fight was being targeted for November 3 in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingtalk.com/pag/article.php?aid=35322|title=BOXINGTALK : YVON MICHEL WINS STEVENSON-GVOZDYK PURSE BID; NOV. 3RD IS TARGET DATE|website=www.boxingtalk.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top Rank made a bid of $1.65 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/adonis-stevenson-vs-oleksandr-gvozdyk-eyed-november-3--129628|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Oleksandr Gvozdyk Eyed For November 3|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy surrounding the purse bids and claims of collusion by Top Rank. Initially, the bid was won by Phil Weiss, on behalf of Tom Brown's TGB Promotions, with the winning bid being $3.102 million. TGB Promotions were known for having close ties with Al Haymon, who was also the advisor of Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/7/3/17530312/top-rank-cries-collusion-on-stevenson-gvozdyk-purse-bid|title=Top Rank cries collusion on Stevenson-Gvozdyk purse bid|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports, the winning bid was withdrawn just minutes later. The next highest bidder, in this case Michel, automatically won the bid, winning the rights to the fight. The WBC stated they would look into the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/stevenson-vs-gvozdyk-michel-reacts-purse-bid-controversy--129659|title=Stevenson vs. Gvozdyk: Michel Reacts To Purse Bid Controversy|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, the WBC upheld the purse bid giving Michel the promotional rights, however also stated they would impose punishment on TGB promotions of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/7/6/17539880/wbc-upholds-stevenson-gvozdyk-purse-bid|title=WBC upholds Stevenson-Gvozdyk purse bid|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBC president tweeted the bout would take place on December 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2018/8/16/17703692/adonis-stevenson-vs-oleksandr-gvozdyk-set-for-december-1st-in-montreal|title=Adonis Stevenson vs. Oleksandr Gvozdyk set for December 1st in Montreal|work=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showtime confirmed they would televise the bout, which took place at the [[Videotron Centre]] in Quebec, before the [[Deontay Wilder]]-[[Tyson Fury]] PPV telecast begins, which would take place at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles.

Gvozdyk defeated Stevenson by an 11th round knockout, to take the title. Stevenson was transported to the hospital on a stretcher, where he was listed in critical condition but was upgraded to stable the next day.

==Personal life==
In 2012, in response to questioning at a press conference before a fight, Stevenson admitted to serving jail time in Bordeaux, Quebec on charges of managing prostitutes, assault, and making threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boxing|first=Phil|title=Boxer Adonis Stevenson admits criminal past after years of suspicion|url=http://philboxing.com/news/story-66524.html|work=The Philippine boxing Journal|publisher=philboxing.com|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson served four years in prison for these crimes and crimes that took place while in prison, and was released in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mma/news/20131218/fighter-of-year-boxing-adonis-stevenson/ SI.com 2013 Fighter of the Year: Adonis Stevenson – MMA – Chris Mannix]. sportsillustrated.cnn.com (2013-12-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agrippa''' ({{lang-el|Ἀγρίππας}}) was a [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] [[philosopher]] who probably lived towards the end of the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Jowett  | first = Benjamin  | author-link = Benjamin Jowett  | contribution = Agrippa (1)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 77  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0086.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is regarded as the author of "The Five Tropes (or Modes) of Agrippa"  ({{lang-el|τρόποι}}), which are purported to establish the impossibility of certain knowledge.

==The Five Tropes==
These ''tropes'' or "modes" are given by [[Sextus Empiricus]] in his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism''.  According to Sextus, they are attributed only "to the more recent skeptics" and it is by [[Diogenes Laertius]] that we attribute them to Agrippa.&lt;ref name="diog1"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The tropes are: 
 
# '''[[Dissent]]''' – The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.
# '''Progress [[ad infinitum]]''' – All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity.
# '''Relation''' – All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view.
# '''[[:wikt:assumption|Assumption]]''' – The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption.
# '''[[Begging the question|Circularity]]''' – The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs.

&lt;blockquote&gt; According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life and among philosophers.  Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule out anything, and we end up with [[Epoché|suspension of judgement]]. In the mode deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source, which itself needs another, and so ''ad infinitum'', so that we have no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgement on what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ''ad infinitum'', begin from something which they do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgement about both.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'' i., from Annas, J., ''Outlines of Scepticism'' [[Cambridge University Press]]. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With reference to these five tropes, that the first and third are a short summary of the earlier Ten Modes of [[Aenesidemus]].&lt;ref name="diog1"/&gt; The three additional ones show a progress in the Pyrrhonist system, building upon the objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion to more abstract and metaphysical grounds.

According to [[Victor Brochard]] “the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of skepticism that has ever been given.  In a sense, they are still irresistible today.”
&lt;ref&gt;Brochard, V., ''The Greek Skeptics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allometric shifts will increase the overall variation in one trait relative to the other breaking their typical correlation]]
'''Allometric engineering''' is the process of experimentally shifting the [[allometry|scaling relationships]], for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight [[covariance]] evident among component traits of a complex [[phenotype]] by altering the [[variance]] of one [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: &lt;math&gt; log(y) = mlog(x) + log(b) &lt;/math&gt;. Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept (''b''), slope (''m'') or both to create novel variants (see: [[Allometry]], for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire [[complex phenotype]], and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances.&lt;ref name=sinervo&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sinervo, B.  |author2=Huey, R. |year=1990 |title= Allometric Engineering: An Experimental Test of the Causes of Interpopulational Differences in Performance |pages= 1106–1109 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=248 |doi= 10.1126/science.248.4959.1106 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/pdfs/SinervoScience1.pdf |issue=4959 |pmid=17733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==

===Lack's hypothesis===
Allometric engineering has been used to test [[David Lack]]'s hypothesis in the lizard ''[[Sceloporus occidentalis]]''.&lt;ref name=sinervo/&gt; In this study, two populations were "engineered" to fit the morphology of the other by manipulating egg yolk quantity, removing effect of size difference between groups. After manipulation, they found that speed was inversely proportional to body size.

===Nature versus nurture===
Maternal investment was "allometrically engineered" by surgically removing an ovary in cockroaches (''[[Diploptera punctata]]'').&lt;ref name=Holbrook&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Holbrook, G.  |author2=Schal, C.|year=2004|title=Maternal investment affects offspring phenotypic plasticity in a viviparous cockroach |journal=PNAS |volume=101 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0400209101 |pmc=397435| issue=15 |pages=5595–5597 | pmid=15064397}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively reduced number of progeny and increased resource allocation to each offspring. They coupled this manipulation with group effects (faster development in large groups), and found that maternal investment can overcome group effect.

===Sexual selection===
The male [[long-tailed widowbird]] (''Euplectes progne'') has exceptionally long tail feathers roughly half a meter in length.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|author =Andersson, Malte|year=1982|title=Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird|doi=10.1038/299818a0|pages=818–820|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=299|issue=5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male tail feathers were cropped and glued and those with artificially enhanced tail lengths secured the most matings, demonstrating female preference.

===Natural selection===
The fly ''[[Zonosemata]] vittigera'' has a banding pattern on its wings that was found to mimic movements of a jumping spider. Greene ''et al.'' engineered novel phenotypes, breaking correlation between a behavior and morphology, by cutting and transplanting the wings of this fly with the common [[housefly]].&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greene, E. |author2=Orsak, L. |author3=Whitman, D. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=A Tephritid Fly Mimics the Territorial Displays of its Jumping Spider Predators |doi= 10.1126/science.236.4799.310 |pages= 310–312 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=236 |issue=4799 |pmid=17755555}} see: [[Tephritid fly]].&lt;/ref&gt; This manipulation demonstrated that it was behavior coupled with the banding pattern that deterred jumping spiders from attacking, though not other predators.

==Methods==
Current uses have involved truncation or cropping, yolk manipulation, hormonal treatments, maternal allocation, temperature manipulation, or altering the nutritional states.&lt;ref name=sinervo1&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sinervo, B. |year=1993 |title=The Effect of Offspring Size on Physiology and Life History |pages= 210–218 |volume=43 |issue=4 |jstor= 1312121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method undoubtedly has its merits and pitfalls to consider before designing an experiment, but these techniques are opening new avenues of research in comparative and evolutionary biology.

He pursued a career in medical examination and served, from 1930 to 1958, as the [[coroner]] with jurisdiction over much of London.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Robert |date=1963 |title=Coroner: the Biography of Sir Bentley Purchase |url= |location=London |publisher=[[George G.

==Biography==
Bentley Purchase's father, Sir William Henry Purchase of [[Luton, England|Luton]], was a successful importer of straw goods such as hats.  The family had means to enroll young Bentley in [[Sidney Sussex College]], Cambridge, where he pursued the liberal arts.  Graduating from Cambridge in 1911, Purchase studied law and entered medical studies at the [[London Hospital]], graduating in 1914.  Bentley was commissioned as a medical officer in the [[Royal Artillery]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1914-18, and was awarded the [[Military Cross]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;  

Upon the coming of peacetime Purchase continued his career pathway and resumed his interrupted legal and medical studies, becoming a barrister in the [[Inner Temple]] in 1919 and a Bachelor in Medicine in 1921.  He was now qualified to serve as a coroner with jurisdiction over cases that required the presence of a medical examiner.  He worked two part-time jobs in the 1920s, as a lawyer and as a deputy coroner within East London.  During this period he married Beryl Chapman, with whom he would have two children.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

In 1930, upon the retirement of the coroner Sir Walter Schröder, Bentley Purchase won appointment as a full-fledged coroner.  His jurisdiction shifted over different neighborhoods within London, but always included the broad area of dense population from the [[City of Westminster]] on the southwest to [[Islington]] toward the northeast.  Purchase served as an official coroner within London from 1930 until 1958, winding down in that year by moving his office from London to [[Ipswich, England|Ipswich]].  Purchase served in office as the Ipswich coroner until his death in 1961, which occurred by mishap.  Attempting to repair his [[television antenna]], the attorney-physician tumbled from the roof of his private home.  He was age 70.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==Significant cases==
As coroner, Purchase held approximately 20,000 inquests into deaths that, in his medico-legal judgement, deserved formal inquiry.  In cases where the cause of death was unknown or where inquiries were required to assist the police, Purchase worked closely with specialists in [[forensic pathology]] such as [[Bernard Spilsbury]] and [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]].&lt;ref name="Browne and Tullett"&gt;{{cite book |last=Browne |first=Douglas G., and Tullett, E.V. |date=1951 |title=Bernard Spilsbury: His Life and Cases |url= |location=London |publisher=[[George G. Harrap and Co.]] |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Murder cases inquired into by Purchase included homicides committed by [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] and [[John Haigh]].&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

Also as coroner, Purchase provided a corpse in 1943 for use in Operation Mincemeat.  The World War II special operation centered on the release in Spanish territorial waters of a body dressed in the uniform of a British marine officer-courier.  The body was supposed to be carrying top-secret planning documents in preparation for Anglo-American operations in the Mediterranean Sea.  As a [[counter-intelligence]] initiative, the operation pointed German military intelligence, the [[Abwehr]], toward locations far away from the Allies' [[Allied invasion of Sicily|true target of Sicily]].  The German armed forces did not take steps to establish tactical air command over Sicily at the time of the Allies' amphibious assault, and Operation Mincemeat is said to have saved thousands of lives.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
During his active life in London, Bentley Purchase was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1949.  Upon the winding-down of his responsibilities in 1958, he accepted a knighthood.  After his death in 1961, a friendly biography (Robert Jackson, ''Coroner: the Biography of Sir Bentley Purchase'', London: George G. Harrap and Co.), was published in 1963.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

'''Biostimulation''' involves the modification of the environment to stimulate existing [[bacteria]] capable of [[bioremediation]].  This can be done by addition of various forms of rate limiting [[nutrient]]s and [[electron acceptors]], such as [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], or [[carbon]] (e.g. in the form of [[molasses]]).  Alternatively, remediation of [[halogenated]] contaminants in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environments may be stimulated by adding [[electron donors]] (organic substrates), thus allowing indigenous [[microorganisms]] to use the halogenated contaminants as [[electron acceptors]].[https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Anaerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/ EPA Anaerobic Bioremediation Technologies] Additives are usually added to the subsurface through injection wells, although injection well technology for biostimulation purposes is still emerging.  Removal of the contaminated material is also an option, albeit an expensive one.  Biostimulation can be enhanced by [[bioaugmentation]].  This process, overall, is referred to as [[bioremediation]] and is an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-approved method for reversing the presence of oil or gas spills.  While biostimulation is usually associated with remediation of [[hydrocarbon]] or [[high production volume chemical]] spills, it is also potentially useful for treatment of less frequently encountered contaminant spills, such as [[pesticides]], particularly [[herbicides]].&lt;ref&gt;Kanissery, R.G., and G.K. Sims.  2011.  Biostimulation for the enhanced degradation of herbicides in soil. Applied and Environmental Soil Science. Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 843450, doi:10.1155/2011/843450. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2011/843450/&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary advantage of biostimulation is that bioremediation will be undertaken by already present native [[microorganisms]] that are well-suited to the subsurface environment, and are well distributed spatially within the subsurface.  The primary disadvantage is that the delivery of additives in a manner that allows the additives to be readily available to subsurface microorganisms is based on the local geology of the subsurface.  Tight, impermeable subsurface [[lithology]] (tight [[clay]]s or other fine-grained material) make it difficult to spread additives throughout the affected area.  Fractures in the subsurface create preferential pathways in the subsurface which additives preferentially follow, preventing even distribution of additives.

Recently a number of products have been introduced which allow popular use of bioremediation using biostimulative methods.  They may harness local bacteria using biostimulation by creating a hospitable environment for hydrocarbon-devouring microorganisms, or they may introduce foreign bacteria into the environment as a direct application to the hydrocarbon.  While the jury is out as to whether either is particularly more effective than the other, ''prima facie'' consideration suggests the introduction of foreign bacteria to any environment stands a chance of mutating organisms already present and affecting the biome.

Investigations to determine subsurface characteristics (such as natural [[groundwater]] velocity during ambient conditions, [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the subsurface, and lithology of the subsurface) are important in developing a successful biostimulation system.  In addition, a pilot-scale study of the potential biostimulation system should be undertaken prior to full-scale design and implementation.

However, some biostimulative agents may be used in chaotic surfaces such as open water and sand so long as they are [oleophilic], meaning that they [[Chemical bond|bond]] exclusively to hydrocarbons, and basically sink in the [[water column]], bonding to oil, where they then float to the water's surface, exposing the hydrocarbon to more abundant [[sunlight]] and [[oxygen]] where greater micro-organic [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] activity can be encouraged.  Some consumer-targeted biostimulants bond possess this quality, others do not.

'''Biting''' is a common behavior which involves the opening and closing of the [[jaw]] found in many animals. This behavior is found in [[Reptile|reptiles]], [[Mammal|mammals]], [[fish]] and [[Amphibian|amphibians]]. [[Arthropod|Arthropods]] can also bite. Biting is a physical action in an attack but it is also a normal activity or response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes [[Parasitism|ectoparasites]] from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratches itself, and grooms other animals and for defense. Animal bites often result in serious infections and death.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases – Animal and Human Bites, Morven S.

Biting is also an [[age appropriate]] [[behavior]] and reaction for human children 30 months and younger. Conversely, children above this age are expected to have verbal skills to explain their needs and dislikes, as biting is not seen as age appropriate. Biting may be prevented by methods including redirection, change in the environment and responding to biting by talking about appropriate ways to express anger and frustration. School age children, those older than 30 months, who habitually bite may require professional intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Child Care Links,"[http://www.childcarelinks.org/fyi/fyi_pdf/HOW%20TO%20HANDLE%20BITING.pdf How to Handle Biting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007012046/http://www.childcarelinks.org/fyi/fyi_pdf/HOW%20TO%20HANDLE%20BITING.pdf|date=October 7, 2011}}", retrieved 14 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Some discussion of human biting appears in ''[[Kinsey Reports#Biting|The Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''.

'''Elizabeth Short''' (July 29, 1924 – January 14 or 15, 1947), known posthumously as the "'''Black Dahlia'''", was an American woman who was found murdered in the [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles|Leimert Park]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], California. Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which included her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist.

A native of [[Boston]], Short spent her early life in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Florida]] before relocating to California, where her father lived. It is commonly held that Short was an aspiring [[actor|actress]], though she had no known acting credits or jobs during her time in Los Angeles. She would acquire the nickname of the Black Dahlia posthumously (after the owner of a drugstore in Long Beach, California told reporters that male customers had that name for her), as newspapers of the period often nicknamed particularly lurid crimes; the term may have originated from a [[film noir]] murder mystery, ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'', released in April 1946.&lt;!-- There is no substantiated evidence that Elizabeth Short was known as the Black Dahlia during her lifetime. --&gt; After the discovery of her body on January 15, 1947, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] began an extensive investigation that produced over [[Black Dahlia suspects|150 suspects]], but yielded no arrests.

Short's [[List of unsolved deaths|unsolved murder]] and the details surrounding it have had a lasting cultural intrigue, generating various theories and public speculation. Her life and death have been the basis of numerous books and films, and her murder is frequently cited as one of the most famous unsolved murders in American history,&lt;!--See "In popular culture" section for references--&gt; as well as one of the oldest unsolved cases in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=9}} It has likewise been credited by historians as one of the first major crimes in post-[[World War II]] America to capture national attention.{{efn|Crime historian Dirk Gibson cited Short's murder as one of the first majorly-publicized murders to "grip" the nation's attention after World War II,{{sfn|Gibson|2004|p=191}} while in her work ''American Murder'', [[Gini Graham Scott]] likens the case to the majorly-publicized [[O.J. Simpson]] [[O. J. Simpson murder case|murder trial]] in the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=106}}}}

Troubled by [[bronchitis]] and severe [[asthma]] attacks, Short underwent [[Cardiothoracic surgery|lung surgery]] at age 15, after which doctors suggested she relocate to a milder climate during the winter months to prevent further respiratory problems.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=19}} Short's mother then sent her to spend winters in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] with family friends.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|pages=19–20}} During the next three years, Short lived in Florida during the winter months and spent the rest of the year in Medford with her mother and sisters.

[[File:Matt Gordon, Flying Tiger c. 1943.jpg|thumb|left|upright|160px|Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr.]]
In late 1942, Phoebe received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in [[California]].{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=20}} In December, at age 18, Elizabeth relocated to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] to live with her father, whom she had not seen since she was six years old.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=23}} At the time, he was working at the nearby [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] on [[San Francisco Bay]]. Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=25}} Shortly after, she took a job at the [[Base Exchange]] at Camp Cooke (now [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]), near [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]], living with several friends, and briefly with an [[U.S. Army Air Force|Army Air Force]] sergeant who reportedly abused her.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=25}} Short left Lompoc in mid-1943 and moved to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], where she was arrested on September 23, 1943 for [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]] at a local bar.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=186}} The juvenile authorities sent her back to Medford,{{efn|In the mid-twentieth century in the United States, juvenile courts considered individuals [[minor (law)|minor]]s until the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/What-is-the-Age.html|work=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]|title=What is the Age of Responsibility?|author=Greenblatt, Alan|date=September 30, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2017|quote=Arbitrary as such reasoning may sound to modern Americans, 21 stuck as a threshold age through the 19th century and into the 20th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=29}}}} but she returned instead to Florida, making only occasional visits to Massachusetts.{{sfn|Haugen|2010|pages=29–31}}

While in Florida, Short met [[Major (United States)|Major]] Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr., a decorated Army Air Force officer at the [[352d Special Operations Wing|2nd Air Commando Group]]. He was training for deployment to the [[China Burma India Theater|China Burma India Theater of Operations]] of [[World War II]]. Short told friends that Gordon had written to propose marriage while he was recovering from injuries from a plane crash in [[India]].{{sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=30}} She accepted his offer, but Gordon died in a second crash on August 10, 1945, less than a week before the [[Surrender of Japan]] ended the war.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=188}}

She relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in July 1946 to visit Army Air Force [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Gordon Fickling, whom she had known from Florida.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=113}} Fickling was stationed at the [[Long Beach Airport#Military use|Naval Reserve Air Base]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].{{Sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=118}} Short spent the last six months of her life in [[Southern California]], mostly in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles area]]; shortly before her death, she had been working as a waitress, and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on [[Hollywood Boulevard]].{{Sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} Short has been variously described and depicted as an aspiring or "would-be" actress.{{sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=140}} According to some sources, she did in fact have aspirations to be a film star,{{sfn|Haugen|2010|pages=19, 23}} though she had no known acting jobs or credits.{{efn|Short is often referred to or characterized as an aspiring actress,{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=2–5}}{{sfn|Haugen|2010|p=19}} though she had no known acting jobs or credits to her name.}}

==Murder==
===Prior to murder===
On January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to [[San Diego]] with Robert "Red" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] located at 506 South [[Grand Avenue (Los Angeles)|Grand Avenue]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone.{{efn|Gini Graham Scott states in ''American Crime'' that Short was sighted at the Biltmore on January 9,{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} though a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article published in 1997 calls into question the validity of this, noting that mention of the Biltmore sighting "cannot be found in heated news accounts of the day, which reported on every conceivable contact anyone had with Short in the so-called 'missing week' before her death".&lt;ref name=harnisch/&gt;}} Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} away from the Biltmore Hotel.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}}

===Discovery===
[[File:Elizabeth Short body.png|thumb|right|upright|Short's body as discovered on January 15, 1947]]
On the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body was found severed in two pieces on a [[vacant lot]] on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at {{coord|34.0164| -118.333|region:US_scale:10000|display=inline}}) in [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles|Leimert Park]], Los Angeles.

In ''Severed'', John Gilmore writes that Short allegedly plugged her cavities with wax, and this supposed fact was reprinted (albeit with pointed skepticism) in a 1997 ''Los Angeles Times'' article.&lt;ref name=harnisch/&gt;}} There were ligature marks on her ankles, wrists, and neck, and an "irregular laceration with superficial tissue loss" on her right breast.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=45}} Newbarr also noted superficial lacerations on the right forearm, left upper arm, and the lower left side of the chest.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=45}}

The body had been cut completely in half between the second and third [[lumbar vertebrae]], thus severing the intestine at the [[duodenum]]. Newbarr's report noted "very little" [[ecchymosis]] (bruising) along the incision line, suggesting it had been performed after death.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=46}} Another "gaping laceration" measuring {{convert|4.25|in|mm}} in length ran longitudinally from the [[navel|umbilicus]] to the [[Hypogastrium|suprapubic region]].{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=46}} The lacerations on each side of the face, which extended from the corners of the lips, were measured at {{convert|3|in|mm}} on the right side of the face, and {{convert|2.5|in|mm}} on the left.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=45}} The skull was not fractured, but there was noted bruising on the front and right side of her scalp, with a small amount of bleeding in the [[subarachnoid space]] on the right side, consistent with blows to the head.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=45}} The cause of death was determined to be [[hemorrhaging]] from the lacerations to her face and the shock from blows on the head and face.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=138}} Newbarr noted that Short's [[anal canal]] was dilated at {{convert|1.75|in|mm}}, suggesting that she may have been [[Rape#Genital injuries|raped]].{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=46}} Samples were taken from her body testing for the presence of [[sperm]], but the results came back negative.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=124–5}}

Prior to the autopsy, police had quickly been able to identify the victim as Short after sending copies of her fingerprints to [[Washington, D.C.]] via Soundphoto, a primitive [[fax machine]] of the era; the prints matched those given by Short during her 1943 arrest.{{sfn|U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation|2008|p=43}} Immediately following Short's identification, reporters from [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' contacted her mother, Phoebe Short, in Boston, and told her that her daughter had won a [[beauty pageant|beauty contest]].{{sfn|Haugen|2010|pages=11–12}}&lt;ref name=bbc17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38513320|work=BBC|title=The Black Dahlia: Los Angeles' most famous unsolved murder|date=January 8, 2017|accessdate=September 11, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912090521/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38513320|archivedate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after prying as much personal information as they could from Phoebe that the reporters revealed that her daughter had in fact been murdered.&lt;ref name=bbc17/&gt; The newspaper offered to pay her airfare and accommodations if she would travel to Los Angeles to help with the police investigation. That was yet another ploy since the newspaper kept her away from police and other reporters to protect its [[scoop (news)|scoop]].{{sfn|Haugen|2010|pages=9–12}} The ''Examiner'' and another Hearst newspaper, the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', later [[sensationalism|sensationalized]] the case, with one article from the ''Examiner'' describing the black tailored suit Short was last seen wearing as "a tight skirt and a [[sheer fabric|sheer]] blouse".&lt;ref name=torture&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Torture Slaying Victim Identified by Examiner, FBI|date=January 17, 1947|work=Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media nicknamed her as the "Black Dahlia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Harnisch, Larry|date=November 1, 1999 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/01/local/me-28619|title=A Crossroads of Murder and Myth in Hollywood | accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described her as an "adventuress" who "prowled Hollywood Boulevard". Additional newspaper reports, such as one published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on January 17, deemed the murder a "sex fiend slaying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 17, 1947|title=Sex Fiend Slaying Victim Identified by Fingerprint Records of F.B.I.|page=2}} [http://blackdahlia.web.unc.edu/becoming-the-black-dahlia/ Scans] available at [http://blackdahlia.web.unc.edu ''The Black Dahlia''] historical archive from the University of North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
===Initial investigation===
====Letters and interviews====
On January 21, 1947,{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=189}} a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the ''Examiner'', congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case, and stated he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} Additionally, the caller told Richardson to "expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail".{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}}

[[File:Black Dahlia letter to Los Angeles Examiner.png|thumb|right|upright=1|Envelope addressed to the ''Los Angeles Examiner'' from the alleged murderer]]
On January 24, a suspicious manila envelope was discovered by a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] worker: The envelope had been addressed to "The ''Los Angeles Examiner'' and other Los Angeles papers" with individual words that had been cut-and-pasted from newspaper clippings; additionally, a large message on the face of the envelope read: "Here is Dahlia's belongings [,] letter to follow".{{Sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} The envelope contained Short's [[birth certificate]], business cards, photographs, names written on pieces of paper, and an address book with the name Mark Hansen embossed on the cover.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=165–9}} The packet had been carefully cleaned with [[gasoline]], similarly to Short's body, which led police to suspect the packet had been sent directly by her killer.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=167-8}} Despite the efforts to clean the packet, several partial fingerprints were lifted from the envelope and sent to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for testing; however, the prints were compromised in transit and thus could not be properly analyzed.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}} The same day the packet was received by the ''Examiner'', a handbag and a black suede shoe were reported to have been seen on top of a garbage can in an alley a short distance from Norton Avenue, {{convert|2|mi|km}} from where Short's body had been discovered. The items were recovered by police, but they had also been wiped clean with gasoline, destroying any fingerprints.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=222}}

Police quickly deemed Mark Hansen, the owner of the address book found in the packet, a suspect.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=148–50}} Hansen was a wealthy local nightclub and theater owner&lt;ref name=Rolling/&gt; and an acquaintance at whose home Short had stayed with friends,{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=169}} and according to some sources,{{efn|Janice Knowlton claims that it was Robert Manley who identified the items as belonging to Short,{{sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=30}} while Cathy Scott states that it was Hansen.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}}}} he also confirmed that the purse and shoe discovered in the alley were in fact Short's.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=221}} [[Ann Toth]], Short's friend and roommate, told investigators that Short had recently rejected sexual advances from Hansen, and suggested it as potential cause for him to kill her;{{Sfn|Scott|2017|p=222}} however, he was cleared of suspicion in the case.{{Sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}} In addition to Hansen, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] interviewed over 150 men in the ensuing weeks whom they believed to be potential suspects.{{sfn|Scott|2017|pages=222–3}} Manley, who had been one of the last people to see Short alive, was also investigated, but was cleared of suspicion after passing numerous [[polygraph]] examinations.{{sfn|Scott|2017|p=222}} Police also interviewed several persons found listed in Hansen's address book, including Martin Lewis, who had been an acquaintance of Short's.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=149}} Lewis was able to provide an [[alibi]] for the date of Short's murder, as he was in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] visiting his father-in-law, who was dying of kidney failure.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=150}}

A total of 750 investigators from the LAPD and other departments worked on the case during its initial stages, including 400 sheriff's deputies and 250 [[California Highway Patrol|California State Patrol]] officers.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}}{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=139}} Various locations were searched for potential evidence, including storm drains throughout Los Angeles, abandoned structures, and various sites along the [[Los Angeles River]], but the searches yielded no further evidence.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=139}} [[Los Angeles City Council|City Councilman]] Lloyd G. Davis posted a $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1947|fmt=eq}}) reward for information leading police to Short's killer.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=140}} After the announcement of the reward, various persons came forward with [[#Suspects and confessions|confessions]], most of which police dismissed as false. Several of the false confessors were charged with [[obstruction of justice]].{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=141}}

====Media response; decline====
On January 26, another letter was received by the ''Examiner'', this time handwritten, which read: "Here it is. Turning in Wed., Jan. 29, 10 am. Had my fun at police. Black Dahlia Avenger".{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}} The letter also named a location at which the supposed killer would turn himself in. Police waited at the location on the morning of January 29, but the alleged killer did not appear.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}} Instead, at 1:00pm, the ''Examiner'' offices received another cut-and-pasted letter, which read: "Have changed my mind. You would not give me a square deal. Dahlia killing was justified."{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=47}}

The graphic nature of the crime and the subsequent letters received by the ''Examiner'' had resulted in a media frenzy surrounding Short's murder.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=134}} Both local and national publications covered the story heavily, many of which reprinted sensationalistic reports suggesting that Short had been [[torture]]d for hours prior to her death; the information, however, was false, yet police allowed the reports to circulate so as to conceal Short's true cause of death—[[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral hemorrhage]]—from the public.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}} Further reports about Short's personal life were publicized, including details about her alleged declining of Hansen's romantic advances; additionally, a [[stripper]] who was an acquaintance of Short's told police that she "liked to get guys worked up over her, but she'd leave them hanging dry."{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=154}} This led some reporters (namely the ''Herald-Express''{{'}}s Bevo Means) and detectives to look into the possibility that Short was a [[lesbian]], and begin questioning employees and patrons of [[gay bar]]s in Los Angeles; this claim, however, remained unsubstantiated.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}}{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=141}} The ''Herald-Express'' also received several letters from the purported killer, again made with cut-and-pasted clippings, one of which read: "I will give up on Dahlia killing if I get 10 years. Don't try to find me."{{sfn|Hodel|Pezzullo|2009|pages=28–9}}

On February 1, the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' reported that the case had "run into a Stone Wall", with no new leads for investigators to pursue.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}} The ''Examiner'' continued to run stories on the murder and the investigation, which was front-page news for 35 days following the discovery of the body.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=185}} When interviewed, lead investigator Captain Jack Donahue told the press that he believed Short's murder had taken place in a remote building or shack on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and her body transported into the city where it was disposed of.{{Sfn|Scott|2007|p=114}} Based on the precise cuts and dissection of Short's corpse, the LAPD looked into the possibility that the murderer may have been a surgeon, doctor, or someone with medical knowledge. In mid-February 1947, the LAPD served a warrant to the [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|University of Southern California Medical School]], which was located near the site where Short's body had been discovered, requesting a complete list of the program's students.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}} The university agreed so long as the students' identities remained private, and background checks were conducted, but they yielded no results.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}}

By the spring of 1947, Short's murder had become a [[cold case]] with few new leads.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=114}} Sergeant Finis Brown, one of the lead detectives on the case, blamed the press for compromising the investigation through reporters' probing of details and unverified reporting.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=173}} In September 1949, a [[grand jury]] convened to discuss inadequacies in the LAPD's homicide unit based on their failure to solve numerous murders—especially those of women and children—in the past several years, Short's being one of them.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=170–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]|date=September 7, 1949|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=MT19490907.2.43|work=Madera Daily News-Tribune|title=LA Grand Jury Sifts Unsolved 'Black Dahlia' Type Murders|page=2|number=55}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the grand jury, further investigation was done on Short's past, with detectives tracing her movements between Massachusetts, California, and Florida, and also interviewed people who knew her in [[Texas]] and [[New Orleans]]. However, the interviews yielded no useful information in the murder.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=173}}

==Suspects and confessions==
{{Main|Black Dahlia suspects}}

The notoriety of Short's murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed [[false confession|false]]. During the initial investigation into her murder, police received a total of 60 confessions, most made by men.&lt;ref name=bray&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3652732/Hell-someones-cut-this-girl-in-half.html|work=The Telegraph|title='Hell, someone's cut this girl in half!'|author=Bray, Christopher|date=June 3, 2006|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom had not even been born at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-25/news/mn-51081_1_false-confession|work=Los Angeles Times|title=False Confessions and Tips Still Flow in Simpson Case|date=March 25, 1996|author=Corwin, Miles|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant [[John P. St. John (detective)|John P. St. John]], a detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, "It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer."{{sfn|Repetto|2013|p=154}}

In 2003, Ralph Asdel, one of the original detectives on the case, told the ''Times'' that he believed he had interviewed Short's killer, a man who had been seen with his sedan parked near the vacant lot where her body was discovered in the early morning hours of January 15, 1947. A neighbor driving by that day stopped to dispose of a bag of lawn clippings in the vacant lot when he saw a parked sedan, allegedly with its right rear door open; the driver of the sedan was standing in the lot. His arrival apparently startled the owner of the sedan, who approached his car and peered in the window before returning to the sedan and driving away.&lt;ref name=asdel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/09/local/me-asdel9|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Ralph Asdel, 82; Detective in the Black Dahlia Case|date=January 9, 2003|accessdate=September 15, 2017|author=McLellan, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the sedan was followed to a local restaurant where he worked, but was ultimately cleared of suspicion.&lt;ref name=asdel/&gt;

==Theories and potentially related crimes==

Several crime authors, as well as Cleveland detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the [[Cleveland Torso Murderer|Cleveland Torso Murders]], which took place in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] between 1934 and 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bardsley |first=Marilyn |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/unsolved/kingsbury/index_1.html |title=The Cleveland Torso Murders aka Kingsbury Run Murders - Eliot Ness Case |work= Crime Library |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724184549/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/unsolved/kingsbury/index_1.html |archivedate=July 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nickel|2001|pages=189–90}} As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any relationship between the two cases. In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson (a.k.a. Arnold Smith), was investigated by Detective St. John in relation to Short's murder. He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson for Short's murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|pages= 80–97}} The possible connection between Short's murder and the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the [[NBC]] series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' in 1992, in which [[Eliot Ness]] biographer [[Oscar Fraley]] suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases.&lt;ref name=um&gt;{{cite episode|series=[[Unsolved Mysteries]]|date=December 9, 1992|network=Lifetime|title=Black Dahlia &amp; Torso Slayer|publisher=Cosgrove-Meurer Productions|season=5|number=13|url=https://unsolved.com/gallery/black-dahlia-torso-slayer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February 10, 1947 murder of Jeanne French in Los Angeles was also considered by the media and detectives as possibly being connected to Short's killing.&lt;ref name=meares&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/in-1947-a-month-after-the-black-dahlia-the-lipstick-murder-shocked-la-7759115|work=LA Weekly|title=In 1947, a Month After the Black Dahlia, the 'Lipstick Murder' Shocked L.A.|author=Meares, Hadley|date=January 4, 2017|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French's body was discovered in west Los Angeles on Grand View Boulevard, nude and badly beaten.&lt;ref name=meares/&gt; Written on her stomach in lipstick was what appeared to say "Fuck You B.D.", and the letters "TEX" below.&lt;ref name=meares/&gt; The ''Herald-Express'' covered the story heavily, and drew comparisons to the Short murder less than a month prior, surmising the initials "B.D." to stand for "Black Dahlia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Herald-Express|date=February 10, 1947|page=1|volume=LXXVI|number=198|title=Werewolf Strikes Again!

Woman, Writes B.D. on Her Body}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Jon Lewis, however, the scrawling actually read "P.D.", ostensibly standing for "police department".{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=38}}

Crime authors such as Steve Hodel (son of George Hill Hodel) and William Rasmussen have suggested a link between the Short murder and the 1946 murder and dismemberment of six-year-old Suzanne Degnan in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/avenger_book_review.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109033336/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/avenger_book_review.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 9, 2010 |title=The Black Dahlia: The Unsolved Murder of Elizabeth Short — Black Dahlia Intro — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date=April 11, 2003 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Donahoe of the LAPD stated publicly that he believed the Black Dahlia and the Chicago [[William Heirens|Lipstick Murders]] were "likely connected".{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|p=101}} Among the evidence cited is the fact that Short's body was found on Norton Avenue, three blocks west of Degnan Boulevard, Degnan being the last name of the girl from Chicago. There were also striking similarities between the handwriting on the Degnan ransom note and that of the "Black Dahlia Avenger". Both texts used a combination of capitals and small letters (the Degnan note read in part "BuRN This FoR heR SAfTY" [sic]), and both notes contain a similar misshapen letter P and have one word that matches exactly.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|p=122}} Convicted [[serial killer]] [[William Heirens]] served life in prison for Degnan's murder. Initially arrested at 17 for breaking into a residence close to that of Degnan, Heirens claimed he was [[torture]]d by police, [[forced confession|forced to confess]], and made a [[scapegoat]] for the murder.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2005|pages= 48–70}} After being taken from the medical infirmary at the Dixon Correctional Center on February 26, 2012 for health problems, Heirens died at the [[University of Illinois Medical Center]] on March 5, 2012, at 83.

Additionally, Steve Hodel has implicated his father, George Hodel, as Short's killer, citing his father's training as a [[surgeon]] as circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name=fitts/&gt; In 2003, it was revealed in notes from the 1949 grand jury report that investigators had [[Telephone tapping|wiretapped]] Hodel's home, and obtained recorded conversation of him with an unidentified visitor, saying: "Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary because she's dead."&lt;ref name=dance/&gt;

In 1991, Janice Knowlton, a woman who was ten years old at the time of Short's murder, claimed that she witnessed her father, George Knowlton, beat Short to death with a clawhammer in the detached garage of her family's home in [[Westminster, California|Westminster]].{{sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=147, 244}} She also published a book titled ''Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer'' in 1995, in which she made additional claims that her father [[sexual abuse|sexually molested]] her.{{sfn|Knowlton|Newton|1995|p=3}} The book was condemned as "trash" by Knowlton's stepsister Jolane Emerson in 2004, who stated: "She believed it, but it wasn't reality. I know, because I lived with her father for sixteen years."&lt;ref name=trash/&gt; Additionally, Detective St. John told the ''Times'' that Knowlton's claims were "not consistent with the facts of the case".&lt;ref name=trash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/19/local/me-knowlton19|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2004|accessdate=September 16, 2017|title=Janice Knowlton, 67; Believed That Her Father Killed the Black Dahlia|author=McLellan, Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gilmore (writer)|John Gilmore]]'s 1994 book ''[[Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder]]'', suggests a possible connection between Short's murder and that of [[Georgette Bauerdorf]], a socialite who was strangled to death in her [[West Hollywood]] home in 1944.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=152–9}} Gilmore suggests that Short's employment at the [[Hollywood Canteen]], where Bauerdorf also worked as a hostess, could be a potential connection between the two women.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=152–9}} However, the claim that Short ever worked at the Hollywood Canteen has been disputed by others, such as the retired ''Times'' copyeditor Larry Harnisch (see ''[[#Rumors and factual disputes|Rumors and factual disputes]]'').

The 2017 book ''Black Dahlia, Red Rose'' by Piu Eatwell focuses on Leslie Dillon, a [[bellhop]] who was a former [[mortician]]'s assistant; his associates Mark Hansen and Jeff Connors; and Sergeant Finis Brown, a lead detective who had links to Hansen and was allegedly [[police corruption|corrupt]].&lt;ref name=Rolling/&gt; Eatwell posits that Short was murdered because she knew too much about the men's involvement in a scheme for robbing hotels. She further suggests that Short was killed at the Aster Motel in Los Angeles, where the owners reported finding one of their rooms "covered in blood and fecal matter" on the morning Short's body was found.&lt;ref name=Rolling/&gt; The ''Examiner'' stated in 1949 that LA Police Chief WIlliam A. Worton denied that the Flower Street [Aster] Motel had anything to do with the case, although its rival newspaper, the ''Los Angeles Herald'', claimed that the murder took place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Examiner|date=December 7, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eatwell is working on a television documentary, and a revised edition of her book is due to be released in the autumn of 2018.

In 2000, Buz Williams, a retired detective with the Long Beach Police Department, wrote an article for the LBPD newsletter ''The Rap Sheet'' on Short's murder. Williams' father, Richard F. Williams, and his friend, Con Keller, were both members of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case. Williams Sr believed that Dillon was the killer, and that when Dillon returned to his home state of [[Oklahoma]], he was able to avoid [[extradition]] to California because his ex-wife Georgia Stevenson was [[second cousin]]s with [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[Adlai Stevenson II]] of [[Illinois]], who contacted the [[governor of Oklahoma]] on Dillon's behalf. Keller believed Hansen was the killer, as he had studied at a surgical school in [[Sweden]] and had thrown elaborate parties attended by prominent LAPD officials. Williams' article says that Dillon sued the LAPD for $3 million, but that the suit was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Rap Sheet (Long Beach Police Department)|date=2000|pages=16, 17, 32, 33, 34, 35|title=The Second Black Dahlia Investigation, Parts 1, 2, and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harnisch disputes this, claiming that Dillon was cleared by police after an exhaustive investigation, and that the [[District Attorney]]'s files positively placed him in [[San Francisco]] when Short was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ladailymirror.com/2017/12/22/black-dahlia-5-reasons-leslie-dillon-didnt-kill-elizabeth-short/|title=The Daily Mirror|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harnisch claims that there was no LAPD coverup, and that Dillon did in fact receive a financial settlement from the City of Los Angeles, but has not produced concrete evidence to prove this.&lt;ref name="The Daily Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ladailymirror.com/2017/09/10/black-dahlia-piu-eatwells-black-dahlia-red-rose-exhumes-leslie-dillon/|title=The Daily Mirror|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rumors and factual disputes==
Numerous details regarding Short's personal life and death have been points of public dispute.{{efn|Varying claims about Short's life leading up to her death—including such claims that she was a prostitute, among other things—have been alleged and refuted by different sources.{{sfn|Nickel|2001|p=289}}&lt;ref name=fitts/&gt; A 2016 article in the ''New York Daily News'' highlights the "Black Dahlia" name and Short's whereabouts from January 9–15, 1947 as key points of contention and intrigue.&lt;ref name=harnisch&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Harnisch|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-06/news/mn-15889_1_black-dahlia|title=A Slaying Cloaked in Mystery and Myths|date=January 6, 1997|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blakinger/&gt;}} The eager involvement of both the public and press in solving her murder have been credited as factors that complicated the investigation significantly, resulting in a complex, sometimes inconsistent narrative of events.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=111}} According to Anne Marie DiStefano of the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'', many "unsubstantiated stories" have circulated about Short over the years: "She was a [[prostitute]], she was frigid, she was pregnant, she was a lesbian. And somehow, instead of fading away over time, the legend of the Black Dahlia just keeps getting more convoluted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=102369|work=Portland Tribune|publisher=Pamplin Media Group|title=The Dahlia, divined|date=September 11, 2006|accessdate=September 12, 2017|author=DiStefano, Anne Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harnisch has refuted several supposed rumors and popular conceptions about Short and her murder and also disputed the validity of Gilmore's book ''Severed'', claiming the book is "25% mistakes, and 50% fiction".&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; Harnisch also had examined the district attorney's files (he claimed that Steve Hodel has examined some of them pertaining to his father, along with ''Times'' columnist Steve Lopez) and contrary to Eatwell's claims, the files showed that Dillon was thoroughly investigated and was determined to have been in San Francisco when Short was killed. Harnisch speculated that Eatwell either did not find these files or she chose to ignore them.&lt;ref name="The Daily Mirror"/&gt;

===Murder and state of the body===
A number of people, none of whom knew Short, contacted police and the newspapers and claimed to have seen her during her so-called "missing week", between her January 9 disappearance and the discovery of her body, on January 15. Police and DA investigators ruled out each alleged sighting; in some cases, those interviewed were identifying other women whom they had mistaken for Short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527024802/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=2|url=http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=2|title=Excerpts From Grand Jury Summary|work= BlackDahlia website|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archivedate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short's whereabouts in the days leading up to her murder and the discovery of her body are unknown.&lt;ref name=blakinger/&gt;

After the discovery of Short's body, numerous Los Angeles newspapers printed headlines claiming she had been tortured leading up to her death.&lt;ref name=torture/&gt; This was denied by law enforcement at the time, but they allowed the claims to circulate so as to keep Short's actual cause of death a secret from the public.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=113}} Some sources, such as Oliver Cyriax's ''Crime: An Encyclopedia'' (1993), state that Short's body was covered in [[cigarette]] burns inflicted on her while she was still alive,{{sfn|Cyriax|1993|p=123}} though there is no indication of this in her official autopsy report.{{sfn|Newton|2009|pages=44–6}}

In ''Severed'', Gilmore states that the coroner who performed Short's autopsy suggested in conversation that she had been forced to consume [[feces]] based on his findings when examining the contents of her stomach.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=125}} This claim has been denied by Harnisch&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; and is also not indicated in Short's official autopsy,{{sfn|Newton|2009|pages=44–6}} though it has been reprinted in several print{{sfn|Chancellor|Graham|2016|p=59}} and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/tortured-hacked-half-drained-blood-11161233|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|title=Tortured, hacked in half and drained of blood: Horrific Black Dahlia murder mystery is finally 'solved' 70 years on|author=Carter, Claire|date=September 14, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Black Dahlia" name===
[[File:Lake-ladd-trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Some sources attribute the Black Dahlia name to the 1946 [[film noir]] ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'', starring [[Veronica Lake]] and [[Alan Ladd]] (pictured)&lt;ref name=summers/&gt;]]
According to newspaper reports shortly after the murder, Short received the nickname "Black [[Dahlia]]" from staff and patrons at a Long Beach drugstore in mid-1946 as wordplay on the film ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946).&lt;ref name=summers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5294114.stm|work=[[BBC]]|date=August 31, 2006|title=The enduring legend of Black Dahlia|author=Summers, Chris|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hare|2004|p=212}} Other popularly-circulated rumors claim that the media crafted the name due to Short's adorning her hair with [[dahlia]]s.&lt;ref name=blakinger/&gt;

However, reports by DA investigators state that the nickname was invented by newspaper reporters covering her murder; ''Herald-Express'' reporter Bevo Means, who interviewed Short's acquaintances at the drugstore, has been credited with first using the "Black Dahlia" name,{{sfn|Mancall|2013|p=39}} though reporters Underwood and [[Jack Smith (columnist)|Jack Smith]] have been alternately named as its creators.&lt;ref name=blakinger/&gt; While some sources claim that Short was referred to or went by the name during her life, others dispute this.{{efn|Harnisch claims that Short went by the "Black Dahlia" name in life, while other sources, such as a 2016 ''New York Daily News'' article, dispute this claim.&lt;ref name=blakinger/&gt; Some sources, however, still claim that Short went by the name in her life.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=44}}}} Both Gilmore{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=15, 56}} and Harnisch agree that the name originated during Short's lifetime and was not a creation of the press: Harnisch states that it was in fact a nickname she earned from the staff of the Long Beach drugstore she frequented;&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; in ''Severed'', Gilmore names an A.L. Landers as the proprietor of the drugstore, though he does not provide the store's name.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=56}} Prior to the circulation of the "Black Dahlia" name, Short's killing had been dubbed the "Werewolf Murder" by the ''Herald-Express'' due to the brutal nature of the crime.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=139}}&lt;ref name=blakinger&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/don-black-dahlia-article-1.2498088|work=New York Daily News|title=Nearly 70 years after her murder, here are the things we still don't know about Black Dahlia |date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=September 10, 2017|author=Blakinger, Keri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged prostitution and sexual history===
Many [[true crime]] books claim that Short lived in or visited Los Angeles at various times in the mid-1940s, including Gilmore's ''Severed'', which claims she worked at the [[Hollywood Canteen]]. This is disputed by Harnisch, who states that Short did not, in fact, live in Los Angeles until after the canteen's closing in 1945.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; Although some of her acquaintances and several authors and journalists described Short as a prostitute or [[call girl]] during her time in Los Angeles,{{efn|In his 2001  book ''Torso: The Story of Eliot Ness and the Search for a Psychopathic Killer'', Steve Nickel describes Short as a "common street prostitute, hooked on alcohol and drugs", posing nude for photos and living with a lesbian lover.{{sfn|Nickel|2001|p=289}} Though these claims have persisted in crime biographies on Short, some journalists, such as the ''Los Angeles Times''{{'}} Larry Harnisch, dispute their validity, as does Alexis Fitts in a 2016 article published in ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref name=fitts/&gt; and Bob Calhoun of ''SF Weekly''.&lt;ref name=calhoun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/news/snitch/yesterdays-crimes/yesterdays-crimes-the-black-dahlia-lies-in-oakland/|work=[[SF Weekly]]|title=Yesterday's Crimes: The Black Dahlia Lies in Oakland|author=Calhoun, Bob|date=July 3, 2017|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} according to Harnisch, the contemporaneous [[grand jury]] proved that there was no existing evidence that she was ever a prostitute.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt; Harnisch claims that the rumor regarding Short's history as a prostitute originates from [[John Gregory Dunne]]'s 1977 novel ''True Confessions'', which is based in part on the crime.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt;

Another widely circulated rumor (sometimes used to counter claims that Short was a prostitute){{sfn|Wilkes|2006|p=174}} holds that Short was unable to have [[sexual intercourse]] because of a congenital defect that resulted in "[[gonadal dysgenesis|infantile genitalia]]".{{efn|John Gilmore notes in ''Severed'' that Short's genitalia was apparently too undeveloped to allow for intercourse, as noted by the deputy coroner who performed her autopsy.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=140}} This claim is disputed by Hélèna Katz in ''Cold Cases: Famous Unsolved Mysteries, Crimes, and Disappearances in America'',{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=187}} and by Michael Newton in ''The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes''.{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=46}}  }} Los Angeles County district attorney's files state that the investigators had questioned three men with whom Short had engaged in sex,&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;[http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news/article.php?storyid=21 "Fact Versus Fiction"] BlackDahlia.info. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218051257/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news/article.php?storyid=21 |date=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a Chicago police officer who was a suspect in the case; FBI files on the case also contain a statement from one of Short's alleged lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024802/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=4 "District Attorney Suspects"] BlackDahlia.info.&lt;/ref&gt; Short's autopsy itself, which was reprinted in full{{sfn|Newton|2009|pages=44–6}} in Michael Newton's 2009 book ''The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes'', notes that her [[uterus]] was "small"; however, no other information in the autopsy is provided that would suggest her reproductive organs were anything other than anatomically normal.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=187}}{{sfn|Newton|2009|p=46}} The autopsy also states that Short was not and had never been pregnant, contrary to what had been claimed prior to and following her death.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

Another rumor—that Short was a lesbian—has often circulated; according to Gilmore, this rumor began after Bevo Means of the ''Herald-Express'' was told by the deputy coroner that Short "wasn't having sex with men" due to her purportedly "small" genitalia.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|pages=141–2}} Means took this to mean that Short had sex with women, and both he and reporter Sid Hughes began fruitlessly investigating gay bars in Los Angeles for further information.{{sfn|Gilmore|2006|p=141}}

Short is interred at the [[Mountain View Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Mountain View Cemetery]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].&lt;ref name=calhoun/&gt; After her younger sisters had grown up and married, their mother, Phoebe, moved to Oakland to be near her daughter's grave. She finally returned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in the 1970s, where she lived into her nineties.&lt;ref name="harnisch"/&gt; On February 2, 1947, just two weeks after Short's murder, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state assemblyman [[C. Don Field]] was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a [[sex offender registry]]; the state of California would become the first U.S. state to make the registration of [[sex offender]]s mandatory.{{sfn|Katz|2010|p=190}}

Short's murder has been described as one of the most brutal and culturally enduring crimes in American history,&lt;ref name=fitts&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/black-dahlia-murder-steve-hodel-elizabeth-short|work=The Guardian|title=I know who killed the Black Dahlia: my own father|author=Fitts, Alexis Sobel|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine listed it as one of the most infamous unsolved cases in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1867198_1867170_1867291,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=The Black Dahlia|series=Top 10 Unsolved Crimes|accessdate=September 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229043627/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1867198_1867170_1867291,00.html|archivedate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short's life and death have been the basis of numerous books and films, both fictionalized and non-fiction. Among the most famous fictional accounts of Short's death is [[James Ellroy]]'s 1987 novel ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'', which, in addition to the murder, explored "the larger fields of politics, crime, corruption, and paranoia in post-war Los Angeles", according to cultural critic David M. Fine.{{sfn|Fine|2004|pages=209–10}} Ellroy's novel was adapted into a [[The Black Dahlia (film)|2006 film of the same name]] by director [[Brian De Palma]].&lt;ref name=summers/&gt; Both Ellroy's novel and its film adaptation bear little relation to the facts of the case.{{sfn|Mayo|2008|p=316}} Short was also portrayed in heavily fictionalized accounts by [[Lucie Arnaz]] in the 1975 television film ''Who Is the Black Dahlia?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Cue|title=Who Is the Black Dahlia?|issue=33–8|volume=45|p=101|publisher=North American Publishing Company|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again by [[Mena Suvari]] in the series ''[[American Horror Story]]'', in 2011 featuring Short in the plot line of the episode "[[Spooky Little Girl]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/recap/american-horror-story-season-1-episode-9/|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=American Horror Story recap: Black Dahlia 'American Horror Story' recap|author=Jensen, Jeff|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2018 with "[[Return to Murder House]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starrymag.com/american-horror-story-return-to-murder-house/|title=American Horror Story – Return to Murder House|website=starrymag.com|date=October 24, 2018|accessdate=November 23, 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025120959/http://starrymag.com/american-horror-story-return-to-murder-house/|archive-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Navajo people|Navajo]] religious belief, a '''chindi''' ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|chʼį́įdii}}}}) is the [[ghost]] left behind after a person dies, believed to leave the body with the deceased's last breath.  It is everything that was bad about the person; the "residue that man has been unable to bring into universal harmony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Chindi are believed to linger around the deceased's bones or possessions, so possessions are often destroyed after death and contact with bodies is avoided. After death, the deceased's name is never spoken, for fear that the chindi will hear and come and make one ill.  Traditional Navajo practice is to allow death to occur outdoors, to allow the chindi to disperse.  If a person dies in a house or [[hogan]], that building is believed to be inhabited by the chindi and is abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Revenge of the Windigo: the construction of the mind and mental health of North American Aboriginal peoples |author=James Burgess Waldram

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7254">In [[philosophy of science]], '''confirmation holism''', also called '''epistemological holism''', is the view that no individual statement can be confirmed or disconfirmed by an empirical test, but only a set of statements (a whole theory).

It is attributed to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] who motivated his holism through extending [[Pierre Duhem]]'s problem of [[underdetermination]] in [[physical theory]] to all knowledge claims.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine. '[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]].' ''The Philosophical Review'', 60 (1951), pp. 20–43. [http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html online text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duhem, Pierre. ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''. Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Duhem's idea was, roughly, that no [[theory]] of any type can be tested in isolation but only when embedded in a background of other hypotheses, e.g. hypotheses about initial conditions. Quine thought that this background involved not only such hypotheses but also our whole web-of-belief, which, among other things, includes our mathematical and logical theories and our scientific theories. This last claim is sometimes known as the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Curd, M. and Cover, J.A. (Eds.) (1998). Philosophy of Science, Section 3, The Duhem-Quine Thesis and Underdetermination, W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; A related claim made by Quine, though contested by some (see [[Adolf Grünbaum]] 1962),&lt;ref&gt;Grünbaum, A. 1962. 'The falsifiability of theories: total or partial? A contemporary evaluation of the Duhem-Quine thesis', Synthese, vol. 14:17-34. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02274802 online text]&lt;/ref&gt; is that one can always protect one's theory against refutation by attributing failure to some other part of our web-of-belief. In his own words, "Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.".&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine. '[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]].' ''The Philosophical Review'', 60 (1951), pp. 20–43. [http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html online text]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underdetermination in physical theory==

By 1845 astronomers found that the orbit of planet [[Uranus]] around the Sun departed from expectations.  Not concluding that [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] was flawed, however, astronomers [[John Couch Adams]] as well as [[Urbain Le Verrier]] independently predicted a new planet, eventually known as [[Neptune]], and even calculated its weight and orbit through Newton's theory. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} And yet neither did this empirical success of Newton's theory verify Newton's theory.

Le Verrier soon reported that Mercury's [[perihelion]]—the peak of its orbital ellipse nearest to the Sun—advanced each time Mercury completed an orbit, a phenomenon not predicted by Newton's theory, which astrophysicists were so confident in that they predicted a new planet, named ''[[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]'', which a number of astronomers subsequently claimed to have seen.  In 1905, however, Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] claimed that space and time are both [[spacetime|relative]], refuting the very framework of Newton's theory that claimed that space and time were both [[absolute space and time|absolute]].

In 1915, Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] newly explained [[gravitation]] while precisely predicting Mercury's orbit.  In 1919, astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] led an expedition to test Einstein's prediction of the Sun's mass reshaping [[spacetime]] in its vicinity.  The [[Royal Society of London|Royal Society]] announced confirmation—accepted by physicists as the fall of Newton's theory.  Yet few [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] believe general relativity is a fundamentally accurate description of gravitation, and instead seek a theory of [[quantum gravity]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Total vs. partial holism==

Some scholars, like Quine, argue that if a prediction that a theory makes comes out true, then the corresponding piece of evidence confirms the whole theory and even the whole framework within which that theory is embedded. Some have questioned this radical or total form of confirmational holism. If total holism were true, they argue, that would lead to absurd consequences like the confirmation of arbitrary conjunctions. For example, if the general [[theory of relativity]] is confirmed by the [[perihelion]] of Mercury then, according to ''total'' holism, the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese also gets confirmed. More controversially, the two conjuncts are meant to be confirmed in equal measure. 

The critics of total holism do not deny that evidence may spread its support far and wide. Rather, they deny that it always spreads its support to the ''whole'' of any theory or theoretical framework that entails or probabilistically predicts the evidence. This view is known as partial holism. One early advocate of partial confirmational holism is [[Adolf Grünbaum]] (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Grünbaum, A. 1962. 'The falsifiability of theories: total or partial? A contemporary evaluation of the Duhem-Quine thesis', Synthese, vol. 14:17-34. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02274802 online text]&lt;/ref&gt; Another is [[Ken Gemes]] (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Gemes, K. 1993. 'Hypothetico-Deductivism, Content, and the Natural Axiomatization of Theories', Philosophy of Science, vol. 60:477-487. [http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/762/1/K_Gemes_Hypothetico-Deductivsm.pdf online text]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provides refinements to the hypothetico-deductive account of confirmation, arguing that a piece of evidence may be confirmationally relevant only to some content parts of a hypothesis. 

More recently, and in a similar vein, Ioannis Votsis (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Votsis, I. 2014. 'Objectivity in Confirmation: Post hoc Monsters and Novel Predictions, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, vol. 45: 70-78. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001052/pdfft?md5=d0b31e51ecfb9a04195f9de0d2a02f80&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0039368113001052-main.pdf online text]&lt;/ref&gt; argues for an objectivist account of confirmation, according to which, monstrous hypotheses, i.e. roughly hypotheses that are put together in an ''[[ad hoc]]'' or arbitrary way, have internal barriers that prevent the spread of confirmation between their parts. Thus even though the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese gets confirmed by the perihelion of Mercury since the latter is entailed by the conjunction, the confirmation does not spread to the conjunct that the moon is made of cheese. In other words, it is not always the case that support spreads to all the parts of a hypotheses, and even when it does, it is not always the case that it spreads to the different parts in equal measure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5562">'''Cross-dominance''', also known as '''mixed-[[handedness]]''', '''hand confusion''', or '''mixed dominance''', is a [[motor skill]] manifestation in which a person favors one hand for some tasks and the other hand for others. For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the right hand but throw mainly with the left one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightleftrightwrong.com/what.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Overall, being mixed handed seems to result in better performance than being strongly handed for sports such as basketball, ice hockey, and field hockey. What these sports have in common is that they require active body movements and also an ability to respond to either side.  The situation is reversed for racquet sports such as tennis.  Individuals with crossed hand-eye preference seem to be much better at gymnastics, running, and basketball because of the way in which congruent and crossed sided individuals position their bodies.|sign=[[Stanley Coren]]|source=''The Left-Hander Syndrome'', Chapter 3}}

It can also refer to mixed [[laterality]], which refers to a person favoring eyes, ears, feet, or hands on one side of the body. A person who is cross-dominant can also be stronger on the opposite side of the body that they favor; for example, a right-handed person can be stronger on the left side. Cross-dominance can often be a problem when shooting or in activities that require aim, although athletes can still achieve success in sports that require accuracy, like passing in [[American football]] and shooting in basketball.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== In baseball ==

In [[baseball]] a left-handed batter is about two steps closer to first base than a right-handed batter, one important advantage.&lt;ref name=HBT/&gt; Because [[curveball]]s and [[slider]]s &amp;ndash; the most commonly used breaking pitches in the game &amp;ndash; curve in the direction of a [[pitcher]]'s non-throwing hand, a [[batter (baseball)|batter]] who bats opposite the pitcher's throwing hand enjoys an advantage. Since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters enjoy a second  advantage over their right-handed counterparts.&lt;ref name=HBT&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-advantage-of-batting-left-handed/ The advantage of batting left handed]&lt;/ref&gt; However, right-handed throwing is more valuable in the field. Every fielding position can be played by a right-handed thrower, although left-handers are considered more valuable pitchers and have a slight advantage at [[first baseman|first base]] owing to the fact that they do not have to turn around to place their foot on first when stretching to catch a throw. Conversely, left-handed throwers are almost completely absent at the highest level at the other infield positions and at [[catcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fangraphs.com/tht/top-10-left-handed-catchers-for-2006/ |title=Top 10 left-handed catchers for 2006 |last=Walsh |first=John |date=2006-04-06 |website=The Hardball Times |access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwarz |first=Alan |date=2009-08-15 |title=Left-handed and left out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/sports/baseball/16catcher.html |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switch hitter|Switch hitting]] exists so a batter can hit from the side opposite every pitcher's throwing arm, but it has gained some [[Switch hitter#Criticism|criticism]] because a batter will always be more dominant from one side of the plate than the other; the switch hitter may be less reliable from one side. So, many baseball players are trained to be simply cross-dominant, batting solely left-handed and throwing solely right-handed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/bats-left-throws-right-part-1/ Article on the advantage of cross-dominance in baseball, including statistics.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few position players, such as [[Rickey Henderson]] and [[Cleon Jones]], who bat right and throw left; but this serves as a substantial disadvantage. Rickey Henderson only did that because he was taught to bat right-handed by right-handed teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/bats-right-throws-left-the-best-players-in-major-league-history/ Bats: Right Throws: Left]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In snooker==

In [[snooker]], swapping the cue from one hand to the other in order to gain easy access to an oblique shot was long thought to be disrespectful, though more recently it has come to be accepted, especially since [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has dominated the world game and often escaped from [[Glossary of cue sports terms#snooker|snookers]] by switching to a left-handed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Sportsmail |title=O'Sullivan takes a left turn |date=25 July 2011 |work=Daily Mail  |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-2018496/VIDEO-Mario-Balotelli-backheel-disrespectful-sports-stars.html |accessdate=3 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017}} There are also several players, most notably [[Barry Hawkins]], who play with the opposite hand of their dominant one.

==Famous people==

Some well-known and influential people in history that have shown cross-dominant traits{{vague|date=June 2018}} are [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Beethoven]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Gandhi]]{{cn|date=June 2018}}, and [[Jimi Hendrix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3101">'''List of cyclist or cycling deaths (any kind) in U.S. by year'''

''[[Cycling]]'' generally includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, and ''similar'' [[human-powered transport]] (HPVs).  Note however that many HPV users ''are not considered cyclists'', for example, using NHTSB statistics (US), [[skateboard]]er deaths are classified as pedestrians, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatepark.org/park-development/advocacy/2014/02/2013-skateboard-fatalities/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it is unclear how [[trikke]]s are classified.

The following table summarizes the number of people killed and/or injured in fatal ''cyclist'' collisions (as defined/reported by NHTSB) in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crash Statistics|url=http://www.pedbikeinfo.org/data/factsheet_crash.cfm|publisher=National Highway Transportation Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-californa-leads-national-bicycle-deaths-20141027-story.html Bicycle traffic deaths soar; California leads nation LAT]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics (generally) may vary based on the definition of what constitutes an injury or death, in particular time after incident and complications for deaths, and severity for injuries, therefore comparing statistics across years or nations requires a bit of deeper investigation.  Many injuries go unreported.

American [[intelligence analysts]] estimate Abdurehim was born in 1974 in [[Ghulja, China|Ghulja]], China, and assigned him the [[Internment Serial Number]] 289.

Abdulrehim is one of 22 [[Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo|Uighurs who have been held in Guantanamo]] for many years despite it becoming clear early on that they were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/02/innocent_detainees_need_a_home/ |work=The Boston Globe |title=Innocent detainees need a home |first1=Bill |last1=Delahunt |first2=Sabin |last2=Willett |date=2009-04-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s6nTMyn0?url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/02/innocent_detainees_need_a_home/ |archivedate=2010-08-19 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/17-innocent-uighurs-detained-guant%C3%A1namo-ask-supreme-court-release 17 Innocent Uighurs Detained at Guantánamo Ask Supreme Court for Release &amp;#124; Center for Constitutional Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5s6nfQuCV?url=http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/17-innocent-uighurs-detained-guant%C3%A1namo-ask-supreme-court-release |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes041104&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FK04Ad02.html China's Uighurs trapped at Guantanamo], ''[[Asia Times]]'', November 4, 2004 {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5iiEnVC9Y?url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FK04Ad02.html |date=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on September 8, 2006, the Department of Defense released 31 pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

===Legal Sufficiency Review===
His Combatant Status Review Tribunal's [[Legal Sufficiency Review]] was drafted on January 18, 2005, by [[Legal Advisor (OARDEC)|Assistant Legal Advisor]] [[Commander]] [[Karen M. Gibbs]].

His enemy combatant status was confirmed by [[Tribunal panel 12]].

Gibbs noted that the Tribunal panel "substantially complied" with the rules set out for Tribunals conduct.

Gibbs noted
{{Quotation|
The Tribunal's decision that detainee #289 is properly classified as an enemy combatant was unanimous.
However, the CSRT "urges favourable consideration for the detainee's release," with no forcible return to China.}}

==Testimony on behalf of Abdul Razak==
Dawut Abdurehim testified on behalf of [[Abdul Razak (Guantanamo detainee 219)|Abdul Razak]].&lt;ref name=CsrtAbdulRazak219&gt;

Dawut Abdurehim testified that Abdul Razak had made two deliveries of food to the Uyghur camp, and that he was not involved in combat.
Dawut Abdurehim confirmed that they had fled the [[American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan]] with the other Uyghurs, through the mountains, into Pakistan, where they were turned over to the Pakistani authorities.

On Abdul Razak's detainee election form Dawut Abdurehim's name was recorded as "Sabet".&lt;ref name=DetaineeElectionFormAbdalRazakQadirvGeorgeWBush&gt;{{cite web

Both men testified that they had not seen the other man be trained on or carry any weapons.

Abdul Razak testified that the camp was near a village he called [[Urhurl, Afghanistan|Urhurl]].

==Current status==
Five Uyghurs, whose CSR Tribunals determined they had not been enemy combatants were transferred to detention in an Albanian refugee camp in 2006.  A man who was born to Uyghur parents, in Saudi Arabia, and thus was considered a Uyghur, was nevertheless returned to Saudi Arabia.  All the other Uyghurs remained in Guantanamo.

In September 2007, the Department of Defense released all the [[Summary of Evidence (ARB)|Summary of Evidence memos]] prepared for the Administrative Review Boards convened in 2006.&lt;ref name=OardecArb1Factors&gt;

No recommendation memos were released for Dawut Abdurehim.

On June 12, 2008, the [[United States Supreme Court]] restored the Guantanamo captives' access to the USA's civilian justice system in its ruling on [[Boumediene v. Bush]].
Specifically it re-initiated the captives' [[habeas corpus]] petitions.
In an unrelated development [[Huzaifa Parhat]]'s [[DTA appeal]] concluded that his Combatant Status Review Tribunal had erred in confirming he was an "enemy combatant", due to insufficient evidence.
The Department of Justice had the option of appealing the ruling, claiming it had new evidence.  The Uyghurs' habeas petitions were the first to be scheduled for review.
In September 2008, days before the Department of Justice would have been expected to offer a justification in court for the Uyghurs' detention, and after six and half years of extrajudicial detention, the Department of Justice acknowledged the evidence to justify their detention did not exist.

==Temporary Asylum in Palau==
In June 2009, the government of [[Palau]] announced that they would offer temporary asylum to some of the Uyghurs.&lt;ref name=DoJ2009-10-31&gt;

The government of Palau sent a delegation Guantanamo, and interviewed some of the remaining Uyghurs.
Some of the Uyghurs declined to be interviewed by the Palauns.  In the end the government of Palau offered asylum to twelve of the remaining thirteen Uyghurs. Palau declined to offer asylum to one of the Uyghurs who suffered from a mental disorder, brought on by detention, that was too profound to be treated in Palau.

On October 31, 2009, Abdulrehim, [[Ahmad Tourson]], [[Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman]], [[Edham Mamet]], [[Anwar Hassan]] and [[Adel Noori]] were released and transferred to Palau.&lt;ref name=DoJ2009-10-31/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009-10-31/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bbc2009-10-31/&gt;&lt;ref name=Afp2009-10-31&gt;

The ''Globe'' confirmed that Palau's agreement to give refuge to the Uyghurs was reached after the USA agreed to various secret payments.  Those payments included $93,333 to cover each Uyghurs living expenses.  The ''Globe'' confirmed that controversy still surrounded former President [[Johnson Toribiong]] who had used some of those funds to billet the Uyghurs in houses belonging to his relatives.

Vanderklippe reported that the men had never felt they could fit in with the Palauns.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail2015-06-28/&gt;  
Some of the men compared Palau with a lusher, larger Guantanamo.  Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau.  Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences.  Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed.  Eventually, all six men were employed as night-time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with Palauns.

Tragically, one of the men's young toddler, conceived and born on Palau, died after he fell off a balcony.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail2015-06-28/&gt;  
According to Vanderklippe, the men's departure from Palau was quietly arranged with cooperation with American officials.  He reported they left, one or two at a time, on commercial flights.  Palaun officials would not share the Uyghurs destination.

The term '''Death Care Industry''' refers to companies and organizations that provide services related to [[death]]: [[funeral]]s, [[cremation]] or [[burial]], and [[memorial]]s.  This includes for example [[funeral home]]s, [[coffin]]s, [[Crematorium|crematoria]], [[Cemetery|cemeteries]], and [[headstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Religion: The Death Industry |date=14 November 1960 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711967,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 10 Companies That Control the Death Industry |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/01/the-10-companies-that-control-the-death-industry/69768/|date=19 January 2011 |journal=The Atlantic Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death care industry within the U.S. consists mainly of small, family-owned businesses.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://build.export.gov/build/groups/public/@eg_main/@byind/@healthtech/documents/webcontent/eg_main_113189.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Commerce.

== History ==
The advent of [[embalming]] in the normal course of preparation of corpses for burial led directly to the transition of death care from a job predominately performed by women at home to an industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2015/08/92557/undertaker-funeral-director-jobs|title=These Two Millennials Want To Change The Way We Die|last=Lebsack|first=Lexy|date=26 October 2016|website=Refinery29|access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], hundreds of soldiers died away from home and the process of embalming aided in preserving the bodies until they could be transported for burial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The process gained popularity after the funeral procession of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s embalmed corpse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Early techniques in embalming were primitive: an article in 1898, written in the ''Journal of Medicine and Science'' criticized and brought to attention the manner in which the [[arsenic]] used to preserve corpses had leeched into the soil and the [[groundwater]] near cemeteries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/30/our-bodies-ourselves|title=Our Bodies, Ourselves|last=Rebecca|first=Mead|date=23 November 2015|journal=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first embalming school, Cincinnati School of Embalming, was created in 1882.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319493422|title=To serve the living : funeral directors and the African American way of death|last=1964-|first=Smith, Suzanne E.,|date=2010|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674036215|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=319493422}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a means of monitoring and establishing the protocol for handling corpses, the first mortuary schools were established in 1898, along with the National Funeral Directors Association, which is still the leading industry association today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Prior to the mid-19th century, the dead were prepared, dressed, and displayed by their own family.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefuneralsource.org/hi0301.html|title=U.S. Funeral History- North American Funerals: The Funeral Source|website=thefuneralsource.org|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was displayed in a homemade or purchased casket in the family's home.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Wealthier families had “proper” rooms that held their finest possessions during viewings, and some family homes had a separate door known as a "coffin door" or “death door” to remove the body as it was custom for the body not to cross a doorway where the living crossed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.milfordmirror.com/17589/uncovering-history-while-renovating-sanford-bristol-house/|title=Uncovering history while renovating Sanford-Bristol house|last=|first=|date=2014-05-30|work=Milford Mirror|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embalming emerged during the Civil War since many soldiers were dying on the battlefield and their families wanted their bodies sent back home for burial. Dr. Auguste Renouard, a pioneer in the field of embalming, published “''The Undertakers’ Manual''” in 1878.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The first embalming school, the Cincinnati School of Embalming, was founded in 1882 by Joseph Henry Clarke, and in 1883, Dr. Renouard opened the Rochester School of Embalming.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The push for embalming occurred simultaneously with the move away from families caring for the dead and for undertakers to organize themselves as “professionals.” The first professional trade association was established in Philadelphia in 1964.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first national convention for funeral directors was held in Rochester, New York in 1882 after Alan Durfee, a Michigan funeral director planned a successful statewide convention.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.frazerconsultants.com/2017/11/201711the-history-of-the-national-funeral-directors-association/|title=The History of the National Funeral Directors Association|date=2017-11-13|work=Frazer Consultants|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first constitution of the National Funeral Directors Association was drafted in 1882.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The industry underwent changes as the public responded to [[Jessica Mitford]]'s ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' in 1963. The book was released at a time when consumer consciousness and empowerment altered Americans' buying and spending habits.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deathreference.com/En-Gh/Funeral-Industry.html|title=Funeral Industry - rituals, world, burial, body, life, customs, history, time, human|website=www.deathreference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the response to Mitford's book, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] began its own investigation of the death care industry in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By 1984, the FTC issued the Federal Trade Rule which included regulations such as requiring funeral directors to provide detailed, itemized price lists to all clients, informing clients that embalming is not required by law, and allowing clients to choose non-traditional alternatives.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Millennial impact  ===

Millennials have been raised in and grown up in a time of extreme technology growth.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.withum.com/kc/millennials-impact-death-care-industry/|title=Millennials Impact on the Death Care Industry - WithumSmith+Brown, PC|work=WithumSmith+Brown, PC|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the marketing strategies required to reach them will need to change. Several moves the industry may take include the use of technology, using social media, and offering non-traditional services or venues.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, this generation is not only expected to impact the industry based on their spending but also through their labor. By 2030, millennials will constitute 75% of the workforce for the death care industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Services in the industry ==

=== Funeral homes ===

* The subtopic "[[funeral home]]s" is one of the most diverse sub-sector of the industry as the operations of the funeral home includes selling burial and memorial products, memorial services and venues, and preparations of the body for burial or cremation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Industries/Industry_Overview__Funeral_Services.aspx|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|last=Publishing|first=Value Line|website=www.valueline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cemeteries ===

* The operations that run at cemeteries include internment rights, burial and memorial products, as well as grounds maintenance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Manufacturers ===

* Manufacturers are the ones who actually create the burial and memorialization products including caskets, urns, and headstones.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Consumer protection==
A number of factors make this business unique from the customer's point of view, according to the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Funerals are among the most expensive purchases many consumers will ever make; most often, a consumer goes through the decision making for this process once, so that there is little experience, and often few sources of information are used; and those making funeral decisions may be under time pressure and significant emotional duress.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2000). Prepared Statement for the Committee on For the Special Committee on Aging. United States Senate (April 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral homes are regulated under the [[Funeral Rule]].

Beginning in 1972, the FTC began investigating the funeral industry. In August 1975, the FTC released a proposal that suggested the following regulations: prices must be itemized, permission of the next of kin must be obtained before embalming, prices must be quoted over the telephone if requested, and the most inexpensive casket must be displayed with the others.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Additionally, the FTC Funeral Rule outlawed false claims and efforts by undertakers to blackball funeral homes that provided cheaper services.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Statistics==
In the United States, there are more than 19,322 [[funeral home]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfda.org/news/statistics|title=Statistics|website=www.nfda.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 115,000 [[cemeteries]], 1,155 [[crematories]], and an estimated 300 [[casket]] sellers.&lt;ref&gt;Hermanson, Sharon. (2000-05-01) [http://www.aarp.org/research/endoflife/funeral/aresearch-import-197-IB44.html The Deathcare Industry]. Aarp.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The total revenue produced from the funeral industry in the U.S. alone was $14.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Enough [[embalming fluid]] is buried every year to fill eight Olympic-size pools; more steel (in caskets alone) than was used to build the Golden Gate Bridge; and enough reinforced concrete to construct a two-lane highway from New York to Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Sehee, Joe (2007). [http://www.perc.org/perc.php?subsection=5&amp;id=1015 Green Burial], [[PERC Reports]], Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2007-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, a push for large companies acquiring smaller funeral homes and cemeteries occurred.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.funeralwise.com/learn/industry/|title=History of the Funeral Industry|work=Funeralwise|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been a consistent push for consolidation, the majority of the industry still consists of small, family-owned businesses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Experts and analysts of the industry have estimated that the top six funeral operators control 25 to 30% of all funeral services in North America, with the top four owning between 15 and 20% of all funeral homes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The industry is experiencing a recent trend toward cremation as opposed to the traditional funeral and burial services due to lower costs and increased value. By the year 2020, the rate of cremation is expected to be 56.2% versus 37.8% for burial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Regardless of choice of funerary option, the overall industry is experiencing growth due to the aging baby-boomer generation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Between the years of 1990 and 2018, the overall average inflation rate was 2.32% per year while the average inflation rate for funeral expenses was 3.71% per year.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/Funeral-expenses/price-inflation/1990|title=Funeral expenses price history from 1990 through 2018|website=www.in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this means that the average cost of a funeral in 2018 is 177.43% more expensive than a funeral in 1990.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Religious influences ==

=== Islam ===

* According to the Prophet Mohammed, the deceased should be treated like the living which is why Muslims are never cremated or have their bodies desecrated in any way, they are always buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/what-happens-if-your-body-is-cremated-according-to-islam-12085547.html|title=What Happens If Your Body Is Cremated According to Islam? {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gatrad|first=A.R.|date=August 1994|title=Muslim customs surrounding death, bereavement, postmortem examinations, and organ transplants|url=|journal=BMJ|volume=309|pages=20–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only time that cremation is acceptable in the Islamic faith is when there are breakouts or epidemics of disease and infection or if there is not enough room for burial, as is the case in much of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/do-muslims-cremate-or-bury-12084938.html|title=Do Muslims Cremate or Bury? {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the space for burial is not so much an issue, however, Islamic customs for a burial soon after death tend to conflict with the speed at which cemeteries work in the United States.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://classroom.synonym.com/muslim-funeral-practices-in-america-12086240.html|title=Muslim Funeral Practices in America {{!}} Synonym|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims are also not embalmed which is another major practice in the U.S. death care industry.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===

* There are two major values that the Jewish community embraces when dealing with death and dying: ''kavod hamet'' and ''nichum avelim''. ''Kavod hamet'' means to "honor the dead" which involves treating the dead body with the same respect and dignity that they were treated with while living.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26769037|title=Ethnic variations in dying, death, and grief : diversity in universality|date=1993|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|others=Irish, Donald P., Lundquist, Kathleen F., Nelsen, Vivian Jenkins.|isbn=1560322772|location=New York, NY|oclc=26769037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the underlying basis for the tradition of Jewish individuals not opting for autopsies. The body can be prepared for burial by either a professional or a lay person. The dead are typically buried in a family plot, and cremation is prohibited by Jewish law.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Native Americans ===

* Native American religion has Christian influences and is therefore a mixture of tribal traditions and Christianity. Since many people attend the wakes and funerals of Native Americans, funeral homes are rarely utilized. Additionally, floral arrangements are rarely used in the funeral procession or ordered by guests for the grieving family.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Funeral directors must understand that, at the burial, family members and friends assist in filling the grave.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Buddhism ===

* The mind is a very important aspect in death for Buddhists. Caregivers and family members work to achieve a calm and peaceful environment for the dying.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Family members plan the funeral so funeral directors are not necessary in the funerary process. Additionally, embalming is not traditional of Buddhist and is not typically performed since there is no belief of resurrection of the body.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The services may be carried out at a funeral home if the family so chooses, and it is customary for flowers and fruits to be brought. Both cremation and burial are practiced in the Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Catholicism ===

* Traditionally, Catholics hold a vigil and then a funeral service with the deceased body or ashes present.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After the services, there is a graveside service for the burial of the body or ashes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Until 1963, cremation in the Catholic religion was forbidden. However, the Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office endorsed an ''Instruction with regard to the Cremation of Bodies'' and, following this endorsement, Pope Paul VI also endorsed this instruction.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44633004|title=Purified by fire : a history of cremation in America|last=R.|first=Prothero, Stephen|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520208161|location=Berkeley|oclc=44633004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quakers and Unitarians ===

* These two religions utilize similar traditions for death and dying. If memorial services are utilized, the body is typically cremated immediately following or donated for educational and scientific purposes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For the ceremonies or services in these religions, there is no embalming and no caskets.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The ashes are either scattered, buried in a cemetery plot, or placed in a mausoleum niche.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Valeriu Victor Boboc''' (May 5, 1985 - April 8, 2009) was a protester who died in police custody amid the [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|post-election protests]] in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].

== Biography ==

He was born on May 5, 1985, in [[Bubuieci]] (a Chişinău suburban community), to Victor Boboc, a history teacher and Ala Boboc, a [[Romanian language]] teacher. But the poverty has radically changed the situation in his family, his father working as taxi driver and his mother, Ala Boboc, became unemployed. Valeriu Boboc graduated from "Miguel de Cervantes" High School Chişinău and attended [[International Relations Institute of Moldova]] for one year. He left university because he didn't have three thousand [[Moldovan leu|lei]] to pay the study contract. Looking to find a better paid work, he tried to leave for [[Russia]], but failed. He worked at a car wash, a car service and then sold belts at market. In the same place was selling clothes Natalia, whom he married in 2007. Valeriu Boboc lived in an apartment in Bubuieci, with his wife, his child Dragoş (born July 30, 2007), his brother Marcel and parents. Some claim he was known at local city police stations as a passive addict and a hooligan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210520/http://www.grenada.md/index.php?newsid=467 The addict and the marauder has deserved the higher award of Moldova?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions to the death ==

After the results of the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election]] were announced, he was a peaceful participant at the protest. Boboc arrived in the Square after 5.00 p.m., when the [[President of Moldova|presidential]] and [[Moldovan Parliament|parliament]] buildings were being ravaged. Following his arrest, [[Valeriu Boboc]] died in a Chişinău hospital on 8 April 2009.&lt;ref name="RFE4-2010"&gt;RFE/RL: [http://www.rferl.org/content/Moldovan_Police_Arrest_Policeman_In_Postelection_Killing_/2007489.html "Moldovan Police Arrest Policeman In Postelection Killing "], 9 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Boboc was pronounced dead in the early hours of April 8 at a Chisinau hospital. The official cause of death was given as inhalation of poisonous gas. His case was reopened after the current ruling coalition won elections in July.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=moldova-makes-arrest-in-post-election-killing-2010-04-09 Moldova makes arrest in post-election killing]&lt;/ref&gt; The police declared he died of smoke inhalation from the riot, but his family claims that he was beaten to death by the police, his body being full of contusions.&lt;ref name="familiaunui"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/847233/Dovada-crimelor-militiei-lui-Voronin/ "Dovada crimelor miliţiei lui Voronin"], ''EVZ.ro'', 13 April 2009.

Valeriu Boboc was killed intentionally, said [[Valeriu Pleşca]], the lawyer of the family of Boboc. According to a witness who witnessed the death of Valeriu Boboc, "On the night of April 8, Valeriu Boboc and other men were peacefully sitting near the Triumph Arch in Chisinau's downtown, watching the events on the [[National Assembly Square, Chișinău|Great National Assembly Square]]. Suddenly we were surrounded by 50 armed policemen. The police ordered us to lay on the ground and started to beat us with clubs, legs and weapons," the lawyer read out from the witness's testimonies. The lawyer of the family of BobocValeriu Pleşca was called to lay testimonies on June 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/3484 Valeriu Boboc's barrister shares from witness's statements]&lt;/ref&gt; Damian Hancu, the man who witnessed the death of Valeriu Boboc, declared he could identify the policemen who beat him and Boboc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eliberatimoldova.eu/en/news_archive/New_evidences_in_the_case_of_Valeriu_Boboc_s_death-467 New evidences in the case of Valeriu Boboc’s death]&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was around 2 AM. We`ve heard an information on the radio that someone had found a person with a bullet wound in the Cathedral Square. That was the initial version regarding Valeriu Boboc` s death", declared former vice-minister of Internal Affairs, [[Ghenadie Coşovan]]. He was surprised about the first declarations made by former minister of Health [[Larisa Catrinici]], that Valeriu Boboc has died due to intoxication, said Ghenadie Coşovan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnal.md/en/news/former-officials-began-talking-a-year-after-valeriu-boboc-s-death-183445/ Former officials began talking a year after Valeriu Boboc` s death]&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of Valeriu Boboc was handed to the relatives by the police on April 12 and was buried on the same day. [[Dorin Chirtoacă]], the [[mayor of Chişinău]] and vice-president of the [[Liberal Party (Moldova)|Liberal Party]], attended Boboc's funerals. The [[Alliance for European Integration|opposition]] parties subsequently used his death as an important subject during the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|July 2009]] electoral campaign.

The police declared he was found dead in the Great National Assembly Square. According to the official investigation, he died of inhaling a toxic gas, his death certificate stating as cause "poisoning with an unknown substance". The Boboc family and the lawyers disputed this, claiming instead that the young man was beaten to death while in custody. Moldova's [[Attorney General]] however noted that the bruises and bleeding traces on Boboc's body were not a cause of his death. The body of Valeriu Boboc was exhumed at the cemetery of [[Bubuieci]] on June 15, 2009 for further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/en/story/3699 Valeriu Boboc`s body to be examined by experts]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a protest gathering around 3,000 in the city's central square on April 12, 2009, [[Dorin Chirtoacă]] called for a moment of silence in memory of Valeriu Boboc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/world/europe/13moldova.html Moldovan Capital’s Mayor Speaks Against Communism ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, the spokeswoman of the Interior Ministry, Ala Meleca, has denied media reports blaming the police for the death of Boboc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicom.moldova.org/news/interior-ministry-denies-police-is-to-blame-for-protesters-death-195995-eng.html Interior Ministry denies police is to blame for protester's death]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Moldova)]] released a statement on April 12, 2009 saying an autopsy showed that Mr. Boboc had a broken rib, but that his death had not been caused by the injury. "Doctors think that the young man was poisoned by unknown substances," the statement said. "Prosecutors are ready for an international probe in order to exclude other interpretations of this fact."&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/world/europe/13moldova.html Moldovan Capital’s Mayor Speaks Against Communism ]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In connection with the multiple rumors related to the death of the citizen Valeriu Boboc, the Press Service of the Prosecutor Office is in right to inform the following. On April 8, at 1.15 am, V. Boboc died on his way to the Emergency Hospital. According to the results of the autopsy, the body injuries and namely a broken rib have no causative connection with the cause of death. According to the doctors, he was subject to intoxication with an unknown substance. In order to exclude any doubts related to the cause of death, the prosecutors are ready to call an international expertise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zdg.md/eng/news/the-memory-of-the-young-person-valeriu-boboc In memoriam of the young person Valeriu Boboc]&lt;/ref&gt;

A silent protest was held in [[Dublin]] city centre on April 13, 2009, in memory of Valeriu Boboc.

An open letter from the mayor of Chişinău, Dorin Chirtoacă, circulated on 14 April showed disturbing photos of Valeriu Boboc.&lt;ref&gt;[[EUobserver]], [http://euobserver.com/24/27943 EU diplomats trying to verify reports of Moldova abuses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip-bg.org/pdf/sos_moldova/mayor_appeal.pdf PRIMĂRIA MUNICIPIULUI CHISINĂU CHISINAU CITY HALL]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2009, [[Amnesty International]] wrote: "Valeriu Boboc reportedly died during the demonstrations on 7 April. There are conflicting reports as to the cause of his death. The General Prosecutor's Office has reported that his death was due to poisoning with unknown substances, while his family allege that he died as a result of injuries inflicted by the police."&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt;

Between April 17 to June 8, 2009, lawyers Veaceslav Ţurcan and Valeriu Pleşca of the family of the victim submitted many requests for the exhumation of Boboc, but they received 12 letters of denial. Later, after attacking the Prosecution in court, they got right to the exhumation and the expertise of an specialist from the UK.&lt;ref name="politicom.moldova.org"&gt;[http://politicom.moldova.org/news/avocaii-lui-valeriu-boboc-nu-au-acces-la-raportul-de-expertiz-202382-rom.html Avocaţii lui Valeriu Boboc nu au acces la raportul de expertiză]&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after a member of the Institute for Human Rights, an NGO that assisted victims of torture, had called a London-based pathologist seeking assistance in investigating the death of Valeriu Boboc, the prosecutor's office called Boboc's father and promised to bring in the same pathologist to investigate the case. That is an evidence that his phone was tapped.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report: Moldova"/&gt;

The body of Valeriu Boboc was exhumed at the cemetery of Bubueci on 15 June 2009. The exhumation lasted nearly 2 hours, and was held in the presence of the Boboc family's two lawyers, the prosecutor conducting the Boboc case, and an expert from Great Britain. The coffin was delivered to a Chisinau morgue, where the body was subjected to a thorough forensic examination to establish the true reason of the young man's death. The British expert [[Derrick John Pounde]] (born February 25, 1949) played a key role in the work.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]],[http://www.azi.md/en/print-story/3699 Valeriu Boboc`s body to be examined by experts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2009, "[[Amnesty International]] welcomes the fact that the Moldovan authorities have invited an international forensic expert to take part in the autopsy of Valeriu Boboc, who died during the demonstrations on 7 April under disputed circumstances, but calls on the authorities to ensure that all cases of alleged police ill-treatment are promptly, independently, impartially and thoroughly investigated and that anyone reasonably identified as responsible is brought to justice, in accordance with Moldova's obligations under international human rights law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/eur59/006/2009/fr/ Moldova: Serious human rights concerns remain]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if Professor John Pounder Derrik presented on June 29, 2009 to the Prosecutor Ion Matiuşenco his report, the access of the lawyers to it was delayed.&lt;ref name="politicom.moldova.org"/&gt;

On July 9, 2009, the Prosecutor General [[Valeriu Gurbulea]] said that on the night of April 8, Boboc was taken from the Great National Assembly Square, was taken to the Emergency Hospital in a police car and the doctors established that he was dead. "Legal action was immediately taken over this case," Gurbulea said&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/ro/print-story/4320 There was beating, 'but not like in Europe']&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2009, the Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea said no policeman who maltreated protesters had been identified yet. Neither is it known who killed Boboc. One of the reasons is that policemen were wearing masks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.moldova.org/news/top-moldovan-prosecutor-romania-not-officially-involved-in-riots-202929-eng.html Top Moldovan prosecutor: Romania not officially involved in riots]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|July 2009 election]], Ion Matiuşenco, the prosecutor investigating Boboc's case, resigned on July 31 and was replaced by another prosecutor. But at year's end there were no further developments in the case.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report: Moldova"/&gt;

When the ruling coalition [[Alliance for European Integration]] came to power, it promised to tell the whole truth about the April 2009 unrest.&lt;ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com"/&gt;

On October 8, 2009 hundreds of people came to the [[Stephen the Great Monument]] in Chişinău to mark 6 months from the bloody events. While was attending the ceremony, the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|prime minister]] [[Vlad Filat]], expressed condolences to Victor Boboc, the father of Valeriu Boboc. Filat also said that the Ministry of the Interior has already started a domestic investigation into the police's actions on April 7, 2009 and especially during subsequent days and weeks.&lt;ref name="infotag.md"&gt;[http://www.infotag.md/news-en/580782/ MEMORY OF APRIL EVENT VICTIMS VENERATED IN MOLDOVA AND ROMANIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720195947/http://www.infotag.md/news-en/580782/ |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 2009, the Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea resigned. "Foreign and national experts determined the death was as a result of injuries caused to Valeriu Boboc and not caused by an unknown, poisoning gas, as was said immediately after the tragedy," said the new Prosecutor General [[Valeriu Zubco]] in January 2010.&lt;ref name="jurnal.md"/&gt;

According to [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|2009 Human Rights Report]] of the [[United States Department of State]], released on March 11, 2010:

{{quote|NGOs accused police of beating to death Valeriu Boboc, age 23, during demonstrations at the parliament building and presidency on the night of April 7–8. Witnesses reported seeing police beat Boboc in front of the main government building with truncheons and rifle butts. A British forensics expert examined Boboc's body after it was exhumed on June 15 and concluded that Boboc was killed by severe blows to his head, which provoked a "diffuse injury of the brain" shortly before his death. Experts working for the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|PCRM]] government, however, concluded that Boboc's head and facial injuries could not have led to his death and at first attributed his death to poisoning by an unknown gas. The COE [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] noted that the injuries revealed in the autopsy "clearly indicate that the person was beaten" but concluded that "it was not certain whether the beating alone was the cause of death." Ion Matiuşenco, the prosecutor investigating Boboc's case, resigned on July 31 and was replaced by another prosecutor. At year's end there were no further developments in the case.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report: Moldova"/&gt;}}

After December 2009, Dragoş Boboc, Valeriu Boboc's son, will monthly receive 1000 lei from [[Mihai Ghimpu]]'s salary. This action will continue as long as his interim mandate of [[acting President of Moldova]] is valid.&lt;ref name="enjurnalmd.blogspot.com"/&gt;

A year after Boboc's death, General prosecution announced on April 6, 2010 that they had arrested the supposed murderer, a collaborator of the General Police Commissariat.

'''''Edmond de Belamy''''' is a [[generative adversarial network]] [[portrait painting]] constructed in 2018 by Paris-based arts-collective ''Obvious.''&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/obvious-ai-art-christies-auction-smart-creativity/index.html|title=AI-produced artwork sells for $433K, smashing expectations - CNN Style|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printed on canvas, the work belongs to a series of generative images called '''La Famille de Belamy'''.  It achieved widespread notoriety after [[Christie's]] announced its intention to auction the piece as the first artwork created using [[Artificial Intelligence]] to be featured in a Christie's auction. It surpassed pre-auction esimates which valued it at $7,000 to $10,000, instead selling for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?sid=&amp;intObjectID=6166184&amp;T=Lot&amp;language=en|title=Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html|title=AI Art at Christie’s Sells for $432,500|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is a portrait of a somewhat-blurry man. It is a print on canvas measuring 27 ½ x 27 ½ in (700 x 700 mm.) set within a gilded wood frame. The image was created by an algorithm that referenced 15,000 portraits from various periods. 

It is signed at the bottom right with "min G max D x [log (D(x))] + z [log(1 -- D (G(z)))]", which is part of the algorithm code that produced it.

The organization that produced it is called Obvious. It is a collective comprising three people, Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier, who are based in Paris, France.

The piece has been criticized because it was created using a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) software package based on prior research by others, including [[Ian Goodfellow]], and implemented by a developer who was not affiliated with Obvious, leading to allegations that Obvious contributed minimally to the final work product. Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that the original developer provide support and custom features. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How three French students used borrowed code to put the first AI portrait in Christie’s | publisher=The Verge | date=23 October 2018 | url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans | access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epistemological idealism''' is a [[subjectivist]] position in [[epistemology]] that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one's mind. It is opposed to [[epistemological realism]].

==Overview==
Epistemological idealism suggests that everything we ''experience'' and know is of a mental nature—''[[sense data]]'' in philosophical jargon. Although it is sometimes employed to argue in favor of [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], in principle epistemological idealism makes no claim about whether sense data are grounded in reality. As such, it is a container for both [[indirect realism]] and [[idealism]]. This is the version of epistemological idealism which interested [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]; it had roots in the [[positivism]] of [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] plus a number of aspects of the [[Kantianism]] or [[neo-Kantianism]] of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Blackmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=apip-Jm9WuwC&amp;dq= ''Ludwig Boltzmann: His Later Life and Philosophy, 1900-1906''], Springer, 1995, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary representative of epistemological idealism is [[Brand Blanshard]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Emmet, ''The Nature of Metaphysical Thinking'', Springer, 2015, p. 73 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Extinction''''' is a 2018 American [[Science fiction|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by Ben Young and written by Spenser Cohen, [[Eric Heisserer]] and [[Brad Kane]]. The film is about a father who has a recurring dream about the loss of his family while witnessing a force bent on destruction. The film stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Michael Peña]], [[Mike Colter]], Lilly Aspell, [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]], [[Israel Broussard]], and [[Lex Shrapnel]]. It was released on [[Netflix]] on July 27, 2018.

== Plot ==
Peter, an engineer, has recurring nightmares in which he and everyone he knows suffer through violent, [[alien invasion]]-like confrontations with an unknown enemy. He reluctantly visits a clinic to receive psychiatric help, only to find a patient there who reveals that he is having the same visions, prompting Peter to believe his visions are of an upcoming invasion. 

That night, invading spaceships open fire on the city, causing significant damage. Peter and his wife Alice barricade their apartment amid the sounds of slaughter from ground troops. A soldier dressed in insectoid-looking armor breaks through anyway and finds Lucy, one of their two daughters, hiding underneath a table. The soldier pauses to examine her long enough to allow Peter and Alice to attack. Peter and his family then escape with the soldier's rifle. 

Based on his visions, Peter and his family agree that the factory he works at is a safe spot. He is able to bypass the rifle's [[biometric authentication]] and kill soldiers guarding the apartment building's exit. They make their way to a tunnel entrance to safely travel to the factory, but not before Alice is injured from a bomb blast. As they regroup, the soldier from their apartment appears, having tracked them with a homing signal on the rifle they took. To Peter's shock, the soldier removes his helmet and appears human. Peter forces the soldier to carry Alice to the factory. There, his boss, David, explains that the invasion has been expected for many years. A medic examines Alice but informs Peter that he cannot save her. As David's men drag the invading soldier off to execute him, he yells to Peter that he can save Alice. Peter agrees to stay with the soldier to save Alice; David will evacuate their children to a subway station where a transport train awaits to take them all to an offsite base.

The soldier surprises Peter by revealing that Alice is an [[Android (robot)|android]]. To save Alice, she needs an alternate source of power: Peter himself. At the soldier's guidance, Peter cuts open his own chest with a pocket knife, confirming that he is also an android. The soldier connects a cable between the two androids and Peter passes out, experiencing in detail what he had thought were visions of the future but are actually memories of a past war. Fearing that android workers ("synths") might rise up against humans, protesters attack unarmed synths. The synths fight back and eventually drive all humans off the whole planet. In order to deal with the guilt of what they have done and prevent themselves from living in fear of a reprisal from humans, the synths have wiped their memories out and lived normal lives.

Peter wakes up and the soldier, Miles, explains that humans have been living on [[Mars]] for 50 years. He had expected the synths to be monsters, not families with children. Peter and Alice part amicably with Miles to find their daughters as humans breach the roof of the factory. As they all depart on the train, David explains that he and a handful of other synths kept their memories to stay prepared for the inevitable return of the humans. Peter suggests that some day there could be peace between humans and synths.

Jake Nevins of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it 2/5 stars and called the film "a competent, if formulaic film", writing that, by virtue of not being viewed theatrically, the film's flaws are magnified and its strengths were weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/27/extinction-review-splashy-alien-invasion-thriller-crash-lands-on-netflix|title=Extinction review – splashy alien invasion thriller crash lands on Netflix|last=Nevins|first=Jake|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1.5/4 star review for ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', Nick Allen wrote "There's a tightness that I respect with ''Extinction.'' It's not so much a thrill-ride but a movie monorail, with one revelation at the end meant to reconsider the entire journey. That speaks to its efficiency as the latest in mindless, if not attention-less Netflix movies. ''Extinction'' doesn't seek to be much, but it's just not all that charming, either."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/extinction-2018|title=Extinction Review|last=Allen|first=Nick|website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|date=July 27, 2018|access-date=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fern''' is a member of a group of [[vascular plant]]s (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via [[spore]]s and have neither [[seed]]s nor [[flower]]s. They differ from [[moss]]es by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients, in having branched [[Plant stem|stems]] and in having life cycles in which the sporophyte is the dominant phase. Like other vascular plants, ferns have complex [[leaf|leaves]] called megaphylls, that are more complex than the [[microphyll]]s of [[clubmosses]]. Most ferns are [[leptosporangiate fern]]s, sometimes referred to as true ferns. They produce coiled [[Fiddlehead fern|fiddleheads]] that uncoil and expand into [[frond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=McCausland |url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/rediscover-ferns-00400000016579/ |title=Rediscover ferns |work=Sunset.com |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=2013-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group includes about 10,560 known extant [[species]].&lt;ref name="Christenhusz-Byng2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Christenhusz, M.

Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the '''Polypodiopsida''', comprising both the '''leptosporangiate''' ([[Polypodiidae (plant)|Polypodiidae]]) and '''[[eusporangiate fern]]s''', the latter itself comprising ferns other than those denominated true ferns, including [[horsetail]]s or scouring rushes, [[Psilotaceae|whisk ferns]], [[marattioid fern]]s, and [[ophioglossoid fern]]s.

Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the late [[Devonian]] period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/plants/pterophyta/pteridofr.html |title=Pteridopsida: Fossil Record |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology | accessdate=2014-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early [[Cretaceous]], after flowering plants came to dominate many environments. The fern ''[[Osmunda claytoniana]]'' is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis; paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.&lt;ref name="pmid24653037"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bomfleur B, McLoughlin S, Vajda V |title=Fossilized nuclei and chromosomes reveal 180 million years of genomic stasis in royal ferns |journal=Science |volume=343 |issue=6177 |pages=1376–7 |date=March 2014  |pmid=24653037 |doi=10.1126/science.1249884 |url=http://nrm.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:719316/FULLTEXT01|bibcode=2014Sci...343.1376B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as [[biofertilizer]], as [[ornamental plants]] and for remediating contaminated soil. They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere. Some fern species are significant weeds.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} They also play certain roles in mythology and art.

==Description==
[[File:Ferns at melb botanical gardens.jpg|thumb|Ferns at the Royal Melbourne Botanical Gardens]]
[[File:Ferns02.jpg|thumb|Tree ferns, probably ''[[Dicksonia antarctica]],'' growing in Nunniong, Australia]]
Like the sporophytes of seed plants, those of ferns consist of stems, leaves and roots.

[[Plant stem|Stems]]: Fern stems are often referred to as [[rhizome]]s, even though they grow underground only in some of the species. Epiphytic species and many of the terrestrial ones have above-ground creeping [[stolon]]s (e.g., [[Polypodiaceae]]), and many groups have above-ground erect semi-woody trunks (e.g., [[Cyatheaceae]]). These can reach up to {{convert|20|m|ft|sp=us}} tall in a few species (e.g., ''[[Cyathea brownii]]'' on [[Norfolk Island]] and ''[[Cyathea medullaris]]'' in [[New Zealand]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mark F. |last1=Large |first2=John E. |last2=Braggins |date=2004 |title=Tree Ferns |publisher=Timber Press | isbn=0881926302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leaf]]: The [[green]], [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] part of the plant is technically a [[microphyll#evolution of leaves: microphyll and megaphyll|megaphyll]] and in ferns, it is often referred to as a ''[[frond]]''. New leaves typically expand by the unrolling of a tight spiral called a crozier or [[fiddlehead fern]]. This uncurling of the leaf is termed [[circinate vernation]]. Leaves are divided into two types a trophophyll and a sporophyll. A [[trophophyll]] frond is a vegetative leaf analogous to the typical green leaves of seed plants that does not produce spores, instead only producing sugars by photosynthesis. A [[sporophyll]] frond is a fertile leaf that produces spores borne in [[sporangia]] that are usually clustered to form [[sorus|sori]]. In most ferns, fertile leaves are morphologically very similar to the sterile ones, and they photosynthesize in the same way. In some groups, the fertile leaves are much narrower than the sterile leaves, and may even have no green tissue at all (e.g., [[Blechnaceae]], [[Lomariopsidaceae]]). The anatomy of fern leaves can either be simple or highly divided. In tree ferns, the main stalk that connects the leaf to the stem (known as the stipe), often has multiple leaflets. The leafy structures that grow from the stipe are known as pinnae and are often again divided into smaller pinnules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basicbiology.net/plants/ferns/fronds.php|title=Fern Fronds|publisher=Basic Biology|accessdate=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Root]]s: The underground non-photosynthetic structures that take up water and nutrients from [[soil]]. They are always [[fibrous root system|fibrous]] and structurally are very similar to the roots of seed plants.

Like all other vascular plants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase or generation in the life cycle. The gametophytes of ferns, however, are very different from those of seed plants. They are free-living and resemble [[liverworts]], whereas those of seed plants develop within the spore wall and are dependent on the parent sporophyte for their nutrition. A fern gametophyte typically consists of:
* Prothallus: A green, photosynthetic structure that is one cell thick, usually heart or kidney shaped, 3–10&amp;nbsp;mm long and 2–8&amp;nbsp;mm broad. The prothallus produces gametes by means of:
** [[Antheridium|Antheridia]]: Small spherical structures that produce [[flagellum|flagellate]] sperm.
** [[Archegonium|Archegonia]]: A flask-shaped structure that produces a single egg at the bottom, reached by the sperm by swimming down the neck.
* [[Rhizoid]]s: [[root]]-like structures (not true roots) that consist of single greatly elongated cells, that absorb water and mineral [[salts]] over the whole structure. Rhizoids anchor the prothallus to the soil.

==Taxonomy==

Ferns first appear in the fossil record in the early [[Carboniferous]] period. By the [[Triassic]], the first evidence of ferns related to several modern families appeared. The great fern radiation occurred in the late [[Cretaceous]], when many modern families of ferns first appeared.

Ferns were traditionally classified in the [[class (biology)|class]] Filices, and later in a [[phylum|Division]] of the Plant Kingdom named [[Pteridophyta]] or Filicophyta. Pteridophyta is no longer recognised as a valid [[taxon]] because it is [[paraphyletic]]. The ferns are also referred to as Polypodiophyta or, when treated as a subdivision of [[Tracheophyta]] (vascular plants), Polypodiopsida, although this name sometimes only refers to leptosporangiate ferns. Traditionally, all of the spore producing [[vascular plant]]s were informally denominated the [[pteridophyte]]s, rendering the term synonymous with ferns and [[fern allies]]. This can be confusing because members of the division Pteridophyta were also denominated pteridophytes (''sensu stricto'').

Traditionally, three discrete groups have been denominated ferns: two groups of eusporangiate ferns, the families [[Ophioglossaceae]] ([[Ophioglossum|adder's tongues]], [[moonwort]]s, and grape ferns) and [[Marattiaceae]]; and the leptosporangiate ferns. The Marattiaceae are a primitive group of tropical ferns with large, fleshy rhizomes and are now thought to be a [[sister group|sibling taxon]] to the leptosporangiate ferns. Several other groups of species were considered fern allies: the [[clubmoss]]es, [[spikemoss]]es, and [[Isoëtes|quillworts]] in [[Lycopodiophyta]]; the whisk ferns of [[Psilotaceae]]; and the horsetails of [[Equisetaceae]]. Since this grouping is polyphyletic, the term fern allies should be abandoned, except in a historical context.{{sfn|Christenhusz|Chase|2014}} More recent genetic studies demonstrated that the Lycopodiophyta are more distantly related to other [[vascular plant]]s, having radiated evolutionarily at the base of the vascular plant [[clade]], while both the whisk ferns and horsetails are as much true ferns as the [[ophioglossoid fern]]s and [[Marattiaceae]]. In fact, the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns are demonstrably a [[clade]], and the [[horsetail]]s and [[Marattiaceae]] are arguably another clade.

=== Molecular phylogenetics ===

Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the [[molecular phylogenetic]] era, and considered the ferns as monilophytes, as follows:{{sfn|Smith et al. 2006}}
* [[Division (botany)|Division]] [[Tracheophyta]] (tracheophytes) - vascular plants
** [[Subdivision (botany)|Sub division]] [[Euphyllophytina]] (euphyllophytes)
*** Infradivision [[Moniliformopses]] ('''monilophytes''')
*** Infradivision [[Spermatophyta]] - seed plants, ~260,000 species
** Subdivision [[Lycopodiophyta]] (lycophytes) - less than 1% of extant vascular plants

Molecular data, which remain poorly constrained for many parts of the plants' phylogeny, have been supplemented by morphological observations supporting the inclusion of Equisetaceae in the ferns, notably relating to the construction of their sperm and peculiarities of their roots.{{sfn|Smith et al. 2006}} However, there remained differences of opinion about the placement of the genus ''[[Equisetum]]'' (see [[Equisetopsida]] for further discussion). One possible solution was to denominate only the leptosporangiate ferns as true ferns while denominating the other three groups as fern allies. In practice, numerous classification schemes have been proposed for ferns and fern allies, and there has been little consensus among them.

The leptosporangiate ferns are sometimes called true ferns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stace |first=Clive |authorlink = Clive Stace |year=2010b |title=New Flora of the British Isles |edition=3rd |publication-place=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70772-5 |page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group includes most plants familiarly known as ferns. Modern research supports older ideas based on morphology that the Osmundaceae diverged early in the evolutionary history of the leptosporangiate ferns; in certain ways this family is intermediate between the eusporangiate ferns and the leptosporangiate ferns. Rai and Graham (2010) broadly supported the primary groups, but queried their relationships, concluding that "at present perhaps the best that can be said about all relationships among the major lineages of monilophytes in current studies is that we do not understand them very well".&lt;ref name=RaiGraham2010&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rai |first=Hardeep S. |last2=Graham |first2=Sean W. |year=2010 |title=Utility of a large, multigene plastid data set in inferring higher-order relationships in ferns and relatives (monilophytes) |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=1444–1456 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900305 |lastauthoramp=yes |pmid=21616899}}, p. 1450&lt;/ref&gt; Grewe et al. (2013) confirmed the inclusion of horsetails within ferns ''sensu lato'', but also suggested that uncertainties remained in their precise placement.&lt;ref name=Grew13/&gt; Other classifications have raised Ophioglossales to the rank of a fifth class, separating the whisk ferns and ophioglossoid ferns.&lt;ref name=Grew13/&gt;

One problem with the classification of ferns is that of [[Species complex#Cryptic species|cryptic species]]. A cryptic species is a species that is morphologically similar to another species, but differs genetically in ways that prevent fertile interbreeding. A good example of this is the currently designated species ''[[Asplenium trichomanes]]'' (maidenhair spleenwort). This is actually a species complex that includes distinct diploid and tetraploid races. There are minor but unclear morphological differences between the two groups, which prefer distinctly differing habitats. In many cases such as this, the species complexes have been separated into separate species, thus raising the total number of species of ferns. Possibly many more cryptic species are yet to be discovered and designated.

===Phylogeny===

The ferns are related to other higher order taxa, as shown in the following cladogram:{{sfn|Christenhusz|Chase|2014}}{{sfn|Cantino et al|2007}}{{sfn|Chase|Reveal|2009}}{{sfn|Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group|2016}}

=== Subdivision ===
{{See also|List of fern families}}
Smith's 2006 classification treated the ferns as four classes:{{sfn|Smith et al.2006}}{{sfn|Schuettpelz|2007}}
* [[Psilotopsida]] 2 orders ([[Psilotaceae|whisk ferns]] and [[ophioglossoid fern]]s) ~92 species 
* [[Equisetopsida]] (Sphenopsida) 1 order, [[Equisetales]] ([[Horsetail]]s) ~ 15 species
* [[Marattiopsida]] 1 order, [[Marattiales]] ~ 150 species
* [[Polypodiopsida]] (Filicopsida) 7 orders ([[leptosporangiate fern]]s) ~ 9,000 species

In addition they defined 11 orders and 37 families.{{sfn|Smith et al.2006}} That system was a consensus of a number of studies, and was further refined.&lt;ref name=Grew13&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grewe|first=Felix|title=Complete plastid genomes from Ophioglossum californicum, Psilotum nudum, and Equisetum hyemale reveal an ancestral land plant genome structure and resolve the position of Equisetales among monilophytes|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-13-8|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/13/8|accessdate=2013-05-21|issn=1471-2148|display-authors=etal|pmid=23311954|pmc=3553075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karol|first=Kenneth G|title=Complete plastome sequences of Equisetum arvense and Isoetes flaccida: implications for phylogeny and plastid genome evolution of early land plant lineages|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|volume=10|pages=321–336|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-321|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/321|accessdate=2013-05-21|issn=1471-2148|pmid=20969798|pmc=3087542|issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phylogenetic relationships are shown in the following [[cladogram]] (to the level of orders).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = F-W | last2 = Kuo | first2 = L-Y | last3 = Rothfels | first3 = CJ | last4 = Ebihara | first4 = A | last5 = Chiou | first5 = W-L | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = rbcL and matK Earn Two Thumbs Up as the Core DNA Barcode for Ferns | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 10| page = e26597 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026597 | pmid=22028918 | pmc=3197659| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626597L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This division into four major clades was then confirmed using [[plant morphology|morphology]] alone.{{sfn|Schneider et al|2009}}
{{Fern cladogram.show(Orders &amp; Outgroups)}}

Subsequently, [[Mark W. Chase|Chase]] and [[James L. Reveal|Reveal]] considered both lycopods and ferns as subclasses of a class Equisetopsida ([[Embryophyta]]) encompassing all land plants. This is referred to as  [[Equisetopsida sensu lato|Equisetopsida]] ''[[sensu lato]]'' to distinguish it from the narrower use to refer to horsetails alone, [[Equisetopsida]] ''sensu stricto''. They placed the lycopods into subclass Lycopodiidae and the ferns, keeping the term monilophytes, into five subclasses, Equisetidae, Ophioglossidae, Psilotidae, Marattiidae and Polypodiidae, by dividing Smith's Psilotopsida into its two orders and elevating them to subclass (Ophioglossidae and Psilotidae).{{sfn|Chase|Reveal|2009}} Christenhusz et al.{{efn|President, International Association of Pteridologists}} (2011) followed this use of subclasses but recombined Smith's Psilotopsida as Ophioglossidae, giving four subclasses of ferns again.{{sfn|Christenhusz et al|2011}}

[[Christenhusz]] and [[Mark Chase|Chase]] (2014) developed a new classification of ferns and lycopods. They used the term Polypodiophyta for the ferns, subdivided like Smith et al. into four groups (shown with equivalents in the Smith system), with 21 families, approximately 212 genera and 10,535 species;{{sfn|Christenhusz|Chase|2014}}
* [[Equisetidae]] (=Equisetopsida) - [[monotypic]] (Equisetales, [[Equisetaceae]], ''[[Equisetum]]'') horsetails ~ 20 species)
* [[Ophioglossidae]] (=Psilotopsida) - 2 monotypic orders ~ 92 species
* [[Marattiidae]] (=Marattiopsida) - 1 monotypic order (Marattiales, [[Marattiaceae]], 2 subfamilies) ~ 130 species
* [[Polypodiidae (plant)|Polypodiidae]] (=Polypodiopsida) - 7 orders

This was a considerable reduction in the number of families from the 37 in the system of Smith et al., since the approach was more that of [[lumping]] rather than splitting. For instance a number of families were reduced to subfamilies. Subsequently, a [[consensus]] group was formed, the [[Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group]] (PPG), analogous to the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]], publishing their first complete classification in November 2016. They recognise ferns as a class, the Polypodiopsida, with four subclasses as described by Christenhusz and Chase, and which are phylogenetically related as in this cladogram:{{sfn|Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group|2016}}
{{clade
|label1='''Polypodiopsida'''
|1={{clade

|2={{clade
   |1=[[Ophioglossidae]]
   |2={{clade
|      1=[[Marattiidae]]
|      2=[[Polypodiidae (plant)|Polypodiidae]]}}
}}}}}}

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification the Polypodiopsida consist of four subclasses, 11 orders, 48 families, 319 genera, and an estimated 10,578 species. Thus Polypodiopsida in the broad sense (''sensu lato'') as used by the PPG (Polypodiopsida ''sensu'' PPG) needs to be distinguished from the narrower usage (''sensu stricto'') of Smith et al. (Polypodiopsida ''sensu'' Smith et al.){{sfn|Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group|2016}}

==Ecology==
[[File:sa-fern.jpg|thumb|Ferns at Muir Woods, California]]
The stereotypical image of ferns growing in moist shady woodland nooks is far from a complete picture of the habitats where ferns can be found growing. Fern species live in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, from remote [[mountain]] elevations, to dry [[desert]] rock faces, to bodies of water or in open fields. Ferns in general may be thought of as largely being specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of [[flowering plant]]s. Some ferns are among the world's most serious weed species, including the [[bracken]] fern growing in the Scottish highlands, or the mosquito fern (''[[Azolla]]'') growing in tropical lakes, both species forming large aggressively spreading colonies. There are four particular types of habitats that ferns are found in: moist, shady [[forest]]s; crevices in rock faces, especially when sheltered from the full sun; acid wetlands including [[bog]]s and [[swamp]]s; and tropical [[tree]]s, where many species are [[epiphyte]]s (something like a quarter to a third of all fern species&lt;ref name="schuettpelz"&gt;Schuettpelz, Eric. "Fern Phylogeny Inferred from 400 Leptosporangiate Species and Three Plastid Genes," contained in "The Evolution and Diversification of Epiphytic Ferns." Doctoral dissertation, Duke University. 2007. http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/10161/181/1/D_Schuettpelz_Eric_a_052007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

Especially the epiphytic ferns have turned out to be hosts of a huge diversity of invertebrates. It is assumed that [[bird's-nest fern]]s alone contain up to half the invertebrate biomass within a hectare of [[rainforest]] canopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/2004/06/ferns-brimming-life Ferns Brimming With Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ferns depend on associations with [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. Many ferns grow only within specific pH ranges; for instance, the climbing fern (''[[Lygodium palmatum]]'') of eastern [[North America]] will grow only in moist, intensely [[acid]] soils, while the bulblet bladder fern (''[[Cystopteris bulbifera]]''), with an overlapping range, is found only on [[limestone]].

The spores are rich in [[lipid]]s, [[protein]] and [[calories]], so some vertebrates eat these. The [[European woodmouse]] (''Apodemus sylvaticus'') has been found to eat the spores of ''[[Culcita macrocarpa]]'' and the [[bullfinch]] (''Pyrrhula murina'') and the [[New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat]] (''Mystacina tuberculata'') also eat fern spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8523000/8523825.stm|title=A mouse that eats ferns like a dinosaur|last=Walker|first=Matt|date=19 February 2010|publisher=BBC Earth News|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Onoclea sensibilis 3 crop.JPG|thumb|right|Gametophyte ([[Thallus|thalloid]] green mass) and sporophyte (ascendent frond) of ''[[Onoclea sensibilis]]'']]
Ferns are [[vascular plant]]s differing from [[lycophyte]]s by having true [[leaf|leaves]] (megaphylls), which are often [[pinnate]]. They differ from [[spermatophyte|seed plant]]s ([[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s) in reproducing by means of spores and they lack [[flower]]s and [[seed]]s. Like all [[embryophyte|land plants]], they have a [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] referred to as [[alternation of generations]], characterized by alternating [[diploid]] [[sporophyte|sporophytic]] and [[haploid]] [[gametophyte|gametophytic]] phases. The diploid sporophyte has 2''n'' paired [[chromosome]]s, where ''n'' varies from species to species. The haploid gametophyte has ''n'' unpaired chromosomes, i.e. half the number of the sporophyte. The gametophyte of ferns is a free-living organism, whereas the gametophyte of the gymnosperms and angiosperms is dependent on the sporophyte.

The life cycle of a typical fern proceeds as follows:
# A diploid sporophyte phase produces haploid [[spore]]s by [[meiosis]] (a process of cell division which reduces the number of chromosomes by a half).
# A spore grows into a free-living haploid gametophyte by [[mitosis]] (a process of cell division which maintains the number of chromosomes). The gametophyte typically consists of a photosynthetic [[prothallus]].
# The gametophyte produces [[gametes]] (often both [[sperm]] and [[Ovum|egg]]s on the same prothallus) by mitosis.
# A mobile, [[flagellum|flagellate]] sperm fertilizes an egg that remains attached to the prothallus.
# The fertilized egg is now a diploid [[zygote]] and grows by mitosis into a diploid sporophyte (the typical fern plant).

==Uses==

Ferns are not as important economically as seed plants but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of ''Pteridium aquilinum'' ([[bracken]]), ''Matteuccia struthiopteris'' ([[ostrich fern]]), and ''Osmundastrum cinnamomeum'' ([[cinnamon fern]]). ''[[Diplazium esculentum]]'' is also used by some tropical persons (for example in ''budu pakis'', a traditional dish of [[Brunei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indigenous Fermented Foods of Southeast Asia|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as food. Tubers from the "para", ''[[Ptisana salicina]]'' (king fern) are a traditional food in [[New Zealand]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Fern tubers were used for food 30,000 years ago in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19597-stone-age-humans-liked-their-burgers-in-a-bun.html "Stone Age humans liked their burgers in a bun"], Sonia Van Gilder Cooke, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 23 October 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1006993107 "Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing"] by Anna Revedin et al., [[PNAS]], published online 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fern tubers were used by the [[Guanches]] to make [[gofio]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. Ferns are generally not known to be poisonous to humans.&lt;ref name="edible plant"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Official Pocket Edible Plant Survival Manual | publisher=Freedom and Liberty Foundation Press | last=Pelton |first=Robert | year=2011 | page=25 | id=[[Barnes &amp; Noble|BNID]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=2940013382145 2940013382145]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Licorice fern]] [[rhizome]]s were chewed by the natives of the [[Pacific Northwest]] for their flavor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Ferns of the genus ''[[Azolla]]'' are very small, floating plants that do not resemble ferns. Called the mosquito fern, they are used as a biological fertilizer in the rice paddies of southeast Asia, taking advantage of their ability to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] from the air into compounds that can then be used by other plants.[http://www.feedipedia.org/node/565]

Many ferns are grown in [[horticulture]] as landscape plants, for [[foliage|cut foliage]] and as [[houseplant]]s, especially the [[Boston fern]] (''Nephrolepis exaltata'') and other members of the genus ''[[Nephrolepis]]''. The [[Asplenium nidus|bird's nest fern]] (''Asplenium nidus'') is also popular, as are the [[staghorn fern]]s (genus ''Platycerium''). Perennial (also known as hardy) ferns planted in gardens in the northern hemisphere also have a considerable following.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Several ferns are noxious [[weed]]s or [[invasive species]], including Japanese climbing fern (''[[Lygodium japonicum]]''), mosquito fern and [[sensitive fern]] (''Onoclea sensibilis''). Giant water fern (''[[Salvinia molesta]]'') is one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. The important fossil fuel [[coal]] consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Ferns have been studied and found to be useful in the removal of heavy metals, especially arsenic, from the soil. Other ferns with some economic significance include:{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* ''[[Dryopteris filix-mas]]'' (male fern), used as a [[vermifuge]], and formerly in the [[US Pharmacopeia]]; also, this fern accidentally sprouting in a bottle resulted in [[Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward]]'s 1829 invention of the terrarium or [[Wardian case]]
* ''[[Rumohra adiantiformis]]'' (floral fern), extensively used in the [[floristry|florist]] trade
* ''[[Microsorum pteropus]]'' (Java fern), one of the most popular freshwater [[List of freshwater aquarium plant species|aquarium plants]].
* ''[[Osmunda regalis]]'' (royal fern) and ''[[Osmunda cinnamomea]]'' (cinnamon fern), the root fiber being used horticulturally; the fiddleheads of ''O. cinnamomea'' are also used as a cooked vegetable
* ''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]'' (ostrich fern), the fiddleheads used as a cooked vegetable in North America
* ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]] or Pteridium esculentum'' (bracken), the fiddleheads used as a cooked vegetable in Japan and are believed{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} to be responsible for the high rate of stomach cancer in Japan. It is also one of the world's most important agricultural weeds, especially in the British highlands, and often poisons cattle and horses.
* ''[[Diplazium esculentum]]'' (vegetable fern), a source of food for some native societies
* ''[[Pteris|Pteris vittata]]'' (brake fern), used to absorb [[arsenic]] from the soil
* ''Polypodium glycyrrhiza'' (licorice fern), roots chewed for their pleasant flavor
* [[Tree fern]]s, used as building material in some tropical areas
* ''[[Cyathea cooperi]]'' (Australian tree fern), an important invasive species in Hawaii
* [[Parkeriaceae|''Ceratopteris'']] ''richardii'', a model plant for teaching and research, often called C-fern

==Culture==
[[File:Nature print, Alois Auer.jpg|thumb|''Blätter des Manns Walfarn.'' by [[Alois Auer]], Vienna: Imperial Printing Office, 1853]]

===Pteridologist===
The study of ferns and other pteridophytes is called '''pteridology'''. A '''pteridologist''' is a specialist in the study of pteridophytes in a broader sense that includes the more distantly related [[lycophyte]]s.

===Pteridomania===
[[Pteridomania]] is a term for the [[Victorian era]] [[Fads and trends|craze]] of fern [[collecting]] and fern motifs in [[decorative art]] including [[pottery]], [[glass]], [[metal]]s, [[textile]]s, [[wood]], [[printing|printed paper]], and [[sculpture]] "appearing on everything from [[infant baptism|christening]] presents to [[gravestone]]s and memorials." The fashion for growing ferns indoors led to the development of the [[Wardian case]], a glazed cabinet that would exclude air pollutants and maintain the necessary humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Peter D. A. | last = Boyd | title = Pteridomania - the Victorian passion for ferns | version = Revised: web version | publisher = Antique Collecting 28, 6, 9–12. | date = 2 January 2002 | url = http://www.peterboyd.com/pteridomania.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barnsley fern plotted with VisSim.PNG|thumb|right|[[Barnsley fern]] created using [[chaos game]], through an [[Iterated function system]] (IFS).]]
The dried form of ferns was also used in other arts, being used as a stencil or directly inked for use in a design. The botanical work, ''[[The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland]]'', is a notable example of this type of [[nature printing]]. The process, patented by the artist and publisher Henry Bradbury, impressed a specimen on to a soft lead plate. The first publication to demonstrate this was [[Alois Auer]]'s ''The Discovery of the Nature Printing-Process''.

[[Fern bar]]s were popular in America in the 1970s and 80s.

===Folklore===
Ferns figure in folklore, for example in legends about mythical flowers or seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02860848 | title = The economic uses and associated folklore of ferns and fern allies | year = 1978 | last1 = May | first1 = Lenore Wile | journal = The Botanical Review | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–528 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Slavic folklore]], ferns are believed to bloom once a year, during the [[Ivan Kupala Day|Ivan Kupala]] night. Although alleged to be exceedingly difficult to find, anyone who sees a [[fern flower]] is thought to be guaranteed to be happy and rich for the rest of their life. Similarly, [[Finland|Finnish]] tradition holds that one who finds the [[seed]] of a fern in bloom on [[Midsummer]] night will, by possession of it, be guided and be able to travel invisibly to the locations where eternally blazing [[Will o' the wisp]]s called [[aarnivalkea]] mark the spot of hidden [[treasure]]. These spots are protected by a spell that prevents anyone but the fern-seed holder from ever knowing their locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunalahti.fi/~marian1/gourmet/season5a.htm |title=Traditional Finnish Midsummer celebration |publisher=Saunalahti.fi |accessdate=2013-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisms confused with ferns==

===Misnomers===

Several non-fern plants (and even animals) are called ferns and are sometimes confused with true ferns. These include:
* Asparagus fern—This may apply to one of several species of the [[monocotyledon|monocot]] genus ''[[Asparagus (genus)|Asparagus]]'', which are flowering plants.
* Sweetfern—A flowering shrub of the genus ''[[Comptonia (plant)|Comptonia]]''.
* [[Air fern]]—A group of [[animal]]s called [[hydrozoa]]n that are distantly related to [[jellyfish]] and [[coral]]s. They are harvested, dried, dyed green, and then sold as a plant that can live on air. While it may look like a fern, it is merely the skeleton of this [[Colony (biology)|colonial animal]].
* Fern bush—''[[Chamaebatiaria|Chamaebatiaria millefolium]]''—a rose family shrub with fern-like leaves.
* Fern tree—''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia]]''—an [[ornamental tree]] of the order [[Lamiales]].

===Fern-like flowering plants===

Some [[Angiosperms|flowering plants]] such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] and members of the [[Apiaceae|carrot family]] have [[pinnate]] leaves that somewhat resemble fern fronds. However, these plants have fully developed seeds contained in fruits, rather than the microscopic spores of ferns.

[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v60/i14/p1351_1]&lt;/ref&gt; have studied an interaction of [[Photon polarization|polarized photons]] and these have demonstrated that the phenomenon does occur. However, the consequence of these experiments is only that past events can be inferred after their occurrence as a probabilistic wave collapse. These weak measurements are considered to be an observation themselves, and therefore part of the causation of wave collapse, making the objective results only a probabilistic function rather than a fixed reality. However, a careful analysis of the experiment shows that Hardy's paradox only proves that a local hidden variable theory can not exist, as there can not be a theory that assumes that the system meets the states of reality regardless of the interaction with the measuring apparatus.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}This confirms that a quantum theory, to be consistent with the experiments, must be non-local (in the sense of Bell) and contextual.

==Setup description and the results==

[[File:hardys paradox.png|right|350px|thumb|Setup for Hardy's thought experiment]]

The basic building block of Hardy’s thought experiment are two [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]]s for quantum particles and antiparticles. We will describe the case using electrons and positrons. Each interferometer consists of bent paths and two beam splitters (labeled BS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and BS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the accompanying diagram) and is tuned so that when operating individually, particles always exit to the same particle detector (the ones labeled "c" in the diagram – "c" is for "constructive interference" and "d" is for "destructive interference"). For example, for the right-hand side interferometer, when operating alone, entering electrons (labeled ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) become a [[quantum superposition]] of electrons taking the path ''v''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and electrons taking path 
''w''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in the diagram, the latter part of the ''w''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; path is labeled ''u&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''), but these constructively interfere and thus always exit in arm c&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; |e^-\rangle \to \frac{|v^-\rangle + i |w^-\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \to i |c^-\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, positrons (labeled e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are always detected at c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
In the actual experiment the interferometers are arranged so that part of their paths overlap as shown in the diagram. If the amplitude for the particle in one arm, say w&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, were to be obstructed by a second particle in w&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that collides with it, only the ''v'' amplitude would reach the second beam splitter and would split into arms c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with equal amplitudes. The detection of a particle in d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; would thus indicate the presence of the obstructing particle, but ''without'' an annihilation taking place. For this reason, this scheme was named [[interaction-free measurement]].

If (classically speaking) both the electron and the positron take the ''w'' paths in their respective interferometers, they will annihilate to produce two gamma rays: &lt;math&gt;|w^+\rangle |w^-\rangle \to |\gamma\rangle |\gamma\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. There is a 1 in 4 chance of this happening. We can express the state of the system, before the final beam splitters, as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2\left(|v^+\rangle |v^-\rangle + i |v^+\rangle |w^-\rangle + i |w^+\rangle |v^-\rangle - |\gamma\rangle |\gamma\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the &lt;math&gt;|c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; detectors click for &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|v\rangle + i |w\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;|d\rangle&lt;/math&gt; detectors for &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|v\rangle - i |w\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;|e^+ e^-\rangle \to \frac14 \left(3|c^+\rangle |c^-\rangle + |c^+\rangle |d^-\rangle + |d^+\rangle |c^-\rangle - |d^+\rangle |d^-\rangle - 2|\gamma\rangle |\gamma\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these amplitudes, this means a 9 in 16 chance of each particle being detected in its respective ''c'' detector, a 1 in 16 chance for one particle being detected in its ''c'' detector and the other in its ''d'' detector, or for both being detected in their ''d'' detectors, and a 4 in 16 (1 in 4) chance that the electron and positron annihilate, so neither is detected. Notice that a detection in both ''d'' detectors is represented by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|v^+\rangle - i |w^+\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{|v^-\rangle - i |w^-\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} =
\frac 1 2\left(|v^+\rangle |v^-\rangle - i |v^+\rangle |w^-\rangle - i |w^+\rangle |v^-\rangle - |w^+\rangle |w^-\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is not orthogonal to the expression above for the state before the final beam splitters. The scalar product between them is 1/4, showing that there is a 1 in 16 chance of this happening, paradoxically.

The situation can be analyzed in terms of two simultaneous interaction-free measurements: from the point of view of the interferometer on the left, a click at d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; implies the presence of the obstructing electron in u&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, for the interferometer on the right, a click at d&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; implies the presence of the positron in u&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, every time a click is recorded at d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (or d&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), the other particle is found in u&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (or u&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; respectively). If we assume the particles are independent (described by [[local hidden variables]]), we conclude that they can never emerge simultaneously in d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. This would imply that they were in u&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and u&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which cannot occur because of the annihilation process.

A paradox then arises because sometimes the particles do emerge simultaneously at d&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (with probability ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/16). Quantum mechanically, the &lt;math&gt;|d^+\rangle |d^-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; term arises, in fact, from the nonmaximally entangled nature of the state just before the final beam splitters.

An article by [[Yakir Aharonov]] and colleagues in 2001&lt;ref&gt;
[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0104062 Revisiting Hardy’s Paradox: Counterfactual Statements, Real Measurements, Entanglement and Weak Values], by [[Yakir Aharonov]] ''et al.'', 2001.
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the number of electrons or positrons in each branch is theoretically observable and is 0 in the ''w'' branches and 1 in the ''v'' branches. And yet, the number of electron–positron ''pairs'' in any combination is ''also'' observable and is not given by the product of the single-particle values. So we find that the number of ''ww'' pairs (both particles in their ''w'' path) is 0, each ''wv'' pair is 1, and ''the number in the vv combination is −1''! They proposed a way that this could be observed physically by temporarily trapping the electron and the positron in the ''v'' paths in boxes and noting the effect of their mutual electrostatic attraction. They stated that one would actually find a repulsion between the boxes.

In 2009 [[Jeff Lundeen]] and [[Aephraim Steinberg]] published work&lt;ref name=Lundeen/&gt; in which they set up a "Hardy's paradox" system using photons. A 405&amp;nbsp;nm laser goes through a [[barium borate]] crystal to produce pairs of 810&amp;nbsp;nm photons with polarizations orthogonal to each other. These then hit a beam splitter, which sends photons back to the barium borate crystal with 50% probability. The 405&amp;nbsp;nm pumping beam also bounces from a mirror and comes back to the barium borate. If both the 810&amp;nbsp;nm photons come back to the crystal, they are annihilated by interaction with the returning pump beam. In any case, the beam of photons that make it through the crystal and the beam of photons that pass through the beam splitter are both separated into "vertically polarized" and "horizontally polarized" beams, which correspond to the "electrons" and the "positrons" of Hardy's scheme. The two "electron" beams (the photons with one kind of polarization) are united at a beam splitter and go to one or two detectors, and the same for the "positrons" (the other photons). Classically, no photons should be detected at what the authors call the "dark ports" because if they take both directions from the first beam splitter, they will interfere with themselves, whereas if they take only one path, then one cannot detect them both at the dark ports because of the paradox. By introducing a 20° rotation in polarization and using [[half-wave plate]]s on certain beams, and then measuring coincidence rates at the detectors, they were able to make [[weak measurement]]s that allowed them to calculate the "occupation" of different arms (paths) and combinations. As predicted by Aharonov and colleagues, they found a negative value for the combination in which both photons take the outer (no-annihilation) route. The results were not exactly as predicted, and they attribute this to imperfect switching (annihilation) and [[interaction-free measurement]]s.

'''Ivor Novello''' (15 January 1893 –  6 March 1951), born '''David Ivor Davies''', was a Welsh composer and actor who became one of the most popular British entertainers of the first half of the 20th century.

He was born into a musical family, and his first successes were as a songwriter. His first big hit was [[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|"Keep the Home Fires Burning"]] (1914), which was enormously popular during the First World War. His 1917 show, ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'', was a wartime hit. After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. He wrote his musicals in the style of [[operetta]] and often composed his music to the [[libretto|libretti]] of [[Christopher Hassall]].

In the 1920s, he turned to acting, first in British films and then on stage, with considerable success in both.  He starred in two silent films directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both 1927).  On stage, he played the title character in the first London production of ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926). Novello briefly went to [[Hollywood]], but he soon returned to Britain, where he had more successes, especially on stage, appearing in his own lavish West End productions of musicals. The best known of these were ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Dancing Years]]'' (1939). 

From the 1930s, he often performed with [[Zena Dare]], writing parts for her in his works.  He continued to write for film, but he had his biggest late successes with stage musicals: ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945), ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949) and ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] were named after him in 1955.

Novello was born in [[Cardiff]], Wales, to David Davies (c. 1852–1931), a rent collector for the city council,&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Snelson, John. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35264 "Novello, Ivor (1893–1951)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 17 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, [[Clara Novello Davies]], an internationally known singing teacher and choral conductor.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Webb, Paul. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20146 "Novello, Ivor",] ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 17 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, Novello was a successful singer in the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Welsh Eisteddfod]].&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; His mother set up as voice teacher in London, where he met leading performers, including members of [[George Edwardes]]'s [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] company, classical musicians such as [[Landon Ronald]], and singers such as [[Adelina Patti]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another of his mother's associates was [[Clara Butt]], who taught him to sing "[[Abide with Me]]" when he was a boy of six.&lt;ref name=tls/&gt;

Novello was educated privately in Cardiff and then in Gloucester, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with [[Herbert Brewer]], the cathedral organist.&lt;ref name=Grdn&gt;[[Simon Callow|Callow, Simon]]. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/03/ivor-novello-musicals-simon-callow "Ivor Novello, master of the musical"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; From there he won a scholarship to [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]] in [[Oxford]], where he was a solo treble in the college choir. He later said that this prolonged youthful exposure to early sacred choral music had turned his tastes, in reaction, to lush romantic music.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Although Brewer had told him he would not have a career in music,&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Novello from his early youth showed a facility for writing songs, and when he was only 15, one of his songs was published.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 7 March 1951, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, he gave piano lessons in Cardiff, and then moved to London in 1913 with his mother. They took a flat above the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], which became his London home for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibell, P. (2010) ''Theatreland: A Journey Through the Heart of London's Theatre'', p. 89, London: Bloomsbury Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1847250032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London he found a mentor in [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Sir Edward Marsh]], a well-known patron of the arts. Marsh encouraged him to compose and introduced him to people who could help his career.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He adopted part of his mother's maiden name, "Novello" as his professional surname, although he did not change it legally until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, at the start of the First World War, Novello wrote [[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|"Keep the Home Fires Burning"]], a song that expressed the feelings of innumerable families sundered by [[World War I]]. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American [[Lena Guilbert Ford]], and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' states that the song dates from 1915, but the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' gives the date as 1914, a fact confirmed by the [[British Library]] [http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6U6CFV8D8YT61TJ95YFXQS36L1967UNQDCNB164KJNXYL77SCB-02460?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=030723&amp;set_entry=000011&amp;format=999 catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After twice crashing an aeroplane, and with the influence of Marsh, he was moved to the [[Air Ministry]] office in central London performing clerical duties for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=MP57&gt;MacQueen-Pope, pp. 57–62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composer and actor==
[[File:Bobbie-Andrews-1921.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Robert Andrews (actor)|Bobbie Andrews]] in 1921]]
Novello continued to write songs while serving in the RNAS. He had his first stage success with ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' in 1916, a production by [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] with a score composed by Novello and the young [[Jerome Kern]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theodore &amp; Co", ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', September 1916, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Novello contributed to [[André Charlot]]'s revue ''See-Saw''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the [[operetta|operette]] ''Arlette'', for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by [[Jane Vieu]] and Guy le Feuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Findon, B.W. "'Arlette' – An Operette in Three Acts", ''The Play Pictorial, November 1917, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Marsh introduced him to the actor [[Robert Andrews (actor)|Bobbie Andrews]], who became Novello's life partner.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Andrews introduced Novello to the young [[Noël Coward]]. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; He wrote, "I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance".&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 and after the war, Novello continued to write successfully for musical comedy and revue. The former included ''Who's Hooper?'' (1919), an adaptation of a [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]] play, with a book by [[Fred Thompson (writer)|Fred Thompson]], lyrics by [[Clifford Grey]], and music by [[Howard Talbot]] and Novello,&lt;ref&gt;Findon, B. W. "Who's Hooper?", ''The Play Pictorial'', July 1919, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Golden Moth'' by Thompson and [[P. G. Wodehouse]] (1921), for which Novello provided the entire score.&lt;ref&gt;"The Golden Moth", ''The Times'', 6 October 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; For Charlot, he contributed numbers to the revues ''Tabs'' (1918), ''A to Z'' (1921) and ''Puppets'' (1924). For the second of these, his songs included one of his few well-known comedy numbers, "And her mother came too", with lyrics by [[Dion Titheradge]], written for [[Jack Buchanan]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the same time as his successes as a composer, Novello was making a career as an actor.  With "a classic profile that gained him matinee idol status amongst the film-going public",&lt;ref name=oxpop&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/search_results?q=Ivor+Novello&amp;search=quick "Ivor Novello",] ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 16 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was sought out, on the strength of a publicity photograph, by the Swiss film director [[Louis Mercanton]]. Mercanton offered him a silent-film role as the romantic lead in ''The Call of the Blood'' (1920).&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; In the same year, he made another film for Mercanton, ''Miarka''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Novello made his first English film, ''Carnival'', the following year.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[Image:Nina Vanna and Ivor Novello.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nina Vanna and Novello in "[[The Man Without Desire]]" (1923)]]
Novello made his stage debut in 1921 in ''Deburau'' by [[Sacha Guitry]] with [[Robert Loraine]], [[Madge Titheradge]] and Bobbie Andrews,&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 20 October 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and, among other stage engagements, in the next years he played Bingley in an adaptation of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''  with [[Ben Webster (actor)|Ben Webster]] as Darcy and [[Mary Jerrold]] as Elizabeth, in a cast that included [[Ellen Terry]], [[May Whitty]] and [[Joyce Carey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Plays of the Year", ''The Play Pictorial'', October 1922, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; At about this time, Novello had an affair with the writer [[Siegfried Sassoon]]; it was short lived, but in the words of Sassoon's biographer John Stuart Roberts, Novello "was a consummate flirt who collected lovers as he gathered lilacs".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Novello made his American movie debut in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The White Rose (1923 film)|The White Rose]]''. The same year, he starred in "[[The Man Without Desire]]", among other British films.&lt;ref&gt;Duguid, Mark. [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/506532/index.html "''The Man Without Desire'' (1923)"], BFI Screen Online, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He next co-wrote, produced and starred in the successful 1924 play ''The Rat''.&lt;ref&gt;It was credited to the pseudonymous David L'Estrange, but was the work of Novello and his friend, the actress [[Constance Collier]]: see ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; The play was made into a [[The Rat (1925 film)|film]] in 1925, which was so successful that two sequels followed in 1926 and 1928.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His dramatic roles in the West End included the title character in the first London production of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926).&lt;ref&gt;"Duke of York's Theatre", ''The Times'', 24 December 1926, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Other films in which Novello starred included [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'', where he played the sinister title character, and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both in 1927).  The British film company [[Gainsborough Pictures]] offered Novello a lucrative contract, which enabled him to buy a country house in [[Littlewick Green]], near [[Maidenhead]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He renamed the property Redroofs, and he entertained there famously and with little regard for convention. [[Cecil Beaton]], noting the frequent homosexual excesses, coined the phrase, "the Ivor/Noel naughty set".&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Coward had by now caught Novello up professionally, despite a joint disaster when Novello starred in Coward's play ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' in 1927, which was a débâcle, and closed within a month of opening.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), pp.187–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres. ''Sirocco'' to be Withdrawn", ''The Times'', 12 December 1927, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Novello starred in the silent adaptation of Coward's much more successful ''[[The Vortex]]'', and made his last silent film, ''[[A South Sea Bubble]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; During the late 1920s, Novello was the most popular male star in British films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines|editor3-last=Menna|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=626 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novello returned to composing for the lyric stage in 1929, writing eight numbers for the revue ''The House that Jack Built''. In the same year, he presented his own play ''Symphony in Two Flats'', which he took to New York the following year.  It was followed by a successful Broadway production of his ''The Truth Game'', which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. He accepted a contract to write for and appear in [[MGM]] films. He found little to do in Hollywood, however, beyond writing the dialogue for ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ODNB, "he reputedly originated the line that gave rise to the now mythical if inaccurate 'Me Tarzan. You Jane' (originally – with appropriate pointing – 'Tarzan. Jane.')"&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to London, he starred in the sound remake of ''[[The Lodger (1932 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==1930s musicals==
After beginning the 1930s with a series of non-musical plays, ''I Lived With You'' (1932), ''Fresh Fields'', ''Proscenium'', ''Sunshine Sisters'', ''Flies in the Sun'' (all 1933) and ''Murder in Mayfair'' (1934), Novello returned to composition in 1935 with ''[[Glamorous Night]]'', which was the first of a series of enormously popular musicals.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' considered that it was for these that Novello would be popularly remembered.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Paul Webb, in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', writes that Novello's show saved the fortunes of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]:
{{quote|Dominating the British musical theatre from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, his shows were heavily influenced by the operettas that he had grown up with (he saw ''[[Die lustige Witwe]]'' 27 times), but had a highly individual style of their own. Blending musicals with opera, operetta and both modern and classical dance, these shows were considered something of an anachronism in their own time, but that was part of their appeal.|}}
Another model was Coward's 1929 musical ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'', which Novello called "a ''lovely'', lovely thing ... sheer joy from beginning to end". That, too, was an old-fashioned musical, "so full of regret ... for a vanished kindly silly darling age".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Novello to Coward, undated, in Day, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his four 1930s musicals, Novello wrote the book and music, [[Christopher Hassall]] wrote the lyrics, and the orchestrations were by Charles Prentice. ''Glamorous Night''  starred Novello and [[Mary Ellis]], with a cast including [[Zena Dare]], [[Olive Gilbert]] and [[Elizabeth Welch]], and ran from 2 May 1935 to 18 July 1936, at Drury Lane and then the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Theatres", ''The Times'', 2 May 1935, p. 12; and 18 July 1936, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Careless Rapture]]'' ran from 11 September 1936 for 296 performances, with Novello, [[Dorothy Dickson]] and Zena Dare in the leading roles.&lt;ref&gt;"Drury Lane", ''The Times'', 12 September 1936, p. 10; and Gaye, p. 1529&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crest of the Wave (musical)|Crest of the Wave]]'' starred Novello, Dickson and Gilbert, and ran from 1 September 1937 for 203 performances.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The last of Novello's prewar musicals was ''[[The Dancing Years]]'', which starred Novello, Ellis and Gilbert, opened at Drury Lane, closed on the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], and reopened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], running for a combined total of 696 performances, closing on 8 July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1530&lt;/ref&gt; This show was the closest Novello came to fulfilling his mother's early ambitions for him to write operas; he played an Austrian composer-conductor at the [[Vienna State Opera|Wiener Hofoper]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

==Second World War and last years==
Novello presented only two new shows during the Second World War. ''Arc de Triomphe'' (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, was only a modest success, but ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of [[Gasoline|petrol]] coupons, a serious offence under [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#World War II|rationing laws]] in wartime Britain.  An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but the court found that Novello was also culpable.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 234. The offending fan, Dora Grace Constable, escaped with a £50 fine: see ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Not everybody was supportive; Coward's sympathy was limited: "He's been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn't done a thing for the general effort",&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.349; Coward's modified sympathy was later echoed in [[Ewan MacColl]]'s song "Ivor": see MacColl, Ewan. ''Bad Lads and Hard Cases'', Riverside LP 1957&lt;/ref&gt; but when Novello returned to ''The Dancing Years'' after his release, he received "a rapturous ovation" on his first entrance.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Novello's last full-scale production in this style, ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949), was, in Webb's words, "a selfconsciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; After the rigours of war, this escapist entertainment had strong box-office appeal, and ran for 841 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 1533&lt;/ref&gt; The show starred Novello and the cast included [[Phyllis Dare]], Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Bobbie Andrews. It was still running, at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], when Novello's last show opened. This was ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). Novello had written no role for himself; the show starred the comedy actress [[Cicely Courtneidge]] and was a departure from his established pattern, balancing the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; ''The Times'' commented that the show "cheerfully parodied the very [[Ruritania]]n romances to which he owed his most triumphant successes".&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Novello died suddenly from a [[coronary thrombosis]] at the age of 58, a few hours after completing a performance in the run of ''King's Rhapsody''.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], and his ashes are buried beneath a [[lilac]] bush and marked with a plaque that reads "Ivor Novello 6th March 1951 'Till you are home once more'."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2. McFarland &amp; Company (2016) {{ISBN|0786479922}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left an estate worth £160,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27025051 |title=Composer Left £160,000 Estate. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=9 June 1951 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (£{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|160000|1951}}|0}} when adjusted for inflation).

Only a few weeks before Novello's death, Coward had written of him: "Theatre – good, bad and indifferent – is the love of his life. For him, other human endeavours are mere shadows. ... The reward of his work lies in the indisputable fact that whenever and wherever he appears the vast majority of the British public flock to see him."&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Trewin, J. C. "Popular Idol", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 18 May 1951, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' writes of Novello that he was "until the advent of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], the 20th-century's most consistently successful composer of British musicals".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] for songwriting, established in 1955 in Novello's memory, are awarded each year by the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]] (BASCA) to British songwriters and composers as well as to an outstanding international music writer.&lt;ref&gt;Pegler, Martin. ''Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War'', Osprey Publishing, 2014, p. 248 {{ISBN|9781427804150}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarship in memory of Novello was established at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], and in 1952 a bronze bust of him by [[Clemence Dane]] was unveiled at Drury Lane. In [[St. Paul's, Covent Garden]], known as the actors' church, a panel was installed to commemorate Novello, and in 1972, to mark the 21st anniversary of his death, a memorial stone was unveiled in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1993, the centenary of Novello's birth was marked by several celebratory shows around the UK, including one at the [[Players Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=oxpop/&gt; In 2005, the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], above which Novello lived for many years, was renamed the Novello Theatre, with a plaque in his honour set at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1922138 "Ivor Novello plaque, Aldwych"], Geograph.org, accessed 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2009, a statue of Novello was unveiled outside the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in [[Cardiff Bay]]. Plaques detailing some of his best-known songs are fitted to the pedestal, along with a dedication to Novello.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/8121374.stm "Statue honours composer Novello"], BBC News, 27 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Novello's memory is promoted by [[The Ivor Novello Appreciation Bureau]], which holds annual events around Britain, including an annual pilgrimage to [[Redroofs Theatre School|Redroofs]] each June. Redroofs was sold after Novello's death and is now a theatre training school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redroofs.co.uk/about.asp "About us"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310122736/http://www.redroofs.co.uk/about.asp |date=10 March 2011 }}, Redroofs Associates, accessed 16 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Novello was portrayed in [[Robert Altman]]'s 2001 film, ''[[Gosford Park]]'', by [[Jeremy Northam]], and several of his songs were used for the film's soundtrack, including "Waltz of My Heart", "And Her Mother Came Too", "I Can Give You the Starlight", "What a Duke Should Be", "Why Isn't It You?" and "The Land of Might-Have-Been".

==Songs==
Among Novello's well-known songs are "[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1915 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/keepthehomefiresburning.htm 1917 mp3 recording of "Keep the home fires burning"] sung by [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], firstworldwar.com, accessed 20 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "Fold Your Wings", "Shine Through My Dreams", "[[Rose of England]]", "I Can Give You the Starlight", "And Her Mother Came Too", "My Dearest Dear", "The Land of Might-Have-Been", "When I Curtsied to the King", "[[We'll Gather Lilacs]]",&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; "Someday My Heart Will Awake", "Yesterday", "Waltz of My Heart", "Why Isn't It You", "My Life Belongs to You", "Fly Home Little Heart", "Take Your Girl" and "Primrose".

In ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Webb writes that although Novello's oeuvre is generally thought of as "romantic" and "[[Ruritanian]]", his music "was far more varied than his current reputation suggests". Webb contends that such romantic hits as "Someday My Heart Will Awake" were balanced by "rousing operetta choruses ... and jazz age numbers" while {{"'}}Rose of England' is a stately patriotic piece that stands comparison with [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] or [[William Walton|Walton]]".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Akikaze'''''|秋風|Autumn Wind}}&lt;ref&gt;Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. pages 666, 960&lt;/ref&gt; was a {{sclass-|Minekaze|destroyer}}, built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] immediately following the end of [[World War I]]. The ''Minekaze'' class of destroyers were considered advanced for their time; these ships served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s. The class was considered obsolete by the start of the [[Pacific War]] and served in a number of roles including [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], aircraft rescue ships and ''[[Kaiten]]''-carriers.&lt;ref&gt;''Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy. 1869–1945'' by H. Jentschura, D. Jung, P. Mickel, p.&amp;nbsp;141 Arms and Armour Press (1996) Cassell plc {{ISBN|978-0-85368-151-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Construction of the large-sized ''Minekaze''-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's [[Eight-eight fleet|8-4 Fleet Program]] (1917–1920) with the first two ships of the class built under the 1917 fiscal programme, followed by five each under the 1918 and 1919 programmes and two ships under the 1920 fiscal programme. The ''Minekaze''-class destroyer was designed to complement the medium-sized {{sclass-|Momi|destroyer|4}}, with which they shared many common design characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with powerful engines, these vessels were capable of high speeds and were intended as escorts for the projected {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser}}s, which were ultimately never built.&lt;ref&gt;Globalsecurity.org, ''IJN Minekaze class destroyers''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Akikaze'' was built at the [[Maizuru Naval Arsenal]] and was the ninth ship of the ''Minekaze'' class. She was laid down on 7 June 1920, and launched on 14 December 1920. Completed on 1 April 1921, ''Akikaze'' was commissioned on 16 September 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0418.htm | title= Minekaze class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first= Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On completion, ''Akikaze'' joined [[sister ship]]s {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hakaze||2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Tachikaze|1921|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hokaze||2}} at the [[Yokosuka Naval District]] to form Destroyer Division 4 under Torpedo Squadron 1 (第1水雷戦隊). In 1938–1939, the division was assigned to patrols of the central [[China]] coastline in support of Japanese combat operations in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

===World War II===
In [[World War II]], ''Akikaze'' performed patrol and convoy escort duties. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Akikaze'' (assigned to Destroyer Division 34 of the [[IJN 11th Air Fleet]]) was based at [[Kaohsiung|Takao]], and provided [[air sea rescue]] support for the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|"Operation M"]] (the Japanese invasion of the [[Philippines]]), and escort of convoys to [[Davao City|Davao]] and [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]].

From January to the end of April 1942, ''Akikaze'' was based at Davao, escorting shipping between Davao and [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]]. After a brief return to [[Maizuru Naval Arsenal|Maizuru]] for repairs in May 1942, ''Akikaze'' was based out of [[Rabaul]], escorting transports throughout the Pacific. On 14 March 1943, ''Akikaze'' and two other destroyers attacked a [[submarine]] — possibly {{USS|Triton|SS-201|6}} — near [[Kairiru Island]] {{coord|3|20|10|S|143|33|0|E |region:PG-ESW_type:isle}}.&lt;ref&gt;CombinedFleet.com says 14 March, but the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;On 15 March, ''Trigger'' reported that she had attacked a convoy and had been depth charged. Even though attacks on her ceased, she could still hear distant depth charging for about an hour. No further messages from ''Triton'' were ever received. Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed that on 15 March 1943 three Japanese destroyers attacked a submarine a little northwest of ''Triton'''s assigned area and subsequently observed an [[oil slick]], debris, and items with American markings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/triton-iii.htm | title= ''Triton'' | work= DANFS | publisher= U.S. [[Naval Historical Center]] | accessdate= 2008-05-24 }} &lt;br/&gt;Maybe ''Akikaze'' made two attacks on ''Triton'', on both the 14th and 15th?&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March ''Akikaze'' was the scene of a war crime. During construction of a seaplane base at [[Kairiru Island]] ''Akikaze'' evacuated the personnel of the Roman Catholic mission headquarters on that island and also several individuals from [[Wewak]]. These included Bishop Joseph Loerks, 38 missionaries (31 of whom were German nationals) including 18 nuns, one New Guinea girl, and two Chinese infants (apparently the children of Wewak storekeeper Ning Hee). The vessel then called at [[Manus Island|Manus]] where it picked up 20 others, again mostly Germans, including six missionaries from the Liebenzell Evangelical Mission, three other nuns and three other priests, a European infant, a plantation owner named Carl Muster and plantation overseer Peter Mathies, two Chinese, and apparently four Malays. The ostensible intention was to carry them to internment in Rabaul. "Between Manus and Rabaul each of the adults was strung up by the hands on a gallows in the stern of the vessel, shot dead by rifle or machine-gun fire, and thrown overboard. The two Chinese infants and the European baby were thrown over alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Townsend | first = G.W.L. | year = 1968 | title = District Officer | publisher = Pacific Publications | page = 225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pacificwrecks.com/ships/ijn/akikaze.html | year = 2011 | title= Akikaze | publisher = Pacific Wrecks }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there were U.S. nationals among the victims, the Australian War Crimes Section in Tokyo, having completed its investigation, on 18 July 1947 handed the matter over to the American authorities, who appear to have taken no further action.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Australian War Crimes Trials and Investigations (1942-51), p.51 by DC Sissons.&lt;/ref&gt;

After repairs again at Maizuru in April 1943, ''Akikaze'' returned to Rabaul to resume her escort and patrol duties. She was heavily damaged in an air raid on 2 August, with 23 casualties and forced to return to Maizuru for repairs again in September. Returning to Rabaul again in mid-November, she made several "[[Tokyo Express]]" troop transport runs to [[New Guinea]] from October 1943-February 1944. In March, she was reassigned to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], where she provided escort for convoys between Truk, [[Saipan]] and [[Palau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/akikaz_t.htm| title= IJN Akikaze: Tabular Record of Movement| last= Nevitt | first=  Allyn D. | year= 1997 | work= Long Lancers | publisher= Combinedfleet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 1944, ''Akikaze'' was reassigned to Destroyer Division 30 of the Central Pacific Fleet. After escorting a convoy from Japan to Davao and [[Manila]], she was based at Manila. However, Destroyer Division 30 was reassigned to the [[Combined Fleet]] on 20 August.

On 24–25 October, ''Akikaze'' led the escort for the 2nd Supply Force of Admiral Ozawa's Northern Force at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], rescuing survivors from the [[torpedo]]ed [[fleet oiler]] ''Jinei Maru'', and taking them to [[Mako Guard District|Mako]].

On 1 November, Destroyer Division 30 — {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūzuki||2}} ([[flagship]]), {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Uzuki|1925|2}}, and ''Akikaze'' — departed Mako, escorting [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}} and [[cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kiso||2}} toward [[Brunei]]. On 3 November, the submarine {{USS|Pintado|SS-387|6}} fired a spread of torpedoes at ''Jun'yō'', but ''Akikaze'' intercepted them, sacrificing herself to save the carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/kiso_t.htm| title=  IJN ''Kiso'': Tabular Record of Movement| last= Hackett | first= Bob |author2=Sander Kingsepp | date= 2007-11-28 | work= Junyokan | publisher= Combinedfleet.com| accessdate= 2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Akikaze'' sank with all hands, {{convert|257|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Cape Bolinao]], [[Luzon]] at position {{coord|16|48|N|117|17|E |display=inline,title}}.

On 10 January 1945, ''Akikaze'' was struck from the [[Navy List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0418.htm | title= Minekaze class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first= Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jedediah Aaker''' is a musician, performer, theatrical producer, and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-area personality. A fixture on cable series ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', he has appeared in more episodes than anyone besides the series' two leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=https://www.ifc.com/2014/12/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=December 2014 |website=''IFC'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDX-native is also a multiple-award-winning, ''Whisker Wars''-celebrated competitive bearder who co-founded the Portland Beardsmen.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jamie |first1=Hale |title=Portland beardsman Jedediah Aaker prepares for the World Beard and Moustache Championships |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/portlands_resident_beardsmen_j.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=''The Oregonian'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worn a Christmas sweater on the cover of ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' and appeared as a shirtless model on the front page of ''[[Willamette Week]]''{{'}}s 2018 &lt;q&gt;Beer&lt;/q&gt; issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/willametteweek/docs/44.18_-_willamette_week__february_2|title=44 18 willamette week, february 28, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as bartender for a failing club featured on the fourth season of ''[[Bar Rescue]]'' and as host of Barfly Bus Tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panic Room on Bar Rescue: &lt;q&gt;They were setting us up to fail.&lt;/q&gt; |url=https://www.wweek.com/arts/2015/07/28/panic-room-on-bar-rescue-they-were-setting-us-up-to-fail/ |date=28 July 2015 |website=Willamette Week |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barflybus.com|title=BarFly Bus Tours of Portland Oregon|website=BarFly Bus Tours of Portland Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramountnetwork.com/episodes/n395kv/bar-rescue-ants-with-wings-bro-season-4-ep-25|title=Bar Rescue - Ants With Wings, Bro! - Paramount Network|website=Paramount Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'' referred to him as a &lt;q&gt;Portland character&lt;/q&gt; and &lt;q&gt;professional party host&lt;/q&gt;, and alternative newspaper ''Willamette Week'' dubbed him a &lt;q&gt;beard-about-town&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Ruth |title=Headout: Puddin' Slam Ladies rassle in white goop: &lt;q&gt;It's empowering.&lt;/q&gt; |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18956-headout-puddin-slam.html |date=20 March 2012 |website=''Willamette Week'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 feature article titled &lt;q&gt;Twilight of the Hipsters&lt;/q&gt;, the French edition of [[Rolling Stone]] introduced Aaker as an &lt;q&gt;actor, concert booker, chauffeur for rock stars, and distributor of the Lucky Egg vending machines that he installs in bars.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saferis |first1=Camille |title=Le Crepuscule des Hipsters |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/377581449/2018-04-01-Rolling-Stone-Hors-Serie |date=April 2018 |website=''Rolling Stone'' |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portlandia''==
''Portlandia'' first entered the global consciousness after satirical music video &lt;q&gt;Dream of the ‘90s&lt;/q&gt; premiered online in December 2010 and thrust [[Saturday Night Live]] star [[Fred Armisen]] between a motley assemblage of circus folk, exotic dancers, and idiosyncratically-styled local luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wappler |first1=Margaret |title='Portlandia': Where the dream of the '90s lives on... |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/01/portlandia-where-the-dream-of-the-90s-lives-on-1.html |date=6 January 2011 |website="Los Angeles Times" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing directly to the right of Armisen throughout the video while wearing only star-spangled swim briefs, black leather, and a sizable beard, Aaker stood out as the swiftly-trending clip sparked interest worldwide in the forthcoming sketch comedy series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portlanders Bid Mixed Goodbyes To 'Portlandia' |url=https://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/portlandia-final-season-portland-oregon-reaction/ |date=24 January 2018 |website="OPB" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, Aaker soon became widely known as, in the words of ''Willamette Week'', &lt;q&gt;that guy in underwear and a leather jacket in the ‘Dream of the ‘90s’ clip.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Willamette Geek: The Week in Geek |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-28088-willamette-geek-the-week-in-geek.html |date=16 January 2012 |website=''Willamette Week'' |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to serving as a [[Extra (acting)|background actor]] on several episodes, Aaker has played a scavenger hunt umpire, a member of Spyke’s wedding party, and a guest at [[List of Portlandia characters|Nina]]'s birthday party.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Locker |first1=Melissa |title=The Citizens of Portlandia: Jedediah Aaker |url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2014/01/citizens-of-portlandia-jedediah-aaker |website="IFC" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranking the &lt;q&gt;Best and Worst&lt;/q&gt; of the series’ third season, ''[[Portland Monthly]]'' critic John Chandler determined the &lt;q&gt;hirsute man-about-town&lt;/q&gt; tied with a veteran theater actress for &lt;q&gt;Best Performance By A Local&lt;/q&gt;. Although &lt;q&gt;Aaker plays himself (presumably)&lt;/q&gt; in episodes four and five, Chandler wrote, &lt;q&gt;the man’s beard has star quality.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chandler |first1=John |title=Portlandia Season 3: The Best and Worst So Far |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2013/1/31/portlandia-season-3 |date=31 January 2013 |website="Portland Monthly" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By season four, Aaker had appeared in almost two dozen of the 37 episodes then filmed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Additionally, he served as [[Kumail Nanjiani]]'s assistant on [[webisode]]s of IFC's travelogue series ''Kumail Tours Portland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2013/01/portlandia-kumail-visits-a-tiny-house-in-portlandia|title=Kumail Nanjiani visits Portlandia’s tiniest house|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the series finished its eighth and final season in the spring of 2018, its network [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] estimated that the collective number of Aaker's various performances ranked below only co-founders [[Armisen]] and [[Carrie Brownstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Sean |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60769/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=29 December 2014 |website="Mental Floss" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Portraitlandia"===
In 2013, during a month-long residency at Portland’s Newspace Center for Photography, acclaimed [[San Francisco]] photographer Kirk Crippens sought out 45 PDX locals for a series of portraits eventually titled "Portraitlandia". Over the next year, according to ''Portland Monthly'', the &lt;q&gt;series went viral, drawing millions of eyes to the site of its photographer.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portraitlandia Asks Us: What Do We Look Like (NSFW) |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2014/1/17/portraitlandia-january-2014 |date=17 January 2014 |website=Portland Monthly |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the Portraitlandia series would be exhibited at London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in conjunction with the [[Taylor Wessing#Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize|Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize]] and toured the United States as part of the Photolucida exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=David |title=Up-Close and Quirky Photos With the Glorious Residents of Portland |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/11/14/kirk_crippens_portraitlandia_examines_the_quirky_residents_of_portland_photos.html |date=14 November 2013 |website=Slate |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Crippens told [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that he’d &lt;q&gt;expected his work to stand in sharp contrast to the fictions&lt;/q&gt; of ''Portlandia'', the artist found &lt;q&gt;significant overlap&lt;/q&gt; – particularly so when the first episode he saw after beginning the project happened to showcase Aaker and another two planned subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brook |first1=Pete |title=Portraitlandia Confirms and Refutes Everything You Think About Portland |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/portraitlandia/ |date=10 July 2013 |website=Wired |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker, &lt;q&gt;a man about town who owns his own lion suit,&lt;/q&gt; was among Crittens’ favorite subjects.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; For their shoot, Crittens said Aakers made available the roof of the nightclub where he tended bar and then asked the photographer &lt;q&gt;if I wanted him to curl up like a kitty in the ivy growing over the top of the roof. Yes, yes I did.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Gregory Eddi |title=Interview with Kirk Crippens, the Artist Behind ‘Portraitlandia’ |url=https://petapixel.com/2013/10/29/interview-kirk-crippens-photographer-behind-portraitlandia/ |date=29 October 2013 |website="PetaPixel" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Aaker has been involved with several NW rock bands. He spent years playing bass for the Fabulous Miss Wendy, a performer who has toured with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and was lauded as the &lt;q&gt;sexiest rock star ever&lt;/q&gt; by [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cavuto |first1=Robert |title=The Fabulous Miss Wendy – No One Can Stop Me! |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2012/09/17/wendy/ |date=17 September 2017 |website=Guitar International |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He’s a founding member and bassist of The Gnash, whose music he has compared to &lt;q&gt;a primer-gray broken down Camaro.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The group recently put out a split single on the [[Voodoo Doughnut Recordings]] label entitled &lt;q&gt;She Took My Doughnut (And Left Me the Hole)&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voodoodoughnutrecordings.com/artists/the-gnash/scuzz-rock-split/|title=Scuzz Rock Split • Voodoo Doughnut Recordings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years throughout the 2000s, Aaker served as frontman of glam metal group Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates – &lt;q&gt;an eight-piece band carefully culled from the lifers of the Portland rock scene.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vegas |first1=Viva Las |title=Stripper Sluts Hit The Road With Portland's Two Hottest Rock Bands: Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates and Starantula |url=http://www.xmag.com/archives/11-12-jun04/feature2.html |date=June 2004 |website="Exotic Magazine" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willamette Week'' referred to their appearance on a (local punk mainstay) Club 21 compilation as &lt;q&gt;epic … buttrock.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soule |first1=Sam |title=VARIOUS ARTISTS Club 21, Fuck Yeah!

==Theater==
In 2009, Aaker and Diamond Tuck guitarist &lt;q&gt;Private&lt;/q&gt; Mike Albano led the live band during performances of writer/director/producer Jeffery &lt;q&gt;Wonderful&lt;/q&gt; Wilson’s rock opera ''Chariots of Rubber'' during performances at the [[Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/events/1489094/chariots-of-rubber|title=Chariots of Rubber|website=Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review from the [[Portland State University]] [[Daily Vanguard|Vanguard]], described the original score as &lt;q&gt;1980s metal with a dash of [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror Picture Show]].&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinney |first1=Anita |title=The Passion of the Metal Areola Snatchers |url=http://psuvanguard.com/the-passion-of-the-metal-areola-snatchers/ |date=29 October 2009 |website=PSU Vanguard |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Aaker and Wilson again joined forces as, respectively, producer and director of ''Hot Gun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Lee |title=Original Performances on Unique Stages Reinvent Portland Theater |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2010/07/original_performances_on_uniqu.html |date=1 July 2010 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;q&gt;rock ’n’ roll re-imagining of the iconic blockbuster [[Top Gun]]&lt;/q&gt; was performed live on stage at PDX nightclub [[Dante's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hallet |first1=Allison |title=Top Gun: The Musical |url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2010/04/09/top-gun-the-musical |date=9 April 2010 |website="The Portland Mercury" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review from ''Portland Monthly'', their critic admired the multimedia production’s deft manipulation of the original film – inserting previously-shot scenes of the stage actors into aerial battles – but found the comedy’s &lt;q&gt;laughs were loudest with the in-crowd. The novelty of seeing friends dressed funny, and/or comically incorporated into video footage, was the bulk of the fun.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Anne |title=Between Theater and Bar |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2010/5/31/63110theater-bar-cp |website=Portland Monthly |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willamette Week'', however, raved ''Hot Gun''’s &lt;q&gt;summer stock-'n'-roll aesthetic, artfully unchoreographed and shruggably brilliant, resembles an old movie naval pageant (coconut bras on bearded men, absent camp or shame) blessed with the underutilized talents peculiar to Portland ...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Jay |title=Hot Gun (Wonderdiamond Productions) The Iceman Cometh |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-12079-i-hot-gun-i-wonderdiamond-productions.html |date=8 June 2010 |website="Willamette Week" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Aaker brought John Walterich’s online-dating satire ''Brie'' to the stage of the Tonic Lounge for a brief run. ''Willamette Week'' critic Jonathan Frochtzwajg described the production as &lt;/q&gt;a largely amateur, very tattooed cast ... scored live by rotating punk-rock acts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frochtzwajg |first1=Jonathan |title=Brie |url=https://issuu.com/willametteweek/docs/38.05_-_willamette_week__december_7 |date=7 December 2011 |website=Willamette Week |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Aaker acted in the 2017 film ''Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time'' alongside TV icons [[Walter Koenig]] ([[Pavel Chekov|Ensign Pavel Chekov]])and [[David Ogden Stiers]] ([[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Major Charles Emerson Winchester]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4394034/|title=Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was a central figure in the 2017 documentary ''Thank You for Supporting the Arts'', which also features [[Gus Van Sant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7391464/|title=Thank You for Supporting the Arts|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doc explores the physical and emotional trauma suffered by author and exotic dancer Liv &lt;q&gt;Viva Las Vegas&lt;/q&gt; Osthus following her fight against breast cancer and subsequent mastectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Douglas |title=Documentary about iconic Portland stripper Viva Las Vegas screens for local audiences |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/documentary_about_iconic_portl.html |date=30 April 2017 |website="The Oregonian" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osthus and Aaker were in a relationship for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osthus |first1=Liv |title=A Reality Show for Couples Therapy?

==Hosting==
As a judge for the 2011 West Coast Beard and Mustache Championships, Aaker appeared in a 2011 episode of the ''Whisker Wars'' cable reality series. &lt;q&gt;You're not judging on what's the biggest or the longest but ... the grandest,&lt;/q&gt; he told the ''Oregonian''. &lt;q&gt;It just has the magic glow ...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He’s also regularly called upon to help select the winners of various events around the Portland area such as the Bacon Cup, the Iron Bartender competition, the horror short GuignolFest, and Portland’s inaugural Pudding Wrestling Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pdxpipeline.com/events/july-16-bacon-cup-ash-st-saloon-bacon-wrestling-strippers-music-recipes/|title=July 16: Bacon Cup @ Ash St Saloon - Bacon Wrestling, Strippers, Music, Recipes|date=15 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yelp.com/events/portland-iron-bartender-2010|title=Iron Bartender 2010, Portland, OR|website=Yelp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portlandtribune.com/pt/11-features/121371-bits--and--pieces|title=Bits &amp; Pieces|first=Jason|last=Vondersmith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18956-headout-puddin-slam.html|title=Headout: Puddin' Slam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] article that takes its title (&lt;q&gt;Every Vagina Is A Snowflake&lt;/q&gt;) from a quote given by Aaker, the magazine noted that the &lt;q&gt;returning judge&lt;/q&gt; brought his own props overseeing the beauty pageant for exotic dancers' nether regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shepard |first1=Susan Elizabeth |title=Every Vagina Is a Snowflake: A Dispatch from Portland's Vagina Beauty Pageant |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvddxv/every-vagina-is-a-snowflake-a-dispatch-from-portlands-vagina-beauty-pageant |date=5 August 2015 |website=Vice |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bearding==
Aaker has been cultivating his beard for more than ten years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He’s become a notable figure in competitive bearding events, winning several freestyle awards, and can be seen in the first season of IFC series ''Whisker Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rob |first1=Owen |title=IFC's 'Whisker Wars' Focuses on Competitive Beard Growing? Yes, It's an Oregon Thing, Too |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2011/07/competitive_beard_growing_yes_its_an_oregon_thing_too.html |date=31 July 2011 |website="The Oregonian" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2014 [[World Beard and Moustache Championships]] held inside Portland’s [[Keller Auditorium]], which hosted 300 contestants from ten countries, Aaker emerged as a fan favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Hairy Controversy Surrounds World Beard and Moustache Championships, Coming to Portland This Weekend |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/hairy_controversy_surrounds_wo.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oregonian'' reported that he "somehow got extra time, walking onstage in short shorts and a white fur coat, his red beard shaped into a flying V guitar, gyrating his belly to the roar of the crowd. He walked away with sixth place, but he stole the audience's heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=World Beard and Moustache Championships Draws Huge Crowd to Portland, Spirals Into Chaos Onstage |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/world_beard_and_moustache_cham_1.html |date=25 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aaker helped found the Portland Beardsmen – a band of facial-hair enthusiasts who compete for prizes awarded on the merits of beard size, grooming, style, creativity, and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandbeardsmen.com|title=Home|website=The Portland Beardsmen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonprofit group raises funds for transportation to far-flung tournaments, and they also organize charitable efforts such as beard-wielded car washes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Portland Beardsmen Surprise Moms with Flower Deliveries |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/31819718/portland-beardsmen-surprise-moms-with-flower-deliveries |date=25 October 2014 |website=KPTV |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their annual Beards N Roses drive each Mother’s Day, hirsute members don brightly-colored tights and tutus for delivering bouquets to Portland-area moms. Aaker helped originate the program six years ago to benefit the [[Uprise Books Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Portland Beardsmen Don Tutus, Deliver Mother's Day Flowers Around the City |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/portland_beardsmen_don_tutus_d.html |date=9 May 2015 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portland Beardsmen===
On the evening of August 28, 2012, Aaker was among 13 bearded men detained at gunpoint by officers from the [[Portland Police Bureau|Portland police]] on the [[Burnside Bridge]] during what ''the Oregonian'' termed "a military-themed photo shoot for breast cancer awareness." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bailey Jr. |first1=Everton |title=Rifle, body armor on Burnside Bridge lead to arrests during 'Beards for Breasts' photo shoot |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/rifle_body_armor_on_burnside_b.html |date=30 August 2012 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an unnamed observer’s [[9-1-1|911]] call alerted authorities about suspicious characters wearing camouflaged body armor, both sides of the bridge were closed for nearly an hour as the police investigated the situation. Two men were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and carrying an (unloaded) AR-15 assault rifle through a public space.

According to [[KPTV]] News, the group was organized by Aaker to aid a national fundraising campaign entitled &lt;q&gt;Beards for Breast Cancer&lt;/q&gt; that was assembling a calender featuring pictures of bearding groups from around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webstaff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Burnside Bridge scare suspects: 'We are the good guys' |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/19423445/burnside-bridge-scare-suspects-we-are-the-good-guys?clienttype=printable |date=30 August 2012 |website="KPTV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Portland contingent was designated to appear alongside July, Aaker thought the resulting photo should feel especially patriotic, which led several of the beardsmen to don militaristic garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=KING |title=Bearded men on bridge cause alarm, but it's all for charity |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/bearded-men-on-bridge-cause-alarm-but-its-all-for-charity/330729166 |date=30 August 2012 |website="KING-TV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[KATU]] News reported that Aaker himself had on an [[NSYNC]] T-shirt.) "We are the good guys," Aaker told the station, "just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo getting rad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kalkstein |first1=Meghan |title='Just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo' |url=https://kval.com/news/offbeat/just-a-bunch-of-dudes-walking-across-the-bridge-wearing-camo-11-21-2015 |date=28 August 2012 |website="KVAL" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">'''Kick the cat''' (or '''kick the dog'''&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200509/learning-not-lash-out|title=Learning Not to Lash Out|work=Psychology Today|first=Kat|last=McGowan|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[metaphor]] used to describe how a relatively high-ranking person in an organization or family [[Displacement (psychology)|displaces]] his or her frustrations by abusing a lower-ranking person, who may in turn take it out on his or her own subordinate.

==Origin of the idiom==
The term has been used at least since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHwXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA35&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Proceedings of the ... Annual Convention of Young Men's Christian Associations of the United States and British Provinces, Volume 14|p=35|year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author John Bradshaw, humans were far more cruel to cats at that time, to the extent that kicking one was not perceived to be unusual and hence entered the language as a popular idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet|first=John|last=Bradshaw|p=194|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-465-04095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was reinforced in British culture by a scene in the ''[[Blackadder]]'' episode ''[[Nob and Nobility]]'' in which Edmund Blackadder kicks the cat when annoyed, and the cat bites the mouse, and the mouse bites Baldrick.

In current usage, the name envisions a scenario where an angry or frustrated employee comes home from work looking for some way to take out his anger, but the only thing present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWy2GlYGDx0C&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EgZkGoIvF&amp;sig=U8Gf-TrF4cZLZII107iJg0nv8-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLJ1VMNKhsaxBIaggtgP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Verbal Self Defense|first=Lillian|last=Glass|p=80|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|isbn=978-1-440-65074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace or family dynamics==
Kicking the cat is commonly used to describe the behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve [[Occupational stress|stress]].&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/23/careers.theguardian5|title=With colleagues like these|first=Catherine|last=Quinn|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2007|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can result in a [[chain reaction]], where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This [[domino effect]] can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father yells at the mother who yells at the older child who yells at the younger child who yells at the pet.&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Beth, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-05-02/features/9904290688_1_chain-reaction-nuclear-families-emotions Grumpy Ol' Dad], Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 1999. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaming]] others can lead to kicking the dog where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.'.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theories==
According to ''Psychology Today'', "Anger and frustration in one part of life can lead us to lash out at innocent people (or pets) in another."&lt;ref name=pt/&gt; The technical term for this kind of behaviour is "displaced aggression".&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;

Kicking the cat is looked upon unfavourably and viewed as a sign of  poor [[anger management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLm2C_J9A90C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CFsQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat or Kitten|first=H. Ellen|last=Whiteley|p=147|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-611-39080-3|quote="Learn to handle anger or quit the job"}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Steve Sonderman, "Men funnel 90 percent of their emotions through anger" and may "kick the cat" as a substitute for grief, [[anxiety]] or other emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iv47hJxGc0EC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=frB1VMKMFqyZsQSv3oLIDw&amp;ved=0CEQQuwUwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22&amp;f=false|title=Mobilizing Men for One-on-One Ministry: The Transforming Power of Authentic Friendship and Discipleship|first=Steve|last=Sonderman|p=168|publisher=Bethany House|year=2010|isbn=978-1-441-21376-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason=A 'Christian author' is not a 'psychology expert', and the claim is outlandish and unsupported.|date=September 2016}} Psychology author [[Raj Persaud]] suggests that people "kick the cat" as a means of [[catharsis]] because they fear expressing their full emotions to the peers and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E86iK3a2mEUC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kKld8O5Z7D&amp;sig=_LsxyfIhnjvAioJpC_wni0JtqIY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hFR3VPS1OtO1sASp9YLwDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=Staying Sane|first=Raj|last=Persaud|authorlink=Raj Persaud|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-144-811106-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ladytron''' is a fictional character in the [[Wildstorm]] and currently, [[DC Comics]] universe.  In addition to her character appearances, Ladytron's likeness was used in-universe by [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]]'s Halo Corporation as a [[mascot]] in various commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Brice |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/98319982392037.htm |title=Wildcats: Ladytron Review - Silver Bullet Comics |publisher=Comicsbulletin.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Maxine Manchester was abused by her father as a young teenager. She fled from home and turned to a life of crime, robbing stores and killing anybody who got in her way. Soon, the government caught up with her and she was hit several times during a gunfight with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Her wounded body was handed over to Doctor Khaz, a mad scientist, who enhanced her body, replacing most of it with [[robotic]] parts. She escaped and continued her crime spree as a [[cyborg]]. Khaz recaptured her and told her about Stanley, a robot he had created before her.  Khaz saw himself as father to Stanley and Maxine and sent her out to bring back Stanley. Maxine and Stanley shared the same psychopathic mentality and soon married between crime sprees. Maxine and Stanley decided to kill Khaz, but Khaz had an override in Stanley's brain. The brainless Stanley turned on Maxine and she killed him. She then killed Khaz and returned to her life of crime.

===Tao===

At this time, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] and [[Mister Majestic]] were trying to rebuild the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.s]] after the previous team were nearly all presumed killed. They convinced [[Condition Red (comics)|Max Cash]], alias Condition Red, to join and acquired the Tactical Augmented Organism ([[Tao (comics)|T.A.O.]], later called simply Tao) for their team.  Savant wanted another woman for the team and decided upon Maxine. Majestic didn't want to be associated with a criminal like Maxine, but T.A.O. managed to change his mind through his hypnotic abilities.

The new WildC.A.T.s captured Maxine while she attempt to rob both sides of a drug transaction and T.A.O. built a [[virtual reality]]-program to reeducate Maxine. The program worked and Maxine joined the WildC.A.T.s, but still remained violent and anti-social. She became romantically interested in Max Cash, but he was turned off by her robotic body and her abrasive personality.

Around this time Ladytron and her team appeared in issue 2 of the Image series ''New Man''.&lt;ref&gt;"New Man" #2 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Max got wounded in a bombing, he used the opportunity to avoid her by sneaking out of the hospital. Maxine was furious and took out her anger on the man responsible for wounding Max (despite flirting with the cyborg [[Overtkill (comics)|OvertKill]] moments before). The man told her and [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]] that T.A.O. had ordered him to bomb the building.

The WildC.A.T.s confronted T.A.O. who turned out to be an evil mastermind after all. T.A.O. inflicted heavy casualties on the team, including Maxine. He managed to remove her cooling systems so that her internal [[nuclear reactor]] overheated. Majestic removed her nuclear reactor, but Maxine was heavily damaged. She was taken to the Church of [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]], a cult for cyborgs, robots and [[Artificial Intelligence]]s, for repairs. T.A.O. was seemingly slain in the sewers underneath the Halo building.

===Gort===

During her stay with the Church of Gort, Maxine became a convert and started to follow the teachings of the Church of Gort. Mister Majestic who had become somewhat of a father figure to Maxine was pleased to see her embrace the tenet "all life is sacred", though she only seemed to recognize mechanical life as sacred. As she stated in ''WildC.A.T.S.'' #50, harming a toaster would be the same as harming a sentient. Still, according to Majestic, it was a step in the right direction. It was in the same issue that T.A.O. was revealed to be alive; he had brainwashed a shapeshifter named Mr. White who was then damaged, not slain, in the sewers.

After a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] within the Church, Maxine was targeted by other members for having too many organic parts.

Maxine fled the Church of Gort and met up with Max's brother [[Grifter (comics)|Cole Cash]]. Cole was annoyed by Maxine and left her with the [[Halo Corporation]]. There, she overheard that former WildC.A.T.s-member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] had been injured by serial killer [[Slaughterhouse Smith|Samuel Smith]] and decided to take vengeance upon him.

Her plan was simple-minded: she visited all hotels and motels in the area to fight anybody listed under the name "Smith". After attacking a few innocents, Maxine met with Samuel Smith, whose superhuman powers turned out to be more than she could handle. The damage was so great that she was deactivated.

Later, her body was reprogrammed and adapted into a more scorpion-like form by Wildcat-traitor Noir to attack [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]], now known as Jack Marlowe, but Marlowe easily defeated the body. Her body was then used by Grifter, whose legs were broken, as a remote-controlled body. Her personality was encrypted and filed away in the [[Halo Corporation]]'s mainframe. When Grifter's legs healed, he no longer needed her robotic body.

===The future===
In an alternate future (2006), Mister Majestic found Maxine Manchester as the sole surviving Wildcat. She revealed that Daemonites had taken over the planet and that she herself was a trap, set by the Daemonites to kill Majestic. Her nuclear reactor exploded, but was incapable of seriously injuring Majestic. Majestic went back in time to prevent this future.

===The New 52===
Maxine makes her appearance in issue #5 of ''[[Team 7]]'' as an injured soldier undergoing cybernetic limb replacement at the Advanced Prosthesis Research Center while a Gamorran program associated with the Spartan Project goes awry turning the personnel into biomechanical killers.  In the catastrophe, Maxine is extensively transformed into a cyborg. She later reappeared in ''Teen Titans'' "Blinded by the light" as a pawn of Manchester Black. She was defeated multiple times as part of his plans before being betrayed and shut down for good by Red Robin

==Powers and abilities==
As a cyborg, Maxine is very strong and durable.  She is capable of lifting and throwing a car and completely bullet-proof.  Her arms have built-in guns and her mouth can open up to reveal a sonic blaster.  During the time Grifter used her as a remote-body, Ladytron also was capable of flight by extending a rocketpack inside her back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">'''Marine regression''' is a geological process occurring when areas of submerged [[seafloor]] are exposed above the sea level. The opposite event, [[Transgression (geology)|marine transgression]], occurs when flooding from the sea covers previously exposed land.&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, James Stewart, and Reed Wicander. ''Physical Geology: Exploring the Earth.'' Fifth edition; Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005; p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of marine regressions and transgressions occurs throughout the fossil record, and these fluctuations are thought to have caused or contributed to several [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]], among them the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] (250 million years ago) and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (66 [[Annum|Ma]]). At the time of the Permian-Triassic extinction, the largest extinction event in the Earth's history, global sea level fell 250 m (820 ft).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Courtillot|Courtillot, Vincent]]. ''Evolutionary Catastrophes: The Science of Mass Extinction.'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999; p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major regression could itself cause marine organisms in shallow seas to go extinct, but mass extinctions tend to involve both terrestrial and aquatic species, and it is harder to see how a marine regression could cause widespread extinctions of land animals. Regressions are, therefore, seen as correlates or symptoms of major extinctions, rather than primary causes. The Permian regression might have been related to the formation of [[Pangaea]]: the accumulation of all the major landmasses into one body could have facilitated a regression, by providing "a slight enlargement of the ocean basins as the great continents coalesced."&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Peter D. ''Rivers in Time: The Search for Clues to Earth's Mass Extinctions.'' New York, Columbia University Press, 2000; p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that cause could not have applied in all, or even many, other cases.

During the [[ice age]]s of the [[Pleistocene]], a clear correlation existed between marine regressions and episodes of [[glaciation]]; as the balance shifts between the global [[cryosphere]] and [[hydrosphere]], more of the planet's water in ice sheets means less in the oceans. At the height of the last ice age, at around 18,000 years before the present, the global sea level was 120 to 130 m (390-425 ft) lower than today. A cold spell around 6 million years ago was linked to an advance in glaciation, a marine regression, and the start of the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] basin. Some major regressions of the past, however, seem unrelated to glaciation episodes &amp;mdash; the regression that accompanied the mass extinction at the end of the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous Period]] being one example.

A clear and certain understanding of major marine regressions has not yet been achieved; according to one hypothesis, regressions may be linked to a "slowdown in sea-floor spreading, leading to a generalized drop in sea level (as the mid-ocean ridges would take up less space)...."&lt;ref&gt;Courtillot, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In that view, major marine regressions are one aspect of a normal variation in rates of [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] activity, which lead to major episodes of global [[Volcano|volcanism]] like the [[Siberian Traps]] and the [[Deccan Traps]], which in turn cause large [[extinction event]]s.

'''Megastructures''' are an [[architectural]] concept popularized in the 1960s where a city could be encased in a single [[building]], or a relatively small number of buildings interconnected together.

The concept was popularized by [[avant-garde]] architectural groups such as [[Archigram]].

==Megacity Montreal==
Megacity Montreal is the title of a chapter in a book titled ''Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past'' written by architecture theoretician [[Reyner Banham]]. Place Bonaventure in Montreal is featured as an example in this book.

[[Place Bonaventure]] was the world's largest building upon its completion in 1967. Place Bonaventure was first conceived as an exhibition hall, international trade centre, and hotel. The building covers an area of 2 ha (5 acres) and is built over 18 [[Canadian National Railway]] tracks leading to Central Station. Place Bonaventure is also linked to the subway system and the [[Tour de la Bourse]] (Stock Exchange Tower) through a network of underground tunnels. Until major renovation work drastically changed its appearance, Place Bonaventure was an entirely self-contained cubic structure that had few windows. Construction began in 1964 and was completed in 1967. 

During the [[Expo 67]] world fair held in [[Montréal]], [[Québec]], various pavilions exhibited megastructure features, such as the USA, Netherlands and Theme pavilions, as well as [[Habitat '67]].

Architectural critics visiting the world fair were struck by Montréal's [[Grain elevator]]s which, with their networks of covered conveyors belts, irresistibly evoked the images megastructures touted in experimental circles. 

Montréal’s [[Montreal Metro|subway system]] also evoked megastructures as it is directly connected to several downtown buildings which eventually evolved into the famed [[Underground city, Montreal|Underground City]].

'''Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere''' is an organization originated at [[Stanford University]] which focuses on the creation of a new paradigm by the use of [https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/66/5/363/2468623/The-Climate-Change-Challenge-and-Barriers-to-the foresight intelligence] to systematically examine likely and possible futures so as to determine what behavioral and institutional changes are necessary to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all.

Strategically, MAHB is aiming to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and policy action so as to alter public perception of these issues as well as to understand why desperate conservation needs are barely responded to.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahb.stanford.edu/welcome/|title=MAHB|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Emphasis is focused upon [[population growth]] and increasing [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] by the already well off as well as economic, racial and gender inequality. It aims to bring together civil society groups and related organizations to build networks, share information and act together.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 174 {{ISBN|1421417189}} – via Open Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the beginning of the 21st century when the MAHB was born, it was known as the Millennium Assessment of Human Behavior, making the point that it was following the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) but focusing on human behavior and collective actions leading to global collapse. But that name led to considerable confusion, especially because another global behavioral assessment was underway, and because MAHB activities range from research related to how behavioral, cultural, and institutional change toward a sustainable path can be accomplished to generating fora to discuss and illuminate that path.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thus it was decided to retain the well-known acronym and re-focus the name to a more accurate description: the Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere.

In April 2014 a chapter detailing the MAHB's scientific approach and research agenda for sustainability was included in the book [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-8959-2 ''Understanding Society and Natural Resources: Forging new strands of integration across the social sciences''] (ed. Michael J. Manfredo, Jerry J. Vaske, Andreas Techkemmer, and Esther A. Duke, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]). The chapter, "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-017-8959-2_2 Millenniuam Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere (MAHB): Integrating Social Science and the Humanities into Solving sustainability Challenges"], was co-authored by Ilan Kelman, Eugene A. Rosa, [[Tom R. Burns]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], Joan M. Diamond, Nora Machado, [[Donald Kennedy]], and [[Lennart Olsson]].

'''Mubariz Aghakerim oglu Ibrahimov''' ({{lang-az|Mübariz Ağakərim oğlu İbrahimov}}) (February 7, 1988, [[Əliabad, Bilasuvar|Əliabad]], [[Bilasuvar Rayon]], [[Azerbaijan]] - June 19, 2010, [[Çaylı, Tartar|Çaylı]], [[Tartar Rayon]], [[Azerbaijan]]) was an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[Warrant Officer]] and [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.today.az/news/yourcornenr/71849.html |title=Your Corner: Former U.S. soldier takes his beret off to Mubariz Ibrahimov |publisher= [[Today.az]] |author=Matthew Kent |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
After completing his [[secondary education]] in 2005, Ibrahimov was drafted to [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] serving from 2006 through 2007. In September 2009, he entered the courses for [[Warrant Officer|warrants]], after which he served in [[Naftalan, Azerbaijan|Naftalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leysan|first=Leyla|script-title=ru:Герой Азербайджана Мубариз Ибрагимов: "Я буду идти против врагов до последнего"|url=http://www.1news.az/politics/20100730043042639.html|publisher=1news.az|accessdate=31 July 2010|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On June 19, Ibrahimov was killed in a shootout along the frontline between Azerbaijani and Armenian and Karabakh forces. Four Armenian soldiers also died in the shootout. An Azerbaijani Defense Ministry press release said Mubariz Ibrahimov died while fighting back against Armenian soldiers in the Chayli village of the Terter region. The Azerbaijani government has attributed the deaths of the 4 Armenian soldiers to Ibrahimov, and have posthumously granted him the title of National Hero of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grigoryan|first1=Marianna|title=Armenia: Spiritual Leader Stokes a Church-State Controversy|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62043|website=Eurasianet|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, some sources indicate that Ibrahimov has killed more than 100 soiliders. It is reported that [[Vladimir Putin]] told in one of his speech that he was astonished to hear about the bravery of Mubariz Ibrahimov, who has killed 135 Armenians and is like a real-life [[John Rambo|Rambo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trt.net.tr/azerbaycan/turk-dunyasi/2017/02/07/s-hid-olanad-k-bu-s-r-fsizl-rin-uz-rin-ged-c-y-m-m-ibrahimov-666984&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian side took Ibrahimov's body and has not returned it." Armenia states Ibrahimov was shot dead in Armenian-controlled territory which proves the fighting was provoked by Azerbaijani forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijanis Demand Armenians Return Soldier's Body|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Azerbaijanis_Demand_Armenians_Return_Soldiers_Body_/2118850.html|website=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body==
The body of Mubariz Ibrahimov remained under Armenian control for 141 days. The spokesman of the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan Teymour Abdullayev alleged that "Armenia repeatedly claimed that the soldier's body is not in their hand and they even didn’t abstain to mislead the international organizations". On August 2, photos, which are claimed to be Ibrahimov's body, were placed on Internet by the Armenians".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709234559/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=127226 Armenians show their hypocrisy placing Shahid Mubariz Ibrahimov's body photo on Internet, Defense Ministry says]&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijani authorities asked the '''ICRC''' [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to mediate in returning Ibrahimov's body.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rferl.org/a/Azerbaijanis_Demand_Armenians_Return_Soldiers_Body_/2118850.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later the head of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] [[Karekin II]] asked the President of Armenia [[Serzh Sargsyan]] to return the body to Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armtoday.info/default.asp?Lang=_Ru&amp;NewsID=32007&amp;SectionID=0&amp;RegionID=0&amp;Date=09/25/2010&amp;PagePosition=1 Гарегин II попросил президента aрмении посодействовать возращению тела азербайджанского диверсанта]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the body was returned to Azerbaijan on November 6 following the agreement reached by presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan in [[Astrakhan]] in October 2010. Mubariz Ibrahimov was buried at the second [[Alley of Honors 2|Alley of Honors]] in [[Baku]]. The funeral was attended by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/More_Armenian_Azerbaijani_Bodies_Exchanged_/2214686.html Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. More Armenian, Azerbaijani Bodies Exchanged.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/76289.html TODAY.AZ Azerbaijani shahid servicemen Mubariz Ibrahimov and Farid Ahmadov buried]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Neural circuit reconstruction''' is the reconstruction of the detailed circuitry of the [[nervous system]] (or a portion of the nervous system) of an animal.  It is sometimes called '''EM reconstruction''' since the main method used is the [[electron microscope]] (EM).&lt;ref name=pmid20833533 /&gt;  This field is a close relative of [[reverse engineering]] of human-made devices, and is part of the field of [[connectomics]], which in turn is a sub-field of [[neuroanatomy]].

==Model systems==
Some of the model systems used for circuit reconstruction are the [[Drosophila|fruit fly]],&lt;ref name=pmid20833533&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chklovskii |first1=Dmitri B |last2=Vitaladevuni |first2=Shiv |last3=Scheffer |first3=Louis K |title=Semi-automated reconstruction of neural circuits using electron microscopy |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=667–75 |year=2010 |pmid=20833533 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2010.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[mouse]],&lt;ref name=pmid21390124&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bock |first1=Davi D. |last2=Lee |first2=Wei-Chung Allen |last3=Kerlin |first3=Aaron M. |last4=Andermann |first4=Mark L. |last5=Hood |first5=Greg |last6=Wetzel |first6=Arthur W. |last7=Yurgenson |first7=Sergey |last8=Soucy |first8=Edward R. |last9=Kim |first9=Hyon Suk |last10=Reid |first10=R. Clay |title=Network anatomy and in vivo physiology of visual cortical neurons |journal=Nature |volume=471 |issue=7337 |pages=177–82 |year=2011 |pmid=21390124 |doi=10.1038/nature09802|display-authors=8 |pmc=3095821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;

==Sample preparation==
The sample must be fixed, stained, and embedded in plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hayat, M. Arif |title=Principles and techniques of scanning electron microscopy. Biological applications, fourth edition. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521632874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaging==
The sample may be cut into thin slices with a [[microtome]], then imaged using [[transmission electron microscopy]].  Alternatively, the sample may be imaged with a [[scanning electron microscope]], then the surface abraded using a [[focused ion beam]], or trimmed using an in-microscope microtome. Then the sample is re-imaged, and the process repeated until the desired volume is processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Briggman, Kevin L. |author2=Davi D. Bock |title=Volume electron microscopy for neuronal circuit reconstruction |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=22 |issue=1 |year=2012 |pages=154–161 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438811001887 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2011.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image processing==
The first step is to align the individual images into a coherent three dimensional volume.

The volume is then annotated using one of two main methods.  The first manually identifies the skeletons of each [[neurite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saalfeld, Stephan, Albert Cardona, Volker Hartenstein, and Pavel Tomančák |title=CATMAID: collaborative annotation toolkit for massive amounts of image data |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=25 |issue=15 |year=2009 |pages=1984–1986 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/15/1984.full |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp266|pmc=2712332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second techniques uses computer vision software to identify voxels belonging to the same neuron, which are then corrected in the process of ''proofreading''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chklovskii, Dmitri B., Shiv Vitaladevuni, and Louis K. Scheffer. |title=Semi-automated reconstruction of neural circuits using electron microscopy |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=667–675 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dmitri_Chklovskii/publication/46220031_Semi-automated_reconstruction_of_neural_circuits_using_electron_microscopy/links/09e41506d91d293cb3000000.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2010.08.002 |pmid=20833533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
*The connectome of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' was the seminal work in this field.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal |author=White, John G., Eileen Southgate, J. Nichol Thomson, and Sydney Brenner |title=The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=314 |issue=1165 |year=1986 |pages=1–340 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This circuit was obtained with great effort using manually cut sections and purely manual annotation on photographic film.  For many years this was the only circuit reconstruction available.

==Limitations and future work==
Understanding the detailed operation of the reconstructed networks also requires knowledge of [[gap junctions]] (hard to see with existing techniques), the identity of [[neurotransmitter]]s and the locations and identities of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s.  In addition, [[neuromodulator]]s can diffuse across large distances and still strongly affect function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bargmann, Cornelia I. |title=Beyond the connectome: how neuromodulators shape neural circuits |journal=BioEssays |volume=34 |issue=6 |year=2012 |pages=458–465 |doi=10.1002/bies.201100185}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently these features must be obtained through other techniques.  [[Expansion microscopy]] may provide an alternative method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Osmoconformers''' are marine [[organisms]] that maintain an internal environment that is [[osmotic]] to their external environment.&lt;ref name=Marion&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClary|first1=Dr. Marion|title=Osmoconformer|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155074/|website=Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=March 13, 2015|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the osmotic pressure, or [[osmolarity]], of the organism’s cells is equal to the [[osmotic]] pressure of their surrounding environment.  By minimizing the osmotic gradient, this subsequently minimizes the net [[inflow (hydrology)|influx]] and [[Flux|efflux]] of water into and out of cells.  Even though osmoconformers have an internal environment that's isosmotic to their external environment the types of [[ions]] in the two environments differ greatly in order to allow critical biological functions to occur.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|last2=Lawrence|first2=G. Mitchell|last3=Reece|first3=Jane B.|title=Biology Concepts &amp; Connections|date=2000|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|pages=506–507|chapter=Control of the Internal Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A benefit to osmoconformation is that organisms don’t need to expend as much energy as [[osmoregulator]]s in order to regulate ion gradients.  However, to ensure the correct types of ions are in their desired location, a small amount of energy is expended on ion transport.  A disadvantage to osmoconformation is that organisms are subject to changes in the osmolarity of their environment.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Timothy J.|title=Animal Osmoregulation|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University|pages=58–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Invertebrates ===

Most osmoconformers are [[marine invertebrates]] such as [[echinoderms]] (such as starfish), [[mussels]], marine crabs, [[lobsters]], [[jellyfish]], [[ascidians]] ([[sea squirts]] - primitive chordates), and [[scallops]].  Some [[insects]] are also osmoconformers.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Some osmoconformers, such as echinoderms, are [[stenohaline]], which means they can only survive in a limited range of external osmolarities.  The survival of such organisms is thus contingent on their external osmotic environment remaining relatively constant.  &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; On the other hand, some osmoconformers are classified as [[euryhaline]], which means they can survive in a broad range of external osmolarities. Mussels are a prime example of a euryhaline osmoconformer.  Mussels have adapted to survive in a broad range of external salinities due to their ability to close their shells which allows them to seclude themselves from unfavorable external environments. &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

=== Craniates ===

There are a couple of examples of osmoconformers that are [[craniates]] such as [[hagfish]], skates and [[sharks]]. Their body fluid is isoosmotic with seawater, but their high osmolarity is maintained by making the concentration of organic solutes unnaturally high. Sharks concentrate urea in their body, and since urea denatures proteins at high concentrations, they also accumulate [[trimethylamine N-oxide]] (TMAO) to counter the effect. Sharks adjust their internal osmolarity according to the osmolarity of the sea water surrounding them. Rather than ingesting sea water in order to change their internal salinity, sharks are able to absorb sea water directly. This is due to the high concentration of urea kept inside their bodies. This high concentration of urea creates a [[diffusion]] gradient which permits the shark to absorb water in order to equalize the concentration difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Amelia|title=Sharks|url=http://www.sharksinfo.com/osmoregulation.html|website=Sharks Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crab-eating frog]], or Rana cancrivora, is an example of a vertebrate osmoconformer. The crab-eating frog also regulates its rates of urea retention and excretion, which allows them to survive and maintain their status as osmoconformers in a wide range of external salinities.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Hagfish maintain an internal ion composition plasma that differs from that of seawater.  The internal ionic environment of hagfish contains a lower concentration of [[divalent]] ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2-) and a slightly higher concentration of [[monovalent ion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vu1uzL0p7xsC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=osmoconformer+hagfish#v=onepage&amp;q=osmoconformer%20hagfish&amp;f=true | title = The Biology of Hagfishes | isbn = 9780412785306 | author1 = Jørgensen | first1 = Jørgen Mørup | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagfish therefore have to expend some energy for osmoregulation.

==Biochemistry==

[[Ion gradient]]s are crucial to many major biological functions on a cellular level.  Consequently, the ionic composition of an organism's internal environment is highly regulated with respect to its external environment.  Osmoconformers have adapted so that they utilize the ionic composition of their external environment, which is typically seawater, in order to support important biological functions.  For instance, seawater has a high concentration of [[sodium ion]]s, which helps support [[muscle contraction]] and [[neuronal]] signaling when paired with high internal concentrations of [[potassium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

'''Peter Nyombi''' (23 April 1954 – 7 October 2018) was a Ugandan [[lawyer]] and [[politician]]. He was an [[Attorney General]] and member of the [[Cabinet of Uganda|Ugandan Cabinet]], appointed on 27 May 2011. He replaced [[Kiddu Makubuya]] who became [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Minister for General Duties in the Office of the Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Uganda State House|accessdate=4 March 2015|

title=Comprehensive List of New Cabinet Appointments &amp; Dropped Ministers|first=.|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cabinet reshuffle of 1 March 2015, he was dropped from the cabinet and was replaced by [[Fred Ruhindi]]. He was also the elected [[Parliament of Uganda|Member of Parliament]] for "Buruuli County" in [[Nakasongola District]].

==Background and education==
Nyombi was born in [[Nakasongola District]], on 23 April 1954, to Eriakimu Kajja, a schoolteacher and Mrs. Kajja, a full-time housewife.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Nyombi is one of thirteen siblings, one of his brothers is [[John Senyonyi|Professor John Musisi Senyonyi]], the [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Uganda Christian University]] and another was diplomatic service member [[Henry Mayega]], who was deputy head of mission for the embassy in China.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burial Program For Ex Attorney General Peter Nyombi Released |url=https://kampalapost.com/content/news/burial-program-ex-attorney-general-peter-nyombi-released |work=Kampala Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nyombi attended Nakasongola Primary School followed by Kings College Buddo for his O-Level and A-Level education.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; In 1973, he was admitted to [[Makerere University]], Uganda's largest and oldest public university, established in 1922. He studied law, graduating in 1976, with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; In 1977, he received the [[Legal practice|Diploma in Legal Practice]] from the [[Law Development Centre]].&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|date=1 August 2013| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/artsculture/Reviews/Peter-Nyombi--The-lawyer--the-politician--the-man/-/691232/1933686/-/yicqn6/-/index.html|title=Peter Nyombi: The Lawyer, The Politician, The Man|accessdate=20 March 2015|first=John|
last=Abimanyi|newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] (Kampala)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1977 until 1986, he worked as a State Attorney in the Department of Public Prosecution in the Ugandan Ministry of Justice. For the next ten years, from 1986 until 1996, he served as Counsel in the Office of the Inspector General of Government (IGG). From 1996 until 2001, he worked as the Director of Legal Affairs in the office of the IGG. In 2001, he opened his own legal practice, ''Nyombi and Company Advocates'', which is still operation as of March 2015. Also in 2001, he was elected to the [[Parliament of Uganda|Uganda's Parliament]] to represent "Buruuli County", Nakasongola District.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; From May 2011 until March 2015, he served as Uganda's Attorney General.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=new/&gt;  Nyombi represented Nakasongola County in parliament from 2006 to 2016 when he lost his seat to [[Noah Mutebi]].&lt;ref name=urn/&gt;  He helped to provide solar panels to maternity wards and health centres, renovate schools and provide boreholes for his constituency.&lt;ref name=urn/&gt;  Nyombi provided free legal advice to military veterans seeking compensation from the government and to constituents involved in land disputes.&lt;ref name=urn/&gt;

==Controversy==
In August 2013 the [[Uganda Law Society]], an industry association suspended Nyombi from membership, citing three controversial opinions that he had rendered, opinions that contravened conventional legal understanding:&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite web|last=Rugambwa|
url=http://www.independent.co.ug/news/news/8179-uls-suspends-attorney-general-peter-nyombi|title=ULS Suspends Attorney General Peter Nyombi|accessdate=20 March 2015|date=30 August 2013| first=Ivan| newspaper=[[The Independent (Uganda)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# He advised [[Rebecca Kadaga]], the [[Parliament of Uganda|Speaker of Parliament]], that three MPs expelled by their political party, the [[National Resistance Movement]], could keep their parliamentary seats.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;
# He advised the President, [[Yoweri Museveni]], that it was Constitutional for [[Aronda Nyakairima|General Aronda Nyakairima]], an actively serving officer in the [[Uganda People's Defence Force]] to serve in the [[Cabinet of Uganda|Ugandan Cabinet]], as [[Minister of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;
# He advised the President that the former Chief Justice of Uganda, [[Benjamin Odoki|Justice Benjamin Odoki]], who had attained the mandatory retirement age of 70 years, could continue to serve on the bench beyond the age of 70, as stipulated in the constitution.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

'''Powhatan Henry Clarke'''  (October 9, 1862 – July 21, 1893) was a [[United States Army]] [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] who was a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] during the [[Apache Wars#Geronimo's War|Geronimo Campaign]] in [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. He received the medal for rescuing a wounded soldier on May 3, 1886.&lt;ref name="indianwars"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/indianwars.html|title=Medal of Honor recipients Indian Wars Period|publisher=Army Center of Military History|accessdate= April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Clarke was born at [[Ulster Plantation, Boyce, Louisiana]] on October 9, 1862. He was the grandson of U.S. federal judge [[Henry Boyce]] and Irene Archinard, and the son of Louise Frances Boyce and Dr. (Professor) Powhatan Clarke.&lt;ref name="nytclarkeobit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/07/23/109264971.pdf|title=Lieut.

He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1884.&lt;ref name="p80"&gt;Thapp (1991), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] in the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s at [[Fort Davis, Texas]].&lt;ref name="p80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clarke10th"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalosoldierselpaso.org/LtPowhattanHClarke.html|title=Lieutenant Powhattan H.

He received a [[Medal of Honor]] for this action. He was the commander of [[Apache Scouts]] until 1891. In 1891, he became [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] and he was transferred to the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]]. He was back with the 10th Cavalry by early 1892. In 1891&amp;ndash;92 he was an observer, stationed at [[Düsseldorf]], with a Westphalian hussar regiment. The discipline of the German Army greatly impressed him.&lt;ref name="germanarmy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/05/17/108213081.pdf|title=German Army Discipline|date=May 17, 1892|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 13, 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1892 until his death in 1893, he lived in Fort Custer, [[Montana]]. In 1892 he married Elizabeth Clemens of St. Louis, Missouri; they had one son. He drowned in the [[Little Bighorn River]] on July 21, 1893, and was buried at [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="clarke10th"/&gt;

The term '''psychic apparatus''' (also '''psychical apparatus''', '''mental apparatus''') denotes a central, theoretic construct of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[metapsychology]], wherein:

{{quote|We assume that mental life is the function of an apparatus to which we ascribe the characteristics of being extended in space and of being made up of several portions &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Id, ego and super-ego]].|Freud, ''An Outline of Psychoanalysis'' (1940)}}

As a [[Ego psychology|psychologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] used the German terms '''''psychischer Apparat''''' and '''''seelischer Apparat''''', about the functioning of which he elaborates:

{{quote|We picture the unknown apparatus, which serves the activities of the mind, as being really like an instrument constructed of several parts (which we speak of as 'agencies'), each of which performs a particular function, and which have a fixed, spatial relation to one another: it being understood that by 'spatial relation'—'in front of' and 'behind', 'superficial' and 'deep'—we merely mean, in the first instance, a representation of the regular succession of the functions.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Freud proposed the psychic apparatus as solely a theoretic construct explaining the functioning of the [[mind]], and not a [[Neurology|neurologic]] structure of the [[brain]]:

{{quote|It is a [[hypothesis]], like so many others in the sciences: the very earliest ones have always been rather rough. 'Open to revision', we can say in such cases ... the value of a 'fiction' of this kind ... depends on how much one can achieve with its help.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Moreover, in emphasizing the immateriality of the psychic apparatus, Freud dismissed the matter of its physical substance:

{{quote|That is not a subject of psychological interest. [[Ego psychology|Psychology]] can be as indifferent to it as, for instance, optics can be to the question of whether the walls of a telescope are made of metal or cardboard. We shall leave entirely to one side the '''material''' line of approach.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

'''Pterygotioidea''' (the name deriving from the [[type genus]] ''[[Pterygotus]]'', meaning "winged fish") is a [[superfamily (taxonomy)|superfamily]] of [[eurypterid]]s, an extinct group of aquatic [[arthropod]]s. '''Pterygotioids''' were the most [[Derived trait|derived]] members of the [[infraorder]] [[Diploperculata]] and the [[sister taxon|sister group]] of the [[Adelophthalmoidea|adelophthalmoid]] eurypterids. The group includes the [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] and small [[Hughmilleriidae|hughmilleriids]], the larger and specialized [[Slimonidae|slimonids]] and the famous [[Pterygotidae|pterygotids]] which were equipped with robust and powerful [[Chelicerae|cheliceral]] claws.

Though the more primitive hughmilleriids were small, ''[[Hughmilleria|Hughmilleria wangi]]'' being the smallest of all pterygotioids at just {{convert|6|cm|in}} in length, later members of the group, particularly in the Pterygotidae, would become the largest known arthropods to ever exist with several genera surpassing {{convert|2|m|ft}} in length.&lt;ref name="Braddy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braddy|first1=Simon J.|last2=Poschmann|first2=Markus|last3=Tetlie|first3=O. Erik|year=2007|title=Giant claw reveals the largest ever arthropod|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/1/106|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=4|issue=1|pages=106–109|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0491|pmc=2412931|pmid=18029297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all currently recognized eurypterid clades, the Pterygotioidea is the most diverse, containing over 50 species in 10 genera. With the number of recognized eurypterid species being around 250, pterygotioids account for more than a fifth of all known eurypterid species.&lt;ref name=":032"/&gt; Though the group only existed for around 50 million years and during a time when most continents were separated by large expanses of water (in contrast with previous and later periods of time when there had been [[Supercontinent|supercontinents]]), the Pterygotioidea had the most [[cosmopolitan distribution]] of all eurypterid groups. Their fossils have been recovered from Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Asia and Australia, with the earliest remains being from the [[Early Silurian]] of [[Scotland]] and [[South China]]. The exact geographical origin of the group remains unknown, but is thought to have been in [[Laurentia]].

Though several characteristic and diagnostic traits can be established for each of the families included within the Pterygotioidea, the group as a whole is primarily joined together by the shared features of marginal eyes, that their compound eyes are placed near or on the margin of the [[carapace]] (the "head" plate).

Like all other [[Chelicerata|chelicerates]], and other arthropods in general, pterygotioid eurypterids possessed [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a [[cuticle]] composed of [[Protein|proteins]] and [[chitin]]. In the [[Pterygotidae]], the outer surface of the [[exoskeleton]] was covered in a scale-like ornamentation but it was smooth within [[Slimonidae]] and [[Hughmilleriidae]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology]], Part P Arthropoda 2, Chelicerata|author=Størmer|first=Leif|publisher=|year=1955|isbn=|location=|page=23|pages=|chapter=Merostomata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chelicerate body is divided into two [[Tagmata (arthropod anatomy)|tagmata]] (sections); the frontal [[prosoma]] (head) and posterior [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and were characterized in pterygotids and slimonids by being small and slender and lacking spines.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In contrast, the more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Hughmilleriids did possess spines on their appendages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tollerton|first=V. P.|date=1989|title=Morphology, taxonomy, and classification of the order Eurypterida Burmeister, 1843|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/morphology-taxonomy-and-classification-of-the-order-eurypterida-burmeister-1843/F3D57FFFD0549E9F0947E562D8307055|journal=Journal of Paleontology|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=642–657|doi=10.1017/S0022336000041275|issn=0022-3360|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[derived (phylogenetics)|derived]] members of the group, Slimonidae and Pterygotidae, the [[telson]] (the posteriormost segment of the body) was expanded and flattened, often with a spike protruding from its end.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plotnick|first=Roy E.|last2=Baumiller|first2=Tomasz K.|date=1988-01-01|title=The pterygotid telson as a biological rudder|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1502-3931.1988.tb01746.x/abstract|journal=Lethaia|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=13–27|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1988.tb01746.x|issn=1502-3931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telsons of the Hughmilleriidae were not flattened, instead being lanceolate (in the shape of a [[lance]] or spike) and similar to those of more primitive eurypterids such as ''[[Eurypterus]]''.&lt;ref name="fi"&gt;Clarke, J. K., Ruedemann R. (1912) "[[wikisource:The Eurypterida of New York/Volume 1/Pterygotidae|The Eurypterida of New York]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other chelicerates, pterygotioids possessed [[chelicerae]]. These appendages are the only ones that appear before the mouth and take the form of small pincers used to feed in most eurypterid groups. This function is retained in the more basal Hughmilleriidae and Slimonidae, but pterygotid chelicerae were large and long with strong and well developed teeth on specialized [[Chela (organ)|chelae]] (claws).&lt;ref name=":0222" /&gt;

== History of research ==
[[File:Pterygotus_problematicus.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pterygotus_problematicus.png|left|thumb|Fossils described by [[John William Salter]] as belonging to "''[[Pterygotus]] problematicus''" in 1852. This species is now considered a ''[[nomen vanum]]''.]]The first pterygotioid fossils to be uncovered were those of the [[type genus]], ''Pterygotus''. [[Louis Agassiz]], a Swiss-American [[biologist]] and [[geologist]], described the fossils in 1839 and named it ''Pterygotus'' in the mistaken belief that they were the fossil remains of a large fish; "''Pterygotus''" translating to "winged fish".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hOxCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pterygotus+winged+one+name|title=The Silurian System, Founded on Geological Researches in the Counties of Salop, Hereford, Radnor, Montgomery, Caermarthen, Brecon, Pembroke, Monmouth, Gloucester, Worcester, and Stafford: With Descriptions of the Coalfields and Overlying Formations|last=Murchison|first=Roderick Impey|publisher=Albemarle Street|year=1839|isbn=|location=|pages=606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agassiz first recognized the true nature of the fossils as arthropod remains five years later in 1844 after having examined more complete fossils recovered in the [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kjellesvig-Waering|first=Erik N.|date=1964|title=A Synopsis of the Family Pterygotidae Clarke and Ruedemann, 1912 (Eurypterida)|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=38|issue=2|pages=331–361|jstor=1301554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the species ''Pterygotus acuminata'' was named by [[John William Salter]]. The fossils referred to this species, recovered from [[Lesmahagow]], [[Scotland]], were soon realized to be distinct from other species of ''Pterygotus'' (such as the [[type species]] ''P. anglicus'') and that same year geologist [[David Page (geologist)|David Page]] erected a new genus to contain the species. The new genus, ''[[Slimonia]]'', could be differentiated from other known species of ''Pterygotus'' most apparently by the lack of large cheliceral claws, otherwise a defining characteristic of ''Pterygotus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Henry Alleyne|date=1868-01-01|title=III.

In 1903, the genus ''[[Hughmilleria]]'' was created based on fossils discovered in the Pittsford Shale Member of the [[Vernon Formation]]. It's describer, the American geologist Clifton J. Sarle, considered the genus to represent an intermediate form between the more basal ''Eurypterus'' and the derived ''Pterygotus'' but did not assign ''Hughmilleria'' to any particular [[family (biology)|family]].&lt;ref name="l2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarle|first=Clifton J.|title=A new eurypterid fauna from the base of the Salina of western New York|url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/43853136|publisher=New York State Museum Bulletin|volume=69|pp=1080–1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family Pterygotidae was erected in 1912 by [[John Mason Clarke]] and [[Rudolf Ruedemann]] to constitute a group for the genera ''Pterygotus'', ''Slimonia'', ''[[Hastimima]]'' and ''Hughmilleria''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ''Pterygotus'' had also been designated as containing two [[subgenera]]; ''Pterygotus'' (''Curviramus'') and ''Pterygotus'' (''Erettopterus''), but ''[[Erettopterus]]'' would later be raised to its own genus.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; American paleontologist Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering emended the Pterygotidae in 1951, referring the genera ''Hastimima'', ''Hughmilleria'' and ''Slimonia'', and the newly named ''[[Grossopterus]]'', to their own family within the Eurypteracea, Hughmilleriidae, leaving ''Pterygotus'' as the sole pterygotid genus.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

In 1955, Norwegian paleontolgist and geologist [[Leif Størmer]] considered the pterygotid clade to represent a family within the eurypterid [[Superfamily (taxonomy)|superfamily]] "Eurypteracea".&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; In 1962, Norwegian paleontologist Nestor Novojilov raised the Eurypteracea and Pterygotidae to subordinal and superfamily status, Eurypteracea becoming the suborder [[Eurypterina]] and creating the superfamily Pterygotioidea, containing Hughmilleriidae and Pterygotidae.&lt;ref&gt;Novojilov, N. 1962: ''Order Eurypterida''.

Pterygotioidea is the most derived superfamily of the suborder and contains over 50 species (the exact number obscured by dubious species and possible synonyms), which accounts for more than a fifth of the approximately 250 known eurypterid species. The closest sister group of the Pterygotioidea, Adelophthalmoidea, also contains a large amount of species, over 40, and is the second most diverse eurypterid superfamily.&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;

Though the Pterygotidae are accepted to clearly represent the most derived group within the pterygotioid superfamily, there has been an ongoing debate on whether the hughmilleriids or the slimonids are the most closely related to the pterygotids, and thus also which of the two families is the most basal. This debate was resolved with the description of ''[[Ciurcopterus]]'', a primitive pterygotid that clearly combines features of ''Slimonia'' (especially within the appendages) and of more derived pterygotid eurypterids, revealing that Slimonidae was the closest [[sister taxon|sister-group]] of the Pterygotidae.&lt;ref name=":0222" /&gt;

The lack of ornamentation in the telson of ''Hughmilleria'', combined with the fact that the genus shares certain characteristics with basal adelophthalmids (in particular the triangular anterior margin of the carapace), places it as the most basal genus in the superfamily.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tetlie|first=O.

== Distribution ==
Eurypterids are most commonly recovered from fossil deposits in [[Scandinavia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[British Isles|Britain]] and [[North America]]. During the Silurian and Devonian periods, when pterygotioids were alive, these regions and continents were part of the continents [[Baltica]] (Scandinavia and Eastern Europe), [[Avalonia]] (Germany, Britain, parts of eastern North America) and [[Laurentia]] (most of eastern continental North America). It is around these continents, and the [[Rhenohercynian Zone|Rheno-Hercynian Terrane]] (western and central Europe), that pterygotioids are the most common.&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pterygotioid fossils have also been recovered from other parts of the world where fossils of other eurypterid groups are absent, including [[Australia]], [[Morocco]], [[Libya]], [[Florida]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[China]], [[Paris]], [[South America]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Siberia]], which indicates that the group had spread significantly during their 50 million year existence. Pterygotioids appear to have been relatively abundant throughout the Silurian and Devonian world, with unusually (in terms of eurypterids, most groups being absent entirely) large numbers recovered from the ancient continent of [[Gondwana]] (composed of [[Africa]], [[India]], [[South America]], [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]]).&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The earliest known pterygotioids, belonging to the genus ''Hughmilleria'', are from the [[Llandovery epoch]] of the Silurian and appear around the same time in Laurentia, [[Scotland]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]]. With the group already being widespread at this seemingly early stage in their evolution, it is difficult to pinpoint their exact geographical point of origin. The closest relatives and sister clade of the pterygotioids, the superfamily [[Adelophthalmoidea]], originated in Laurentia. Modern researchers assume that the case would be the same with the pterygotioids, which are thought to have originated within, or in close proximity to, Laurentia.&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;

It remains unclear whether pterygotioids were capable of crossing oceans on a regular basis or if species recovered outside of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia represent isolated occurrences. Pterygotioids were, like the related adelophthalmoids, excellent swimmers which might help explain the intercontinental dispersal patterns and wide-ranging distribution seen in both superfamilies.&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;

Dr '''Robert Mortimer Glover''' [[FRSE]] (1815-1859) was a British physician. In 1838 he co-founded the '''Paris Medical Society''' and served as its first Vice President. He won the [[Medical Society of London]]’s Fothergill Gold Medal in 1846 for his lecture "On the Pathology and Treatment of [[Scrofula]]". Some 5 years prior to [[James Young Simpson]]’s use of [[chloroform]] on human patients in 1842 Glover discovered its anaesthetic qualities on laboratory animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes called "the true discoverer of chloroform". In an ironic twist of fate he died from a chloroform overdose.

==Life==

He was born in [[South Shields]] on 2 November 1815 to William Glover, a merchant, and his wife Catherine. In 1829 he was apprenticed to Thomas J. Aitken TRCSE of 31 Nicolson Street in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1829-30&lt;/ref&gt; He began studying Medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] the following year, and was clerked to Prof [[James Syme]] at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. In 1834 he travelled to [[Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]] to study under Prof Lombard. In 1835 he was elected a member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh. In 1837 he received his licence to practice medicine and travelled to [[Paris]], founding the Paris Medical Society the following year and serving as its first Vice President.

He returned briefly to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in 1839 before again heading to [[Edinburgh]] in 1840. This was to defend his thesis "On the Physiological and Medical Properties of Bromine and its Compounds" from which he then received his doctorate (MD). He then returned to Newcastle to stay with his brother William Glover who was also a doctor, operating from 12 Northumberland Street. He joined the Newcastle School of Medicine and Practical Sciences, serving as Chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Head of the Department of Materia Medica and Therapeutics.

In 1842 he won the Gold Medal of the [[Harveian Society]] for his thesis on the properties of chloroform and bromine, including the first description of the anaesthetic effects of chloroform (injected into the neck of a dog). The paper acknowledged the potential effects upon the heart (including potential death). He omitted to spot its potential use during surgery. Glover later wrote to James Young Simpson, decrying Simpson’s failure to credit his own contributions. Simpson answered that he did not follow "animal experiments". However, as Simpson was one of the university assessors of Glover’s thesis (which contained the same theories) this claim seems a little hollow. Simpson should have read his thesis even if he claimed he had not. Simpson’s use on humans is generally described as "the first" and this is technically correct, if perhaps obfuscating other factors. It equally belittles the contribution of Simpson’s dentist neighbour, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]], who used chloroform in clinical conditions to extract a tooth (perhaps its safest use) on 11 November 1847, and equally deserves more recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Dental History Magazine: Vol 2 Issue 1 p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Glover's findings were confirmed by Dr [[Robert Halliday Gunning]] in May 1848, also disproving Simpson's theories on the reasons for the effects of chloroform.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/research_awards/prizes/prize_lists/gunning_victoria_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 Glover assisted [[John Fife (surgeon)|Prof John Fife]] at Newcastle Infirmary in the autopsy of 15 year old Hannah Greener, who had died under the effects of chloroform whilst having an infected toenail removed. She was the first human death from chloroform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blessed Days of Anaesthesia by Stephanie Snow 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his proposer being Sir [[Robert Christison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1851 the Newcastle School of Medicine was dissolved following various arguments over rent owed to the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway Company]] and moves to be absorbed by [[Durham University]]. Glover and Dawson set up a new school, whilst the majority of teachers ran a rival school under the umbrella of Durham University. The two factions reunited in 1857 after Glover had left Newcastle.

Late in 1854 he appears at the Royal Free Hospital in London under the name of Mortimer Glover, living at 2 Tavistock Place off [[Russell Square]]. Here he worked with Frederick James Gant and [[Thomas Wakley]]. He was reprimanded for failure to receive his London licence to practice (LRCP) and being slack in clinical duties. He asked for a leave of absence in April 1855. Together with Gant he volunteered to join the medical staff in the Crimea, also attracted by the very large stipend of £1500 per annum.

On 25 April 1855 they sailed on HMS Candia reaching [[Üsküdar|Scutari]] on 26 May 1855. Gant and Glover were amongst the five civilian surgeons working at the Barracks at Scutari. Glover caught [[dysentery]] here and began taking doses of [[opium]] and chloroform to deal with this. Civil surgeons and military surgeons did not mix well and the civil surgeons were dispensed of prior to the end of the war. Gant and Glover left in January 1856 having been of little practical purpose. Gant returned to the Royal Free Hospital but Glover did not, neither did he resign. His name disappears from their records in 1856.

In July 1856 he at last passed his LRCP.

His health deteriorated after his time serving in the [[Crimean War]] at which point he became addicted to both opium and chloroform. Destitute and unable to work, he took lodgings with a Mr Walter Rochfort a pharmacist, at 1 Kensington Park Gardens in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]].

Sadly Glover died from an overdose of chloroform at 1 Kensington Park Road in London, taken on 9 April 1859. His friend Frederick James Gant and Mt Rochfort were with him when he died the following day, 10 April. Setting aside [[Horace Wells]]’ chloroform-assisted suicide, he was the first professional to die purely from the use (or abuse) of chloroform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His friend Gant performed an autopsy on 11 April, a horrible task on a friend. He found 4 pints (2 litres) of bloody mucus in his guts, smelling of chloroform. He was estimated to have taken a liquid dose of 2 to 5 ounces of pure chloroform (60-150ml). His enlarged liver indicated long-term abuse predating Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/anaesthesia59_394_400_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Wakley]] oversaw the inquest of his death, acting both as a former friend and coroner of Middlesex at the time. He was also editor of [[The Lancet]] at the time. His brother William Glover attended as did Gant, Hopton and a J. Millar. A verdict of "accidental death by excessive use of chloroform taken as a sedative" was found, it being concluded not as a deliberate suicide.

He was buried in [[City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell|Hanwell Cemetery]] in an unmarked grave on 14 April 1859.

In May 1853, he applied his knowledge of chemistry to a different field, lodging a [[patent]] for an arsenic-based paint for the hulls of ships to prevent the growth of barnacles and algae.&lt;ref&gt;The Repertory of Patent Inventions: and other Discoveries and Improvements, Alexander MacIntosh 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 1859, shortly before his death, in a very strange act, Glover married Sarah Hickson a 36 year old seamstress who had escaped from [[Colney Hatch Asylum]] (allegedly where the word "booby hatch" comes from&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2007/11/booby-hatch.html&lt;/ref&gt;). This was Britain’s largest mental asylum, and she had been there for seven years for "violent and dangerous behaviour". She was also from Newcastle and they had met through her friend Rochfort. As she was described as "lunatic as himself" (himself meaning Glover) this attests to Glovers mental state in his final months. They honeymooned for a week at a hotel at 30 Charles Street in [[Westminster]] before she was recaptured and escorted back to Colney Hatch.

==Career==
Bedair received the Bachelor's degree (with first class honors) from the Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt, in June 1972. He was the recipient of the first Master's degree to be awarded by the Military Technical College, in July 1976. He worked in the Electronics Laboratories of the [[University of Kent]], [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], England from April 1978 to July 1982, where he received the Ph.D. degree in July 1981. He was a member of the teaching staff of the Military Technical College from June 1972 to December 1982. He joined the [[Egyptian Air Force]] in January 1983, where he was in the Department of Research and Technical Developments until July 1987. In August 1987, he became engaged in a research project related to the design and fabrication of various [[Monolithic microwave integrated circuit|monolithic microwave integrated devices]] (MMICs) at the Electrical Engineering Department at the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]], [[Germany]]. His experiences covered several aspects of electrical and electronic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/108321|title=Fast, accurate and simple approximate analytic formulas for calculating the parameters of supported coplanar waveguides for (M)MIC's - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==His death==
During his stay in his brother's apartment in [[Camp Chezar]] in [[Alexandria]] on July 14th, 1989, he fell to his death from the balcony in unclear circumstances. His veins were found cut and a gas leak was detected in the apartment. It is unclear how Said Bedair died. Many Arabic and Egyptian sources claim that the assassination technique was planned to appear as a suicide and that he was assassinated by the [[Israel]]i [[Mosaad]]. His wife negated the possibility that her husband would commit suicide.&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

'''Sanofi S.A.''' is a French [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in Paris, [[France]], as of 2013 the world's fifth-largest by [[Prescription drug|prescription]] sales.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Palmer and Carly Helfand for FiercePharma. 4 March 2014 [http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/top-10-pharma-companies-2013-revenue#ixzz2y9cVWuGd The top 10 pharma companies by 2013 revenue]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was formed as '''Sanofi-Aventis''' in 2004 by the merger of Aventis and Sanofi-Synthélabo, which were each the product of several previous mergers. It changed its name to Sanofi in May 2011. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents|title=Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange): Stock market quotes, charts and news|website=www.boerse-frankfurt.de|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi engages in the [[research and development]], manufacturing and marketing of [[pharmaceutical drugs]] principally in the prescription market, but the firm also develops [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medication]]. The company covers seven major therapeutic areas: [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]], [[central nervous system]], [[diabetes]], [[internal medicine]], [[oncology]], [[thrombosis]] and [[vaccine]]s (it is the world's largest producer of the latter through its subsidiary [[Sanofi Pasteur]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/11/23/afx4368351.html|title=Sanofi-Aventis to sign deal to build flu vaccine plant in China - source|date=23 November 2007|work=[[AFX News]]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Sanofi-Synthélabo===
Sanofi was founded in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/entreprises/le-fondateur-de-sanofi-est-mort_1366122.html|title=Le fondateur de Sanofi est mort|work=lexpress.fr|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a subsidiary of [[Elf Aquitaine]] (a French oil company subsequently acquired by [[Total S.A.|Total]]), when Elf Aquitaine took control of the Labaz group, a pharmaceutical company.  In 1993 Sanofi made a move into the Eastern Europe market by acquiring a controlling interest in Chinoin, a Hungarian drug company that had about US$104 million in sales in 1992.&lt;ref name=PL1993&gt;Staff, The Pharma Letter.

[[Synthélabo]] was founded in 1970 through the merger of two French pharmaceutical laboratories, Laboratoires Dausse (founded in 1834) and Laboratoires Robert &amp; Carrière (founded in 1899). In 1973, the French cosmetics group [[L’Oréal]] acquired the majority of its share capital.&lt;ref name=20F-2002/&gt;{{rp|19}}  In 1991, Synthelabo acquired Laboratories Delalande&lt;ref&gt;Denis Cosnard for Les Echos.  11 December 1991.

Sanofi-Synthélabo was formed in 1999 when Sanofi merged with Synthélabo; at the time of the merger Sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in France in terms of sales and Synthélabo was the third largest. The merged company was based in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=20F-2002/&gt;{{rp|18–19}}&lt;ref&gt;Tom Meek for PMLiVE 24 May 2013 [http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/a_look_back_at_sanofis_merger_with_synthelabo_477146 A look back at Sanofi's merger with Synthélabo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals, divesting several businesses soon after the merger, including beauty, diagnostics, animal health and nutrition, custom chemicals, and two medical equipment businesses.&lt;ref name=20F-2002/&gt;{{rp|19}}

===Aventis===
[[File:Aventis logo.png|left]]
Aventis was formed in 1999 when French company [[Rhône-Poulenc]] S.A. merged with the German corporation [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]], which itself was formed from the 1995 merger of [[Hoechst AG]] with [[Cassella]], [[Roussel Uclaf]] and [[Marion Merrell Dow]].

At the time of the merger, Rhône-Poulenc's business included the pharmaceutical businesses Rorer, Centeon (blood products), and [[Sanofi Pasteur|Pasteur Merieux]] (vaccines),  the plant and animal health businesses Rhône-Poulenc Agro, Rhône-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, and [[Merial]], and a 67 percent share in [[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]], a speciality chemicals company.&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|10}}   Hoechst, one of the companies resulting from the post-WWII split of [[IG Farben]], had seven primary businesses: Hoechst Marion Roussel (pharmaceuticals), [[AgrEvo]] (a joint venture with [[Schering AG|Schering]] in crop protection agents and pest control products), HR Vet (veterinary products), [[Dade Behring]] (diagnostics), Centeon, [[Celanese]] (chemicals), and Messer (chemicals).&lt;ref name=Bris/&gt;{{rp|9}} [[Institut Mérieux|Merieux]] has been in the business of selling blood products, and In the 1980s during the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|AIDS epidemic]], Merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] that were sold to developing nations.&lt;ref name = NYTimes1996&gt;{{cite news | title =  Blood, Money and AIDS: Haemophiliacs Are Split; Liability Cases Bogged Down in Disputes | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/11/business/blood-money-aids-hemophiliacs-are-split-liability-cases-bogged-down-disputes.html | first = Barry | last = Meier | date = 1996-06-11 | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 2000 Aventis and [[Millennium Pharmaceuticals]], a US biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the then-new science of [[genomics]], announced that Aventis would make a $250M investment in Millennium and would pay $200M to Millennium in research fees over five years, one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. 24 June 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/business/international-business-aventis-unit-sets-big-investment-biotechnology-start-up.html Aventis Unit Sets Big Investment in Biotechnology Start-Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, in the midst of the [[StarLink corn recall|recall of Starlink]], its [[genetically modified maize]] product, Aventis announced that it had determined to sell off Aventis Cropscience, the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 16 November 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/business/aventis-to-sell-agriculture-unit.html Aventis to Sell Agriculture Unit]&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2001, [[Bayer]] and Aventis announced that Bayer would acquire the unit for about $6.6 billion, with the unit becoming [[Bayer CropScience]] and making Bayer the world's second-largest agrochemical company behind [[Syngenta]].&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money.  2 October 2001 [http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/10/02/europe/bayer/ Bayer buys CropScience]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Aventis entered into a collaboration with [[Regeneron]], a New York biotechnology company, to develop Regeneron's [[VEGF]]-inhibiting drug, [[aflibercept]], in the field of cancer, which was then in [[Phases of clinical research|Phase I]] clinical trials.  Aventis invested $45 million in Regeneron and made an upfront payment of $80 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;Candace Hoffmann for First Word Pharma.  8 September 2003 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/215613#axzz2yoOgZJHQ Aventis inks deal with Regeneron for collaboration on cancer therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Regeneron partnered the drug with [[Bayer Healthcare]] in the field of proliferative eye diseases, and under the name Eylea it was approved by the FDA in 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= John | last= Gever |url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/Ophthalmology/GeneralOphthalmology/29811 |title=FDA Approves Eylea for Macular Degeneration |publisher=MedpageToday.com |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; after several setbacks in clinical trials,&lt;ref&gt;Ciombor KK et al.

====Sanofi-Aventis merger====
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid worth €47.8 billion for Aventis. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company's share value, and the board of Aventis went so far as to enact [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]] provisions and to invite [[Novartis]] to enter merger negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 3 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/03/business/international-business-aventis-invites-novartis-to-counter-sanofi-s-bid.html Aventis Invites Novartis To Counter Sanofi's Bid]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid.  The [[France|French]] government played a strong role, desiring what it called a "local solution", by putting heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis and for Aventis to accept the offer&lt;ref&gt;Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 27 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/france-helped-broker-the-aventis-sanofi-deal.html France Helped Broker the Aventis-Sanofi Deal]&lt;/ref&gt; and by rejecting Aventis' poison pill proposal.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times 24 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/business/aventis-plan-is-rejected.html Aventis Plan Is Rejected]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the largest risks in the deal for both sides, was the fate of the patents protecting [[Clopidogrel]] (Plavix) which was one of the top-selling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of Sanofi's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly S Cleaves and Ann M Thayer [http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v07/i08/pdf/804business2.pdf Warning, merge with care: Sanofi-Aventis] Modern Drug Discovery, August 2004:21-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-merger activities===
In 2006, Iraqis infected with HIV sued Sanofi and Baxter due to HIV-[[contaminated haemophilia blood products]] sold by Merieux in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul von Zielbauer for the New York Times. 4 September 2006 [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/04/world/middleeast/04aids.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Iraqis Infected by H.I.V.-Tainted Blood Try New Tool: A Lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the US patents on [[clopidogrel]] (Plavix) were challenged when a Canadian generics company, [[Apotex]], filed an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] under the [[Hatch-Waxman Act]], received FDA approval, and started marketing a generic clopidogrel.

In 2007 Sanofi-Aventis expanded on Aventis' prior relationship with [[Regeneron]]; in the new deal Sanofi-Aventis agreed to pay Regeneron $100 million each year for five years, under which Regeneron would use its [[monoclonal antibody]] [[drug discovery|discovery]] platform to create new [[biopharmaceuticals]], which Sanofi-Aventis gained the exclusive right to co-develop.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand&gt;Ron Winslow for the Wall Street Journal. 10 Nov. 2009 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574528224003357650 Sanofi Expands Regeneron Deal]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the companies expanded the deal to $160 million per year and extended it through 2017.&lt;ref name=RegenExpand/&gt;&lt;ref name=GEN2009&gt;Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. 11 Nov 2009 [http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sanofi-aventis-commits-over-2-8b-to-regeneron-in-mab-discovery-alliance/68174500/ Sanofi-Aventis Commits Over $2.8B to Regeneron in mAb Discovery Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009 the collaboration had four antibodies in clinical development and had filed an IND for a fifth.

Between 2008, when Chris Viebacher was hired as CEO, and 2010, the company spent more than $17 billion in mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its consumer healthcare and generics platforms, especially in emerging markets, in the face of looming [[patent cliff]]s and the growth of the consumer healthcare segment.&lt;ref&gt;FierceBiotech.

===Rename to Sanofi and beyond===

'''Product recall and effects''': The Epinephrine auto-injection devices made by Sanofi SA currently on the market in the U.S. and Canada were voluntarily recalled on 28 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/allerject-epinephrine-auto-injectors-recalled-by-drugmaker-sanofi-1.3293765|title=All Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors recalled|website=Cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allerject.ca/Common/docs/en/Sanofi-Canada-Issues-Voluntary-Recall-of-Allerject.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|website=Allerject.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason stated by Sanofi was that the products have been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver drug.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auvi-q.com/|title=Auvi-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP)|website=Auvi-q.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm469980.htm|title=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, &amp; Safety Alerts - UPDATED: Sanofi US Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of All Auvi-Q® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|first=Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanofi US also added the following warning: If a patient experiencing a serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) did not receive the intended dose, there could be significant health consequences, including death because anaphylaxis is a potentially life‑threatening condition.&lt;ref name="auvi-q.com"/&gt;

In its news release on 28 October 2015, Sanofi Canada stated that it was "actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine auto-injectors to have a full stock available in Canada as soon as possible. Canadian customers were asked to immediately return the Allerject product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine auto-injector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sanofi-canada-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-of-allerject-due-to-potential-inaccurate-dosage-delivery-538090301.html|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage|website=Newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also filed a news release&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; confirming that the recall involves all Auvi-Q currently on the market in the U.S. The FDA release went on to provide information for consumers re: exchanging the device for another brand of product, also provided on the Auivi-Q web site. Sanofi US will provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new, alternate epinephrine auto-injectors with proof of purchase.

The alternate products expected to most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the EpiPens made by [[Mylan]] in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epipen101.ca/en/welcome|title=Welcome to EpiPen® 101|website=Epipen101.ca|date=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mylan already had an 85% market share of the auto-injectors in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business|title=How Marketing Turned the EpiPen Into a Billion-Dollar Business|first=Cynthia Koons CynthiaLKoons Robert Langreth RobertLangreth|last=Reprints|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of 2015. Maylan was expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of 2 November 2015: "....it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamarketing.com/story/sanofis-auvi-q-recall-puts-mylans-rival-epipen-full-control-blockbuster-mar/2015-11-02|title=Sanofi's Auvi-Q recall puts Mylan's rival EpiPen in full control of blockbuster market - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharmamarketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on 3 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/its-open-season-mylans-epipen-sanofi-teva-stumble/2015-11-02|title=It's open season for Mylan's EpiPen as Sanofi, Teva stumble - FiercePharma|website=Fiercepharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, [[Rue La Boétie]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.

Sanofi's previous head office was located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], 174 Avenue de France. The architecture of the head office is of the predominant style of the area surrounding the [[François Mitterrand Library]]. After Sanofi and Aventis merged, the employees at the former Aventis head office in [[Schiltigheim]], [[Alsace]] moved to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/sanofi-aventis-regroupement-a-paris.shtml Sanofi-Aventis : regroupement à Paris]."

[[File:ISS-05 Valery Korzun checks the Lada plant growth experiment.jpg|thumb|Lada plant growth experiment]]
'''Space farming''' refers to the cultivation of crops for food and other materials in [[outer space|space]] or on off-Earth celestial objects – equivalent to [[agriculture]] on [[Earth]].

Farming on celestial bodies, such as [[the Moon]] or [[Mars]], shares many similarities with farming on a [[space station]] or [[Space habitat|space colony]]. But, depending on the size of the celestial body, may lack the complexity of [[microgravity]] found in the latter.  Each environment would have differences in the availability of [[Plant growth#Factors affecting growth|inputs]] to the space agriculture process: inorganic material needed for [[plant growth]], soil media, [[insolation]], relative availability of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen, and so forth.

==Introduction==
[[File:ISS-30 Zucchini plant in the Destiny lab.jpg|thumb|Zucchini plant in the Destiny lab]]
Supply of food to [[space stations]] and other long duration missions is heavy and [[cost of spaceflight|staggeringly expensive]]. One astronaut on the [[International Space Station]] requires approximately "1.8 kilograms of food and packaging per day".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Maya|last2=Douglas|first2=Grace|last3=Perchonok|first3=Michele|date=2011-03-01|title=Developing the NASA Food System for Long-Duration Missions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01982.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=76|issue=2|pages=R40–R48|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01982.x|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long-term mission, such as a four-man crew, three year Martian mission, this number can grow to as much as 24,000 pounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the cost of resupply and the impracticality of resupplying interplanetary missions the prospect of growing food inflight is incredibly appealing. The existence of a space farm would aid the creation of a [[sustainable]] environment, as plants can be used to recycle wastewater, generate oxygen, continuously purify the air and recycle faeces on the space station or spaceship. Just 10m² of crops produces 25% of the daily requirements of 1 person, or about 180-210grams of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Kijk magazine 9/2015"&gt;Kijk magazine 9/2015&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially allows the space farm to turn the spaceship into an artificial [[ecosystem]] with a [[hydrological cycle]] and nutrient recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and C. Pallud, (2010), Space agriculture in micro- and hypo-gravity: A comparative study of soil hydraulics and biogeochemistry in a cropping unit on Earth, Mars, the Moon and the space station, Planet. Space Sci. 58, 1996–2007, doi:10.1016/j.pss.2010.09.025.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and C. Pallud, (2010), Martian base agriculture: The effect of low gravity on water flow, nutrient cycles, and microbial biomass dynamic, Advances in Space Research 46, 1257-1265, doi:10.1016/j.asr.2010.07.012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to maintaining a shelf-life and reducing total mass, the ability to grow food in space would help reduce the vitamin gap in astronaut's diets and provide fresh food with improved taste and texture. Currently, much of the food supplied to astronauts is heat treated or [[Freeze-drying|freeze dried]]. Both of these methods, for the most part, retain the properties of the food pre-treatment. However, vitamin degradation during storage can occur. A 2009 study noted significant decreases in vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin C|C]] and [[Vitamin K|K]] as well as [[Folate|folic acid]] and thiamin can occur in as little as one year of storage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A mission to Mars could require food storage for as long as five years, thus a new source of these vitamins would be required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Supply of foodstuffs to others is likely to be a major part of early off-Earth settlements.  Food production is a non-trivial task and is likely to be one of the most labor-intensive, and vital, tasks of early colonists.  Among others, NASA is researching how to accomplish space farming.&lt;ref name=fn20130515&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Farming on Mars? NASA ponders food supply for 2030 mission|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/05/15/farming-on-mars-nasa/|accessdate=2014-05-18|newspaper=Fox News|date=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical challenges===
[[File:ISS-05 Advanced Astroculture soybean plant growth experiment.jpg|thumb|Advanced Astroculture soybean plant growth experiment]]
A variety of technical challenges will face colonists who attempt to do off-Earth agriculture.  These include the effect of reduced gravity, lighting, and pressure as well as increased radiation.&lt;ref name=fn20130515/&gt; Though greenhouses may solve many of the problems presented in space, their construction would come with their own set of technical challenges.

Plants grown inflight experience a [[Micro-g environment|microgravity environment]], and plants grown on the surface of Mars experience approximately 1/3 the gravity that earth plants do. However, so long as plants are provided with directional light, those grown in low gravity environments still experienced normal growth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Anna-Lisa|last2=Amalfitano|first2=Claire E.|last3=Ferl|first3=Robert J.|date=2012-12-07|title=Plant growth strategies are remodeled by spaceflight|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-12-232|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=12|pages=232|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-12-232|issn=1471-2229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal growth is classified as opposite root and shoot growth direction. This being said many plants grown in a space flight environment have been significantly smaller than those grown on earth’s surface and grew at a slower rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to varying effects of gravity, unless protected, plants grown on the surface of Mars will be exposed to much higher levels of radiation than on Earth. Exposure to high levels of radiation can damage plant DNA. This occurs as highly reactive hydroxyl radicals target DNA.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esnault|first=Marie-Andrée|last2=Legue|first2=Florence|last3=Chenal|first3=Christian|title=Ionizing radiation: Advances in plant response|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098847210000225|journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany|language=en|volume=68|issue=3|pages=231–237|doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA degradation has a direct effect on plant germination, growth and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ionizing radiation also has an effect on PSII function and may cause a loss of function and generation of radicals responsible for photo-oxidation. The intensity of these effects vary from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micco|first=Veronica De|last2=Arena|first2=Carmen|last3=Pignalosa|first3=Diana|last4=Durante|first4=Marco|date=2011-03-01|title=Effects of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on plants|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00411-010-0343-8|journal=Radiation and Environmental Biophysics|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1007/s00411-010-0343-8|issn=0301-634X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low-pressure environment of the surface of Mars has also been a cause for concern. Hypobaric conditions can affect net photosynthesis and evapotranspiration rates.  However, a 2006 study suggests maintaining elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations can mitigate the effects of hypobaric conditions as low as 10 kPa to achieve normal plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jeffrey T.|last2=Corey|first2=Kenneth A.|last3=Paul|first3=Anna-Lisa|last4=Ferl|first4=Robert J.|last5=Wheeler|first5=Raymond M.|last6=Schuerger|first6=Andrew C.|date=2006-12-01|title=Exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to Hypobaric Environments: Implications for Low-Pressure Bioregenerative Life Support Systems for Human Exploration Missions and Terraforming on Mars|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2006.6.851|journal=Astrobiology|volume=6|issue=6|pages=851–866|doi=10.1089/ast.2006.6.851|issn=1531-1074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martian soil contains a majority of the minerals needed for plant growth except for reactive nitrogen, which is a product of mineralization of organic matter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wamelink|first=G. W. Wieger|last2=Frissel|first2=Joep Y.|last3=Krijnen|first3=Wilfred H. J.|last4=Verwoert|first4=M. Rinie|last5=Goedhart|first5=Paul W.|date=2014-08-27|title=Can Plants Grow on Mars and the Moon: A Growth Experiment on Mars and Moon Soil Simulants|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103138|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e103138|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103138|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is a lack of organic matter on the surface of mars, there is a lack of this component. Reactive nitrogen is a required constituent of soil used for plant growth, and it is possible that nitrogen fixing species, such as bacteria, could aide in the lack of reactive nitrogen series. However, a  2014 study suggested that plants were able to germinate and survive a period of 50 days on a Martian and lunar soil by using simulant soils. This being said, only one of their four experimented species did well enough to achieve full flower formation and more work would need to be done to achieve complete growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Swarm''' is the name of an open-source [[agent-based model]]ing simulation package, useful for simulating the interaction of [[Intelligent agent|agent]]s (social or biological) and their [[emergence|emergent]] collective behaviour.  Swarm was initially developed at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in the mid-1990s, and since 1999 has been maintained by the non-profit [[Swarm Development Group]].  Also known as the Swarm Simulation System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm_main_page Swarm]&lt;/ref&gt; it is available for free &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_software_main_page download Software main page downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and use, covered by the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early development work on Swarm was completed by Chris Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (SFI), Manor Askenazi (SFI), Glen Ropella (SFI), Marcus Daniels (SFI), and Alex Lancaster (SFI). Since that time, many hundreds of people around the world have contributed to the continued open source development of the suite of Swarm ABM tools.

== Applications ==

=== Scientific applications===
Agent-based modeling seeks to replicate these complexities and adaptations in computational environments where these interactive [[emergent behavior]]s can be analyzed multi-dimensionally. By defining and assigning agencies reflective of prescribed behaviors, known or estimated, to active software agents in a [[computer simulation]], scientists can approximate experimental results not possible in natural temporal frameworks.

Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms afford scientists the opportunity to conduct and [[Scientific visualization|visualize]] experiments in these synthetic macro and microenvironments for testing scientific theories, natural data sets, and other analyses while free of pressing constraints like time, volume, hazards, or many other parameters.

=== Commercial applications ===
Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include:
* [[supply chain optimization]] and [[logistics]];
* modeling of [[consumer behavior]], including [[word of mouth]] and [[social network]] effects;
* [[distributed computing]];
* [[workforce management]];
* [[traffic management]]; and
* [[Investment management|portfolio management]].
In these and other applications, the system of interest is simulated by capturing the behavior of individual agents and their interconnections. Agent-based modeling tools can be used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the overall, emergent system behavior.

'''''The Stuff''''' (also known as '''''Larry Cohen's The Stuff''''') is a 1985 American [[satire|satirical]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Larry Cohen]] and starring [[Michael Moriarty]], [[Garrett Morris]], [[Andrea Marcovicci]], and [[Paul Sorvino]]. It was also the last film of noted actor [[Alexander Scourby]].

==Plot==
Several railroad workers discover a [[yogurt]]-like white substance bubbling out of the ground. These workers find it to be sweet and addictive. Later, the substance, marketed as "The Stuff," is being sold to the general public in containers like ice cream. It is marketed as having no calories and as being sweet, creamy, and filling. The Stuff quickly becomes a nationwide craze and drastically hurts the sales of ice cream.

Former FBI agent turned industrial [[saboteur]] David "Mo" Rutherford is hired by the leaders of the suffering ice cream industry, as well as junk food mogul Charles W. "Chocolate Chip Charlie" Hobbs, to find out exactly what The Stuff is and destroy it.

Under their commissions, Rutherford conducts an investigation into The Stuff. His efforts reveal, to his initial horror, that the craze for the dessert is far deadlier than anyone had believed: The Stuff is actually a living, parasitic, and possibly sentient organism that gradually takes over the brain; it then mutates those who eat it into bizarre zombie-like creatures, before consuming them from the inside and leaving them literal empty shells of their former selves.

A young boy named Jason also discovers The Stuff is alive and sees how it affects his family and how they are adamantly against his beliefs on The Stuff. He gets arrested for vandalizing a supermarket display of The Stuff, attracting the attention of Rutherford, who comes to his aid. Rutherford also manages to charm Nicole, an advertising executive who becomes his partner and lover when she sees the effect of The Stuff. The trio infiltrates the distribution operation, which is actually an organized corporate effort to spread The Stuff on the basis of eliminating world hunger, and destroy the lake of The Stuff with explosives. Meanwhile, United States Army Col. Malcolm Grommett Spears, a retired right-wing soldier, leads a [[Militia (United States)|militia]] in battling the zombies and transmitting a civil defense message for Americans to break their addiction to The Stuff by destroying it with fire. The Stuff addiction is ended, and Rutherford, Nicole, Jason, and Col. Spears are hailed as national heroes.

Mo then visits the head of The Stuff Company, a man named Mr. Fletcher. He tells Mo that the destruction of the mine has not hurt his business, since The Stuff seeps out from many places in the ground, but Mo vows to find those places and get rid of them all. Another man, Mr. Vickers, brings in Mr. Evans, the ice cream mogul with whom he is now working--and who had originally hired Mo to find out about what The Stuff was. They tell him they have come up with a new product that they call "The Taste," which is a mix of 88% ice cream and 12% The Stuff, supposedly enough to make people crave more without it taking over their minds or killing them. However, Mo then brings in Jason, who is carrying a box, and then holds the two moguls at gunpoint. The box is full of pint containers of The Stuff, and Mo forces both to eat them all as punishment for all the lives lost to it, and for their greed. As they do, Rutherford asks pointedly, "Are ''you'' eating ''it...''or is '''''it''''' eating '''''YOU?"''''' When they finish, Mo and Jason leave them to the approaching police.

The film ends with smugglers selling The Stuff on the black market, having one of the smugglers tasting The Stuff, and revealing that samples of The Stuff still exist. In a [[post-credits scene]], a woman in a bathroom says "Enough is never enough" while holding The Stuff.

==Production==
The script was an original story by Cohen. He said, "My main inspiration was the consumerism and corporate greed found in our country and the damaging products that were being sold. I was constantly reading in the newspapers about various goods and materials being recalled because they were harming people. For example, you had foods being pulled off the market because they were hazardous to people’s health."&lt;ref&gt;Doyle p 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen was particularly influenced by "the sheer volume of junk food we consume every day. We continue to eat these foods despite the fact some of them are killing us. That’s when I started thinking that The Stuff could be an imaginary product— in this case an ice cream dessert— that is being consumed by millions and is doing irreparable damage to humanity. Everybody is gobbling down this yummy food, so how can it possibly be wrong for us?"&lt;ref&gt;Doyle p 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen wanted to cast [[Arsenio Hall]] as "Chocolate Chip Charlie" W. Hobbs, since he thought he was not only a good actor but also a rising star.  The executives at [[New World Pictures]], however, wanted someone more recognizable and thus cast [[Garrett Morris]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comedians.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/horrorfilmswithcomedians.htm About.com – 13 Horror Films Starring Comedians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707005909/http://comedians.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/horrorfilmswithcomedians.htm |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Cohen says the film was significantly trimmed in post production:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We did lose a few funny scenes that I wanted to keep. When I showed New World my original cut, they felt strongly that the film should move a lot faster. I realized that I’d made a picture that was a little too dense and sophisticated, so we increased the pacing. I know that along with some of the commercials, we did lose a romantic scene between Moriarty and Andrea that took place in a hotel room. It was perhaps a wise decision to cut some of those scenes out, because I don’t think they played well in the totality of the film. The story needed to drive forward at certain points and not be slowed down with extraneous material, although it can be painful cutting scenes out that you like.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cohen says that the New World Pictures Company was slightly unhappy with the resulting movie:
&lt;blockquote&gt;New World wanted a straight-up horror film, and, in retrospect, ''The Stuff'' had more comedic aspects to it than the executives were perhaps expecting. They thought they were going to get a flat-out horror movie with a lot of gore and scares, and we made a film that was more satirical and had a lot of humour and commentary in it. We played the characters for laughs in many cases and that greatly diluted the horror element. It made ''The Stuff'' more of what I would consider “A Larry Cohen Movie” but less of a conventional, commercial horror film. I think New World were disappointed that The Stuff wasn’t more horrific and nasty--more of a balls-out monster movie. I knew before the film even hit theaters ''The Stuff'' would appeal to a different audience than the one we were trying to get.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle p 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''The Stuff'' was given a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States by [[New World Pictures]] in June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090094/companycredits|title=Company Credits for The Stuff|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not a hit, and Cohen feels that it was hurt by the fact it was sold as a horror film when it was basically a satirical comedy. It received positive reviews from critics; on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 70% rating based on 10 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stuff/ | title=The Stuff | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen says "the day ''The Stuff'' opened in New York a hurricane hit and the newspapers were not delivered. Of course, we had received all these great reviews, but it didn’t matter because nobody ever got to read a single word of them."&lt;ref&gt;Doyle p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The film was released on [[VHS]] by [[New World Pictures|New World Home Video]]. It was eventually released on [[DVD]] by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=18660|title=The Stuff|publisher=dvdempire.com|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is currently [[out of print]].

On September 11, 2011, [[Image Entertainment]] released ''The Stuff'' under its "Midnight Madness Series" banner on DVD. It is a direct port of the Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release.

A Special Edition [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] was released in the United Kingdom on March 10, 2013 by Arrow Films.

==Copyright dispute==
The company Effects Associated were hired by Cohen to supply some of the special effects shots. When the shots were delivered, Cohen was not satisfied with shots of exploding factory buildings&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LnisuqGSsY The disputed footage as posted on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; and paid only half (c. $8,000) of the agreed price for those shots. Effects Associated brought an action against Cohen in court to claim full compensation, but also because the parties had no written copyright agreement regarding the use of the shots. The trial court decided in favor of Cohen, ruling that there was an "implied agreement" for the non-exclusive use of the shots in the film. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] confirmed the ruling, and confirmed that Effects Associated still retained the copyright for use outside of ''The Stuff''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rwarner/classes/legalaspects_ukraine/copyright/cases/effects_v_cohen.html][http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/03/paging-bradley-coopers-lawyers-you-might-own-ellens-famous-oscar-selfie/358758/][http://www.invispress.com/law/copyright/effects.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of extinctions''' is an historical account of species that have become [[extinction|extinct]] during the time that modern humans have occupied the earth.

The following is a selective list made by sampling a very small proportion, mostly [[mammal]]s, of some of the well-known extinct species in the recent history. For a more elaborate list see [[Lists of extinct animals]]. The vast majority of extinctions, though, are thought to be undocumented. According to the [[species-area curve|species-area theory]] and based on upper-bound estimating, the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;S.L.

'''Titus Manlius T.f. Torquatus''' (died 299 BC) was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Roman Republic]]an [[Roman consul|consul]] for 299 BC, elected along with a [[plebe]]ian co-consul [[Marcus Fulvius Cn.f. Paetinus]].

According to [[Livy]], Titus Manlius died of a fall from his horse, while preparing his troops to march into [[Etruria]]

: The province of Etruria fell by lot to the consul Titus Manlius; who, when he had but just entered the enemy's country, as he was exercising the cavalry, in wheeling about at full speed, was thrown from his horse, and almost killed on the spot; three days after the fall, he died. ([[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Livy]] V:11)

==Family background==
The [[Manlia (gens)|Manlii]] were one of the oldest and most distinguished patrician gens in the Roman Republic.  One [[Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus]] had been chosen consul in 480 BC, four years after the first Fabius had become consul.  Prominent consuls in the family included the early 4th century consul [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus|Marcus Manlius T.f. Capitolinus]] (whose career was marked by his ''gens'' banning the use of the ''praenomen'' ''Marcus'' thereafter), and the 4th century consul [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (347 BC)|Titus Manlius L.f. Imperiosus Torquatus]].  Titus was descended from this last consul, notable not only for his military successes but also for executing his own son for an impetuous breach of military discipline.  It is not clear if the consuls [[Aulus Manlius Titus f. Torquatus Atticus]], consul in 244 BC and 241 BC, and [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (235 BC)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], consul in 235 BC and 224 BC and censor 231 BC, were his sons or other relatives.

It is one of the few known cases of [[animal]]s capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. Others include the jellyfish ''{{ill|Laodicea undulata|sv}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]]'' sp.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|volume=10|issue = 12|pmc=4687044|pages=e0145314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other [[hydrozoan]]s, ''T. dohrnii'' begin their life as free-swimming tiny [[larva]]e known as [[planula]]. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of [[polyp]]s that are attached to the sea-floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones. The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If a ''T. dohrnii'' jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; It does this through the cell development process of [[transdifferentiation]], which alters the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated state of the cells]] and transforms them into new types of cells.

Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|year=2006|accessdate=2009-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2010-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice individuals can still die. In nature, most ''Turritopsis'' are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage, without reverting to the polyp form.&lt;ref name="National Geographic News"&gt;{{cite web

The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes ''T. dohrnii'' an important target of basic biological, [[Ageing|aging]] and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencepub.net/stem/stem0504/007_A00288stem050414_49_53.pdf|doi=10.7537/marsscj050414.07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "immortal jellyfish" was formerly classified as ''[[Turritopsis nutricula|T. nutricula]]''.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt;

== Description ==

The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is bell-shaped, with a maximum diameter of about {{convert|4.5|mm|in}} and is about as tall as it is wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P. L.|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=1961|volume=40|pages=1–469|doi=10.1017/s0025315400007347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline26012009" /&gt; The jelly in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin, except for some thickening at the apex. The relatively large stomach is bright red and has a cruciform shape in cross section. Young specimens 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter have only eight tentacles evenly spaced out along the edge,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martell|first=L.|last2=Piraino|first2=S.|last3=Gravili|first3=C.|last4=Boero|first4=F.|date=2016-07-02|title=Life cycle, morphology and medusa ontogenesis of Turritopsis dohrnii (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa)|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|volume=83|issue=3|pages=390–399|doi=10.1080/11250003.2016.1203034|issn=1125-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas adult specimens have 80–90 tentacles. The medusa (jellyfish) is free-living in the plankton. Dense [[nerve net]] cells are also present in the [[epidermis]] in the cap. They form a large ring-like structure above the radial cannal which is commonly presented in cnidarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koizumi|first=Osamu|last2=Hamada|first2=Shun|last3=Minobe|first3=Sumiko|last4=Hamaguchi-Hamada|first4=Kayoko|last5=Kurumata-Shigeto|first5=Mami|last6=Nakamura|first6=Masaru|last7=Namikawa|first7=Hiroshi|title=The nerve ring in cnidarians: its presence and structure in hydrozoan medusae|journal=Zoology|volume=118|issue=2|pages=79–88|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2014.10.001|pmid=25498132|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Turritopsis dohrnii'' also has a bottom-living polyp form, or hydroid, which consists of [[stolon]]s that run along the substrate, and upright branches with feeding polyps that can produce medusa buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=C. McLean|title=Hydroids of the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1937|pages=201 plus 44 plates}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polyps develop over a few days into tiny 1&amp;nbsp;mm medusae, which are liberated and swim free from the parent hydroid colony.

Images of both the medusa and polyp of the closely related species ''[[Turritopsis rubra]]'' from [[New Zealand]] can be found online.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |title=Turritopsis rubra |last=Schuchert |first=Peter |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912180002/http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a recent genetic study, it was thought that ''Turritopsis rubra'' and ''Turritopsis nutricula'' were the same.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt; It is not known whether or not ''T. rubra'' medusae can also transform back into polyps.

== Distribution and invasion ==

''Turritopsis'' is believed to have originated in the [[Pacific]] but has spread all over the world through trans-Arctic migrations, and has speciated into several populations that are easy to distinguish morphologically, but whose species distinctions have recently been verified by a study and comparison of mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences.&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miglietta|first=M.

== Life cycle ==

The eggs develop in gonads of female medusae, which are located in the walls of the manubrium (stomach). Mature eggs are presumably spawned and fertilized in the sea by sperm produced and released by male medusae, as is the case for most hydromedusae, although the related species ''Turritopsis rubra'' seems to retain fertilized eggs until the planula stage.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"/&gt; Fertilized eggs develop into [[planula]] larvae, which settle onto the sea-floor (or even the rich marine communities that live on floating docks), and develop into polyp colonies ([[hydroids]]). The hydroids bud new jellyfishes, which are released at about one millimetre in size and then grow and feed in the plankton, becoming sexually mature after a few weeks (the exact duration depends on the ocean temperature; at {{convert|20|C|F}} it is 25 to 30 days and at {{convert|22|C|F}} it is 18 to 22 days).&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt; Medusae of ''T. dohrnii'' are able to survive between 14&amp;nbsp;°C  and 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biological immortality ===

Most jellyfish species have a relatively fixed life-span, which varies by species from hours to many months (long-lived mature jellyfish spawn every day or night; the time is also fairly fixed and species-specific).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=C. E.|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is the only form known to have developed the ability to return to a polyp state, by a specific transformation process that requires the presence of certain cell types (tissue from both the jellyfish bell surface and the circulatory canal system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/meet-the-worlds-only-immortal-animal/|title = Meet the world's only immortal animal|date = December 5, 2008|accessdate = January 10, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful laboratory experiments have revealed that all stages of the medusae, from newly released to fully mature individuals, can transform back into polyps under the conditions of starvation, sudden temperature change, reduction of salinity and artificial damage of the bell with forceps or scissor.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; The transforming [[medusae|medusa]] is characterized first by deterioration of the bell, mesoglea and tentacles. All immature medusa (with 12 tentacles at most) then turned into a [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]-like stage and then transformed into [[stolon]]s and polyps. However, about 20%-40% of mature medusa went into stolons and polyps stage without passing cyst-like stage. Polyps were formed after 2 days since stolons had developed and fed on food. Polyps further multiply by growing additional stolons, branches and then polyps, to form colonial [[hydroids]]. In the experiment, they would eventually transform into stolons and polyps and begin their lives once again even without suffering from environment changes or injury.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Diagram of the transformation procedure can be found at the further reading.

This ability to reverse the biotic cycle (in response to adverse conditions) is unique in the [[animals|animal kingdom]], and allows the jellyfish to bypass death, rendering ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' potentially [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. The process has not been observed in their natural habitat, in part because the process is quite rapid, and because field observations at the right moment are unlikely.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Regardless, most individual medusae are likely to fall victim to the general hazards of life as [[plankton]], including being eaten by predators or succumbing to disease.

The species' cell development method of transdifferentiation has inspired scientists to find a way to make stem cells using this process for renewing damaged or dead tissue in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimberu|first=Peniel M.|title=Immortal Jellyfish Provides Clues for Regenerative Medicine|url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/04/25/immortal-jellyfish-provides-clues-for-regenerative-medicine/|publisher=Singularity Hub|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic analysis ==
Genomic analyses such as [[sequence analysis]] on [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] DNA have been employed to investigate its lifecycle. mRNA analysis of each life stage showed that a stage-specific gene in the medusae stage is expressed tenfold more than in other stages. This gene is relative to a [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signal]] that can induce a regeneration process upon injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Catriona Y.|last2=Nusse|first2=Roel|date=2004-10-08|title=The wnt signaling pathway in development and disease|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=781–810|doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.113126|pmid=15473860|issn=1081-0706|citeseerx=10.1.1.322.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=Yoshinori|last2=Watanabe|first2=Takashi|last3=Takazawa|first3=Masaki|last4=Ohara|first4=Osamu|last5=Kubota|first5=Shin|date=2016-08-01|title=De Novo Assembly of the Transcriptome of Turritopsis, a Jellyfish that Repeatedly Rejuvenates|journal=Zoological Science|volume=33|issue=4|pages=366–371|doi=10.2108/zs150186|pmid=27498796|issn=0289-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] homologs and protein homologs identified ''[[Nemopsis bachei]]'' as the species' closest relative. None of the closely related species show biological immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devarapalli|first=Pratap|last2=Science|first2=Department of Genomic|last3=Kerala|first3=Central University of|last4=Campus|first4=Riverside Transit|last5=Science|first5=Opp: Nehru College of Arts and|last6=17|first6=NH|last7=Padanakkad|last8=Nileshwer|last9=Kasaragod|title=The conserved mitochondrial gene distribution in relatives of Turritopsis nutricula, an immortal jellyfish|url=http://www.bioinformation.net/010/97320630010586.htm|journal=Bioinformation|volume=10|issue=9|pages=586–591|doi=10.6026/97320630010586|pmid=25352727|pmc=4209368|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culturing==

Keeping ''T. dohrnii'' in captivity is quite difficult. Currently only one scientist, Shin Kubota from [[Kyoto University]], has managed to sustain a group of these jellyfish for a prolonged period of time. The plankton must be inspected daily to ensure that they have properly digested the [[Brine shrimp|Artemia cysts]] they are being fed.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; 
Kubota reported that during a two-year period, his colony rebirthed itself 11 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S Kubota|title=Repeating rejuvenation in Turritopsis, an immortal hydrozoan (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa)|journal=Biogeography|issn=1345-0662|year=2011|volume=13|number=|pages=101–103|pmid=|url=http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029093746/http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubota regularly appears on Japanese television to talk about his immortal jellyfish and has recorded several songs about them.&lt;ref name=nytm&gt;{{cite news |last=Rich|first=Nathaniel|title=Can a jellyfish unlock the secret of immortality? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/can-a-jellyfish-unlock-the-secret-of-immortality.html?src=me&amp;ref=general|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=November 28, 2012|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30459">'''Vexatious litigation''' is legal action which is brought, regardless of its merits, solely to [[harass]] or subdue an [[wiktionary:adversary|adversary]]. It may take the form of a primary [[frivolous lawsuit]] or may be the repetitive, burdensome, and unwarranted filing of meritless motions in a matter which is otherwise a meritorious [[cause of action]]. Filing vexatious litigation is considered an abuse of the [[judicial process]] and may result in [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] against the offender.

A single action, even a frivolous one, is usually not enough to raise a litigant to the level of being declared vexatious. Rather, a pattern of frivolous legal actions is typically required to rise to the level of vexatious. Repeated and severe instances by a single [[lawyer]] or [[law firm|firm]] can result in eventual [[disbarment]].

Some [[jurisdiction]]s have a list of vexatious litigants: people who have repeatedly abused the legal system. Because lawyers could be disbarred for participating in this abuse of the legal process, vexatious litigants are often unable to retain legal counsel, and such litigants therefore represent themselves in court. Those on the vexatious litigant list are usually either forbidden from any further legal action, or are required to obtain prior permission from a senior judge before taking any legal action. The process by which a person is added to the list varies among jurisdictions. In [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] jurisdictions, declaring someone a vexatious litigant is considered to be a serious measure and rarely occurs, as judges and officials are reluctant to curtail a person's access to the courts.
 
These legal actions occur in some countries of the former [[British Empire]], where the [[Common Law]] System still remains: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[United States|US]], which are specified below. The [[Civil Law (legal system)|Civil (Codified/Continental) Law]] does not provide this kind of gate to limit equal access of citizens to the justice system.

==History of legislation against vexatious litigation==
The concept of vexatious litigation entered into law in 1896 with the Vexatious Actions Act, enacted in [[England]] and soon extended to [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. This was  primarily a response to the actions of [[Alexander Chaffers]], a solicitor who filed numerous actions against [[Travers Twiss#Scandal|leading members]] of Victorian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Simpson |title=The Rule of Law in International Affairs |journal=Proceedings of the British Academy |volume= 125 |date=2003 |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; When costs were awarded against him, he failed to pay.&lt;ref name = "alv"&gt;Alvin Stauber, "Litigious Paranoia: Confronting And Controlling Abusive Litigation In The United States, The United Kingdom", ''International Review of Business Research Papers'', Vol.5 No. 1 January 2009, pp.11- 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taggart (2004).

VEXATIOUS ACTIONS ACT 1896. The Cambridge Law Journal, 63, pp 656684 
{{doi|10.1017/S0008197304006713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such law outside Britain, the [[Supreme Court Act, 1927]] was passed in Australia nearly thirty years later. This too was prompted by the behaviour of an individual, Rupert Millane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rosalind Dixon |author2=George Williams |date=2015 |title=The High Court, the Constitution and Australian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqewBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Rupert+Millane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3W7vsxdrXX&amp;sig=RqtqsMdd1L_K95V2GfIyrx9w0gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6I6XvfTaAhVj8IMKHfBeBpsQ6AEIIzAF |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=133 |isbn=9781107043664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Vexatious Litigant law in the United States was enacted in [[California]] in 1963. By 2007 five US states had passed similar legislation: California, [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Ohio]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name = "alv"/&gt;

In [[Queensland]], the process for having someone declared a vexatious litigant is governed by the ''[[Vexatious Proceedings Act 2005]]'', which supplanted an earlier Act.&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-1818794"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/151.htm |title=Vexatious litigants |work=courts.qld.gov.au |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326220116/http://www.courts.qld.gov.au/151.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the Act defines a vexatious proceeding to include a proceeding brought without merit or any prospect of success, with the consequence that it is not necessary to prove the existence of any improper motive in order to obtain relief under the Act.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, vexatious litigation laws were enacted in the mid-1930s with the ''[[Supreme Court Act 1935-1936]]'', following similar laws enacted in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, Alvin. (2009). "[http://www.bizresearchpapers.com/attachments_2009_01_14/2.Alvin.pdf Litigious Paranoia: Confronting And Controlling Abusive Litigation In The United States, The United Kingdom, And Australia]". ''International Review of Business Research Papers''. 5:11. p22. Retrieved 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the [[Mike Rann|Rann government]] acted to strengthen the ability of the courts to act against vexatious litigants by "increasing the range of courts and tribunals that can declare people as vexatious".&lt;ref name="McGregor2010-11-06"&gt;McGregor, Ken. (6 November 2010). "[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/government-targets-serial-litigants-clogging-up-the-courts/story-e6frea83-1225948535382 Government targets serial litigants clogging up the courts]". ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', Adelaide, South Australia. Retrieved 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that date, few people had been banned from bringing litigation to South Australian courts – by 2005, only two people were listed as having been declared as vexatious litigants, the first in 1997 and the second declared during that year.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Nick. (19 July 2005). "Legal History in the Making as Woman Faces Courts Ban: Litigant has her day in court – maybe for the last time." ''The Advertiser'', Adelaide, South Australia. p10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Andrew. (12 November 2005). "Serial litigant barred". ''The Advertiser'', Adelaide, South Australia. p25.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at least two other South Australians have been found to be vexatious litigants.&lt;ref name="McGregor2010-11-06" /&gt;

====Victoria====
{{As of|2006}}, only 13 people—including convicted mass-murderer [[Julian Knight (murderer)|Julian Knight]]—had been declared vexatious litigants since the law was introduced in 1930.&lt;ref name="DJ Lindsey"&gt;{{cite news | first=Fergus | last=Shiel | title=Annoying litigant is back | date=2006-04-10 | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/annoying-litigant-is-back/2006/04/09/1144521210696.html | work =[[The Age]] | accessdate = 2008-07-06 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Australia====
Legislation has existed since 1930, but is under review as of limited use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070829161357/http://www.lrc.justice.wa.gov.au/2publications/reports/P92-CJS/consults/2-11unreaslits.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', section 92(14),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#distribution |title=Legislative Authority of Parliament of Canada |accessdate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each province is vested with the power to enact and apply laws relating to the administration of justice within its own territory.

In Canada, Section 40 of the ''Federal Court Act''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605031024/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/F-7///en?page=1]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ontario Section 140 of the ''Courts of Justice Act'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c43_e.htm |title=Law Document English View &amp;#124; Ontario.ca |website=E-laws.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrict the ability to introduce or continue proceedings for those who have instituted vexatious proceedings or conducted proceedings in a vexatious manner.

====Quebec====
In Quebec, the Code of Civil Procedure is the principal legislation that sets rules related to civil procedure.

Under section 46 of the Code of Civil Procedure,&lt;ref&gt;L.R.Q., ch. C-25, s. 46&lt;/ref&gt; all judicial courts and judges in Quebec are vested with "...all the powers necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction". Furthermore, they may:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"…at any time and in all matters, whether in first instance or in appeal, issue orders to safeguard the rights of the parties, for such time and on such conditions as they may determine. As well, they may, in the matters brought before them, even on their own initiative, issue injunctions or reprimands, suppress writings or declare them libellous, and make such orders as are appropriate to deal with cases for which no specific remedy is provided by law."&lt;ref&gt;Code of civil procedure, L.R.Q., ch. C-25, s. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 46 vests a very broad power on judicial courts and judges to ensure that the administration of justice is conducted according to decorum and according to the remedial nature of justice. As the courts's decisions have shown it, the authority to declare a litigant as vexatious is directly tributary to the power conferred by section 46.

Cases illustrating the application of section 46 are numerous. Among them, there are: ''Nguiagain v. Commission de la fonction publique'',&lt;ref&gt;[1996] R.J.Q. 3009&lt;/ref&gt; in which the judge rejected the plaintiff's motion for a ''[[mandamus]]'' to enjoin his union to revise the grievance that he had filed on the grounds that the motion was groundless and abusive; ''De Niverville c. Descôteaux'',&lt;ref&gt;[1997] R.J.Q. 1049&lt;/ref&gt; where an injunction was rendered declaring the respondent, disbarred lawyer Descôteaux, as a vexatious litigant due to the multiple unfounded and frivolous actions that he had sought against the plaintiff De Niverville; and in ''Fabrikant v. Corbin'',&lt;ref&gt;J.E. 2000-1347&lt;/ref&gt; a motion to declare the plaintiff [[Valery Fabrikant]] as a vexatious litigant was granted to the defendant, Dr. Corbin. In all of the above cited cases, a litigant was only declared vexatious following a proceeding instated by the opposite party.

Moreover, section 46’s scope is limited to judicial courts and judges. Administrative tribunals are legislative creations and they can only exist and function within the limits that are imposed by law. Administrative tribunals in Quebec cannot declare a person a vexatious litigant.

As per section 90 of the ''Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of Québec in Civil Matters'',&lt;ref&gt;L.R.Q., ch. C-25, r. 8&lt;/ref&gt; such litigants are now indexed in a registry kept by the Chief Justice in the judiciary district of Montreal. Lawyer and author Claude Duchesnay has reported in May 2003 that a document on the Quebec attorney general’s intranet contains the name of 58 persons who must obtain permission prior to instating proceedings before the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Claude DUCHESNAY, « Se représenter seul », Congrès du Barreau du Québec, Compte rendu des activités de formation, Le Journal Barreau, édition du 1 er  août 2002, p. VII et VIII&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a court may, of its own motion or on application, order that no proceedings, either of a certain type or at all, may be issued by a certain person without leave of that court or some other court, for a specified time, or indefinitely. Such an order is referred to in legal circles as an [[Isaac Wunder order]] after Isaac Wunder who made several claims against the Hospitals Trust claiming [[sweepstakes]] prizes, but the claims were found to be groundless and the case deemed [[frivolous or vexatious]]. He was prohibited from taking further High Court proceedings in the action without leave of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsijournal.ie/html/Volume%201%20No.%201/1%5B1%5D_Moore_Isaac%20Wunder%20Orders.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721124946/http://www.jsijournal.ie/html/Volume%201%20No.%201/1%5B1%5D_Moore_Isaac%20Wunder%20Orders.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand a person may be declared a vexatious litigant by a High Court Judge on the application of the [[Attorney-General of New Zealand|Attorney-General]]. A vexatious litigant must then apply to a [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] Judge for leave to commence any action. A decision by the High Court whether or not to grant leave cannot be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 88B of the Judicature Act 1908|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1908/0089/latest/DLM147394.html|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
{{see also|Civil restraint order}}
Courts in [[England and Wales]] have the means of escalating the sanctions against a litigant who makes applications to the court that are "totally without merit":&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil Procedure Rules]]'', Practice Direction to Pt.3 3CPD.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil restraint order]]s allow courts to forbid applications for court hearings without the permission of a judge. There are three types of CRO: limited, extended and general, with different scopes of application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/civil-restraint-orders--2|title=Civil restraint orders - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|date=1 October 2014|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further applications totally without merit can lead to withdrawal of the right of [[appeal]]. Harassment of the court and court officials can lead to a penal prohibition notice, prohibiting the litigant from contacting or approaching the court without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Litigation|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|year=2005|isbn=0-421-90690-1|edition=12th|location=London|pages=para 7.011|nopp=true|author1=O'Hare, J.|author2=Browne, K.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HM Courts Service]] maintains a list of vexatious litigants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/courts/vexatious-litigants/index.htm|title=List of vexatious litigants (England and Wales)|publisher=HM Courts Service|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Under the [[Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/61-62/35|title=Vexatious Actions (Scotland) Act 1898|date=|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lord Advocate]] can apply for an order under section 1 of that Act to prevent any person accused of vexatious litigation from raising any and all legal proceedings "unless he obtains the leave of a judge sitting in the Outer House on the Bills in the [[Court of Session]], having satisfied the judge that such legal proceeding is not vexatious." A list of people who have had such an order brought against them is published on the Scottish Courts website. As of June 2018 there are ten names on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/the-courts/supreme-courts/about-the-supreme-courts/general-department/vexatious-litigants|title=Vexatious Litigants|date=|website=Scotcourts.gov.uk|accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====California====
Under [[California]] law&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130911060648/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=391-391.8]&lt;/ref&gt; a vexatious litigant is someone who does any of the following, most of which require that the litigant be proceeding ''[[Pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se]]'', i.e., representing himself:
#In the immediately preceding seven-year period has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained ''[[in propria persona]]'' at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been (i) finally determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing.
#After a litigation has been finally determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate, ''in propria persona'', either (i) the validity of the determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined.
#In any litigation while acting ''in propria persona'', repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
#Has previously been declared to be a vexatious litigant by any [[U.S. state|state]] or federal [[court of record]] in any action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts, transaction, or occurrence.

Appeals of an existing action do not count as “final determinations”. Appeals and writs that are related to a current action do not count as “final determinations” or additional determinations, because until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted the determinations cannot be construed as “final”.&lt;ref&gt;''Childs v. Painewebber, Inc.'' (1994), 29 Cal.App.4th 982&lt;/ref&gt; A judgment is final for all purposes when all avenues for direct review have been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;''First Western Development Co. v. Superior Court'', (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 860, 864, 261 Cal.Rptr. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Interlocutory decisions before a judgment cannot be considered “final determinations”.&lt;ref&gt;''Holcomb v. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n'', (2005), 129 Cal.App.4th 1494, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 578&lt;/ref&gt; Docket lists show nothing about qualifying merit of interim motions (Id.)

To meet the unspecified criteria for "repeated" motions or litigations, the number must be much more than two, and the rule based on case law seems to be around 12. "While there is no bright line rule as to what constitutes “repeatedly,” most cases affirming the vexatious litigant designation involve situations where litigants have filed dozens of motions either during the pendency of an action or relating to the same judgment." &lt;ref&gt;''Bravo v. Ismaj'', (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 211, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 879)&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeated motions must be "so devoid of merit and be so frivolous that they can be described as a flagrant [[abuse of the system]], have no reasonable probability of success, lack reasonable or probable cause or excuse, and are clearly meant to abuse the processes of the courts and to harass the adverse party than other litigants."&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v. Wagner'', (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 963, 67 Cal.Rptr.3d 818.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that a litigant is a frequent plaintiff or defendant alone is insufficient to support a vexatious litigant designation.&lt;ref&gt;''Roston v. Edwards'',  (1982) 127 Cal.App.3d at 847, 179 Cal.Rptr. 830.&lt;/ref&gt; The moving party, in addition to demonstrating that the plaintiff is vexatious, must make an affirmative showing based on evidence that the case has little chance of prevailing on the merits. If the plaintiff is so determined, a bond may be required, and if the bond requirement is not met within a specified time period, a judgment of dismissal is ordered. A finding of vexatiousness is not an appealable order, but a dismissal for failure to post a bond requirement based on a judgment of vexatiousness is appealable.

[[Habeas corpus|Habeas petitions]] do not count towards vexatious litigant determination.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Bittaker'', (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1004, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 679.&lt;/ref&gt; Vexatiousness in Probate Actions are governed by a different standard (Cal. Prob. Code §1611&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/PROB/1611./content.html |title=Cal. Prob. Code §1611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Notable vexatious litigants==
* '''[[Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris|Lawrence Bittaker]]''', who together with his partner Roy Norris was convicted of torturing and murdering five young girls in 1979. He filed 40 separate frivolous lawsuits against the state of California, including one claiming "cruel and unusual punishment" after being served a broken cookie.

* '''Alexander Chaffers''', a solicitor whose actions led to the first British law against vexatious litigation, the Vexatious Actions Act, 1896. Chaffers became notorious after accusing the wife of [[Travers Twiss]] of being a prostitute, and subsequently issued 48 proceedings against leading members of Victorian society in the 1890s. Costs awarded against Chaffers were never paid. After the act was passed, he became the first person to be declared a habitually vexatious litigant and barred from future litigation without judicial permission.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taggart, "Alexander Chaffers and the Genesis of the Vexatious Actions Act 1896, ''The Cambridge Law Journal'', Volume 63, Issue 03, November 2004, pp 656-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The [[Scientology and the legal system|Church of Scientology]]'''.
