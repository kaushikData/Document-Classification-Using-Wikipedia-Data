'''Anti-corporate activism''' holds that the influence of [[big business]] [[corporation]]s is a detriment to the [[public good]] and to the [[democratic process]].

==Disagreements with corporations==
{{confusing|section|date=June 2018}} 
{{refimprove|date=June 2018}} 
[[Activists]]{{Who|date=March 2012}} argue that corporate globalization corresponds to a displacement in the transition from a highly industrial-based economy to one where trade development is connected with the [[financial deregulation]] on the basis of circulation of capital. An increasing number of diverse societies have been changed to [[free market|free-market]] structure, leading to displacement. As this expansion has occurred, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abeles |first=Marc |title=Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective |pages=484–486 |journal=[[Anthropological Quarterly]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |publisher=Institute for Ethnographic Research |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[political left]], activists against [[corporate power]] and influence support a decreased [[income gap]] and improved [[Equity (economics)|economical equity]].

==Counter-arguments==
{{Section OR|date=March 2012}}
The defenders of corporations such as [[Ron Arnold]] highlight that governments do legislate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DiscoverTheNetwork|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6898|website=DiscoverTheNetwork.org|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ways that restrict the actions of corporations (see [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]) and that lawbreaking companies and executives are routinely caught and punished, usually in the form of monetary fines.

In addition, from the perspective of [[business ethics]] it might be argued{{By whom|date=March 2012}} that chief executives are not inherently more evil than anyone else and so are no more likely to attempt unethical or illegal activity than the general population. Large multi-national corporations do continue to attempt to erode governmental regulations through in-house or contracted lobbyists who work closely with State and Federal legislators. So as corporate laws continue to lean in their favor, corporate members have improved portals to drive up company profits.

==Alliances==
Anti-corporate activists may often ally themselves with other activists, such as [[environmental activist]]s or [[animal-rights|animal-rights activist]]s in their condemnation of the practices of modern organizations such as the [[McDonald's Corporation]] (see [[McLibel]]) and forestry company Gunns Limited (see [[Gunns 20]]).

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'' being a well-known example) and films such as ''The Corporation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php ''The Corporation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609023424/http://www.thecorporation.com/index.php |date=June 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have to a certain extent supported anti-corporate politics.

==Anti-corporate web sites==
In June 2008, [[Condé Nast Publications]] released an article entitled "The Secret Seven" which it listed the top seven anti-corporate web sites which include: [[WikiLeaks]], [[Mini-Microsoft]], [[Wal-Mart Watch]], [http://www.hobb.org/ HomeOwners for Better Building], Brenda Priddy and Company (automotive spy photos) and finally Apple Rumor Sites [[AppleInsider]] and [[MacRumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |title=The Secret Seven |publisher=Condé Nast Publications |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730011448/http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Anti-Corporate-Websites |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/06/13/Dotcom-Confidential|title=Dotcom Confidential|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New digital media==
{{Advert|section|date=July 2018}}
Media and digital networking have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, and ability to reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The [[internet]] supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline political spectrums.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Juris |first=Jeffrey S. |title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking |pages=191–199 |journal=The Annals of the [[American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=599 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Email lists, web pages, and open editing software have allowed for changes in organization. Now, actions are planned, information is shared, documents are produced by multiple people, and all of this can be done despite differences in distance. This has led to increased growth in digital collaboration. Activists can presently build ties between diverse topics, open the distribution of information, decentralize and increase collaboration, and self-direct networks.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

==Rise of anti-corporate globalization==

Close to fifty thousand people [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|protested]] the WTO meetings in Seattle on November 30, 1999. Labor, economic, and environmental activists succeeded in disrupting and closing the meetings due to their disapproval of corporate globalization.  This event became a symbol as anti-globalization networks emerged and became strengthened.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;
The experiences from the protests were distributed throughout the internet via emails and websites. Anti-corporate globalization movements have also expanded through the organization of mass mobilizations, including the anti-WTO protests, which were remarkably successful. In the United States, these movements reemerged after less attention was given to the war in Iraq, resulting in an increase in mass mobilizations.&lt;ref name="Juris, Jeffrey S. pg 191-199" /&gt;

A '''badge of shame''', also a '''symbol of shame''', '''mark of shame''' or '''stigma''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stigma stigma]. [[Dictionary.com]]. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. (accessed: January 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; is typically a distinctive symbol required to be worn by a specific group or an individual for the purpose of [[public humiliation]], [[ostracism]] or [[persecution]].

The term is also used metaphorically, especially in a pejorative sense, to characterize something associated with a person or group as shameful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hinshaw, S.|title=Mark of Shame: Stigma of Mental Illness and an Agenda for Change| chapter =|chapterurl= |publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated |location=Oxford|year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-530844-0 |oclc= |doi=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, under the [[Poor Act 1697]], paupers in receipt of parish relief were required to wear a [[badge]] of blue or red cloth on the shoulder of the right sleeve in an open and visible manner, in order to discourage people from collecting relief unless they were desperate, as while many would be willing to collect relief, few would be willing to do so if required to wear the "shameful" mark of the poor in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/324/1/WRAP_Hindle_Dependency_Shame_Belonging_Final_Version.pdf|title=Dependency, Shame and Belonging: Badging the Deserving Poor, c. 1550–1750*.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Depilation===
Punitive [[depilation]] of men, especially burning off [[pubic hair]], was intended as a mark of shame in ancient Mediterranean cultures where male body hair was valued.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8014-8482-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Trexler, Richard C. |title=Sex and conquest: gendered violence, political order, and the European conquest of the Americas |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1995 |isbn=0-8014-8482-0 |quote = Other sexual punishments left a temporary mark of shame on the body. Perhaps the most important of these was depilation, especially the burning off of anal and pubic hair.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who committed [[adultery]] have also been forced to wear specific icons or marks, or had their hair shorn, as a badge of shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6375683.stm |title= Mark of a woman |accessdate=2007-11-06 |date = 2007-02-20 |author = Winterman, Denise |work=BBC News Magazine|quote=Historically a shaven head has also always had meaning – and in a woman's case, mostly negative. It has been used as a badge of shame, often linked to sexual promiscuity.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071007081646/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6375683.stm| archivedate= 7 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women who fraternized with the occupiers in [[German-occupied Europe]] had their [[head shaving|heads shaved]] by angry mobs of their peers after liberation by the [[Allies of World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eva Simonsen |author2=Kjersti Ericsson |title=Children of World War II: The Hidden Enemy Legacy |publisher=Berg Publishers |location=Oxford, UK |year= 2005|page= 157 | isbn=1-84520-207-4 |quote= After the Occupation, Dutch women and girls who had consorted with the Germans were accused of treason. It was known before the war was over that they would be punished by having their heads shaved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the Nazis also used head shaving as a mark of shame to punish Germans like the youthful non-conformists known as the [[Edelweiss Pirates]].&lt;ref name="titleBBC - h2g2 - Youth Resistance in Wartime Germany"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3059255 |title=BBC - h2g2 - Youth Resistance in Wartime Germany |accessdate=2008-01-12 |work=|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing===
[[File:CatharCross.JPG|thumb|[[Cathar yellow cross]] for radicals]]
In [[Ancient Rome]], both men and women originally wore the [[toga]], but over time matrons adopted the [[stola]] as the preferred form of dress, while prostitutes retained the toga. Later, under the [[Lex Julia]], women convicted of [[prostitution]] were forced to wear a ''toga muliebris'', as the prostitute's badge of shame.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-508785-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=McGinn, Thomas A. |title=Prostitution, sexuality, and the law in ancient Rome |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1998 |page=340 |isbn=0-19-508785-2 |quote=...through conviction under the law was cast as a prostitute, most visibly through imposition of the label of the toga, the prostitute's badge of shame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[Pope Innocent III]] prohibited Christians from causing Jews bodily harm, but supported their segregation in society. On at least one occasion he likened this to the fate of [[Cain]] described in the [[Book of Genesis]], writing to the [[Count of Nevers]]:

{{quote|The Lord made Cain a wanderer and a fugitive over the earth, but set a mark upon him,... as wanderers must [the Jews] remain upon the earth, until their countenance be filled with shame...|&lt;ref name="isbn0-8091-4324-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flannery, Edward H. |title=The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism (Stimulus Books) |publisher=Paulist Press |location=New York, NY |year=2004 |page= 103 |isbn=0-8091-4324-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Image:LOC Utah Prisoners c1885.jpg|thumb|Prisoners in [[Utah]] c.1885 wearing striped [[prison uniforms]] considered a badge of shame]]
After Innocent III later presided over the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215,&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-92633-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Maurianne |title=Readings for diversity and social justice |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |page= 147|isbn=0-415-92633-5 |quote=Pope Innocent III, the most power of the medieval popes, presided over the fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and had the bishops decree that non-Christians must wear distinctive garments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the council adopted [[Council of Nablus#Content|canon 68]], requiring Jews (and Muslims) to dress distinctively to prevent interfaith relations.&lt;ref name="Medieval Sourcebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/lat4-c68.html |title=Lateran IV: Canon 68 - on Jews |accessdate=2008-01-12 |author=Halsall, Paul | date=February 1996 |work=Medieval Sourcebook|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|quote= ...we decree that such Jews ... shall be marked off in the eyes of the public from other peoples through the character of their dress...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Albigensian Crusade]] ended in 1229, the subsequent [[Papal inquisition]] of [[Pope Gregory IX]] imposed the [[ecclesiastical]] [[penance]] of the [[Cathar yellow cross]] as a badge of shame to be worn by the remaining repentant [[Cathar]]s convicted of [[heresy]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8264-7665-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, Eamon |title=Faith Of Our Fathers: Reflections On Catholic Traditions (Continuum Icons) |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location= |year=2006 |page= 159 | chapter= What About the Inquisition? |isbn=0-8264-7665-1 |quote=Suspects found guilty of heresy had ecclesiastical penances imposed on them, which might include the wearing of a badge of shame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial]] [[New England]] during the 17th and 18th centuries, courts required people convicted of [[sexual immorality]] to wear the letter "A" or letters "AD" for adultery and the letter "I" for [[incest]] on their clothing.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8377-2180-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Howard, George P. |title=A History of Matrimonial Institutions: Chiefly in England and the United States, With an Introductory Analysis of the Literature and the Theories of |publisher=Fred B Rothman &amp; Co |location= |pages= 169–178 |isbn=0-8377-2180-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Striped [[prison uniform]]s were commonly used in the 19th century, as a way to instantly mark an escaping convict. Modern orange prison uniforms serve the same purpose, only with a highly visible bright color to make it difficult to hide. Stripes were adopted as simple one-color uniforms could easily be dyed to another color; dying a striped uniform cannot hide the stripes. They were temporarily abolished in the United States early in the 20th century because their use as a badge of shame was considered undesirable as they were causing constant embarrassment and exasperation to the [[prisoner]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7619-4753-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pratt, John Clark |title=Punishment and civilization: penal tolerance and intolerance in modern society |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2002 |page= 76 |isbn=0-7619-4753-1 |oclc= |doi= | quote = The distinctive prison stripes were abolished in 1904. ...stripes had come to be looked upon as a badge of shame and were a constant humiliation and irritant to many prisoners' (Report of the New York (State) Prison Department, 1904: 22)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came back to usage as the public viewpoint changed. In many of today's [[jail]]s and [[prison]]s in the United States the inmates are forced to wear striped prison uniforms. A prominent example is [[Maricopa County Jail]] under the administration of [[Joe Arpaio]], where black and white stripes are used. Another predominantly used color scheme consists of orange and white stripes. A person wearing this kind of clothing is distinctly marked and can unmistakably be identified as a prison inmate from a far distance, which allows citizens to instantly identify escapees and notify the authorities.

===Skin===
Societies have marked people directly in the practice generally known as being "branded a criminal". Criminals and slaves have been marked{{when|date=February 2012}} with [[tattoos]].&lt;ref name="tattoos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/surgery/body_mind/everyone/tattoos/ |author = Sayer, Melissa |date= 2007-06-17 |title= Tattoos : AKA: Getting inked |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=The Surgery|publisher=BBC|quote=For thousands of years, people have been getting tattoos....

The practice of human branding with visible marks on the face had been firmly established by King [[Edward VI of England]] under the 1547 ''Statute of Vagabonds'', which specified the burning of the letter "S" on the cheek or forehead of an escaped slave, and the letter "F" for "fraymaker" on the cheek of a church brawler.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrews, William L. |title=Bygone Punishments |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |location= |year=2006 |page= 138|isbn=1-4254-9141-3 |quote=In the reign of Edward VI. was passed the famous Statute of Vagabonds, authorising the branding with hot iron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Nayler]], an [[England|English]] [[Quaker]] convicted of blasphemy in 1656, was famously branded with a "B" on his forehead.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"/&gt;
The practice of human branding was abolished in England by 1829.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"/&gt; It continued in the United States until at least 1864, during the [[American Civil War]], where some [[Desertion|deserters]] from the [[Union Army]] had their face branded with the letter "D" as a mark of shame intended to discourage others.&lt;ref name="title"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfmh.org/whps/images/03-04.2001.pdf |title=William Chester Minor, M.D.: The Brilliance of a Tortured Mind |date=March 2001 |first=Syed, MD |last=Abdullah |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=The Synapse |publisher=West Hudson Psychiatric Society branch of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] |quote=The branding was sometimes done over the cheek so that the would-be deserter carried a visible mark of shame on his face forever. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225063824/http://www.rfmh.org/whps/images/03-04.2001.pdf |archivedate=2004-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Runaway slaves could be branded with an "R" for "runaway", which had the effect of ensuring he or she was watched closely and often prejudiced against by any subsequent owners and overseers.

===Headwear===
In old-fashioned [[France|French]] schoolrooms, misbehaving students were sent to sit in a corner of the room wearing a sign that said "[[wikt:Âne|Âne]]", meaning [[donkey]], and were forced to wear a [[jester]]'s cap with donkey's ears, sometimes conical in shape, known as a "bonnet d'âne", meaning "donkey's cap".

===Barefoot===
[[File:Cornelis De Wael - To Visit the Imprisoned - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|Depiction of barefooted and partly fettered prisoners by [[Cornelis de Wael]]; ''To Visit the Imprisoned'' c. 1640]]
[[File:Prisoner in courtroom, Wales 19th century.JPG|thumb|230px|Barefooted prisoner in iron restraints; [[Wales]] 19th century (museum exhibit)]]
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|Barefooted or naked oriental slaves (''Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market'')]]
In former times [[prisoner]]s were routinely divested of large parts of their clothing and hereby left with usually covered body parts exposed. This was primarily done to visually earmark the captive individuals so onlookers could distinguish their status upon first sight. It also had a symbolistic connotation in those divesting prisoners of their clothes meant divesting them of their rights and social status.&lt;br&gt;
Notably taking away the [[footwear]] of an unfree person and thereby forcing him or her to remain in [[barefoot|bare feet]] has been used for visibly marking captives, prisoners and [[slaves]] in almost every culture. This customary practice is still commonplace in prisons of many countries.

As [[shoes]] in their various appearances have been worn throughout all [[social class]]es since earliest human history, forcibly presenting a person to the public in bare feet is a common method to showcase a person's loss of status or absence of rights.  As bare feet are a highly noticeable visual attribute in almost every social situation, this particular form of appearance often incidentally raises suspicion or disdain among bystanders.

It also serves to dishearten prisoners and frustrate attempts of escape. The ability to walk or run quickly is hereby often drastically reduced.
As the feet are the only body part with near permanent contact to the environment, their lack of protection can have a victimizing effect and make the person feel physically defeated, helpless or vulnerable which adds to the shaming effect.

Wearing shoes is a low-level and natural manifestation of civil rights and liberties, which cannot be revoked from free citizens of any culture under normal circumstances. Even when suffering neediness in ancient history, simple forms of footwear were handmade from available materials, while today simple shoes are sufficiently inexpensive to be purchased in practically every part of the world.&lt;br&gt;
Forcing a subdued person to go barefoot is therefore used to showcase his or her deprivation of the most basic rights and natural liberties. It hereby displays the subjugation of the person under individuals with sufficient authority to impose and enforce certain living conditions. By abiding it also establishes that the person does not have the self-determination, means or power to resist.&lt;br&gt;
Forcing individuals to remain barefoot against their will is, therefore, a common method to display and exercise authority and showcase the flagrant disproportion of power usually found in situations of imprisonment. Exploiting the effects it is often used to intimidate captives or prisoners and cut their self-confidence.

===Restraints===
Presenting a prisoner to the public in restraints (such as [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs|shackles]], [[chain]]s or similar devices) has always served as a method of shaming the person as well. In addition to their practical use of preventing movement and escape, they are usually uncomfortable to wear and often lock the body in unnatural positions. Especially restraining the hands of a captive behind his or her back is perceived as particularly shameful, as it renders the person practically defenceless and showcases his or her physical defeat to onlookers. The effect is often multiplied by combining means of marking people such as the use of [[prison uniform]]s or similar clothing like penitential garbs and the exposure of bare feet.

==Other meanings==

In April 1945 the government of [[Czechoslovakia]] ordered the expropriation, denaturalisation and ensuing deportation of all Czechoslovaks of [[Hungarian language|Magyar]] or [[German language|German]] native language.

{{see also|Bar association}}

A '''bar council''' ({{lang-ga|'''Comhairle an Bharra'''}}) or '''bar association''', in a [[common law]] jurisdiction with a [[legal profession]] split between [[solicitors]] and [[barristers]] or [[advocates]], is a [[professional body]] that regulates the profession of [[barristers]]. In such jurisdictions, solicitors are generally regulated by the [[law society]].

In common law jurisdictions with no distinction between barristers and solicitors (i.e. where there is a "[[fused profession]]"), the professional body may be called variously a ''Law Society'', ''Bar Council'' or ''[[bar association]]''.

{{Evidence law}}
The '''burden of proof''' ({{lang-la|onus probandi}}) is the obligation of a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[trial]] to produce the [[evidence]] that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The burden of proof is always on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: "the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."&lt;ref&gt;Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.

==Definition==
The term "burden of proof" is used to mean two kinds of burdens: The burden of production (or the burden of "going forward with the evidence") and the burden of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, pp. 55-56 (2nd ed. 1984); Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "burden of persuasion" or "risk of nonpersuasion"&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 55 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the [[trier of fact]], the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the [[presumption of innocence]] in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for [[affirmative defense]]s in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. New York'', {{ussc|432|197|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of persuasion should not be confused with the [[evidential burden]], or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence)&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 56 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.

==Standard of proof in the United States==
Burden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any [[affirmative defenses|affirmative facts in defense]]. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.

===Legal standards for burden of proof===
====Some evidence====
Per ''{{w|Superintendent v. Hill}}'' (1985), in order to take away a prisoner's {{w|good conduct time}} for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have "some evidence," i.e., "a modicum of evidence".

Per ''{{w|Thompson v. City of Louisville}}'' (1960), the some evidence standard is required to overrule a jury's finding of guilt in criminal cases.

====Reasonable indications====
"Reasonable indication is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere 'hunch' is insufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch Ballin|first1=Marianne|title=Anticipative Criminal Investigation: Theory and Counterterrorism Practice in the Netherlands and the United States|date=Mar 6, 2012|page=525|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGExJeGdVF0C&amp;lpg=PA524&amp;ots=Fe-QCWeGvn&amp;dq=%22reasonable%20indications%22%20crime&amp;pg=PA524#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pak|first1=Nam|title=American Lamb Company v. United States: Application of the Reasonable Indication Standard|journal=Northwest Journal of International Law and Business|date=1988|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol9/iss1/11|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasonable suspicion====
{{Main|Reasonable suspicion}}
Reasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a ''brief'' investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. It is important to note that this stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often [[probable cause]]) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or "hunch" is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.

An investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.

====Reasonable to believe====
In ''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'' (2009), the United States Supreme Court defined a new standard, that of "reasonable to believe." This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled ''[[New York v. Belton]]'' (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect's arrest only where it is "reasonable to believe" that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.

There is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the "reasonable suspicion" of the ''Terry'' stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.

====Probable cause====
{{main|Probable cause}}
Probable cause is a relatively low standard of proof, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by [[grand jury|grand juries]] to determine whether to issue an [[indictment]]. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement [[remedy (law)|remedy]].

In the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''United States v. Sokolow'', {{ussc|490|1|1989}}, determined that probable cause requires "a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found" in deciding whether [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts vary when determining what constitutes a "fair probability": some{{Who|date=August 2012}} say 30%, others 40%, others 51%.

A good illustration of this evidence/intrusiveness continuum might be a typical police/citizen interaction. Consider the following three interactions:
* '''no level of suspicion required''': a consensual encounter between officer and citizen
* '''reasonable suspicion required''': a stop initiated by the officer that would cause a reasonable person not to feel free to leave
* '''probable cause required''': arrest.

====Some credible evidence====
One of the least reliable standards of proof, this assessment is often used in administrative law, and often in [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) proceedings in some states. The "some credible evidence" standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of "probable cause" used in ex parte threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see ''Valmonte v. Bane,'' 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the "some credible evidence" standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.

====Substantial evidence====
In some appeals from decisions of [[administrative agencies]], the courts apply a "substantial evidence" [[standard of review]] of the agency's factual findings. In the United States, for example, if a [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] claimant is found "not disabled" (and, therefore, ineligible for benefits) by an [[administrative law judge|Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)]] and the claimant appeals, both the Appeals Council (the body within the [[Social Security Administration]] that hears appeals from decisions of ALJs) and the [[United States Federal courts|Federal courts]] (which, in this type of case, will normally hear an appeal only after the claimant has [[exhaustion of remedies|exhausted all administrative remedies]]) will look to see whether the administrative law judge's decision was supported by "substantial evidence" or not. Substantial evidence is "more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''[[Richardson v. Perales]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10758399444677950472&amp;q=%22substantial+evidence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,9 402 U.S. 389, 401] (1971), ''quoting from'' ''[[Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB]]'', 305 U. S. 197, 229 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

This applies to other court decisions. The trier of fact's decision cannot be baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/12431.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{vanchor|Preponderance of the evidence}}====
Preponderance of the evidence, also known as '''balance of probabilities''', is the standard required in most [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases and in [[family court]] determinations solely involving money, such as [[child support]] under the [[Child Support Standards Act]]. It is also the burden of proof of which the defendant must prove [[affirmative defenses]] or  [[mitigating circumstances]] in civil or criminal court. In civil court, [[aggravating circumstances]] also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as they do in criminal court).

The standard is met if the proposition is [[Probability|more likely]] to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], in ''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'',&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'' [1947] 2 All ER 372&lt;/ref&gt; described it simply as "more probable than not." Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also the standard of proof used when determining eligibility of unemployment benefits for a former employee accused of losing the job through alleged misconduct. In most US states, the employer must prove this case with a preponderance of evidence.

Preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial [[stand-your-ground law]]. The defense must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the preponderance of the evidence whether to grant immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224306/http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a far lower burden than "beyond a reasonable doubt," the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/florida-stand-your-ground-law-yields-some-shocking-outcomes-depending-on/1233133|title=Florida 'stand your ground' law yields some shocking outcomes depending on how law is applied|work=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but higher than the "probable cause" threshold generally required for [[indictment]].

====Clear and convincing evidence====
Clear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than "preponderance of the evidence". It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in [[civil procedure|civil]] and certain [[criminal procedure]] in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking ''[[habeas corpus]]'' relief from [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Calderon v. Thompson'', {{ussc|523|538|1998}}. The petitioner, Thomas M. Thompson, a convicted rapist/murderer, was executed on July 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard is used in many types of [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, including [[paternity (law)|paternity]], [[persons in need of supervision]], [[juvenile delinquency]], [[child custody]], the [[probate]] of both wills and [[living wills]], petitions to remove a person from [[life support]] ("[[right to die]]" cases),&lt;ref&gt;See, ''[[Quinlan case#Legal battle|Quinlan v. New Jersey]]'', and ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'', 497 U.S. 261 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and many similar cases.

Clear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions, which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.

This standard is also known as "clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence"; "clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence"; and "clear, unequivocal, satisfactory, and convincing evidence", and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists.

====Beyond reasonable doubt====
{{main|Reasonable doubt}}

This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering [[aggravating circumstances]] in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.

The term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no ''reasonable'' doubt is possible from the evidence presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1971|litigants=Green v The Queen |parallelcite=(1971) 126 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 28 at p. 33 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, ''i.e.'', when conviction is based entirely on [[circumstantial evidence]], certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.

The main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty or even in his or her death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.

Another noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is [[Conservatorship|LPS conservatorship]].

==Standard of proof in the United Kingdom==
In the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England &amp; Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. (There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.)

The criminal standard was formerly described as "beyond reasonable doubt". That standard remains, and the words commonly used, though the Judicial Studies Board guidance is that juries might be assisted by being told that to convict they must be persuaded "so that you are sure".

The civil standard is 'the balance of probabilities', often referred to in judgments as "more likely than not".

The civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to [[Driving under the influence#United Kingdom|drunk in charge]] that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/5 s.5 Road Traffic Act 1988]; see [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd041014/gen4-1.htm R. vs Sheldrake])&lt;/ref&gt;). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Burden_of_Proof|title=Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime - The Crown Prosecution Service|author=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Prior to the decision of the House of Lords in ''Re B (A Child)'' [2008] UKHL 35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080611/child-1.htm|title=House of Lords -   In Re B (Children) (Fc)    Appellate Committee    Lord Hoffmann  Lord Scott of Foscote  Lord R|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; there had been some confusion – even at the Court of Appeal – as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the 'heightened standard'. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges to make decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. [[Baroness Hale]] said:

{{quote|70. ... Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.

72. ... there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.}}

The task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognise that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains 'the balance of probabilities'.

==Other standards for presenting cases or defenses==

===Air of reality===
&lt;!-- [[Air of reality]] redirects here --&gt;
{{see also|R v Cinous}}

The "air of reality" is a standard of proof used in [[Canada]] to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an "air of reality." Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a ''[[prima facie#Burden of proof|prima facie]]'' case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an [[affirmative defense]], such as the [[insanity defense]].

===Evidentiary standards of proof===
Depending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest.  For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code Section 662, available at http://legalmasters.net/practices/real-estate-law/commonly-referenced-real-estate-statutes-and-regulations/california-evidence-code-sections-660-668/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Criminal law===
In the [[Western world|West]], [[criminal law|criminal]] cases usually place the burden of proof on the [[prosecutor]] (expressed in the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin]] [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] '''''[[ei incumbit probatio qui dicit]], non qui negat''''', "the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies"). This principle is known as the [[presumption of innocence]], and is summed up with "innocent until proven guilty," but is not upheld in all legal systems or [[jurisdiction]]s. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.
&lt;ref name=Bailii&gt;{{cite web|title=Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html&amp;query=woolmington&amp;method=boolean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presumption of innocence means three things:
* With respect to the critical facts of a case the defendant has no burden of proof whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;The critical facts of a criminal case are whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant is criminally responsible for the commission of the crime.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state must prove the critical facts of the case to the appropriate level of certainty.
* The jury is not to draw any inferences adverse to the defendant from the fact that he has been charged with a crime and is present in court facing the charges against him.

For example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.
* Burden of proof: P
** Burden of production: P has to show some evidence that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then it is up to the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson v. Virginia'', {{ussc|443|307|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).
*** e.g. [[witness]], [[forensic evidence]], [[autopsy]] report
*** Failure to meet the burden: the issue will be decided as a matter of law. In this case, D is presumed innocent
** Burden of persuasion: if at the close of evidence, the jury cannot decide if P has established with relevant level of certainty that D had committed murder, the jury must find D not guilty of the crime of murder
*** Measure of proof: P has to prove every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, but not necessarily prove every single fact beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, in [[England and Wales]], the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" in his defence, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being [[drunk in charge]] of a motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, s.5(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.&lt;ref name="herring"&gt;{{cite book |author=Herring, J. |year=2004 |title=Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876578-9 |pages=58–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that:&lt;ref name="herring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v. DPP, Ex Parte Kebeline'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/43.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1999]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKHL 43]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mere evidential burden did not contravene art.6(2);
* A legal / persuasive burden did not necessarily contravene art.6(2) so long as confined within reasonable limits, considering the questions:
** ''What must the prosecution prove to transfer burden to the defendant?''
** ''Is the defendant required to prove something difficult or easily within his access?''
** ''What threat to society is the provision designed to combat?''

In some cases, there is a [[reverse onus]] on the accused.  A typical example is that of a [[Hit and run#Canada|hit-and-run]] charge prosecuted under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']].  The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offence.

===Civil law===
In [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases, the "burden of proof" requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought.  This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover. However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove there is a real or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.

===Civil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court===
In ''Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1'', {{ussc|413|189|1973}}, the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated: "There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations.'" For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In ''Keyes'', the Supreme Court held that if "school authorities have been found to have practised purposeful segregation in part of a school system," the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.

In ''Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries'', {{ussc|512|267|1994}}, the Supreme Court explained that ''burden of proof'' is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens:  the ''burden of persuasion'', and the ''burden of production''.

The Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in ''Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast'', {{ussc|546|49|2005}}. The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will "begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims." In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:

{{quote|The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.}}

At the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized "The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. See, e.g., ''FTC v. Morton Salt Co.'', 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. See ''Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA'', {{ussc|540|461|2004}}." Nonetheless, "[a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Conditional Limitation''', in [[law]], a phrase used in two senses.

(1) The qualification annexed to the grant of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] or interest in land, providing for the determination of that grant or interest upon a particular [[Contingency (contract)|contingency]] happening. An estate with such a limitation can endure only until the particular contingency happens; it is a present interest, to be divested on a future contingency. The grant of an estate to a man so long as he is parson of Dale, or while he continues unmarried, are instances of conditional limitations of estates for life.

(2) A [[future interest|use or interest]] in land limited to take effect upon a given contingency. For instance, a grant to X. and his heirs to the use of A., provided that when C. returns from Rome the land shall go to the use of B. in fee simple. B. is said to take under a conditional limitation, operating by executory devise or springing or shifting use.

In [[United States|American]] law, this creates a [[fee simple]] '''on [[condition subsequent]]'''.

A '''coroner''' may conduct or order an [[inquest]] into [[Manner of death|the manner]] or [[cause of death]], and investigate or confirm the identity of an unknown person who has been found dead within the coroner's jurisdiction.

In medieval times, English coroners were Crown officials who held financial powers and conducted some judicial investigations in order to counterbalance the power of [[sheriff]]s.

The word ''coroner'' derives from the same source as the word ''[[Crown (headgear)|crown]]'', and it is believed to denote an officer of [[The Crown]].

==Duties and functions==
Responsibilities of the coroner may include overseeing the investigation and certification of deaths related to mass disasters that occur within the coroner's jurisdiction. A coroner's office typically maintains death records of those who have died within the coroner's jurisdiction.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the coroner may adjudge the cause of death personally, or may act as the presiding officer of a special [[court]] (a "[[coroner's jury]]"). The office of coroner originated in [[medieval England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/138338/coroner "coroner"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2009. Accessed 10 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyco.org/dotnetnuke/Home/Coroner/History/tabid/462/Default.aspx Coroner History]. [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Accessed 10 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been adopted in many countries whose legal systems have at some time been subject to [[English law|English]] or [[United Kingdom law]]. The additional roles that a coroner may oversee in judicial investigations may be subject to the attainment of suitable legal and medical qualifications. The qualifications required of a coroner vary significantly between [[jurisdiction]]s, and are described under the entry for each jurisdiction.
Coroners, [[medical examiner]]s, and [[forensic pathologist]]s are different professions.&lt;ref name=CvM&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner vs. medical examiner|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/examiner.html|website=Visible Proofs |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have different roles and responsibilities.

In Middle English, the word "coroner" referred to an officer of The Crown, derived from the French ''couronne'' and Latin ''corona'', meaning "crown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coroner |title=coroner |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam Webster |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The office of the coroner dates from approximately the 11th century, shortly after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of England in 1066.

The coroner was formally established in England by Article 20 of the "[[Articles of Eyre]]" in September 1194 to "keep the pleas of the Crown" ([[Latin]], ''custos placitorum coronae'') from which the word "coroner" is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=coroner&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: ''coroner (n.)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role provided a local [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] official whose primary duty was to protect the financial interest of the Crown in criminal proceedings. The office of coroner is, "in many instances, a necessary substitute: for if the [[sheriff]] is interested in a suit, or if he is of affinity with one of the parties to a suit, the coroner must execute and return the process of the courts of justice."&lt;ref&gt;James Wilson, Lectures on Law, vol. 2, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; This role was qualified in Chapter 24 of [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, which states: "No sheriff, constable, coroner or bailiff shall hold pleas of our Crown." "Keeping the pleas" was an administrative task, while "holding the pleas" was a judicial one that was not assigned to the locally resident coroner but left to judges who traveled around the country holding [[Assize Court]]s. The role of [[custos rotulorum]] or keeper of the county records became an independent office, which after 1836 was held by the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county. The person who found a body from a death thought sudden or unnatural was required to raise the "[[hue and cry]]" and to notify the coroner. While coronial manuals written for sheriffs, bailiffs, justices of the peace and coroners were published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, handbooks specifically written for coroners were distributed in England in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trabsky|first1=Marc|title=The Coronial Manual and the Bureaucratic Logic of the Coroner's Office|journal=International Journal of Law in Context|date=2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=195–209|doi=10.1017/S1744552316000069|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1744552316000069|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coroners were introduced into [[Wales]] following its military conquest by [[Edward I of England]] in 1282 through the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284.

==Coroners by country==

===Australia===

Australian coroners are responsible for investigating and determining the cause of death for those cases reported to them. In all states and territories, a coroner is a [[magistrate]] with legal training, and is attached to a local court. Four states – [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] – also have state coroners and specialised coronial courts. In [[Tasmania]], the Chief Magistrate also acts as the state coroner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who works at a morgue?|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/who-works-at-a-morgue|website=Australian Museum|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=en|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In [[Canada]] the officer responsible for investigating all unnatural and natural unexpected, unexplained, or unattended deaths goes under the title "coroner" or "medical examiner" depending on location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-214-x/2012001/int-eng.htm Introduction: Coroner Canadian Medical Examiner Database: Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt; While the title differs, however, they act in similar capacities. They do not determine civil or criminal responsibility, but instead make and offer recommendations to improve public safety and prevention of death in similar circumstances.

Coroner or Medical Examiner services are under the jurisdiction of provincial or territorial governments, generally within the public safety and security or justice portfolio. These services are headed by a Chief Coroner (or Chief Medical Examiner) and comprise coroners or medical examiners appointed by the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]].

The provinces of [[Alberta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://justice.alberta.ca/programs_services/fatality/ocme/Pages/default.aspx |title=Office of the Chief Medical Examiner |website=justice.alberta.ca |publisher=Alberta Justice and Solicitor General |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manitoba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/justice/about/chief.html |title=The Role of the Chief Medical Examiner's Office |website=www.gov.mb.ca |publisher=Manitoba Justice |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nova Scotia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.ns.ca/just/cme/ |title=Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service |website=www.gov.ns.ca |publisher=Nova Scotia |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.nl.ca/just/department/branches/division/division_ocme.html |title=Office of the Chief Medical Examiner |website=www.justice.gov.nl.ca |publisher= Newfoundland - Labrador Department of Justice |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a Medical Examiner system, meaning that all death investigations are conducted by specialist physicians trained in [[Forensic Pathology]], with the assistance of other medical and law enforcement personnel. All other provinces run on a coroner system. In [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Ontario]], all coroners are, by law, [[physicians]]. In the other provinces and territories with a coroner system, namely [[British Columbia]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]], coroners are not necessarily physicians but generally have legal, medical, or investigative backgrounds.

===Hong Kong===
The Coroner's Court is responsible to inquire into the causes and circumstances of some deaths. The Coroner is a judicial officer who has the power to:
* Grant:
** Burial orders
** Cremation orders
** Waivers of autopsy
** Autopsy orders
** Exhumation orders
** Orders to remove dead bodies outside Hong Kong
* Order police investigations of death
* Order inquests
* Approve removal and use of body parts of the dead body
* Issue certificates of fact of death

The Coroner makes orders after considering the pathologist's report.

===Ireland===
The Coroners Service is a network of Coroners situated across Ireland, usually covering areas based on Ireland's traditional counties.&lt;ref name="Corserv-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coroners.ie/en/CS/Pages/Overview|title=Coroner Service|publisher=Coroner Service|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are appointed by local authorities as independent experts and must be either qualified doctors or lawyers.&lt;ref name="Corserv-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coroners.ie/en/CS/Pages/Who%20Are%20Coroners|title=Who are the coroners|publisher=Coroner Service|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary function is to investigate any sudden, unexplained, violent or unnatural death in order to allow a death certificate to be issued. Any death due to unnatural causes will require an [[inquest]] to be held.&lt;ref name="Corserv-2"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
Two coronial services operate in New Zealand. The older one deals only with deaths before midnight of 30 June 2007 that remain under investigation. The new system operates under the [[Coroners Act 2006]], which:
* Established the office of the chief coroner to provide leadership and coordination
* Moved to a smaller number of full-time legally-qualified coroners who are Judges of the Coroners Court
* Ensured families are notified of significant steps in the coronial process
* Introduced wide-ranging cultural matters to be considered in all aspects of dealing with the dead body
* Introduced a specific regime for attention and release of body parts and body samples
* Enhanced inquiry and inquest processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/coroners-court|publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Justice|title=Welcome to the Coronial Services of New Zealand|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
n Poland, a coroner is a forensic doctor (colloquially called a forensic medicine), whose job is to legally identify patients who died. As a separate profession, it has existed since 2002, its introduction aimed to relieve home doctors and emergency physicians, as well as to prevent funeral corruption  and corpses. The coroner is bound by business secret.

The responsibilities of the city coroner working on behalf of the city authorities in Poland include: declaring death, assessing the causes of death (natural or criminal), issuing relevant documents and keeping records.

A family doctor may also be called to declare a death. In the event of an emergency, the doctor diagnoses an ambulance from the ambulance service. Doctors who have the legal right to declare death cooperate with funeral institutions.

The position of the first coroners was chosen in Łódź for experienced forensic doctors, who are on call and cooperating with the ambulance service, will be notified of evidential death reports to go to the indicated address. Just in case, the coroners were also equipped with the apparatus necessary to provide first aid.

The widespread employment of coroners requires adjusting the relevant provisions regulating who may, according to the law in force, make an act of finding a human death. It is believed that forensic doctors have appropriate education and professional practice to perform the function of coroners.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the [[Minister of Justice (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Justice]] appoints ''Inquirers into Sudden Deaths'' under the ''Code of Criminal Procedure'' to carryout an inquest into the death of a sudden, unexpected and suspicious nature. Some large cities such as [[Colombo]] and [[Kandy]] have a City Coroners' Court attached to the main city hospital, with a Coroner and Additional Coroner. 

===United Kingdom===
====Overview====
{{update|type=section|the consequences of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]]|date=March 2010}}
In the United Kingdom a coroner is an independent judicial office holder, appointed and paid for by the relevant [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]]. The [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], which is headed by the [[Lord Chancellor|Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice]] has the responsibility for the coronial law and policy only, and no operational responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/whatwedo/coroners.htm|title=Coroners - Ministry of Justice|accessdate=3 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227110654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/whatwedo/coroners.htm|archivedate=27 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are separate services for [[England and Wales]], and for [[Northern Ireland]]. A different system applies in [[Scotland]], which does not have a coroner service.
The coroner service in England and Wales is supervised by the Chief Coroner, a judge appointed by the Lord Chief Justice after consulting the Lord Chancellor. He provides advice, guidance and training to coroners and aims to secure uniformity of practice throughout England and Wales. The post is currently part-time. The present Chief Coroner is Judge Mark Lucraft QC, who is one of the judges sitting at the Central Criminal Court. He has also been appointed a deputy judge of the High Court, and as such he normally sits as a member of the bench when that court has occasion to hold a judicial review of an inquest.
England and Wales are divided into coroner districts by the Lord Chancellor, each district consisting of the area or areas of one or more local authorities.  The relevant local authority, with the consent of the Chief Coroner and the Lord Chancellor, must appoint a Senior Coroner for the district. It must also appoint Area Coroners (in effect deputies to the Senior Coroner) and Assistant Coroners, to the number that the Lord Chancellor considers necessary in view of the physical character and population of the district.  The cost of the coroner service for the district falls upon the local authority or authorities concerned, and thus ultimately upon the local inhabitants.

====Jurisdiction====
The majority of deaths are not investigated by the coroner. If the deceased has been under medical care, or has been seen by a doctor within 14 days of death, then the doctor can issue a death certificate. However if the deceased died without being seen by a doctor, or if they are  unwilling to make a determination, the coroner will investigate the cause and manner of death. 
The coroner will also investigate when a death is deemed violent or unnatural, where the cause is unknown, where a death is the result of poisoning or industrial injury, or if it occurred in police custody or prison. 
Any person aware of a dead body lying in the district of a coroner has a duty to report it to the coroner; failure to do so is an offence. This can include bodies brought into England or [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=cps&gt;[https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/coroners ''Coroners''] at cps.gov.uk; retrieved 6 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcr&gt;[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/626/coroners/5530/general_information_about_the_coroners_service/1 ''General information about the coroner service''] at manchester.gov.uk; retrieved 6 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The coroner has a team of Coroner's Officers (previously often ex-police officers, but increasingly from a nursing or other paramedical background) who carry out the investigation on the coroner's behalf. 
A coroner's investigation may involve a simple review of the circumstances, ordering a post-mortem examination, or they may decide that an inquest is appropriate. 
When a person dies in the custody of the legal authorities (in police cells, or in [[prison]]), an inquest must be held. In England, inquests are usually heard without a jury (unless the coroner wants one). However, a case in which a person has died under the control of central authority must have a jury, as a check on the possible abuse of governmental power.&lt;ref name=cps/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcr/&gt;

The coroner's court is a [[court of law]], and accordingly, the coroner may summon witnesses. Those found lying are guilty of [[perjury]].

Additional powers of the coroner may include the power of [[subpoena]] and [[attachment (law)|attachment]], the [[power of arrest]], the power to administer [[oath]]s, and [[Sequestration (law)|sequester]] juries of six during inquests.

Coroners also have a role in [[treasure trove]] cases. This role arose from the ancient duty of the coroner as a protector of the property of the Crown. It is now contained in the [[Treasure Act 1996]].  This jurisdiction is no longer exercised by local coroners, but by specialist "Coroners for Treasure" appointed by the Chief Coroner.

====Qualification====
To become a coroner in [[England and Wales]] the applicant must be a qualified [[lawyer]] ([[solicitor]]/[[barrister]]), or a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx), with at least 5 years' qualified experience. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/coroners/ "Coroners"] at judiciary.uk; reviewed 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the role of a coroner: to determine the cause of death of a deceased in cases where the death was sudden, unexpected, occurred abroad, was suspicious in any way, or happened while the person was under the control of central authority (e.g., in police [[Powers of the police in England and Wales#Detention|custody]]).  Until 2013 a qualified medical practitioner could be appointed, but that is no longer possible. Any medical coroner still in office will either have been appointed before 2013, or, exceptionally, will hold both medical and legal qualifications.

Formerly, every justice of the High Court was, ''ex officio'', a coroner for every district in England and Wales. This is no longer so; there are now no ''ex officio'' coroners.  A senior judge is sometimes appointed ''ad hoc'' as a deputy coroner to undertake a high-profile inquest, such as those into the deaths of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and the victims of the [[2005 London bombings]].

====Inquest====
{{See also|Inquests in England and Wales}}
The coroner's jurisdiction is limited to determining who the deceased was and how, when and where they came by their death. When the death is suspected to have been either sudden with unknown cause, violent, or unnatural, the coroner decides whether to hold a [[post-mortem]] examination and, if necessary, an [[inquest]].

====Verdict====
The coroner's former power to name a suspect in the inquest verdict and commit them for trial has been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1977, section 56(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The coroner's verdict sometimes is persuasive for the police and [[Crown Prosecution Service]], but normally proceedings in the coroner's court are suspended until after the final outcome of any criminal case is known. More usually, a coroner's verdict is also relied upon in [[civil law (common law)|civil proceedings]] and [[insurance]] [[Claim (legal)|claims]]. The coroner commonly tells the jury which verdicts are lawfully available in a particular case.

The most common verdicts include:&lt;ref name="hse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/wrdeaths/chronology.htm|title=Enforcement Guide (England &amp; Wales) - Work-related deaths and inquests - Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
* [[Death by natural causes]]
* [[Death by misadventure]]
* [[Accident]]al death
* [[Lawful killing]]
* [[Suicide]]
* [[Unlawful killing]]
* [[Occupational disease]]
* Drug dependence
* Non-dependent drug abuse
{{col-3}}
* Attempted abortion
* Self-induced abortion
* Disaster (but only if it has been the subject of a public enquiry)
* [[Still birth]]
* [[Self-neglect]]
* Lack of care/neglect
* An [[open verdict]]
* A [[narrative verdict]]
{{col-end}}

Lawful killing includes lawful [[self-defence]]. There is no material difference between an accidental death verdict and one of misadventure.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Portsmouth Coroner ex parte Anderson'' (1987) 1 WLR 1640&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing require proving beyond [[reasonable doubt]]. Other verdicts are arrived at on the [[balance of probabilities]].

A verdict of neglect requires that there was a need for relevant care (such as nourishment, medical attention, shelter or warmth) identified, and there was an opportunity to offer or provide that care that was not taken. Neglect can be ruled an aggravating factor in other verdicts as well as a freestanding verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''R v N Humberside and Scunthorpe Coroner ex parte Jamieson'' [1994] 3 All ER 972&lt;/ref&gt;

An open verdict is given where the cause of death cannot be identified on the evidence available to the inquest.

A coroner giving a narrative verdict may choose to refer to the other verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;''R v HM Coroner for the County of West Yorkshire ex parte Sacker'' [2004] UKHL 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A narrative verdict may also consist of answers to a set of questions posed by the Coroner to himself or to the jury (as appropriate).

====England and Wales====
There are 98 coroners in England and Wales, covering 109 local authority areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/coroners  Coroners] at cps.gov.uk; retrieved 5 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Coronial services in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in England and Wales, including dealing with [[treasure trove]] cases under the [[Treasure Act 1996]]. Northern Ireland has three coroners, who oversee the province as a whole. They are assisted by Coroners Liaison Officers and a medical Officer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/articles/coroners-service-northern-ireland  Coroner service for Northern Ireland] at justice-ni.gov.uk; retrieved 5 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In Scotland there are no longer coroners. Coroners were used in Scotland between about 1500 and 1800 when they ceased to be used. Now deaths requiring judicial examination are reported to the [[Procurator Fiscal]] and dealt with by [[Fatal accident inquiry|Fatal Accident Inquiries]] conducted by the [[Sheriff]] for the area.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===United States===

{{as of|2004}}, of the 2,342 death investigation offices in the United States, 1,590 were coroners' offices, 82 of which served jurisdictions of more than 250,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Hickman, K.A. Hughes, K.J. Strom, and J.D. Ropero-Miller, [https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/meco04.pdf Medical Examiners and Coroners’ Offices], (2004). U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report NCJ216756.&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifications for coroners are set by individual states and counties in the U.S., and vary widely. In many jurisdictions, little or no training is required, even though a coroner may overrule a forensic pathologist in naming a cause of death. Some coroners are elected, and others appointed. Some coroners hold office by virtue of holding another office: in Nebraska, the county district attorney is the coroner; in many counties in Texas, the [[Justice of the Peace]] may be in charge of death investigation; in other places, the sheriff is the coroner.

In different jurisdictions the terms "coroner" and "[[medical examiner]]" are defined differently. In some places, stringent rules require that the medical examiner be a forensic pathologist. In others, the medical examiner must be a physician, though not necessarily a forensic pathologist or even a pathologist; physicians with no experience in forensic medicine have become medical examiners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/post-mortem/ Frontline: Post Mortem]&lt;/ref&gt; In others, such as Wisconsin, each county sets standards, and in some, the medical examiner does not need any medical or educational qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Keach, Jenifer. Coroners and Medical Examiners A Comparison of Options Offered by Both Systems in Wisconsin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all U.S. jurisdictions use a coroner system for medicolegal death investigation—some are on a medical examiner system, others are on a mixed coroner–medical examiner system. In the U.S., the terms "coroner" and "medical examiner" vary widely in meaning by jurisdiction, as do qualifications and duties for these offices.&lt;ref name="Sciences 2009 p 241-253"/&gt;

Local laws define the deaths a coroner must investigate, but most often include those that are sudden, unexpected, and have no [[attending physician]]—and deaths that are suspicious or violent.&lt;ref name="Sciences 2009 p 241-253"&gt;National Academy of Sciences, ''Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward'', (2009), pp. 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; In some places in the United States, a coroner has other special powers, such as the ability to arrest the county sheriff.

====Duties====
Duties always include determining the cause, time, and manner of death. This uses the same investigatory skills of a police detective in most cases, because the answers are available from the circumstances, scene, and recent medical records. In many American jurisdictions, any death not certified by the person's own physician must be referred to the medical examiner. If an individual dies outside of his/her state of residence, the coroner of the state in which the death took place issues the death certificate. Only a small percentage of deaths require an [[autopsy]] to determine the time, cause and manner of death.

In some states, additional functions are handled by the coroner. For example, in [[Louisiana]], coroners are involved in the determination of mental illness of living persons. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the coroner has the same powers as a county [[sheriff]] to execute arrest warrants and serve process, and in certain situations where there is no sheriff, in addition to conducting cause and manner of death investigations and inquests,&lt;ref&gt;Title 15, Chapter 16, Section 8 of Georgia law and Ch. 152 of NC law&lt;/ref&gt; the coroner officially acts as sheriff for the county. Also the Coroner is the only official who can arrest the sheriff of a county. This is also the case in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Section 30-10-604, Colorado revised statutes&lt;/ref&gt; Also in North Carolina, the coroner exists in approximately 65 counties by law, but is only an active office on ten.&lt;ref&gt;Section 30-10-604, Colorado Revised Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kentucky]], section 72.415 of the [[Kentucky Revised Statutes]] gives coroners and their deputies the full power and authority of [[peace officer]]s. This includes the power of arrest and the authority to carry [[firearm]]s. In North Carolina, in the counties that have coroners, they are set forth as common law peace officers, yet the coroner of the county also has judicial powers; not only to investigate cause and manner of death, but to conduct inquests, issue court orders, to empanel a coroner's jury and to act as Sheriff in certain cases or even arrest the Sheriff for cause. Beginning in 2015, the NC Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) began optional training for coroners to become special assistant medical examiner investigators (NC CH130A &amp; 152). In [[Indiana]] the coroner is the only law enforcement officer who has the authority to arrest the county sheriff, incarcerate him, and take command of the county jail. The coroner is also the only official who may serve the sheriff with civil process. In [[New York City]], the office of coroner was actually abolished in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;Section 284, New York State Laws of 1915&lt;/ref&gt; since before that time, having medical knowledge was not actually a requirement, leading to much abuse of position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helpern|first=Milton|title=Autopsy: the memoirs of Milton Helpern, the world's greatest medical detective|year=1977|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-451-08607-4|pages=12–13|chapter=Beginnings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents in other countries==
The office of coroner is common to most countries with a British colonial influence, but unusual outside of that. The equivalent offices in other nations follow the Medical Examiner model, or are part of the Police and Judiciary. In France the relevant official is the ''Médecin légiste'' ([[:fr:Médecin légiste|fr]]) and in Italy the ''Medicina legale''([[:it:Medicina legale|it]]); in Germany it is the ''Gerichtmediziner''([[:de:Gerichtmediziner|de]]). In Spain and Portugal investigations are carried out by a forensic pathologist under the supervision of an [[Examining magistrate]] (a ''Juez de instrucción''([[:es:Juez de instrucción|es]])). 

In Japan the office of ''kenshi-kan'' (検視官)([[:ja:検視官|ja]]) generally translates as "coroner", but holders of the office are police [[detective]]s with field experience, thus resembling [[Scenes of Crime Officer|scenes of crime officers]] or [[Crime Scene Investigator | crime scene investigators]] in English-speaking countries. A ''kenshi-kan'' typically holds the rank of captain, and has studied forensic medicine and investigation techniques at the National Police Academy.

'''Crime Stoppers International Foundation''' or '''CSI Foundation''' (CSI) is an umbrella organization that aims to spread the [[Crimestoppers]] program in countries around the world. Crimestoppers is a program designed to utilize the media and other resources to entice information from the public that can facilitate [[police]] investigations. CSI is run by a volunteer board and its activities include hosting annual training conferences and supporting regional leadership and training programs. CSI coordinates networking resources for local Crimestoppers' operations, such as a website and a print publications called ''The Caller''. It is funded by dues paid by member organizations. Some of the services CSI provides to its members include an annual awards program for local Crimestoppers operations, produces an operations manual to assist new programs and to help set up and guide new Crimestopper programs, and providing legal services to its members.

CSI lists its mission statement as the following: "To develop Crime Stoppers as an effective crime-solving organization throughout the world, with the primary objective of the tri-partite organization, Community, Media and Law Enforcement, being, Working Together to Solve Crime".&lt;ref name="CSI_about"&gt;[http://www.c-s-i.org/OurVision.aspx Crime Stoppers International - Our Vision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129112813/http://www.c-s-i.org/OurVision.aspx |date=January 29, 2010 }} Retrieved 2008-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crimestoppers program began in the 1970s as an innovation to solve a crime that was committed with no witnesses and few leads for police investigators. The main goal is to produce televised re-enactments, offer rewards and promises of anonymity for information leading to an arrest. Detective Greg MacAleese was investigating the [[murder]] of a [[gas station]] attendant, Michael Carmen, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] in 1976 when he came up with the idea..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M5z-vQAACAAJ&amp;dq=crimestoppers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTmoS-zI_eAhVlKcAKHTafDvwQ6AEIKTAA|title=Crime Stoppers: The Inside Story|last=MacAleese|first=Greg|date=2016-07-12|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781533259721|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lB_aoQEACAAJ&amp;dq=crimestoppers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTmoS-zI_eAhVlKcAKHTafDvwQ6AEIMTAC|title=What Is Crime Stoppers|last=Millar|first=Cal|date=2014-08-07|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781500645939|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Albuquerque had one of the highest per capita crime rates in the US.

==Crime Stoppers in Canada==

In Canada, a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision R. v . Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281 ruled unanimously that police do not have to disclose any information they receive from this internationally recognized crime prevention program.

:{{Cquote|The rule of informer privilege is of such fundamental importance to the workings of a criminal justice system it cannot be balanced against other interest relating to the administration of justice...Once the privilege has been established, neither the police nor the court possesses discretion to abridge it.&lt;ref name="Reason for Judgement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime Stoppers Anonymity Guaranteed|url=http://www.greatervancouvercrimestoppers.com/news.php?cat=2&amp;news_id=113&amp;rc=program_events|author=Greater Vancouver Crime Stoppers|publisher=Greater Vancouver Crime Stoppers|date=2007-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425100914/http://www.greatervancouvercrimestoppers.com/news.php?cat=2&amp;news_id=113&amp;rc=program_events|archivedate=2009-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Decomposed granite''' is classification of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that is derived from [[granite]] via its [[weathering]] to the point that the parent material readily fractures into smaller pieces of weaker rock. Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into a mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles known as [[Grus (geology)|grus]], that in turn may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite. It has practical uses that include its incorporation into [[Road surface|paving]] and [[driveway]] materials, residential gardening materials in arid environments, as well as various types of [[walkway]]s and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]] in [[park]]s. Different colors of decomposed granite are available, deriving from the natural range of granite colors from different quarry sources, and admixture of other natural and synthetic materials can extend the range of decomposed granite properties.

==Definition and composition==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
Decomposed granite is [[Rock (geology)|rock]] of [[granitic]] origin that has [[weathering|weathered]] to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of [[gravel]]-sized particles, [[sand]], and [[silt]]-sized particles with some [[clay]]. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.

The parent [[granite]] material is a common type of [[igneous rock]] that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is [[phaneritic]] in texture); it is composed of [[plagioclase feldspar]], [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[mica]], and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of [[feldspar]], one of the primary constituents of [[granite]], into the clay mineral [[kaolin]] is one of the important weathering processes.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05&gt;Mitchell, J.K., and Soga, K. (2005) Fundamentals of soil behavior, Third edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., {{ISBN|9780471463023}}, pages 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles,&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt; where, ultimately, the grains of [[silica]] produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.&lt;ref name=MitchellSoga05/&gt;

==Uses==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[Image:Decomposed granite path.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Decomposed granite path]]
Decomposed granite, as a [[crushed stone]] form, is used as a [[Road surface|pavement]] building material. It is used on [[driveway]]s, [[garden]] [[walkway]]s, [[bocce]] courts and [[pétanque]] terrains, and [[urban park|urban]], [[regional park|regional]], and [[national park]] walkways and heavy-use [[Trail|paths]]. DG can be installed and compacted to meet handicapped accessibility specifications and criteria, such as the ADA standards in the U.S.  Different colors are available based on the various natural ranges available from different quarry sources, and polymeric stabilizers and other additives can be included to change the properties of the natural material. Decomposed granite is also sometimes used as a component of soil mixtures for cultivating [[bonsai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Randy|title=Guidelines For Creating Bonsai Soil|url=http://www.bonsailearningcenter.com/IMAGES/PDF%20Files/Soils.pdf|publisher=Bonsai Learning Center|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Joshua|title=Potting Soils for a Bonsai|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/potting-soils-bonsai-70677.html|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16610">'''Disparate treatment''' is one kind of unlawful [[discrimination]] in [[US labor law]]. In the United States, it means unequal behavior toward someone because of a protected characteristic (e.g. race or gender) under Title VII of the United States [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]]. This contrasts with [[disparate impact]], where an employer applies a neutral rule that treats everyone equally in form, but has a disadvantageous effect on some people of a protected characteristic compared to others.

Title VII prohibits employers from treating applicants or employees differently because of their membership in a [[protected class]]. A '''disparate treatment''' violation is made out when an individual of a protected group is shown to have been singled out and treated less favorably than others similarly situated on the basis of an impermissible criterion under Title VII. The issue is whether the employer's actions were motivated by discriminatory intent. Discriminatory intent can either be shown by direct evidence, or through indirect or circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green]]'', 411 U.S. 792 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title VII, Griggs, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991==
Under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]], a disparate-treatment plaintiff must establish "that the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive" for taking a job-related action.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust]]'', 487 U. S. 977 at 986.&lt;/ref&gt;  This doctrine was read into the act in ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]'', which interpreted the Act to prohibit, in some cases, employers' facially neutral practices that, in fact, are "discriminatory in operation."  The Griggs Court stated that the "touchstone" for disparate-impact liability is the lack of "business necessity": "If an employment practice which operates to exclude [minorities] cannot be shown to be related to [[job performance]], the practice is prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust]]'', 487 U. S. 977 at 986, and at 432 (employer's burden to demonstrate that practice has "a manifest relationship to the employment in question")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody]]'', 422 U. S. 405, 425 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; If an employer met its burden by showing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was required to show a legitimate alternative that would have resulted in less discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody]]'', 422 U. S. 405, 425 (1975) (allowing complaining party to show "that other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also serve the employer's legitimate interest").&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years after Griggs, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] was enacted. The Act included a provision codifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimination.  Under the disparate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie violation by showing that an employer uses "a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;ref name="USC2000"&gt;42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i).&lt;/ref&gt; An employer may defend against liability by demonstrating that the practice is "job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity."&lt;ref name="USC2000"/&gt; Even if the employer meets that burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer's legitimate needs.&lt;ref&gt;42 U. S. C. §§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct method==
Under the direct method, a plaintiff tries to show that his membership in the protected class was a motivating factor in the adverse job action.
:#He may offer direct evidence, e.g. that the defendant admitted that it was motivated by discriminatory intent or that it acted pursuant to a policy that is discriminatory on its face. Direct evidence of discrimination is rarely available, given that most employers do not openly admit that they discriminate. Facially discriminatory policies are only permissible if gender, national origin, or religion is a bona fide occupational qualification for the position in question. Race or color may never be a bona fide occupational qualification.
:#He may offer any of three types of circumstantial evidence:
:::*"suspicious timing, ambiguous statements oral or written, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Troupe v. May Department Stores]]'', 20 F.3d 734, 736 (7th Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;
:::*evidence that other, similarly-situated employees not in the protected class received systematically better treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marshall v. American Hospital Association]]'', 157 F.3d 520 (7th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;
:::*evidence that the plaintiff was qualified for the job, a person not in the protected class got the job, and the employer's stated reason for its decision is unworthy of belief. Id. This type of circumstantial evidence is substantially the same as the evidence required by the McDonnell Douglas method described below.

==Indirect method – burden-shifting==
In the majority of cases, the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of discrimination and must prove discriminatory intent indirectly by inference. The Supreme Court analyzes these cases using the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting formula]]. The analysis is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell Douglas, 411 U. S. at 802-04; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(1) The plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.
:(2) The employer must then articulate, through admissible evidence, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.
:(3) To prevail, the plaintiff must prove that the employer's stated reason is a pretext to hide discrimination.
:In the Seventh Circuit, courts generally analyze disparate treatment cases using this method, though attorneys may also use the direct method described above. 
::*'''Prima facie case''': The elements of the prima facie case are: 
::::(i) The plaintiff is a member of a protected class.
::::(ii) The plaintiff applied and was qualified for the job.
::::(iii) The application was rejected.
::::(iv) The position remained open after the rejection.
::::''[[St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks]]'', 509 U.S. 502, 505-507. In a termination case, the second element is whether the plaintiff was performing up to the employer's legitimate expectations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coco v. Elmwood Care, Inc.]]'', 128 F.3d 1177, 1178 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
::::"The burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. Establishment of a prima facie case creates an inference that the employer acted with discriminatory intent. Id. at 254.  Although establishing a prima facie case used to be fairly routine, the courts have begun scrutinizing the second element of the test more rigorously. See, e.g. ''[[Cengr v. Fusibond Piping Systems, Inc.]]'', 135 F.3d 445 (7th Cir. 1998); ''[[Fisher v. Wayne Dalton Corp.]]'', 139 F.3d 1137 (7th Cir. 1998). It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine whether the plaintiff has stated a prima facie case.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Achor v. Riverside Golf Club]]'', 117 F.3d 339, 340 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
::*'''Employer's burden of production:''' To rebut the inference of discrimination, the employer must articulate, through admissible evidence, a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. The employer's burden is one of production, not persuasion; the ultimate burden of persuasion always remains with the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511.&lt;/ref&gt;
::*'''Plaintiff's proof of pretext:''' Proof that the defendant's asserted reason is untrue permits, but does not require, a finding of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''[[St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks]]'', 509 U.S. at 511; ''[[Anderson v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.]]'', 13 F.3d 1120, 1123 (7th Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh Circuit has held in one case that where the defendant asserts several reasons for its decision, the plaintiff may not normally survive summary judgment by refuting only one of the reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coco v. Elmwood Care, Inc.]]'', 128 F.3d 1177, 1178 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the court held that plaintiff need not rebut all of defendant's reasons but must instead show that defendant's decision was based on a prohibited factor. ''[[Monroe v. Children's Home Association]]'', 128 F.3d 591, 593 (7th Cir. 1997).
:::In addition to producing evidence of the falsity of the employer's proffered reason, the plaintiff may also attempt to prove pretext using: comparative evidence; statistics; or direct evidence of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pollard v. Rea Magnet Wire Co.]]'', 824 F.2d 557, 558 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 977 (1987); Barbara Lindemann and Paul Grossman, 1 Employment Discrimination Law 27 (3d ed. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;
::::'''Comparative evidence:''' Plaintiff may prove pretext by offering evidence that similarly situated employees who are not in the plaintiff's protected group were treated more favorably or did not receive the same adverse treatment. The Seventh Circuit has issued differing opinions on whether the plaintiff's testimony about the comparative employees is sufficient to raise a factual issue and survive summary judgment. For example, in ''[[Collier v. Budd Co.]]'', 66 F.3d 886 (7th Cir. 1995), the employer offered evidence that the younger employees who were retained were better qualified than the plaintiff. In his deposition, the plaintiff disputed that these employees were better qualified. The court said that the resulting credibility decision was best left for the trier of fact, and reversed a summary judgment ruling for the employer. Collier at 893. On the other hand, in ''[[Russell v. Acme-Evans Co.]]'', 51 F.3d 64 (7th Cir. 1995), the court held that the plaintiff's testimony regarding the qualifications of the workers who were given the positions that plaintiff wanted was insufficient to create a factual issue and survive summary judgment given that the employer had stated that they were more qualified.
::::'''Statistics:''' Statistics are admissible in individual disparate treatment cases, but their usefulness depends on their relevance to the specific decision affecting the individual plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann and Grossman, 1 Employment Discrimination Law 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
::::'''Direct evidence:''' Although direct evidence of discrimination can be very powerful, courts often give little weight to discriminatory remarks made by persons other than decision makers, "stray" remarks not pertaining directly to the plaintiffs, or remarks that are distant in time to the disputed employment decision. See, e.g., ''[[McCarthy v. Kemper Life Ins. Cos.]]'', 924 F.2d 683, 687 (7th Cir. 1991) (discriminatory remarks by a fellow employee are not evidence of discriminatory discharge because they were not made by a decision maker and the remarks occurred two years before the discharge); ''[[Cowan v. Glenbrook Security Services, Inc.]]'', 123 F.3d 438, 444 (7th Cir. 1997) ("[S]tray remarks . . . cannot justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or firing or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria. Such remarks . . . when unrelated to the decisional issue process, are insufficient to demonstrate that the employer relied on illegitimate criteria, even when such statements are made by the decision maker").

:'''Instructing the jury:''' If the case goes to a jury, the elaborate McDonnell Douglas formula should not be part of the jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Achor v. Riverside Golf Club]]'', 117 F.3d 339, 340 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate question for the jury is whether the defendant took the actions at issue because of the plaintiff's membership in a protected class.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Achor v. Riverside Golf Club]]'', 117 F.3d 341 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mixed motives==
The plaintiff in a disparate treatment case need only prove that membership in a protected class was a motivating factor in the employment decision, not that it was the sole factor. One's membership in a protected class will be considered a motivating factor when it contributes to the employment decision.  If the employer proves that it had another reason for its actions and it would have made the same decision without the discriminatory factor, it may avoid liability for monetary damages, reinstatement or promotion. The court may still grant the plaintiff declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(i) (overruling in part ''[[Price-Waterhouse v. Hopkins]]'', 490 U.S. 228 (1989)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit has held that in a mixed motives retaliation case, the plaintiff is not entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, or attorneys fees because retaliation is not listed in the mixed motives provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McNutt v. Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois]]'', 141 F.3d 706, (7th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==After-acquired evidence==
If an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee for a discriminatory reason and later discovers a legitimate reason that it can prove would have led it to take the same action, the employer is still liable for the discrimination, but the relief that the employee can recover may be limited. ''[[McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.]]'', 513 U.S. 352 (1995). In general, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement or front pay, and the back pay liability period is limited to the time between the occurrence of the discriminatory act and the date the misconduct justifying the job action is discovered. McKennon, 513 U.S. at 361-62.

==Pattern or practice discrimination==
In class actions or other cases alleging a widespread practice of intentional discrimination, plaintiffs may establish a prima facie case using statistical evidence instead of comparative evidence pertaining to each class member.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teamsters v. United States]]'', 431 U.S. 324 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiffs often combine the statistical evidence with anecdotal or other evidence of discriminatory treatment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[EEOC v. O &amp; G Spring &amp; Wire Forms Specialty Co.]]'', 38 F.3d 872, 874-75 (7th Cir. 1994) (plaintiff's statistical evidence was corroborated by anecdotal evidence and hiring records).&lt;/ref&gt; The employer can rebut the prima facie case by introducing alternative statistics or by demonstrating that plaintiff's proof is either inaccurate or insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;''Teamsters'', 431 U.S. at 339-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff then bears the burden of proving that the employer's information is biased, inaccurate, or otherwise unworthy of credence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coates v. Johnson &amp; Johnson]]'', 756 F.2d 524, 544 (7th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast to disparate impact==
A violation of Title VII can be shown in two separate and distinct ways.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''[[Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust]]'', 487 U.S. 977 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative to a "disparate treatment" theory is a "disparate impact" theory. A disparate impact violation is when an employer is shown to have used a specific employment practice, neutral on its face but that caused a substantial adverse impact to a protected group, and cannot be justified as serving a legitimate business goal for the employer.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio]]'', 490 U.S. 642 (1989) (like the analytical proof structure under the disparate treatment theory, the burden of showing disparate impact always remains with the plaintiff and the employer has only the burden of production, on the issue of business justification, once a prima facie case has been established).&lt;/ref&gt; No proof of intentional discrimination is necessary.

==Fair Housing Act==
The disparate treatment theory has application also in the housing context under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also known as the [[Fair Housing Act]].  The Fair Housing Act prohibits disparate treatment in the housing market due to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, family status, and disability.  The [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] enforces this law.  It receives and investigates any discrimination complaints that are filed.

'''Environmental cleanup laws'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!-- This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; govern the removal of [[pollution]] or [[contaminant]]s from environmental media such as [[soil]], [[sediment]], [[surface water]], or [[ground water]]. Unlike pollution control laws, cleanup laws are designed to respond after-the-fact to environmental contamination, and consequently must often define not only the necessary response actions, but also the parties who may be responsible for undertaking (or paying for) such actions. Regulatory requirements may include rules for emergency response, liability allocation, site assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial action, post-remedial monitoring, and site reuse.&lt;section end=overview /&gt;

Different laws may govern the cleanup or remediation of varying environmental media. Spill response or cleanup requirements may be enacted as stand-alone laws, or as parts of larger laws focused on a specific environmental medium or pollutant.

== Emergency response and prevention ==

{{Further|Oil spill}}
{{Further|Chemical accident}}

Environmental cleanup laws may contain requirements for identifying and responding to [[Environmental emergency|environmental emergencies]]. In such cases, laws may define when immediate response actions are required, or criteria by which a regulatory agency may make such a determination.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., US EPA materials on [http://cfpub.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/cleanup/rcra/index.cfm?action=main.category&amp;id=1381 Imminent and Substantial Endangerment] under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] and [[CERCLA]].&lt;/ref&gt; Immediate response actions may be required, for example, when a release of a pollutant into the environment poses an immediate threat to human health or ecological values. Events such as oil spills and large-scale chemical releases often trigger emergency response actions.

== Environmental remediation ==

{{Main|environmental remediation}}

Environmental remediation is the process of physically removing, treating, or isolating pollutants in environmental media. Environmental cleanup laws may contain specific requisite remediation protocols, or may contain standards and processes by which a regulatory agency may determine an appropriate remedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10713">[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Executive Order 12333 was signed by President Ronald Reagan on December 4, 1981.]]
'''Executive Order 12333''', signed on December 4, 1981 by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], was an [[Executive Order (United States)|Executive Order]] intended to extend powers and responsibilities of [[United States intelligence community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] and direct the leaders of U.S. federal agencies to co-operate fully with [[CIA]] requests for information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ronald Reagan, [https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html "Executive Order 12333—United States Intelligence Activities,"] ''US Federal Register,'' Dec. 4, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This executive order was titled ''United States Intelligence Activities''.

It was amended by [[Executive Order 13355|Executive Order 13355: Strengthened Management of the Intelligence Community]], on August 27, 2004.  On July 30, 2008, [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13470]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-13470.htm |title=Executive Order 13470 |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the [[Director of National Intelligence|DNI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-Intelligence-Rules.html "Bush Orders Intelligence Overhaul", by [[Associated Press]], July 31, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080731-2.html Executive Order: Further Amendments to Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities], ''[[White House]]'', July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part 1 ==
"Goals, Direction, Duties and Responsibilities with Respect to the National Intelligence Effort" lays out roles for various intelligence agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and Treasury.

== Part 2 ==
"Conduct of Intelligence Activities" provides guidelines for actions of intelligence agencies.

=== Collection of Information ===
Part 2.3  permits collection, retention and dissemination of the following types of information along with several others.

{{quote|(c) Information obtained in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, international narcotics or international terrorism investigation

. . .

(i) Incidentally obtained information that may indicate involvement in activities that may violate federal, state, local or foreign laws&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

=== Proscription on assassination ===
Part 2.11 of this executive order reiterates a proscription on US intelligence agencies sponsoring or carrying out an assassination. It reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html |title=Executive Orders |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previously, [[Executive Order 11905|EO 11905]] (Gerald Ford) had banned political assassinations and [[EO 12036]] (Jimmy Carter) had further banned indirect U.S. involvement in assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;CRS Report for Congress Assassination Ban and E.O. 12333: A Brief Summary January 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1998, this proscription against assassination was reinterpreted, and relaxed, for targets who are classified by the United States as connected to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;

==Impact==
Executive Order 12333 has been regarded by the American intelligence community as a fundamental document authorizing the expansion of data collection activities.&lt;ref name=Ackerman&gt;Spencer Ackerman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/nsa-surveillance-government-privacy-board-report?CMP=ema_565 "NSA Reformers Dismayed after Privacy Board Vindicates Surveillance Dragnet: Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Endorses Agency's So-called '702' Powers, Plus Backdoor Searches of Americans' Information"], '[[The Guardian]]'' (London), July 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The document has been employed by the [[National Security Agency]] as legal authorization for its collection of unencrypted information flowing through the [[data center]]s of internet communications giants [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref name=Ackerman /&gt;

In July 2014 chairman David Medine and two other members of the [[Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board]], a government oversight agency, indicated a desire to review Executive Order 12333 in the near future, according to a report by journalist Spencer Ackerman of ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Ackerman /&gt;

In July 2014, former State Department official [[John Tye (whistleblower)|John Tye]] published an editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', citing his prior access to classified material on intelligence-gathering activities under Executive Order 12333, and arguing that the order represented a significant threat to Americans' privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web | last = Farivar | first = Cyrus | title = Meet John Tye: the kinder, gentler, and by-the-book whistleblower |publisher= [[Ars Technica]] | date = August 20, 2014 | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/meet-john-tye-the-kinder-gentler-and-by-the-book-whistleblower/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act''' of 2009, or '''FERA''', {{USStatute|111|21|123|1617|2009|05|20|S|386}}, is a [[public law]] in the United States enacted in 2009. The law enhanced criminal enforcement of federal [[fraud]] laws, especially regarding [[financial institution]]s, [[mortgage fraud]], and [[securities fraud]] or commodities fraud.

{{wikisource|Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009}}

==Legislative history==
[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Patrick Leahy]] of [[Vermont]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and the chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], sponsored the bill.

On April 27, 2009, the Senate invoked [[cloture]] on the bill as amended (S. 386) on an 84–4 vote, with eleven not voting. Only four Senators voted no, all [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] ([[Tom Coburn]], [[Jim DeMint]], [[James Inhofe]], and [[Jon Kyl]]).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00170 Roll Call #170]." On the Cloture Motion (Motion to Invoke Cloture on the Committee Substitute to S. 386). [[111th United States Congress]], 1st Session. [[United States Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, the Senate passed the bill on a 92–4 vote, with three not voting; the same Senators who voted against cloture voted against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00171 Roll Call #171]." On Passage of the Bill (S. 386 as Amended). [[111th United States Congress]], 1st Session. [[United States Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the bill with its own amendment on a 367–59 vote, with six Representatives not voting and one Representative, Democrat [[Alan Grayson]] of [[Florida]], voting [[Abstention|present]]. All 250 Democrats casting votes, as well as 117 Republicans, voted yes; all of the 59 no votes were cast by Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll235.xml Roll Call #235]" (On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended - Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act). [[111th United States Congress]], 1st Session. [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate then added an amendment to the House's amendment. The House accepted the final version of the bill on a 338–52 vote on May 18, with 43 Representatives not voting. All 224 Democrats casting votes, as well as 114 Republicans, voted yes. Fifty-two Republicans voted no.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll268.xml Roll Call #268]" (Suspend Rules and Agree to S Adt to House Adts - Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act). [[111th United States Congress]], 1st Session. [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed the legislation into law on May 20 along with the [[Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009]], a bill concerned with mortgage foreclosure prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Protecting Homeowners, Protecting the Economy | author = White House Press Office | date = May 20, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-24 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Protecting-Homeowners-Protecting-the-Economy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amendments to fraud statutes ==
The Act changes the definition of a ''financial institution'' for the purposes of Federal criminal law to include ''mortgage lending businesses'', which are defined as "organizations which finance or refinance any debt secured by an interest in real estate, including private mortgage companies and any subsidiaries of such organizations, and whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce."  {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1014}}, which makes it a [[federal offense]] to falsify loan documents submitted to a broad range of financial institutions, is amended to include mortgage lending businesses in that range, and for good measure also includes any other person "that makes in whole or in part a federally related mortgage loan".&lt;ref&gt;FERA, section 2, subsections (a) through (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime of major fraud against the United States ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|1031}}), which previously covered only fraud in government procurement and contracts for services, is amended to include a wider range of government involvement, including grants under the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], transactions under the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]], and any "other form of Federal assistance".&lt;ref&gt;FERA, subsection (2)(d)&lt;/ref&gt;  FERA amends the definition of [[securities fraud]], {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1348}}, to include fraud related to [[commodities]] [[Futures contract|futures]] and [[option (finance)|option]]s in addition to the existing category of registered securities under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;FERA, subsection (2)(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the Act defines ''proceeds'' in the [[money laundering]] statute ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|1956}}) as "any property derived from or obtained or retained, directly or indirectly, through some form of unlawful activity, including the gross receipts of such activity".&lt;ref&gt;FERA, subsection (2)(f)&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, the term was left undefined, and was interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Santos]]'' by a plurality of the justices as excluding gross receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = United States v. Santos: "Proceeds" in Federal Criminal Money Laundering Statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1956, Means "Profits," Not "Gross Receipts" | author = M.

Sec. 1956, 1957) to correct an erroneous Supreme Court decision in 2008 that significantly weakened these statutes. In ''[[United States v. Santos]]'', the Supreme Court misinterpreted the money laundering statutes, limiting their scope to only the `profits' of crimes, rather than the `proceeds' of the offenses. 128 S. Ct. 2020 (2008). The Court's decision was contrary to Congressional intent and will lead to criminals escaping culpability simply by claiming their illegal scams did not make any profit. | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp111&amp;sid=cp11123vD4&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=sr010.111&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_6455&amp; | date = March 23, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-26 | author = Senate Judiciary Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Sense of the Congress" section suggests that senior prosecutors, such as a [[United States Attorney]] or superior, should be involved before certain kinds of money-laundering cases are instigated, and directs the [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] to deliver a yearly report on such cases for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;FERA subsection (2)(g)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authorization for additional funding ==
Section 3 of the Act authorizes additional funding to detect and prosecute fraud at various federal agencies, specifically:
* [[United States dollar|$]]165,000,000 to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]],
* $30,000,000 each to the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Postal Inspection Service]] and the Office of the [[Inspector General]] at the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] [http://www.hudoig.gov (HUD/OIG)]
* $20,000,000 to the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]
* $21,000,000 to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]

These authorizations are made for the federal [[fiscal year]]s beginning October 1, 2009 and 2010, after which point they expire, and are in addition to the previously authorized budgets for these agencies.&lt;ref&gt;FERA section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== False Claims Act restatement ==
{{main|False Claims Act}}

Section 4 of FERA restates part of the [[False Claims Act]], to "reflect the original intent of the law".  This amendment is in reaction to the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', in which the Court held that the mere involvement of Federal money was insufficient to bring a fraudulent claim or invoice within the scope of the False Claims Act.  The amended subsection (a) of {{UnitedStatesCode|31|3729}} effectively reverses the ''Allison Engine'' decision, weakening the requirement to "a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim", where a ''claim'' includes "any request or demand" related to a government program and which will be paid from funds supplied by the government.&lt;ref&gt;FERA, section 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Report 111-10, part III: "This section amends the FCA to clarify and correct erroneous interpretations of the law that were decided in ''[[Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2123 (2008), and ''United States ex. rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp'', 380 F.3d 488 (D.C. Cir. 2004)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ==
Finally, section 5 of the Act created the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], a legislative commission with each house of the [[United States Congress]] represented by three members appointed by the majority party and two members appointed by the minority, none of whom may be employees of the Federal government or any state or local government. The purpose of the commission is "to examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States."

'''Fugitive dust''' is an environmental [[air quality]] term that refers to very small [[particle]]s suspended in [[Earth's atmosphere|the air]], the source of which is primarily the Earth's [[soil]]. It does not include [[particulates|particulate matter]] from other common sources, such as vehicle exhaust or smokestacks. Fugitive dust particles are mainly [[minerals]] common to soil, including [[silicon oxide]]s, [[aluminium]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]]. About half of fugitive dust particles are larger than 10 [[micrometre|microns]] in [[particle size|diameter]] and settle more quickly than the smaller particles.{{r|fdc}} The term is used to denote that the dust "escapes" into the atmosphere rather than being exhausted in a "confined flow stream" from a "ducted emitter" (an [[exhaust pipe]] or [[chimney]]).{{r|anf1}}

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimated that fugitive dust was responsible for 92% of the [[PM-10]] emissions in the United States in 1995.{{r|sh}}

==Sources==
[[File:121127-M-EF955-151 (8245266781).jpg|thumb|Fugitive dust from military helicopters]]
[[File:DustWorkerStreet.jpg|thumb|Fugitive dust from construction in a city]]
[[File:Fendt tractor raising dust.jpg|thumb|Fugitive dust from agriculture]]
Fugitive dust results from dry conditions where there is insufficient moisture content in the ground to hold the soil together. Particulate matter (PM) then enters the atmosphere through the action of wind, vehicular movement, or other activities.{{r|az1}}

Areas with dry or desert climates, especially when combined with high winds, have more severe problems of fugitive dust. Dry and disturbed surfaces can release wind-borne fugitive dust for many months before there is sufficient rainfall to coagulate the soil. Surfaces susceptible to fugitive dust emissions are both natural and man-made.{{r|az1}}

Specific sources include open fields and parking lots, paved and unpaved roads, agricultural fields, construction sites, unenclosed storage piles, and material transfer systems.{{r|awm}}

Surface mining operations are also sources of fugitive dust as a result of many mining operations including [[haul road]]s, [[tailings|tailing]] piles, drilling, blasting, the removal of [[overburden]] and the actual mineral extraction.{{r|bm1}}

In 1995, 28 percent of fugitive dust in the US originated from unpaved roads, 23 percent from construction sites, 19 percent agricultural, 15 percent from paved roads, 5 percent from wind erosion, 1 percent from mining according to the EPA.{{r|sh}}

==Effects==
The inhalation of PM by people introduces it into the lungs where it can cause respiratory illnesses, permanent lung damage, and in some individuals premature death.{{r|az1}} PM with diameters of ≤10 micrometers (PM10) can harm human health, with particles of ≤2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) being the worst.{{r|abem}}

As wind-borne dust can easily migrate, respiratory irritation can occur in construction and agricultural workers close to a source as well as others including wildlife.{{r|npt1}} In addition to adverse health affects, the abrasive nature of particulate matter can cause property damage{{r|chn1}} and obscure visibility leading to vehicular collisions causing injury and death.{{r|ads1}}

Fugitive dust can also harm plant life. In 1999, the [[National Park Service]] found that [[lichen]] and other [[non-vascular plant]]s in the [[Cape Krusenstern National Monument]] in [[Alaska]] were affected due to dust generated from hauling ore from the [[Red Dog mine]] along a {{convert|19|mi}} road within the monument. A follow-up study in 2006 found slightly elevated levels of [[lead]] and [[cadmium]] concentrations in small birds and [[voles]] captured along the road.{{r|npt1}}

A lawsuit in 2011 filed by 150 [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]], [[Hawaii]] residents alleges that their homes were subjected, "on almost a daily basis", to blown "pesticide-laden fugitive dust". The residents claimed their homes sustained physical damage and they were forced to live with their windows closed year-round. They were seeking monetary damages from [[DuPont Pioneer]] to compensate for the reduced value of their homes and suggested future lawsuits would address health issues.{{r|gi1}}

A 2017 lawsuit in [[Maryland]] claims that fugitive dust from a {{convert|215|ft|adj=on}}-high pile of [[coal dust]] at a coal processing plant has caused "extensive damage" through erosion to blades on [[wind turbine]]s in a nearby [[wind farm]].{{r|chn1}}

==Measurement==
One of the first methods of measuring fugitive dust was developed in the 1970s and used [[wikt:isokinetic|isokinetic]] dust samplers. At least six samplers were needed downstream of a dust source. Exposure profiling was developed later and used in the 1980s and 1990s. Later improvements use time-resolved dust monitors to  isolate short-term dust releases. New methods include Optical Remote Sensing which uses an open path laser transmissometer used with time-resolved dust monitors and other wind monitors.{{r|abem}}

==Prevention==
Various methods are employed to minimize fugitive dust. In agricultural settings, bare soil can be covered with crop residue or planted with cover crops between seasons. Dirt roads can be sprayed with water to contain dust, or stabilized with chemicals that form hard surface crusts, or paved with aggregate or a hard surface. In windy areas, wind barriers including fences or vegetation can reduce wind speed and trap larger particles already in the air. Irrigation can be used to keep soil moist between natural rainfalls.{{r|az1}}

Fugitive dust can be controlled by the application of various chemical suppressants including [[lignin sulfonate]]s, petroleum resins, [[latex]]es, salts, plastics, and wetting agents.{{r|bm1}}

Coal dust piles have been treated with water or other chemical [[surfactant]]s to suppress dust until the moisture evaporates. Other chemicals can provide protection for up to six months. Wind fences of polyester fabric can also be used to slow wind movement and minimize fugitive dust.{{r|power1}}

==Regulation==
The US state of [[Arizona]] has an Agricultural Dust Program with compliance officers that inspect agricultural operations and investigate dust complaints. All farms in the state must take "reasonable precautions" to "minimize" the emission of fugitive dust. More stringent procedures must be followed in areas that don't meet [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] air quality standards.{{r|az2|ads1}}

The US Federal [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has specific standards for daily average particulate matter originating from active mines. Finer particulates have been detected up to {{convert|20|km}} from mining operations.{{r|smc}}

==Other types==
Dust emitted from processing equipment that may not contain typical soil components is also considered fugitive dust. In this context, fugitive dust is dust that has "escaped" during any mechanical process and entered the atmosphere. Fugitive dust emissions within a structure can not only cause respiratory problems but, when generated during the processing of combustible materials, can cause fire and blast damage if ignited.{{r|ded}}

Fugitive dust acquires an electronic charge when dispersed in the air. Spraying an oppositely charged water fog can be used to effectively control dust in an industrial setting. If so charged, less water is needed to cause the particulate matter to drop from the air. This method has been tested with many materials including [[silica]] flour, [[sulfur dioxide]], and [[fly ash]].{{r|ecf}}

The '''Gatsby Charitable Foundation''' is an endowed grant-making trust, based in [[London]], founded by [[David Sainsbury]] in 1967. The organisation is one of the [[Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts]], set up to provide funding for charitable causes. Although the organisation is permitted in its [[Trust deed (real estate)|Trust Deed]] to make general grants within this broad area, its activities have generally been restricted to a limited number of fields. At the time of writing, these fields are:

* Science and Engineering Education
* Plant science
* Neuroscience
* Poverty alleviation in Africa
* The arts
* Public policy

However, these categories may change from time to time. 

Amongst its activities, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation funds the [[Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/ |title=Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit |publisher=Gatsby.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University College London]], the [[Sainsbury Management Fellowship]]s, the [[Institute for Government]] based in [[Carlton House Terrace]], and the [[Sainsbury Laboratory]]. It has long funded the [[Centre for Mental Health]] but is mostly withdrawing that funding in 2010. More recently, the foundation has become a co-sponsor of the [[University Technical College]]s programme, in conjunction with the [[Baker Dearing Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utcolleges.org/about/our-sponsors/ |title=University Technical Colleges |publisher=Utcolleges.org |date=2012-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619033128/http://www.utcolleges.org/about/our-sponsors/ |archivedate=2012-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entwurf eines Cannabiskontrollgesetzes''' (CannKG) ("design of a cannabis control law") is a proposed descheduling of [[cannabis]] from [[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]], the federal controlled substances law in Germany. The issue was proposed by [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (the German Green Party). It would regulate cannabis in a manner similar to alcohol, with adults 18 years old permitted to buy and possess up to 30 grams in regulated stores.&lt;ref name=Spiegel2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Welt2015/&gt;

'''Ilbe Storage''' ({{korean|hangul=일베저장소|rr=Ilbe Jeojangso}}), also known as '''ILBE''' ({{lang|ko|일베}}), is a right-wing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2017/07/682_232434.html|title=Death threats put K-pop stars in danger|date=4 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; website based in [[South Korea]]. The site, created in April 2010, began as a collection of the "daily popular" posts from the BBS of South Korean social website [[DC Inside]]. This gave the site its name Ilbe, which is short for Ilgan Best, Korean for popular daily. As of February 2017, it is the most popular [[Internet humor]] site in South Korea by daily traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rankey.com/rank/rank_site_cate.php?cat1_id=13&amp;cat2_id=1372&amp;cat3_id=1373 Rankey 유머/재미 카테고리 순위] 2013.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140604000915|title=2PM Chansung sued by ultra-right online community site|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=4 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ilbe subculture ==
Ilbe's userbase has strong right tendencies. The website has very few rules, but it does prohibit users from mentioning each other by their username or getting too close to each other, in order to prevent new users or dissenters from being down-voted indiscriminately by existing users. This policy has effectively made everyone more anonymous (and equal), in contrast with other popular Korean forums where the old users are more respected and hold greater authority during discussions. The forums are largely unmoderated, with exceptions made for cases that may result in litigation or cases in response to complaints.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The lack of moderation, however, does result in problematic behaviors such as [[defamation]] or [[harassment]], which are criminal under Korean Law. The website routinely comes under criticism for its users' actions, the most notable of which was the Korea Communications Standards Commission's request that Ilbe regulate problematic contents that are harmful for teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news1.kr/articles/1426126] 'Ilbe is advised to enhance teenager protection activity by KCSC' (News1)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the website has been praised for its anonymity and free spirit: a spokesman of [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] mentioned Ilbe as "free space where innocent people can speak their minds freely".&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=10178596] (Joongang Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of Ilbe's subculture comes from the users' collective identity as "losers" of a sort: until the founding of Ilbe, most of the large community forums on the Korean web were left-leaning to an extent where anyone with even a moderate right-wing opinion had to endure ridicule and name-calling by the majority including the moderators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Thus, Ilbe's userbase has embraced many of the derogatory terms used by the left to show pride in their dissent. Due to their vocal users and strong political/cultural influence, Ilbe has gained widespread attention by social critics, with some labeling the website a social phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economy.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201305/e2013053019344696930.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212175255/http://economy.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201305/e2013053019344696930.htm |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }} Newspaper editorial 'The Ilbe phenomenon and ideological [[populism]]' written by Hwang Yong-seok, Professor of Konkook University (Seoul Economy Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[
http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201306042217105&amp;code=940202] 'The cause of Ilbe phenomenon is... expressing anxiety, feeling betrayed, anger from difficult life as amusement' (Kyunghyang Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[
http://www.naeil.com/news_view/?id_art=86391] 'To understand Ilbe phenomenon' by journalist Kim Joo-eon (Naeil Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; and some critics consider Ilbe a Korean analogue of [[4chan]] and [[2channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/media/585308.html]'How to deal with troll websites like Ilbe' written by Hwang Yong-seok, Professor of Konkook University (Hankyoreh)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a vocal minority of the users engage in questionable behavior both online and offline, the website has largely negative connotation, especially with the political left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2012110211481048862&amp;outlink=1] Money Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1001647616] SBS News&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the users tend not to reveal their identity as an Ilbe user in the real world to prevent themselves from being [[ostracize]]d. The term "Ilming-out" ({{lang|ko|일밍아웃}}), which is a [[portmanteau]] of "Ilbe" and "Coming out (of the closet)", describes a disclosure as an Ilbe user to the general public, and is avoided. Having to resort to more discreet measures to display their identity, Ilbe users use a hand sign that represents the Korean initials of the website's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20131204000330&amp;md=20131209164300_AT] Psychologist Hwang Sang-min said "It's a kind of play, to secretly reveal their participation in Ilbe which is not justifiable in society, and gain reputation among them." (Herald Economy News)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Ilbe's political stance generally ranges from right to far-right,&lt;ref name="동경"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.khan.co.kr/khnm.html?mode=view&amp;artid=201206131132341&amp;code=115|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[표지이야기]그들은 왜 보수우파를 동경하게 되었나&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=주간경향|author=정용인|date=2012-06-19|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ilbe has raised controversy for its strong opinions, mainly from the left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmaker.khan.co.kr/khnm.html?mode=view&amp;code=115&amp;artid=201206131132381&amp;pt=nv &lt;nowiki&gt;[표지이야기]&lt;/nowiki&gt;온라인 극우파 결집 코드는 ‘혐오’] 주간경향 2012.06.19&lt;/ref&gt;

In parliamentary inspection held in October 2013, member of [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2011)|Democratic Party]] Yu Seung-hui criticized Ilbe's antisocial aspect. He released the information from Korean Communications Standards Commission, hundreds of submitted complaints about harmful contents in Ilbe like suicide, crime, drug, sexism, violence, as well as defamation and discrimination against left-wing politics and [[Jeolla]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201310152236385&amp;code=940202] 'Ilbe, excess of antisocial contents like drugs and organ trafficking' (Kyunghyang Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shin Hye-sik, representative of right-wing online press ''Dokrip Newspaper'' said "(Ilbe users) should make an apology for problematic claims". Kim Young-hwan, former pro-NK activist and a convert to the right now, said "Right-wing is an attitude to inherit conservative awareness, but in this criteria Ilbe is not right-wing. Ilbe's radical argument will escalate social chaos". Yoon Pyong-joong, right-wing professor of Hanshin University defined Ilbe's far-right extremism as "Isn't worth saying at all". They shared the understanding that Ilbe should be criticized by public argument, not by legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.khan.co.kr/khnm.html?mode=view&amp;code=113&amp;artid=201305281106011] Ilbe from right-wing prospect, 'It's a kind of disease, More than senselessness' (Weekly Kyunghyang)&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative monthly magazine 'Shindonga' released a special section to criticize Ilbe as 'close to fascism rather than normal right-wing' and 'antisocial'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shindonga.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2013/06/18/201306180500014/201306180500014_1.html] 'Ilbe, a mutant monster who tickles fascism within us' Shindonga July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese journalist Yasuda Goichi, the author of ''The Internet and Patriotism'' (Netto to Aikoku) diagnosed Ilbe as similar to anti-[[Zainichi]] association, one of Japanese cyber far-right group ([[Uyoku dantai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201306/h2013060321175221950.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719004235/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201306/h2013060321175221950.htm |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }} 'Ilbe resembles anti-Zainichi association... maybe a phenomenon which revealed many Korean's heart' (Hankook Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegedly criticizing former president Roh Moo-Hyun ===
The Ilbe Community is mainly known by citizens for allegedly making fun of former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]]. The political parties have declared a war against the Ilbe Community, as they have been consecutively criticizing Roh Mu-Hyeon, and other political leaders through many forms of media, such as making jokes, [[parody music]] containing criticisms and people's discontent against political leaders such as [[Park Geun-hye]] and North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]], and spreading rumors on social media. Users make an Ilbe "theme song" every year, and they regularly parody popular songs with lyrics that criticize the leaders. Ilbe users compose their parody songs as a propaganda that attracts people who coincidentally listen to their songs, to join the community. Users are trying to add a sense of humor to their songs, such as exaggerating expressions of political leaders and colloquially referring them as "MC Muhyeon", "DJ Daejung", "MC Jong-Un" and "MC Geunhye".This makes their songs sound legitimate in some ways.
Recently, following up the uprising criticisms and hostility against the Ilbe Community, Korean celebrities who accidentally use Ilbe terminology on social media make people misunderstand them as an Ilbe member. As a result, comic artists and companies are adding caution to their productions to avoid being misunderstood as an Ilbe member.

=== Denial of Gwangju riot ===
Although the South Korean government, judiciary and legislature officially concluded that the [[Gwangju Uprising]] was a justified civil movement by passing a special law, (also confirmed by [[UNESCO]] who registered records of the Gwangju Uprising as [[UNESCO World Heritage]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/human-rights-documentary-heritage-1980-archives-for-the-may-18th-democratic-uprising-against-military-regime-in-gwangju-republic-of-korea/] UNESCO World Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; Ilbe is propagating unverified conspiracy theories about Korean democratization.

The May 18 Memorial Foundation (5.18 기념재단), one of the Gwangju Uprising memorial organizations, announced that Ilbe is spreading questionable information like,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2013/05/21/0200000000AKR20130521117800054.HTML] '4 types of distorting 5.18 Gwangju Democratize Movement' (Yonhap News)&lt;/ref&gt;
*North Korean special forces were involved in the Gwangju Uprising.
*The Gwangju Uprising was a heavily armed riot.
*Military suppression against citizens was justifiable.
*The 5.18 Special Law (5.18특별법), which pays respect to the Gwangju Uprising, is unconstitutional.

Claims similar to Ilbe's were denied by the government multiple times. The Minister of National Defense, Kim Gwan-jin, dismissed the allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization as 'groundless'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201305/h2013053015191921950.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530155916/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201305/h2013053015191921950.htm |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }} 'Kim Kwan-jin confirms the involvement of North Korean special forces in 5.18 uprising is not true' (Hankook iNews)&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean Communications Standards Commission decided to take disciplinary action against the right-wing television news programs, 'TV Chosun' and 'Channel A', which made allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisainlive.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=16787] 'KCSC gives a hard blow to TV Chosun and Channel A' (SisaIN News)&lt;/ref&gt; It was accused of "both defamation and spreading false information".

In November 2013, the [[Daegu]] District Court dismissed a similar case of defamation against Gwangju Uprising victims, committed by 10 members of Jeonsamo (a [[Chun Doo-hwan]] fan group). Although they were found not guilty, the judge explained that their claim was insufficient to be considered defamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201310301425401&amp;code=940301] Kyunghyang Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

Even journalist Cho Gap-je, who was on the scene in Gwangju, admitted that the Gwangju Uprising was a righteous anti-communism democratic movement in his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.kr/news/article.html?no=5030 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216181859/http://www.independent.co.kr/news/article.html?no=5030 |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }} Dokrip News&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering all these, Ilbe uses the word 'democratization' in a negative sense, similar in meaning to "thumbs down". However, various users of Ilbe claim that the seemingly inappropriate use of the word is just a mockery of the left wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/1036662|title=''민주화''에 ''운지''까지…십대 파고드는 ''일베語''|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wide opposition to left-wing politics ===
Ilbe's opinions are expressed as strong opposition to left wing parties, political figures and supporters, alongside indiscriminate labeling of the South Korean left wing as pro-communism, pro-North Korea, pro-socialism, and anti-South Korean.

Ilbe also labels some journalist like former chief editor of Monthly Chosun Cho Gap-je as "좌빨" (Far-left communist) due to his support of the Gwangju Uprising as a justifiable movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=11577790&amp;cloc=olink|article|default] Cho Gap-je bashed from Ilbe (Joongang Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/588681.html] Causeless 'red-hunting' of Ilbe (Hankyoreh)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though former president Roh Mu-hyun and Kim Dae-jung used [[neoliberal]] economic policies, and came under criticism from the left-wing for their conservative stance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=60090604160957] Pressian&lt;/ref&gt; Ilbe considers both to be 'communists' due to their conciliatory attitude toward North Korea in economy and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201305/h20130529033054121990.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811190535/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201305/h20130529033054121990.htm |archivedate=2013-08-11 |df= }} Hankook iNews Opinion&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hatred of the Jeolla region ===
A sizable part of Ilbe users have an intense disliking for the [[Jeolla region]] in the southwestern portion of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=60025] 'Cyber specter who tickles regionalism' (Sisa Journal)&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to several factors, including the fact that Jeolla province had a staggering 98% vote for a regional (left-wing) party candidate [[Kim Dae-jung]], and their belief that the [[Gwangju Uprising]] has been placed on a pedestal by the locals, to the extent that all other moments in the history of Korean democratisation are overlooked, and that it was not a democratization uprising or movement, but simply a riot. The intense disliking manifests itself as verbal attack against Jeolla and related political figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.donga.com/3/all/20130619/55959333/1]'"Eliminate all communists" to the classmate from Jeolla province' (Dong-a Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
Ilbe users show protests to different issues of the country, and they end up doing mass protests and singing Ilbe songs in city squares. Many Ilbe users ended up in court for degrading the public order. On November 28, 2013, there was a first trial of defamation committed by Ilbe user who injured the honor of Gwangju Uprising victims by disparaging their corpse photo as 'Skate(fish) parcel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2013/11/28/0702000000AKR20131128163300054.HTML] Yonhap News&lt;/ref&gt; Offender claimed that he feels sorry for his crime and he sent such apology to the victims by phone call, but the organizations related to Gwangju Uprising victims said there was no such apology. Offender requested the jurisdictional transfer of his case from [[Gwangju]] District Court to Daegu District Court and it was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131212145935/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201312/h2013121115164022000.htm] Hankook iNews&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2013, 32-year-old male Ilbe user pushed ahead sandwich-man protest in front of Ewha Women's University. He was hanging a cardboard on his neck filled with sentences like insulting Ewha University students, [[comfort women]], other Korean women, and their genitals, sexually. Also there were words like 'such women are communists and Pro-North Korea'. He was charged 1.5 million won of penalty from Seoul West Prosecutor's Office, but he blamed his guilt as 'wrong democracy'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/Show.asp?IDX=2655773] Nocut News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[
http://news1.kr/articles/1341740] News1&lt;/ref&gt;

Seoul Central District Court accepted the provisidonal injunction against Ilbe. It was petitioned by an Ilbe critic who was degraded and threatened from Ilbe user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201310/h2013101721094521950.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212223956/http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/society/201310/h2013101721094521950.htm |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }} Hankook iNews&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Ilbe was forced to delete some antisocial contents.

On November 7, 2013, former first lady [[Lee Hui-ho]], whose husband was former president [[Kim Dae-jung]] accused some Ilbe users of degrading deceased president Kim by spreading false information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=60131107153842] Lady Lee accuses Ilbe users of degrading former president Kim Dae-Jung (Pressian)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2017, Gi Maeng-gi, author of the [[Naver]] webtoon ''My ID is Gangnam Beauty'', sued an Ilbe member for making malicious posts about her on the site.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/UsCV1&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Seoul Police Agency raided Ilbe Storehouse's with servers secured after securing warrant for search of membership informations and records on basis of violation of sexual violence law due to postings of content such as spycam porn, private pictures that may or may not contain nudity among other charges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20181122077100004?input=1195m&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible misdemeanor ===
In April 2013, After [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] Korea released the member list of [[Uriminzokkiri]], Ilbe users witchhunted massive identities from the list as 'communist' and 'North Korean spies'.

A pre-service elementary teacher who depicted female elementary school students as "로린이" (Lolita girl) and wrote his experience of prostitution on Ilbe caused controversy. This was ended by giving up his appointment by himself. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/view/345582/?sc=naver] Dailian&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Seoul National University Student Council's protesting declaration against 2013 South Korea Election Meddling Scandal, Ilbe user released the photos of some members as an opposition and mentioned 'I don't care whether you guys lynch them or not'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etoday.co.kr/news/section/newsview.php?idxno=751218] eToday News&lt;/ref&gt; Seoul National University Student Council said they're considering lawsuit against Ilbe.

The website has also raised controversy by mocking the early death of boy-band singer [[Ulala Session|Lim Yoon-taek]] from stomach cancer and former president [[Roh Moo-hyun]]&lt;ref&gt;The Korea Herald/ANN [http://my.news.yahoo.com/korean-singer-plagued-even-death-malicious-internet-comments-040002808.html Korean singer plagued even in death by malicious Internet comments] 13 February 2013 "Hateful online comments toward the late singer Lim Yoon-taek - who died Monday from gastric cancer - started to emerge on Tuesday, debasing Lim's premature death. On humor website Daily Best (Ilgan Best), a netizen posted a picture of Lim's wife with comments "My husband passed away. I was paid 1 billion won." This appears to be a parody of a life insurance commercial that depicts a wife being paid insurance money after her husband dies. Another posting from the Daily Best featured a picture of the late former President Roh Moo-hyun welcoming Lim. In the picture Roh tells Lim, "You're new. Sing me a song." Each posting received more than 500 "likes" on the website, which is notorious for crudeness among its members."&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2013, student of Kangwon Provincial College who is self-claimed Ilbe user uploaded Twitter which contains sexual harassment on female buddhist monk's virginity. Three days later, the monk Hyo-jeon asked for follow-up action to the president of the college. But Ilbe user didn't apologize his crime and kept insulting her. After controversy he deleted his Twitter account and this is ended with an official apology from the president of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkdifferent.tistory.com/7129 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213002359/http://thinkdifferent.tistory.com/7129 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }} Twitter Screenshot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.co.kr/view/mtview.php?type=1&amp;no=2013112609401145278&amp;outlink=1] MoneyToday&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misogyny ===
Ilbe takes an extremely hostile attitude toward types South Korean women that it deems undesirable, and expresses hatred towards them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/Show.asp?IDX=2541314|title='김치女' '보슬아치' 도배된 일베…혐오냐 열등감이냐|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilbe members think that men are superior and that women should be deferential to them. Ilbe labels women who do not comport to such gender norms as "Kimchi Nyun," which is a reference to their national food, kimchi. Through this label, Ilbe community implies that such characteristic is only displayed in Korean women.

One sexual assault counsellor said "It is the combination of commodification of women and peer culture which lies beneath Korean society", and women organization Womenlink activist Lee Yoon-so said "Ilbe seems to express misogyny behind anonymousity, and enjoying its propagation". The misogyny is expressed as Ilbe's language subculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=kmi&amp;arcid=0007379452&amp;cp=nv] Kim Hak-jun, who analyzed Ilbe and presented his paper 'Misogyny in cyberspace' at Korean Association Of Women Studies seminar said, "The anxiety of conservative men caused by the extension of women's right is expressed in misogyny". (Kookmin iNews)&lt;/ref&gt; Misogynistic Ilbe users simultaneously bemoan the fact that men have to serve in the military and that most of breadwinners in South Korean families are men, while also bemoaning the fact of women in the workplace. Hence, women are attacked both for being housewives and for working.

Such misogyny and [[male chauvinism]] is sometimes expressed as actual sexual harassment against women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=soc&amp;arcid=0007827356&amp;cp=nv] Ilbe stirs controversy over spying their female family sexually (Kookmin Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=107310] 'Most of such contents are victimizing almost every Korean woman and express savagery over them' (MediaToday)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilbe Community can be seen as anti-feminism community, composed of mostly males. The female users of Ilbe are called "Am-Be-Choong" (암베충) (Am: expression of females (mostly used in animals.)/Be: (ilbe)/Choong: insect) by the users. The female users who openly "comes out" as a female are banned from the website, mainly because their presences are likely to cause disputes in such masculine community, contributing to the decline of the website.

=== Vandalism ===
In December 2013, some self-claimed Ilbe users start vandalizing hand-written posters in universities and colleges around South Korea. Publicizing hand-written posters which criticizes political indifference, social disharmony, inequality, South Korea spy allegations, ongoing rail strike, and other political and social issues is started from Korea University and it spread among some Korean universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201312161627441&amp;code=940100] '안녕들 하십니까(inquiring after nation's health)' hand-written poster created sensation (Kyunghyang Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this culture is generally seen as far-left, communistic and pro-North Korea by such Ilbe users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2013121554677] Ilbe user who vandalized the poster mentioned "I ripped it because I don't want to see far-left communist schoomates putting this school to shame". (Hankook Economy News)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand-written posters on the Korea University campus were vandalized by self-claimed Ilbe users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201312142122551&amp;code=940100] One person, who acknowledged his vandalism against popular hand-written posters called '안녕들 하십니까 (inquiring after nation's health)', claimed himself to be an Ilbe user. (Kyunghyang Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed his vandalism by uploading his photo online with sexual degrade against original writer of the poster. After it became controversial, he uploaded an apology for his actions. But he also announced that he will accuse people first who degraded him and his action and revealed his identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/Show.asp?IDX=2713607] 'sexual harassment, pretended apology, and preparing legal action' (Nocut News)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar vandalism is ongoing nationwide such as [[Busan]] University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kookje.co.kr/news2011/asp/newsbody.asp?code=0300&amp;key=20131216.22008212154] Ilbe user who vandalized Busan University's hand-written poster confirms it with photo (Kookje Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt; Hannam University in [[Daejeon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.yonhapnews.co.kr/YNA/Basic/article/ArticlePhoto/YIBW_showArticlePhotoPopup.aspx?contents_id=PYH20131216080700063&amp;from=search] Photo by Yonhap News&lt;/ref&gt; Sogang University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20130625000286&amp;md=20130628004528_AT] 'Same thing happened in Sogang University' (Herald Economy News)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ha Tae-kyung, a member of conservative [[Saenuri Party (2017)|Saenuri Party]] (former [[Liberty Korea Party]]) blamed Ilbe users who committed such vandalism as "losers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201312161011211&amp;code=910402 "Ha Tae-kyung says 'Anyone who rip the poster is loser'"] (''Kyunghyang'' newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberterrorism ===
In 2012, some anonymous Ilbe users attempted an XSS script attack against TodayHumor, a website with a left-wing stance. The administrator of TodayHumor announced that he would consider legal action against Ilbe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=9919224&amp;ctg=1200] Joongang Ilbo&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberterrorism against Ilbe ===
An unknown hacker group made a [[distributed denial-of-service]] attack on the site on 7 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130408000916 Major Korean community website attacked by hackers] 8 April 2013-04-08 "An international hacking group is rumored to have attacked “Ilgan Best,” one of South Korea’s biggest online communities. Ilgan Best (Ilbe.com) is a humor-centered community website, producing jokes and political viewpoints."&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was reported as possible revenge of Anonymous for Ilbe's vandalism in #OpIsrael [[IRC]]. Anonymous Korea claimed on its Twitter account that it was not involved with the denial of service at Ilbe. However Anonymous Korea also mentioned that Ilbe members entered the chatroom used by Anonymous hackers and stirred them up, using insulting language and flooding the chatroom with repeated text. The relationship between Anonymous Korea and Anonymous remains ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/581971.html Transnational hackers may have struck another Korean target] "Right wing website Ilgan Best Jeojangso (Daily Best Storehouse: Ilbe) suffered connectivity issues after being the target of a DDOS (distributed denial of service) attack. Analysts suspect that Ilbe may have been attacked by Anonymous, the international hacker organization that hacked Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean propaganda website directed at South Korea."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violation of political neutrality ===
Some police officers and soldiers publicly described former presidents [[Chun Doo-hwan]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] as 'patriotic' on Ilbe, which caused controversy because they violated the political neutrality required for public officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segye.com/content/html/2013/10/02/20131002002239.html?OutUrl=naver] Segye Ilbo&lt;/ref&gt;

In another instance, a police officer described left-wing protesters as 'rioters' on Ilbe. He was sent to the [[Yongsan]] police office disciplinary committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=soc&amp;arcid=0007904686&amp;cp=nv] 'Police officer who mentioned 'war on riot' at Ilbe is finally brought to disciplinary committee' (Kookmin Ilbo)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged vandalism on Comotomo feeding bottles ===
On 10 December 2013, an Ilbe user claiming to be an employee of the [[Comotomo]] feeding bottle company alleged that he interrupted the manufacturing process by 'sucking on' feeding bottles. He confirmed his employment at the company by uploading his photo on Ilbe under the title 'Titty Party' and commented "Sometimes I suck this feeding bottle when I miss female breasts so much". His post raised outrage in the childcare community; not only for his vulgarism but also over hygiene concerns. Comotomo Korea released an official apology for the controversy and mentioned their employment of the Ilbe user was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbscnbc.sbs.co.kr/read.jsp?pmArticleId=10000619972] Comotomo's official apology for 'alleged feeding bottle terrorism by Ilbe user employee' (SBS CNBC)&lt;/ref&gt; The employee's accident report was revealed, in which he confessed: "I submitted vulgar contents on Ilbe.

===Provoking Sewol ferry victims===
South Korean police arrested Ilbe users for writing comments on the site that allegedly insulted victims of the [[Sinking of MV Sewol|Sewol ferry disaster]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} At the public square located at the [[Gwanghwamun|Gwanghwamun gate]], families of the ferry victims were staging a hunger strike to protest the perceived lack of government action. Ilbe users organised a binge event, eating lots of pizza right next to the bereaved families.

== Media attention ==
Agency of Korean [[K-pop]] dance group [[Crayon Pop]] mentioned Ilbe as 'antisocial' while denying alleged involvement with Ilbe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130822000942] (Korea Herald)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2013082202019922792001] (Digital Times)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Ilbe members are alleged to have registered in [[SHINee]] world (fan club) to post defamatory comments about [[Kim Jong-hyun (singer)|Jonghyun]] after he voiced his support to a student cause in support of [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]], which was one of above-mentioned hand-written posters around Korean universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.omg.yahoo.com/news/shinee-world-gets-harassed-by-ilbe-users-over-075500017.html] (Yahoo Philippines)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20131218000210] (In response to Jonghyun's support for hand-written poster,) 'In far-right website Ilbe, there are ongoing political condemn and verbal abuse against Jonghyun.'

{{italic title}}
The '''''Indian Act''''' (''An Act respecting Indians'', {{lang-fr|Loi sur les Indiens}}), (the ''Act'') is a Canadian Act of Parliament that concerns [[Indian Register|registered Indian]]s, their bands, and the system of [[Indian reserve]]s.{{sfn|Belanger|2014|p=117}}{{sfn|Belanger|2014|p=115}} First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments, it is the primary document which defines how the [[Government of Canada]] interacts with the 614 First Nation [[Band government|bands]] in Canada and their members.  Throughout its long history the ''Act'' has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians.  The legislation has been amended many times, including "over twenty major changes" made by 2002.&lt;ref name="revparl_IndianAct2002"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=255&amp;param=83|title=The ''Indian Act'': An Historical Perspective|author=John F. Leslie|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|volume=25|number=2|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Act'' is very wide-ranging in scope, covering governance, land use, healthcare, education, and more on Indian reserves.  Notably, the original ''Indian Act'' does two things affecting all [[indigenous peoples in Canada]]:
*  It says how reserves and bands can operate. The ''Act'' sets out rules for governing [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian reserves]], defines how bands can be created and spells out the powers of "band councils". Bands do not have to have reserve lands to operate under the act.&lt;ref name="IndianAct2013" /&gt;
* It defines who is, and who is not recognized as an "Indian". The ''Act'' defines a number of types of Indian people who are not recognized as "registered" or "status" Indians and who are therefore denied membership in bands.&lt;ref name="IndianAct2013" /&gt;

The ''Act'''s existence is necessitated by the fact that [[First Nations]] (historically called "Indians") relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] and various treaties, and because Canada's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal, rather than provincial governments, by the terms of Section 91(24) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]].'' The ''Indian Act'' replaced any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation, creating a definitive national policy on the subject.  The ''Act'' is not a treaty; it is Canada's legal response to the treaties. Nevertheless, its unilateral nature, imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties, is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada.

== Original rationale and purpose ==
{{main|Indian enfranchisement in Canada}}
{{quote box|quote= "The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the Dominion as speedily as they are fit to change."|source = John A Macdonald, 1887&lt;ref name="indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca"&gt;http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/government-policy/the-indian-act.html#origins&lt;/ref&gt;|align=left|width=20%}}

The ''Indian Act'' was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], most notably the ''[[Gradual Civilization Act]]'' passed by the [[Parliament of the Province of Canada]] in 1857 and the ''Gradual Enfranchisement Act'' of 1869.&lt;ref name="indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca"/&gt;  The ''Indian Act'' was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91(24) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', which provides Canada's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to "Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians". It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, while at the same time enforcing Euro-Canadian standards of  "civilization".  The purpose of the act, as stated by its drafters, was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members: a process called enfranchisement.

The idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of ''Indian Act'' and survived in some form until 1985.  Upon the introduction in 1857 by the [[Étienne-Paschal Taché|Taché]]-[[Sir John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961, the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English.&lt;ref name=1857leg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://signatoryindian.tripod.com/routingusedtoenslavethesovereignindigenouspeoples/id10.html|title=1857 "Gradual Civilization Act", 20 Vic., c.26. |publisher=}} For 'compulsory' text, see section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reserves, under this legislation, were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights. "Enfranchisement" derives from the idea of "franchise", which has gradually been degraded as "vote". Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives, were expected to pay taxes and lived "off-reserve".  By contrast, groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations.  One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve.

The tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective, or tribe, by virtue of a Crown protectorate. Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls; for example, the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians. It was hoped through means of [[fiduciary]] duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity, but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the ''Gradual Civilization Act''. The 1985 amendment to the ''Indian Act'' extinguished the idea of enfranchisement.

== Definitions ==

=== "Reserve" ===
{{main|Indian reserve}}
Under the section entitled "Reserves" in the ''Indian Act'', it is stated that reserves are "to be held for use and benefit of Indians.&lt;ref name="IndianAct2013" /&gt;
{{quote|18. (1) "Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.

{{quote|18. (2) "The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools, the administration of Indian affairs, Indian burial grounds, Indian health projects or, with the consent of the council of the band, for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band, and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes, but where an individual Indian, immediately prior to the taking, was entitled to the possession of those lands, compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian, in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister, or, failing agreement, as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct."|source = R.S., c. I-6, s. 18. ''Indian Act''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;|DIANA}}

=== "Band" ===
{{main|Band government}}
In the ''Indian Act'', updated to April 2013, the term "band",&lt;ref name="IndianAct2013" /&gt;

{{quote|"means a body of Indians  (a) for whose use and benefit in common, lands, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, have been set apart before, on or after September 4, 1951, (b) for whose use and benefit in common, moneys are held by Her Majesty, or (c) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act."|source=  ''Indian Act''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

=== "Indian" ===
{{main|Indian Register}}
Fundamental to Canada's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are (e.g. who are the "Indians" of the ''Indian Act''?), and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history.  Not all people who self-identify as "Aboriginal" are considered "Indians" under the terms of the act.  Only those on the official [[Indian Register]] maintained by the federal government (or a local "band list" in some cases) are Status Indians, subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the ''Indian Act''.  Notably this excludes [[Métis people]], [[Inuit people]], and so-called [[Non-Status Indians]].  Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status.  Many bands now maintain their own band lists.

==== Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments ====
{{repetition|section|date=August 2014}}
Though people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians, Bill C-31 clarified that various sections of the ''Indian Act'' would apply to such members. The sections in question are those relating to community life (e.g., land holdings). Sections relating to Indians (Aboriginal people) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.
Prior to 1985, Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following:
* marrying a man who was not a status Indian
* [[Indian enfranchisement in Canada|enfranchisement]] (until 1960, an Indian could vote in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=his&amp;document=chap3&amp;lang=e |title=Chapter 3: Modernization, 1920–1981 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=A History of the Vote in Canada
 |publisher=Elections Canada |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* having at the age of 21 a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage
* being born out of wedlock to a mother with status and a father without.

These provisions interfered with the [[matrilineal]] cultures of many First Nations, whereby children were born to the mother's [[clan]] and people, and gained their status in the tribe from her family. Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line.

In ''[[Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell]]'' (1974), these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]].  The ''Indian Act'' was amended in 1985 (Bill C-31)&lt;ref name="IndianAct2013" /&gt; to restore status to people who had lost it in one of these ways, and to their children.

===== Discriminatory definition issues =====
{{one source|section|date=August 2014}}
[[Bonita Lawrence]] (2003){{sfn|Lawrence|2003}} discusses a feminist position on the relationship between federal definition and Indian identity in Canada. Until 1985, subsection 12(1)(b) of the act "discriminated against Indian women by stripping them and their descendants of their Indian status if they married a man without Indian status."{{sfn|Lawrence|2003|page=13}}  Under subsection 12(2) of the act, "'illegitimate' children of status Indian women could also lose status if the alleged father was known not to be a status Indian and if the child's status as an Indian was "protested" by the Indian agent."  Further, subparagraph 12(1)(a)(iv), which Lawrence calls the "double mother" clause, "removed status from children when they reached the age of 21 if their mother and paternal grandmother did not have status before marriage."  Much of the discrimination stems from the ''Indian Act'' amendments and modifications in 1951.

She discusses the struggles of Jeannette Corbiere Lavell and Yvonne Bédard in the early 1970s, two women who had both lost their Indian status for marrying white men.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that the ''Indian Act'' was not discriminatory, as the pair gained the legal rights of white women at the same time they lost the status of Indian women, in a parallel to ''[[R. v. Drybones]]'' (supra).  In 1981, [[Sandra Lovelace Nicholas|Sandra Lovelace]], a [[Maliseet]] woman from western [[New Brunswick]] forced the issue by taking her case to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]], contending that she should not have to lose her own status by her marriage.  The Canadian law was amended in 1985.{{sfn|Lawrence|2003|page=13}}

== Policies enacted via the ''Indian Act'' ==

===Gender discrimination===
In the 1951 amendments to the ''Indian Act'', paragraph 12(1)(b) initiated that a status Indian woman who married a man who was not a status Indian became non-status.&lt;ref name="Hanson 2009"&gt;Hanson 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Subjecting Aboriginal female status to that of their father or husband, the Canadian government applied gender bias requirements to the legal status of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Without legal status, Aboriginal women are unable to access treaty benefits, practice inherent rights to live on their reserve, inherit family property or be buried on reserve with ancestors.&lt;ref name="Hanson 2009"/&gt; Restricted from access to their native community, Aboriginal women without legal status were unable to participate in ceremonies and rituals on their traditional land. However, these conditions did not apply to status Indian men who married non-status women; these men were able to keep their status.&lt;ref name="Hanson 2009"/&gt; Section 12, paragraph 1(b) of the ''Indian Act'' worked to disadvantage the position of Aboriginal women and can be considered an attempt to demolish Aboriginal families and alienate Aboriginal women from their land. Inflicting gender discriminatory laws the Canadian government marginalized and disadvantaged Aboriginal women. Section 12 gained the attention of female movements contributing to a variety of proposals for reform.&lt;ref name="Furi &amp; Wherret 2003"&gt;Furi &amp; Wherret 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Amended in 1985 through the introduction of Bill C-31, section 12 was removed and status was reinstated to those affected.

As stated in Bill C-31 women who lost their status as a result of marrying a man who was not a status Indian can apply for reinstatement and regain status under subsection 6(1).&lt;ref name="NWAC 1998"&gt;NWAC 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However, the children of reinstated women are subject to registration under subsection 6(2).&lt;ref name="Furi &amp; Wherret 2003"/&gt; Aboriginal people registered under section 6(2) are unable to transmit status to future generations.&lt;ref name="NWAC 1998"/&gt; Thus, by reinstating women under section 6 of the ''Indian Act'' the Canadian government failed to completely remove gender discrimination from its legislation. Since, the children of reinstated women have restrictions on their status, and status Indian men continue to hold greater quality of status then women. Bill C-31 amendments create a new system for classifying status Indians that maintains gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="NWAC 1998"/&gt; Patriarchy continued to be inflicted on Aboriginal peoples in Canada even after the 1985 ''Indian Act'' amendments. Female movements expressed that Bill C-31 failed to eliminate all gender discrimination from the ''Indian Act'', and in 2010 the Canadian government introduced Bill C-3 (Act to Promote Gender Equality in Indian Registration).&lt;ref name="NWAC 1998"/&gt;

Bill C-3 amendments to the ''Indian Act'' (Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2010_18/page-1.html|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - GEIRA) permitted Aboriginal women reinstated under subsection 6(2) to be eligible for 6(1) status.&lt;ref name="ICTI 2015"&gt;ICTI 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Creating paragraph 6(1)(c.1) registration, reinstated Aboriginal women could only be eligible for registration under 6(1) if they had non-status children.&lt;ref name="ICTI 2015"/&gt; Since it was the children of Aboriginal women who had been affected by restrictions under subsection 6(2) legal registration, only women who had children were eligible to be registered under subsection 6(1) of the ''Indian Act''. Continuing to place restrictions on the status of reinstated women, Bill C-3 does not remove all gender bias provisions from the ''Indian Act''.

=== Residential schools ===
{{main|Canadian Indian residential school system}}
An 1884 amendment to the Act mandated education for Indian children, to bring them to read and write English. The now infamous [[Indian Residential School]] system subjected children to forced conversions, sickness, abuse and what has been described as an attempt at Genocide by the recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] can be seen as an attempt to force Indians off their lands, sever family ties and diminish traditional Indian culture, for which on 11 June 2008 the government of Canada apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CTV News |title=Harper apologizes for residential school abuse |publisher=CTV |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080610/native_apology_080611/20080611?hub=TopStories |date=2008-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709021317/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080610/native_apology_080611/20080611?hub=TopStories |archivedate=2008-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bans on religious ceremonies ("Potlatch Law") ===
In 1885 an amendment to the ''Indian Act'' banned the [[Potlach]] ceremony of the West Coast peoples. The [[Potlatch ban]] drove traditional ceremonies underground.  A similar amendment in 1895 banned the [[Sun Dance]] of the Plains peoples, which was not lifted until 1951.

=== Restriction on access to the courts ===
A 1927 amendment (Section 141) forbid any first nation or band from retaining a lawyer for the purpose of making a claim against Canada, and further forbid them from raising money to retain a lawyer, on punishment of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/government-policy/the-indian-act.html#potlatch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conspiracy of Legislation: 
The Suppression of Indian Rights in Canada 
CHIE F JO E MATHIAS and GARY R. YABSLEY, pp 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax exemption ===
Section 87 exempts Indians from paying taxes on two types of property:
(a) the interest of an Indian or a band in reserve lands or surrendered lands; and
(b) the personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/exemption.pdf | title=The ''Indian Act'' Taxation Exemption – Beguiling Simplicity | author=Leslie J. Pinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; are beyond legal challenge under the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 25]] of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] shall not be interpreted as negating Aboriginal, treaty or other rights of Canada's Aboriginal peoples.

=== Section 88 ===
Section 88 of the ''Indian Act'' states that provincial laws may affect Aboriginals if they are of "general application", meaning that they affect other people as well as Aboriginals.  Hence, provincial laws are incorporated into federal law, since otherwise the provincial laws would be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Kruger and al. v. The Queen]]'' (1978), the Supreme Court found that provincial laws with a more significant impact on Aboriginals than other people can be upheld, as "There are few laws which have a uniform impact."

Constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] argues that in ''[[Dick v. The Queen]]'' (1985), the Supreme Court "changed its mind about the scope of s. 88."  Section 88 could now protect provincial laws relating to primary Aboriginal issues and even limiting Aboriginal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pp. 598–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1961: Amended to end the compulsory enfranchisement of men or bands.
* 1985: ''Indian Act'' amended to void the enfranchisement process.  Amended to allow status Indian women the right to keep or regain their status even after "marrying out" and to grant status to the children (but not grandchildren) of such a marriage. This amendment was debated in Parliament as Bill C-31.  Under this amendment, full status Indians are referred to as 6–1. A child of a marriage between a status (6–1) person and a non-status person qualifies for 6–2 (half) status. If that child grows up and in turn married a non-status person, the child of that union would be non-status. If a 6–2 marries a 6–1 or another 6–2, the children revert to 6–1 status. [[Blood quantum]] is disregarded, or rather, replaced with a "two generation cut-off clause".&lt;ref name = "truth"&gt;King, Thomas. ''The Truth about Stories''. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Under amendments to the ''Indian Act'' (Bill C-31), [[Michel Band]] members have individual Indian status restored.  No provision made in Bill C-31 for the restoration of status under the Band enfranchisement provision that was applied to the Michel Band.  According to Thomas King, around half of status Indians are currently marrying non-status people, meaning this legislation accomplishes complete legal assimilation in a matter of a few generations.&lt;ref name = "truth"/&gt;

=== Attempts to repeal or replace ===
Numerous failed attempts have been made by Canadian parliamentarians to repeal or replace the ''Indian Act'' without success.  Those changes that have been made have been piecemeal reforms, rather than sweeping revisions.

==== Failed major changes ====
* The [[Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy]] or "the White Paper" (1969) – would have abolished reserves and all other markers of "special status" and assimilated Indians fully into Canada.  Failed due to First Nations' opposition (e.g. "the Red Paper") and withdrawn in 1971.
* The Manitoba Framework Agreement – a 1994 agreement between the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs and the Minister of Indian Affairs, it created a regional pilot project to dismantle the Department of Indian Affairs' regional structure in Manitoba.  It was deemed unsuccessful and discontinued in 2004.
* The ''[[Indian Act Optional Modification Act]]'' (Bill C-79) – introduced in 1996, it would have devolved certain powers to bands, but was opposed by most bands as being too limited and not respecting the principle of [[Aboriginal self-government]] as endorsed by the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]].  It died in parliament at the start of the 1997 election.
* The ''[[First Nations Governance Act]]'' (Bill C-7) – introduced in 2002, it would have allowed bands to amend their own leadership selection processes and devolved some other powers.  It was opposed by most bands and died in Parliament in 2003.
* Senate Proposals (several) – the most recent is ''[[An Act for the Recognition of Self-Governing First Nations]]'' (Bill S-216) initiated by Senator [[Gerry St. Germain]] in May 2006 which would have allowed bands to write their own constitutions, subject to vetting by the Auditor General.  Died in Parliament in September 2007

==== Opt-outs ====
Since the 1990s, several pieces of legislation have been passed allowing individual bands to opt out of a particular section of the ''Indian Act'' if an agreement is signed between the band and the government putting alternative measures in place.  These are called "Sectoral Legislative Arrangements".  The band remains subject to the ''Act'' except for the section in question.
* ''[[First Nations Land Management Act]]'' (FNLMA) - enacted in 1999, it allows opt-outs of 34 land-related sections of the ''Indian Act'' and allows bands to create their own codes on land use and environmental stewardship.  Fourteen bands originally signed on, by 2013 there were over 30 bands involved.
* ''[[First Nations Fiscal Management Act]]'' (FNFMA) - enacted in 2005, allows bands to issue their own bonds
* ''[[First Nations Oil and Gas and Moneys Management Act]]'' (FNOGMMA) - enacted in 2005, allows bands to opt to take over the management of funds held in trust for them by the Crown, or to assume management of oil and gas resources on their reserves
* ''[[First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act]]'' (FNCIDA) - since 2006 has allowed a band to request the federal government to create regulations for a particular industry on reserve that mirror those of the surrounding province.  Amended in 2010 by the [[First Nations Certainty of Land Title Act]] (FNCLTA) which creates a registry similar to a provincial land titles registry for on-reserve real estate.

== Case law ==
{{Maincat|Canadian Indigenous case law}}
The 1895 amendment of the ''Indian Act'' (Section 114) criminalized many Aboriginal ceremonies, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of numerous Aboriginal people for practising their basic traditions.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=68}}  These arrests were based on Aboriginal participation in festivals, dances and ceremonies that involved the wounding of animals or humans, or the giving away of money or goods.  The [[Dakota people]] (Sioux) who settled in Oak River, Manitoba, in 1875 were known to conduct "give-away dances", also known as the "grass dance".{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=72}}  The dance ceremony involved the giving away and exchange of blankets and horses; thus it breached Section 114 of the ''Indian Act''.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=63}}  As a result, Wanduta, an elder of the Dakota community, was sentenced to four months of hard labour and imprisonment on January 26, 1903.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=79}}

According to Canadian historian Constance Backhouse, the Aboriginal "give-away dances" were ceremonies more commonly known as [[potlatch]]es that connected entire communities politically, economically and socially.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=64}} These dances affirmed kinship ties, provided elders with opportunities to pass on insight, legends and history to the next generation, and were a core part of Aboriginal resistance to assimilation.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=64}} It is estimated that between 1900 and 1904, 50 Aboriginal people were arrested and 20 were convicted for their involvement in such dances.{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=69}}  The ''Indian Act'' was amended in 1951 to allow religious ceremonies, including the "give-away dance".{{sfn|Backhouse|1999|page=63}}

In ''[[R. v. Jim]]'' (1915), the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] found that Aboriginal hunting on Indian reserves should be considered under federal jurisdiction under both the constitution and the ''Indian Act''.  The case involved whether Aboriginals were subject to provincial game laws when hunting on Indian reserves.

The act was at the centre of the 1969 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] case ''[[R. v. Drybones]]'', regarding the conflict of a clause forbidding Indians to be drunk off the reserve with the Bill of Rights.  The case is remembered for having been one of the few in which the [[Canadian Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] prevailed in application to Indian rights.

In ''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'' (1999), voting rights on reserves were extended under [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

Leslie|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|volume=25|number=2|year=2002}} This article by John F. Leslie, a research consultant with Public History Inc., is an edited version of the testimony Leslie's testimony to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on March 12, 2002. The article provides a detailed step-by-step description of amendments to the ''Indian Act''. It also provides detailed information about other laws related to the ''Indian Act''. "In 2001 the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Nault, announced that the government would be introducing legislation to overhaul the ''Indian Act''.

For the sake of simplicity, this article uses the term "Indian" throughout.

The '''International Seabed Authority (ISA)''' ({{lang-fr|Autorité internationale des fonds marins}}) is an [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental body]] based in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], that was established to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, an area underlying most of the world’s [[ocean]]s. It is an organization established by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements.] UN: regularly updated.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Following at least ten preparatory meetings over the years,&lt;ref name="UN_ARES4828_page4"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-28 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=28 |highlight=rect_104,309_898,400 |page=4 |accessdate=2009-04-23|date=11 January 1994| title=Law of the Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Authority held its first inaugural meeting in its host country, [[Jamaica]], on 16 November 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-49-PV.22 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=49 |meeting=22 |page=10 |anchor=pg010-bk02-pa12 |date=7 October 1994 |speakername=Mr. Robertson | speakernation=Jamaica |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the day the Convention came into force.  The articles governing the Authority have been made "noting the political and economic changes, including market-oriented approaches, affecting the implementation" of the Convention.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES48263"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-263 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=263 |accessdate=2009-04-23|title=Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982|date=17 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Authority obtained its [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status to the United Nations]] in October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-51-PV.40 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=51 |meeting=40 |page=22 |anchor=pg022-bk05 |date=24 October 1996 | title=Observer status for the International Seabed Authority in the General Assembly| accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Authority has 167 members and the European Union, composed of all parties to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

Two principal organs establish the policies and govern the work of the Authority: the Assembly, in which all members are represented, and a 36-member Council elected by the Assembly.  Council members are chosen according to a formula designed to ensure equitable representation of countries from various groups, including those engaged in seabed mineral exploration and the land-based producers of minerals found on the seabed. The Authority holds one annual session, usually of two weeks' duration.

Also established is a 30-member Legal and Technical Commission which advises the Council and a 15-member Finance Committee that deals with budgetary and related matters.  All members are experts nominated by governments and elected to serve in their individual capacity.

The Authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore, and eventually exploit, specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources essential for building most technological products.  The Convention also established a body called the Enterprise which is to serve as the Authority’s own mining operator, but no concrete steps have been taken to bring this into being.

==Status==
The Authority currently has a Secretariat of 37 authorized posts and a biennial budget of $9.1 million for 2017 and $8.9 million for 2018. In July 2016, the Assembly of the Authority elected Michael Lodge of the United Kingdom, for a four-year term as Secretary-General beginning 1 January 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isa.org.jm/sites/default/files/files/documents/isba-22a-10_1.pdf |title=Decision of the Assembly of the International Seabed Authority Concerning the Appointment of the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority |publisher=International Seabed Authority |date=21 July 2016 |website=International Seabed Authority |access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeds [[Nii Allotey Odunton]] of Ghana, who had served two consecutive four-year terms since 2008.

==Exploration contracts==
The exploitation system envisaged in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, overseen by the Authority, came to life with the signature in 2001/02 of 15-year contracts with seven organizations that had applied for specific seabed areas in which they were authorized to explore for polymetallic nodules. In 2006, a German entity was added to the list.

These contractors are: Yuzhmorgeologya (Russian Federation); Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) (Bulgaria, Cuba, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Russian Federation); the Government of the Republic of Korea; China Ocean Minerals Research and Development Association (COMRA) (China); Deep Ocean Resources Development Company (DORD) (Japan); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (IFREMER) (France); the Government of India, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany.

All but one of the current areas of exploration are in the [[Clarion-Clipperton Zone]], in the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean south and southeast of Hawaii. The remaining area, being explored by India, is in the Central Indian Basin of the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration Exploration Areas | International Seabed Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915123021/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration |date=15 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each area is limited to {{convert|150,000|km2}}, of which half is to be relinquished to the Authority after eight years. Each contractor is required to report once a year on its activities in its assigned area. So far, none of them has indicated any serious move to begin commercial exploitation.

In 2008, the Authority received two new applications for authorization to explore for polymetallic nodules, coming for the first time from private firms in developing island nations of the Pacific. Sponsored by their respective governments, they were submitted by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-L2.pdf Nauru Ocean Resources Inc.: application for approval of a plan of work for exploration.] Document ISBA/14/LTC/L.2, 21 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-L3.pdf Tonga Offshore Mining Limited : application for approval of a plan of work for exploration.] Document ISBA/14/LTC/L.3, 21 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 15-year exploration contract was granted by the Authority to Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. on 22 July 2011 and to Tonga Offshore Mining Limited on 12 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration/contractors |title=Contractors &amp;#124; International Seabed Authority |publisher=Isa.org.jm |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125174247/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/scientific/exploration/contractors |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen-year exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules were also  granted to G-TECH Sea Mineral Resources NV (Belgium) on the 14 January 2013; Marawa Research and Exploration Ltd (Kiribati) on the 19 January 2015;  Ocean Mineral Singapore Pte Ltd on 22 January 2015; UK Seabed Resources Ltd (two contracts on the 8 February 2013 and 29 March 2016 respectively); Cook Islands Investment Corporation on the 15 July 2016 and more recently China Minmetals Corporation on 12 May 2017.

The Authority has signed seven contracts for the exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (18 November 2011); the Government of Russia (29 October 2012); Government of the Republic of Korea (24 June 2014); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (Ifremer,France, 18 November 2014); the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany (6 May 2015); and the Government of India (26 September 2016) and the Government of the Republic of Poland (12 February 2018).

The Authority also holds five contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (29 April 2014); Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC, 27 January 2014); Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (10 March 2015), Companhia De Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (9 November 2015) and the Government of the Republic of Korea (27 March 2018).

The Authority's main legislative accomplishment to date has been the adoption, in the year 2000, of regulations governing exploration for polymetallic nodules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/en/documents/mcode Mining Code | International Seabed Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522100957/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/documents/mcode |date=22 May 2008 }} Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dundee.ac.uk/cepmlp/journal/html/vol10/vol10-2.html Website of the Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy (CEPMLP), volume 10, abstract 2 (18 December 2001).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219043004/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/cepmlp/journal/html/vol10/vol10-2.html |date=19 February 2008 }} The University of Dundee (United Kingdom). Article on the Regulations (2001) by Michael W. Lodge, chief of the ISA [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt; These resources, also called [[manganese nodule]]s, contain varying amounts of [[manganese]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]].  They occur as potato-sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor, mainly in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] but with some deposits in the [[Indian Ocean]].

The Council of the Authority began work, in August 2002, on another set of regulations, covering [[polymetallic]] [[sulfide]]s and cobalt-rich [[ferromanganese]] crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, [[zinc]], silver and gold, as well as [[cobalt]]. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world.  The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees to be paid to the Authority and the question of how to deal with any overlapping claims that might arise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/En/SG-Stats/StatesParties18.pdf Statement by the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority to the Eighteenth Meeting of States Parties to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201113034/http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/En/SG-Stats/StatesParties18.pdf |date=1 December 2008 }} New York, 16 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on ferromanganese crusts.&lt;ref name="isa.org.jm"&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/Cncl/ISBA-14C-11.pdf Statement of the President of the Council of the International Seabed Authority on the work of the Council during the fourteenth session.] Document ISBA/14/C/11, 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its legislative work, the Authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration, with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences.  It disseminates the results of these meetings through publications. Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/Pubs/TechStudy3.pdf Biodiversity, species ranges, and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province: predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining.] ISA Technical Study No. 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-2.pdf Workshop on Designing Marine Protected Areas for Seamounts and the Abyssal Nodule Province in Pacific High Seas.] Document ISBA/14/LTC/2.&lt;/ref&gt; produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of "preservation reference areas" in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact. The most recent workshop, held at Chennai, India, in February 2008, concerned polymetallic nodule mining technology, with special reference to its current status and challenges ahead &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/LTC/ISBA-14LTC-3.pdf Report on the International Seabed Authority's workshop on polymetallic nodule mining technology: current status and challenges ahead.] Document ISBA/14/C/7, prepared by the Secretariat.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to early hopes that seabed mining would generate extensive revenues for both the exploiting countries and the Authority, no technology has yet been developed for gathering deep-sea minerals at costs that can compete with land-based mines.  Until recently, the consensus has been that economic mining of the ocean depths might be decades away.  Moreover, the [[United States]], with some of the most advanced ocean technology in the world, has not yet ratified the Law of the Sea Convention and is thus not a member of the Authority.

In recent years, however, interest in deep-sea mining, especially with regard to ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides, has picked up among several firms now operating in waters within the national zones of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to grant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits when it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan’s new ocean policy emphasizes the need to develop [[methane clathrate|methane hydrate]] and hydrothermal deposits within Japan’s exclusive economic zone and calls for the commercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on these developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008, Secretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and prices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be derived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for offshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/14Sess/Ass/ISBA-14A-2.pdf Report of the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority under article 166, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.] Document ISBA/14/A/2, 14 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its preamble, UNCLOS defines the international seabed area—the part under ISA jurisdiction—as “the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”. There are no maps annexed to the Convention to delineate this area. Rather, UNCLOS outlines the areas of national jurisdiction, leaving the rest for the international portion. National jurisdiction over the seabed normally leaves off at {{convert|200|nmi|km}} seaward from baselines running along the shore, unless a nation can demonstrate that its [[continental shelf]] is naturally prolonged beyond that limit, in which case it may claim up to {{convert|350|nmi|km}}. ISA has no role in determining this boundary. Rather, this task is left to another body established by UNCLOS, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which examines scientific data submitted by coastal states that claim a broader reach. [[Maritime boundaries]] between states are generally decided by bilateral negotiation (sometimes with the aid of judicial bodies), not by ISA.

Recently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed resources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States (see [[Territorial claims in the Arctic]]). Mineral exploration and exploitation activities in any seabed area not belonging to these states would fall under ISA jurisdiction.

==Endowment fund==
In 2006 the Authority established an Endowment Fund to Support Collaborative Marine Scientific Research on the International Seabed Area. The Fund will aid experienced scientists and technicians from developing countries to participate in deep-sea research organized by international and national institutions. A campaign was launched in February 2008 to identify participants, establish a network of cooperating bodies and seek outside funds to augment the initial $3 million endowment from the Authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isa.org.jm/en/efund/fund Endowment Fund | International Seabed Authority.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430125957/http://www.isa.org.jm/en/efund/fund |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Seabed Authority Endowment Fund promotes and encourages the conduct of collaborative marine scientific research in the international seabed area through two main activities:
* ''By supporting the participation of qualified scientists and technical personnel from developing countries in marine scientific research programmes and activities.''
* ''By providing opportunities to these scientists to participate in relevant initiatives.''

The Secretariat of the International Seabed Authority is facilitating these activities by creating and maintaining an ongoing list of opportunities for scientific collaboration, including research cruises, deep-sea sample analysis, and training and internship programmes. This entails building a network of co-operating groups interested in (or presently undertaking) these types of activities and programmes, such as universities, institutions, contractors with the Authority and other entities.

The Secretariat is also actively seeking applications from scientists and other technical personnel from developing nations to be considered for assistance under the Fund. Application guidelines have been prepared for potential recipients to participate in marine scientific research programmes or other scientific co-operation activity, to enroll in training programmes, and to qualify for technical assistance. An advisory panel will evaluate all incoming applications and make recommendations to the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority so successful applicants may be awarded with Fund assistance.

To maximize opportunities for and participation in the Fund, the Secretariat is also seeking donations and in-kind contributions to build on the initial investment of US$3 million. This entails raising awareness of the Fund, reporting on its successes and encouraging new activities and participants.

==Voluntary commitments==
In 2017, the Authority registered seven voluntary commitments with the UN Oceans Conference for Sustainable Development Goal 14. These were:
#OceanAction15467 - Enhancing the role of women in marine scientific research through capacity building
#OceanAction15796 - Encouraging dissemination of research results through the ISA Secretary-General Award for Excellence in Deep-Sea Research
#OceanAction16538 - Abyssal Initiative for Blue Growth (with UN-DESA)
#OceanAction16494 - Fostering cooperation to promote the sustainable development of Africa's deep seabed resources in support of Africas Blue Economy
#OceanAction17746 - Enhancing the assessment of essential ecological functions of the deep sea oceans through long-term underwater oceanographic observatories in the Area; 
#OceanAction17776 - Enhancing deep sea marine biodiversity assessment through the creation of online taxonomic atlases linked to deep sea mining activities in the Area

==Controversy==
The exact nature of the ISA's mission and authority has been questioned by opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty who are generally skeptical of multilateral engagement by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlawoftheseatreaty.org Law of the Sea Treaty.] National Center for Public Policy Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] is the only major maritime power that has not ratified the Convention (see [[United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS]]), with one of the main anti-ratification arguments being a charge that the ISA is flawed or unnecessary. In its original form, the Convention included certain provisions that some found objectionable, such as:
* Imposition of permit requirements, fees and taxation on seabed mining; ban on mining absent ISA permission
* Use of collected money for [[wealth redistribution]] in addition to ISA administration
* Mandatory technology transfer

Because of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the Convention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat mitigates them and thus modifies the ISA's authority. Despite this change the United States has not ratified the Convention and so is not a member of ISA, although it sends sizable delegations to participate in meetings as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN31335584 U.S. Senate panel backs Law of the Sea treaty | Reuters.] 31 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses2|Lies}}
{{Evidence law}}
A '''lie''' is a statement used intentionally for the purpose of [[deception]]. The practice of communicating a lie is called '''lying'''; a person who communicates a lie may be termed a '''liar'''. Lies may be employed to serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them. Generally, the term "lie" carries a negative connotation and, depending on the context, a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions.

==England and Wales==
In [[England]], if the prosecution seeks to rely on the fact the defendant lied (to police, for example), it is sometimes necessary for the judge to give the jury what is known as a ''Lucas'' direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsboard.co.uk/criminal_law/cbb/index.htm Judicial Studies Board Specimen Directions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051149/http://www.jsboard.co.uk/criminal_law/cbb/index.htm |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Lucas'' direction is not used where the prosecution attempts to show the defendant committed the crime, and, if the jury finds the defendant guilty, this would mean the defendant had lied. The direction "comes into play when the prosecution says, or the judge envisages that the jury may say, that the lie is evidence against the accused, in effect using it as an implied admission of guilt .... this is quite distinct from the run of the mill case in which the defence case is contradicted by the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in such a way as to make it necessary for the prosecution to say ... that the defendant's account is untrue and indeed deliberately and knowingly false".&lt;ref name="Burge and Pegg"&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants=R v. Burge and Pegg
  |vol=1
  |reporter=Cr App Rep
  |opinion=163
  |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is appropriate for a judge to give a ''Lucas'' direction:&lt;ref name="Burge and Pegg" /&gt;
{{Ordered list
|list-style-type=lower-roman
|1=Where the defence relies on an [[alibi]] (see also R v Harron [1996] 2 Cr App R 457, R v Lesley [1996] 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 39 and R v Peacock [1998] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 681. But not necessarily in every such case&amp;mdash;see R v Patrick [1999] 6 Archbold News 3.)
|2=Where the judge considers it desirable or necessary to suggest that the jury should look for support or [[corroboration]] of one piece of evidence in the case, and amongst that other evidence draws attention to lies told, or allegedly told, by the defendant.
|3=Where the prosecution seeks to show that something said, either in or out of the court, in relation to a '''separate and distinct issue''' was a lie, and to rely on that lie as evidence of guilt in relation to the charge which is sought to be proved.
|4=Where although the prosecution has not adopted the approach (in (iii) above) the judge reasonably envisages that there is a real danger that the jury may do so.
}}

A ''Lucas'' direction has three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants=R v. Lucas
  |reporter=QB
  |opinion=720
  |year=1981}}; {{cite court
  |litigants=R v. Goodway
  |vol=4
  |reporter=[[All England Law Reports|All ER]]
  |opinion=894
  |year=1993
  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The judge must tell the jury the lie is only evidence of guilt if they are satisfied the lie was made deliberately.
*The judge must remind the jury that people might lie not because they are guilty, but for other reasons (for example, to bolster a weak case, to protect someone, out of panic, or to cover up disgraceful behaviour).
*The judge must tell the jury that because the lie alone is insufficient evidence, they should not rely solely on the lie but should also look to the other evidence to corroborate guilt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25069">This [[list of rampage killers]] lists mass murders where the perpetrator used only [[hand grenade]]s or comparable explosive devices, like [[pipe bomb]]s or [[dynamite]] sticks, for the attack. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

'''''MOL Comfort''''' was a 2008-built [[Bahamas|Bahamian-flagged]] [[post-Panamax]] [[container ship]] chartered by [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines]]. On 17 June 2013, she broke into two about {{convert|200|nmi}} off the coast of [[Yemen]]. The aft section sank on 27 June and the bow section, after having been destroyed by fire, on 11 July.
 
== Career ==

One of twelve ships of similar design, ''MOL Comfort'' was laid down at [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] [[Nagasaki]] shipyard in [[Japan]] on 23 August 2007 and launched on 8 March 2008 as '''''APL Russia''''' for charter to APL (formerly [[American President Lines]]). She was completed on 14 July 2008. On 1 June 2012, ''APL Russia'' was transferred to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines' Europe-Asia route and renamed ''MOL Comfort''.&lt;ref name="classnk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="equasis" /&gt;

=== Shipwreck ===

On 17 June 2013, ''MOL Comfort'' suffered a crack amidships in bad weather about {{convert|200|nmi}} off the coast of Yemen and eventually broke into two after [[Hogging and sagging|hogging]]. The vessel was underway from [[Singapore]] to [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], with a cargo of 4,382 containers equivalent to 7,041 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]]. The crew of 26—11 Russians, one Ukrainian and 14 Filipinos—abandoned the ship and were rescued from two life rafts and a lifeboat by the [[Germany|German-flagged]] container ship ''[[Yantian Express]]'', one of three vessels diverted to the site of incident by [[Indian Coast Guard|ICG]] Mumbai.&lt;ref name="mitsui_news"&gt;[http://www.mol.co.jp/en/pr/2013/13032.html Incident with Containership MOL Comfort].

== General characteristics ==

With an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|316|m|ft|0}} long, moulded beam of {{convert|45.6|m|ft|0}} and fully laden draught of {{convert|14.5|m|ft|0}}, ''MOL Comfort'' was too large to transit the [[Panama canal]] and was thus referred to as a post-Panamax container ship. She measured 86,692 in [[gross tonnage]] and 48,825 in [[net tonnage]], and had a [[deadweight tonnage]] of 90,613 tonnes. The container capacity of the ship, measured in [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEU), was 8,110 of which 4,616 TEU is stored on the deck and 3,494 TEU in the holds.&lt;ref name="classnk" /&gt;

Like most large container ships, ''MOL Comfort'' was propelled by a single low-speed two-stroke [[crosshead]] [[diesel engine]] coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Her main engine, a [[straight-11 engine|11-cylinder]] licence-manufactured Mitsubishi-[[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] 11RT-flex96C, was rated at {{convert|62920|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 102 rpm and was capable of propelling the ship at {{convert|25.25|kn}}. She also had six auxiliary diesel generators with a combined output of 14,625{{nbsp}}kVA.&lt;ref name="classnk" /&gt;

The hatch side coamings in modern container ships are subjected to the highest stress of all structural members in the ship. This is due to the large openings in the strength deck needed for loading and unloading containers in the cargo holds. Plate thicknesses up to {{convert|90|mm|in}} are used to keep the stress levels acceptable. ''MOL Comfort'''s [[sister ship]], 2007-built ''[[MOL Creation]]'', was the first container ship classified by [[Nippon Kaiji Kyokai]] to use ultra-high-strength steel with a [[yield strength]] of 470{{nbsp}}MPa in these structures to reduce the steel weight by avoiding extreme plate thicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;YP47.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law''' ('''Max Planck Institute for International Law''', '''MPIL''') is a legal research institute located in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. It is operated by the [[Max Planck Society]].

The institute was founded in 1924 and was originally named the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Foreign and International Public Law'' and located in [[Berlin]]. It later relocated to Heidelberg and received its current name in 1949. The institute currently employs 69 scientific staff and is led by two co-directors, [[Armin von Bogdandy]] (since 2002) and [[Anne Peters]] (since 2013).&lt;ref name=MPILorg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|title=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law - History and Organization|accessdate=2010-01-10|work=Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805001929/http://www.mpil.de/ww/en/pub/research/profile/history.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seated at [[Heidelberg University]]'s [[New Campus (University of Heidelberg)|New Campus]].

'''''Mueller v. Allen''''', 463 U.S. 388 (1983),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Mueller v. Allen|463|388|1983}}. {{Include-FedCourts}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case examining the constitutionality of a state tax deduction granted to taxpaying parents for school-related expenses, including expenses incurred from private secular and religious schools. The plaintiffs claimed that a [[Minnesota]] statute, allowing tax deductions for both public and private school expenses, had the effect of subsidizing religious instruction since parents who paid tuition to religious schools received a larger deduction than parents of public school students, who incurred no tuition expenses.

In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld the statute. The majority affirmed that the benefit was religiously neutral because the deduction applied equally to sectarian and nonsectarian tuition and that the choice of religious or nonreligious instruction was made by individual parents, not the state. Also, aid was given to parents, not schools.

The dissenting opinion argued that the tax deduction violated the [[US Constitution]] because it was an indirect government subsidy of religion, providing a financial incentive to parents to send their children to religious schools.

==Background==
The [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the US Constitution prohibits laws advancing the establishment of any religion. Any government-sponsored religious instruction is thus barred. Prior to the adoption of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], the Supreme Court's reviews of First Amendment disputes were minimal because the court maintained jurisdiction to consider only challenges against laws passed at the federal level.

''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947) was the first case decided by the Court to apply the Establishment Clause prohibition to state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Religion |title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States |edition=2nd |editor=Kermit L. Hall |first=Frederick Mark |last=Gedicks |year=2005 |isbn=9780195176612 |publisher=Oxford |page=837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision in ''Everson'' established two criteria to judge state legislation: the action must have a secular purpose, and that purpose must be the primary effect of the action. Following a 1971 decision by the Supreme Court, a third condition was incorporated.  The resulting three-pronged test, called [[Lemon v. Kurtzman#Lemon test|''Lemon'' test]], prescribes that for any governmental policy or legislation to satisfy the Establishment Clause, it must have a secular purpose, its primary effect must not the advancement or inhibition of religion, and it must not create an excessive entanglement between religion and government.&lt;ref name="Finkelman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties |volume=1 |chapter=Mueller v. Allen |editor=Paul Finkelman |page=1045 |year=2006 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9780415943420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mueller'', the plaintiff claimed that the primary effect of the Minnesota law was the advancement of religion since most taxpayers who benefited from the legislation were parents paying their children's tuition to private religious schools.

==Majority opinion==
[[William Rehnquist|Justice Rehnquist]] delivered the [[majority opinion]], which affirmed the decisions of the [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Mueller v. Allen |vol=514 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=998 |pinpoint= |court=D. Minn. |date=1981 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/514/998/1962012/ |accessdate=2017-12-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Mueller v. Allen |vol=676 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1195 |pinpoint= |court=8th Cir. |date=1982 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/676/1195/375088/ |accessdate=2017-12-24 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Minnesota statute (§ 290.09, subd. 22) was constitutional. The law allowed state taxpayers to a state income tax deduction for any expenses toward their children's school tuition, textbooks, and transportation. The deduction was limited to $500 per student in elementary school and $700 per student in [[middle school]] and [[high school]]. The statute excluded deducting any expenses for "instructional books and materials used in the teaching of religious tenets, doctrines or worship, the purpose of which is to inculcate such tenets, doctrines or worship."

The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in contending that the tax deduction provided financial assistance to religious schools and that to assure no deduction was made for textbooks containing religious teachings, the state became excessively entangled with religion.

Rehnquist noted that the statute was facially neutral on religion and rejected the plaintiff's argument that its religious partiality was evidenced by the fact that 96% of the private schools in Minnesota were sectarian institutions.

==Dissenting opinion==
[[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]] wrote the [[dissenting opinion]], agreed to by three other justices. The tax credits were available to all parents, but, in practice, the chief benefit went to parents whose children attended parochial schools. "Parents who send their children to free public schools are simply ineligible to obtain the full benefit of the deduction except in the unlikely event that they buy $700 worth of pencils, notebooks, and bus rides for their children." As the First Amendment was concerned, Marshall added, a tax credit did not differ from a direct grant to parents, which had already been found unconstitutional.

==Aftermath==
''Mueller v. Allen'' marked a turning point for the Establishment Clause, and for the next 20 years the Supreme Court ruled more favorably if governments fostered aid. The Court upheld benefits that were deemed to be religiously neutral and were extended to all equally, even if they were favorable to individuals in exercising their privately-held religious interests. The Court became disinclined to overturn laws that did not disqualify religiously based interests if the direct beneficiaries of the legislation in question were individuals, rather than religiously-affiliated institutions.&lt;ref name="Finkelman"/&gt;

Followin ''Mueller'', "private choice" was a key element extended to subsequent Establishment Clause court decisions over government sponsored [[school voucher]]s, the most significant one being ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'' (2002). While direct aid was funneled instead to religious schools, the Court focused instead on whether or not the policies at issue provided sufficient controls to ensure the assistance was not directed to religious instruction and that the e policies did not lead to forbidden entanglements between the government and any religious institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Religion |title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States |edition=2nd |editor=Kermit L. Hall |first=Frederick Mark |last=Gedicks |year=2005 |isbn=9780195176612 |publisher=Oxford |page=839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13512">'''Naming laws in the People's Republic of China''' (excluding [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], as well as the [[Republic of China]] situated on the islands of [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]) are based on technical capability rather than the appropriateness of words (as opposed to [[Japanese name#Regulations|naming laws in Japan]], which restrict the [[Kanji]] which can be used based on appropriate taste, as well as readability by all people). Although it is advised for parents to name their children so that others are able to easily read their names, there are no restrictions on the complexity of [[Chinese characters]] used, provided that there are no technical issues in doing so (see below). The use of [[Simplified Chinese|Simplified characters]] is advised over [[Traditional Chinese characters]]; however, this is not strictly enforced.

==Details==
"[[s:General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China|General Principles of Civil Law]]" Article 99 guarantees citizens the right to a name and the choice of naming therein.&lt;ref name=law&gt;[http://www.lawtime.cn/info/sunhai/jsshxingmingq/2009031144127.html 什么是姓名权？ – 法律快车知识]. Lawtime.cn (2009-03-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The right of self-naming permits the [[Chinese surname|surname]], although naturally obtained from the [[paternal]] side, to be taken from either parent if desired (such as in the case of a dispute between parents) under Article 22 of the "Marriage Law". Thus, the government does not interfere with the will of the person or their parents in the selection of a surname, provided that it is taken from one parent. Citizens also have the right to select their given names and aliases, in which the government has no right to interfere.

There are also no restrictions on previously used names by the government, which fully permits the usage of "well-known" names. It is not illegal to name a child after a famous celebrity, company, or product, as copyright and trademark laws do not apply to personal names. Consequently, this is able to lead to legal issues regarding [[intellectual property]] rights and legal matters, as the person is then known by the name given according to law, which opens the possibility for confusion where a personal name is exactly the same to a company or another person, such as during a court case or the creation of legal documents.&lt;ref name=law/&gt;

Latin characters, numerals and other non-Chinese symbols are prohibited, as they do not constitute part of a Chinese name under government law. Only Chinese characters are permitted; however, characters which are unable to be input on computers are also disallowed. There are no limits on the number of characters used, as this may vary depending on the name (typical Chinese names on average constitute 2 to 3 characters, with 4 or more characters being rare; however, [[List of ethnic groups in China|non-Han ethnic groups]] such as [[Mongols]], [[Tibetans]] and [[Uighurs]] have many syllables after [[Transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration into Standard Chinese]]).

There are no laws which restrict a person's surname to one character like most [[Han Chinese]] names, since some people of Han Chinese ethnicity have [[Chinese compound surname]]s, and it is very common for foreign residents and ethnic minorities to have long surname transcriptions. However, since the People's Republic of China government does not recognise [[Mongolian name|Mongolian clan names]] as surnames, persons of Mongol ethnicity usually only have a registered given name and no surname (which are absent on their identification cards, whilst their passports would have "XXX" in the surname field), although some individuals choose to adopt a single-character [[Han Chinese]] surname that resembles an abbreviation of their clan name.

==Technical issues==
There are over 70,000 known [[Chinese character]]s, yet approximately only 32,232 are supported for computer input,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/asia/21china.html | work=The New York Times | title=Name Not on Our List? Change It, China Says | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including both Traditional and Simplified characters (see [[GBK (character encoding)]] etc.). As the government database of personal names is maintained digitally on government networks, input of rarer characters becomes virtually impossible, thus creating an irremovable restriction on permitted names. All citizens within the People's Republic of China must have their details registered on the government computer network, while those over the age of 16 must carry an [[Identity document#China|identification card]], known in China as a [[Resident Identity Card (PRC)|Resident Identity Card]] at all times. As these processes are all done electronically, having a name which is not supported by electronic input makes government registration and the management of ID cards much more difficult.

==Religious naming restrictions==

In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party enacted bans on a list of Muslim names it deemed "too extreme", or may have "connotations of holy war or of splittism (separatism)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/24/china-bans-many-muslim-baby-names-xinjiang | work=Human Rights Watch | title=China Bans Many Muslim Baby Names in Xinjiang | first=Sophie | last=Richardson | date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/names-04202017093324.html | work=Radio Free Asia | title=China Bans 'Extreme' Islamic Baby Names Among Xinjiang's Uyghurs | first=Lin | last=Xin | date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples include "Islam", "Quran", "Mecca", "Jihad", "Imam", "Saddam", "Hajj", and "Medina", among others.

==Notable cases==

===Ma Cheng===
[[File:Ma Cheng JMSFZ.jpg|thumb|The temporary [[Resident Identity Card (PRC)|Resident ID Card]] of Ma Cheng, with a handwritten "Cheng" character. Note that Ma Cheng's name appears in [[Simplified Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Note: The character which appears on the ID card is a [[Simplified Chinese]] variant character of [[File:Chinese character Cheng.svg|20px]], adapted to match other characters in the PRC, using the simplified 马 (''ma'', "horse") character. As of April 2009, there is no Simplified Chinese [[Variant Chinese character|variant]] of "Cheng" supported by [[Unicode]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Ma Cheng''' ({{zh|c=马[[wikt:𩧢|𩧢]]}} (some browsers will be unable to display the second character [[File:Chinese character Cheng.svg|20px]], which is three [[wikt:馬|馬]] horses placed horizontally), {{zh|p=Mǎ Chěng}}) is a woman from [[Beijing]] who, due to her obscure name, frequently encounters issues regarding name registration in places such as airports and police stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danwei.org/video/crazy_horse_name.php Living with an obscure name – DANWEI]. Danwei.org. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma explained on [[Beijing TV|BTV-7]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://leitie.com/show.php?tid=714 Video from BTV-7]. Leitie.com.

Pronounced "Cheng", this character can be found in the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', where it is listed as a [[variant Chinese character|variant character]] of [[wikt:骋|骋]] (gallop). There is also the comparatively more common stacked character [[wikt:骉|骉]], which doesn't accurately reflect her name either, as it has a different pronunciation. While some vendors may write her name by hand, those that are strictly electronically managed, such as the [[Public Security Bureau]], are unable to correctly enter her name. Because of this, some computers record her name as 马CHENG or 马马马马. (Compare this practice with the previous technical issues of inputting the Chinese name of the Taiwanese singer [[David Tao]] ({{zh|c=陶喆|p=Tao Zhe}}), where before the input of ''zhe'' [[wikt:喆|喆]] became supported on computers, many media sources often rendered his name as Tao Jiji 陶吉吉, using two ''ji'' [[wikt:吉|吉]] in place of the ''zhe'' 喆.)&lt;ref name=cheng&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/asia/21china.html?hp | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 April 2009 | accessdate=21 April 2009 | title=Name Not on Our List?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15101">A '''Norwich Pharmacal order''' is a court order for the disclosure of documents or information that is available in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is granted against a third party which has been innocently mixed up in wrongdoing, forcing the disclosure of documents or information. By identifying individuals the documents and information sought are disclosed in order to assist the applicant for such an order in bringing legal proceedings against individuals who are believed to have wronged the applicant.

A Norwich Pharmacal order was first granted in 1974 by the House of Lords in ''[[Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Norwich Pharmacal Company &amp; Ors v Customs And Excise|link=Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners|court=UKHL|year=1973|num=6|parallelcite= [1974] AC 133|date=26 June 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; a case concerning the alleged violation of a [[patent]] by unknown importers of the chemical subject to the patent. While first developed in relation to [[intellectual property]], Norwich Pharmacal orders are now granted in relation to other [[torts]], including [[defamation]] and [[breach of contract]], as well as alleged criminal offences. More recently Norwich Pharmacal orders are used against [[Internet hosting services]] and [[Internet service providers]] to identify users which have allegedly engaged in wrongdoing.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=441}}

In 2011, it was proposed that Norwich Pharmacal orders should not be granted by the UK courts where disclosure of the material in question would cause damage to the [[public interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Justice and Security Green Paper (Cm 8194)|url= http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf|location= |publisher= HMSO|page= |year= 2011|isbn= 9780101819428|accessdate= 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented in the [[Justice and Security Act 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 2013| chapter = 18| act = Justice and Security Act 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction==
In ''[[Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners]]'', the [[House of Lords]] held that where an innocent third party has information relating to unlawful conduct, a court could compel them to assist the person suffering damage by giving them that information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gillhams.com/dictionary/556.cfm|title=Norwich Pharmacal Orders|accessdate=30 September 2010|work=Gillhams LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement is based on the 19th Century procedure known as the "bill of discovery" and the case was brought by [[Norwich Pharmaceuticals|Norwich Pharmacal Co.]], the owner of the patent for a chemical. Norwich knew that its patent was infringed, because the chemical was imported into the UK, but it was unable to identify the alleged wrongdoer. It brought proceedings against [[HM Customs and Excise]] to force the Commissioners to disclose the names of the importers, which were the "Intended Defendants".{{sfn|Sime|2007|p=381}}

Norwich Pharmacal orders are typically sought when legal proceedings for alleged wrongdoing cannot be brought because the identity of the wrongdoer is not known. Parties which believe they have been wronged will apply for a Norwich Pharmacal order to the court against third parties who can identify the wrongdoer, because they unwittingly facilitate the wrongdoing.{{sfn|Sime|2007|p=381}} In the judgement granting the first Norwich Pharmacal order [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] summarised the principle of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction as follows:

{{cquote|...that if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrongdoing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers.{{sfn|Sime|2007|p=381}}}}

An application for a Norwich Pharmacal order must be commenced against the facilitator by issuing a claim form. In the case of alleged [[tort]] an interim application must be made to a master in the [[Queen's Bench Division]] or the [[Chancery Division]] in the [[High Court of Justice]].{{sfn|Sime|2007|p=384}} The [[Civil Procedure Rules]] (CPR) 31.17 outline the procedures of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction in England and Wales.{{sfn|Bellamy|2009|p=2}} Norwich Pharmacal orders are not restricted to cases where such an order is a last resort - it is "intended to be a... flexible remedy."{{sfn|Bellamy|2009|p=4}}

The nature of the relief has been summarized thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Alberta Treasury Branches v. Leahy|link=|year=2000|court=abqb|num=575|format=|pinpoint=par. 106|parallelcite=270 AR 1|date=2000-08-18|courtname=auto|juris=}}, endorsed in {{cite CanLII|litigants=GEA Group AG v. Flex-N-Gate Corporation|link=|year=2009|court=onca|num=619|format=|pinpoint=par. 50{{endash}}51, 62|parallelcite=96 OR (3d) 481|date=2009-08-21|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
a. ''Norwich''-type relief has been granted in varied situations:
:(i) where the information sought is necessary to identify wrongdoers;
:(ii) to find and preserve evidence that may substantiate or support an action against either known or unknown wrongdoers, or even determine whether an action exists; and
:(iii) to trace and preserve assets.

b. The court will consider the following factors on an application for ''Norwich'' relief:
:(i) Whether the applicant has provided evidence sufficient to raise a valid, ''[[bona fide]]'' or reasonable claim;
:(ii) Whether the applicant has established a relationship with the third party from whom the information is sought such that it establishes that the third party is somehow involved in the acts complained of;
:(iii) Whether the third party is the only practicable source of the information available;
:(iv) Whether the third party can be indemnified for costs to which the third party may be exposed because of the disclosure, some refer to the associated expenses of complying with the orders, while others speak of damages; and
:(v) Whether the interests of justice favour the obtaining of the disclosure.

|The House of Lords established the principle that Norwich Pharmacal orders should only be granted where the applicant intends to seek redress by court proceedings or otherwise. It upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that journalists can, according to the law, be forced to disclose their news sources.

|In one of the first Norwich orders against an [[online chat]] room operator, the investment advice company [[Motley Fool]] was compelled to identify a user who had posted allegedly libellous comments about the ISP [[Madasafish|Totalise]], thus establishing the applicability of the jurisdiction to alleged offences such as [[libel]] and [[copyright infringement]]. The case reaffirmed the principle established in ''SmithKline'' that the applicant pays the third party's cost, even where the third party actively contests the order, because it is for the applicant to prove to the court that he or she is entitled to the disclosure order. Legitimate reasons for contesting an application include: genuine doubt that the person seeking the disclosure order is entitled to it, the legal position regarding obligations not to disclose data (for example under the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]) is not clear, and that the disclosure of the information sought might infringe a legitimate interest of another.{{sfn|Bellamy|2009|p=8}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Totalise v Motley Fool | work = Computer Law Reports | publisher = Out-Law.com | url = http://www.out-law.com/page-8699 | accessdate = 26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|In a case concerning alleged libel on an [[Internet bulletin board]], the Court of Appeal refused to grant a Norwich Pharmacal order against the bulletin board which would have forced the identification of individuals which were alleged to have libelled the applicant. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court ruling that it would be  disproportionate to grant the order and that the applicant had not established an arguable case of [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bulletin board postings more likely slander than libel, says High Court | publisher = Out-Law.com| date = 7 August 2008 | url = http://www.out-law.com/page-9330| accessdate = 12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal also provided guidance on the quality and quantity of the evidence needed to support a Norwich Pharmacal order.

|The High Court clarified that Norwich Pharmacal orders should not be granted for "fishing expeditions". In the case, Middle Eastern inter-governmental organisations applied for an order against a Saudi dissident for the identification of individuals that "may have been involved" in the broadcast of political material. The High Court refused to grant an order which would compel a third party to make a judgement about who "may have" done something, and ruled that "Norwich Pharmacal does not give claimants a general licence to fish for information that will do not more than potentially assist them to identify a claim or a defendant".{{sfn|Bellamy|2009|p=7}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4232">The '''Peace of Callias''' is a purported treaty established around 449 BC between the [[Delian League]] (led by [[Athens]]) and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], ending the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. The peace was agreed as the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid Persia and a Greek city.

The peace was negotiated by [[Callias]], an Athenian politician. Persia had continually lost territory to the [[Greece|Greeks]] after the end of [[Xerxes I]]'s invasion in 479 BC. The exact date of the treaty is debated, although it is usually placed after the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] in 469 or 466 or the [[Wars of the Delian League|Battle of Cypriot Salamis]] in 450. The Peace of Callias gave autonomy to the [[Ionia]]n states in [[Asia Minor]], prohibited the encroachment of Persian [[satrap]]ies within three days march of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast, and prohibited Persian ships from the Aegean. Athens also agreed not to interfere with Persia's possessions in Asia Minor, [[Cyprus]], [[Libya]] or [[Egypt]] &lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 12.4&lt;/ref&gt;(Athens had recently lost a fleet aiding an Egyptian revolt against Persia&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, i. 104, and 109-10&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Arguments for the existence of a peace treaty ==

Our knowledge of the Peace of Callias comes from references by the 4th century BC orators [[Isocrates]] and [[Demosthenes]] as well as the historian [[Diodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online Encyclopedia: ancient Greece (historical region, Eurasia): Peace with Persia&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient historian [[Theopompus]] deemed it a fabrication arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake – the lettering used hadn't come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purported to have been agreed. It is possible that the treaty never officially existed, and if it was concluded, its importance is disputed. [[Thucydides]] did not mention it, but [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Histories, 7.151&lt;/ref&gt; says something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does [[Plutarch]], who thought it had either been signed after the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] in 466 BC, or that it had never been signed at all. In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Persia after 450/449, which allowed Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Greek states such as [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], as well as Euboea which rebelled from the Delian League shortly after this. These conflicts may have arisen when Athenian 'allies' felt there was no longer a justification for the [[Delian League]] (which had developed from the [[Sparta]]n-led Hellenic League that defeated Xerxes' invasion), as Persia was apparently no longer a threat. As Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the League became more of a true empire, and many of Athens' 'allies' began to rebel. Although Callias was also responsible for a peace (The [[Thirty Years' Peace]]) with Sparta in 446&amp;ndash;445 BC, the growing Athenian threat would eventually lead to the [[Peloponnesian War]].

Fighting between the Greeks and the Persians subsided after 450, but Persia continued to meddle in Greek affairs and was to become instrumental in securing a [[Sparta]]n victory in the Peloponnesian War.

Nonetheless, it remains a controversial topic among historians and scholars today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20170">{{for|companies named Phoenix|Phoenix (disambiguation)#Businesses{{!}}Phoenix § Businesses}}
A '''phoenix company''' is a [[Legal person|commercial entity]] which has emerged from the collapse of another through [[insolvency]]. Unlike "[[Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance|bottom of the harbour]]" and similar schemes that strictly focus on [[asset stripping]], the new company is set up to trade in the same or similar trading activities as the former, and is able to present the appearance of "business as usual" to its customers. It has been described as "one that arises amidst or from the disarray and demise of its predecessor."{{sfn|Margret|Peck|2015|p=109}}

==Nature of phoenix activity==

===Types of phoenix company operators===
A study by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] has identified three groups of operators that practice phoenix activity:{{sfn|Cole|2003|pp=118{{endash}}119}}

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Group !!Description
|- valign="top"
|Innocent phoenix operators ||A business gets into a position of doubtful solvency or insolvency, and directors try and recover as much as possible from the business before it collapses.
|- valign="top"
|Occupational hazard ||The nature of the industry may potentially heighten the risk of phoenix activity. Once a company has collapsed, the operators of the business may have little option but to return to the same industry in the form of a new business.
|- valign="top"
|Careerist offenders ||These operators purposely structure their operations in order to engage in phoenix activity and to avoid detection. These offenders are often selective as to which debts they will pay throughout the life of the company. 
|}

Such activity can also be characterized as either "basic" (involving replacement of one entity by another) or "sophisticated" (which has regard for the intricacies of corporate groups, where management and directors may misuse the concept of the [[corporate veil]]).{{sfn|Margret|Peck|2015|p=109}}

Certain sectors see more frequent phoenix activity than others. In the [[event management|events industry]], [[public relations]] and [[marketing]] agencies are known to "phoenix" regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = David Quainton|title = Phoenixing: Tempers flare as the phoenix rises|url =http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/phoenixing-tempers-flare-phoenix-rises/business/article/869945|publisher = ''Event Magazine''|date = 12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenix scenarios===
Phoenix activity is generally observed to occur through the following scenarios:{{sfn|Roach|2010|pp=96{{endash}}97}}

{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! Group !!Description
|- valign="top"
| "One after the other" || A closely held company is formed, which operates for a period of 6{{endash}}24 months. During that time, it accumulates large debts, stalls creditors for as long as possible, and, when pressure becomes too great, it goes into liquidation. Another company, frequently with a very similar name, purchases the productive assets and takes over the operations of the failing company. Often the new company operates out of the same premises, with the same suppliers, employees and customers.
|- valign="top"
| Management company || The productive assets are kept in a management company, which is kept solvent. A second labour supply company employs the workers and conducts the principal business operations. Profits are stripped from the second company through high rates charged for the use of the first company's assets, which leaves the second with insufficient funds to pay its liabilities. Eventually, the second company will be liquidated, with little to no capital reserves, and a new one will rise in its stead.
|- valign="top"
| Labour hire || This structure utilizes a management company, a sales company and a labour hire company. The sales company receives all the income arising from the business, while the management company charges the sales company for the use of the assets. The labour hire company employs the workers, for which the net pay is reimbursed by the sales company but not the payroll deductions or taxes.  Often the labour hire company is a façade, merely issuing payment summaries, while the sales company pays the workers directly. Eventually the labour hire company is forced into liquidation, while the underlying assets are preserved in the management company.
|- valign="top"
| [[Shadow director]]s ||Former directors can control a company through spouses, relatives and associates. There is little to prevent a disqualified director from giving advice as an employee of a successor company.
|}

===Indicators===
The primary identifiers of phoenix activity have been described as "a deliberate and often cyclical misuse of the corporate form accompanied by a fraudulent scheme to evade creditors".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/90962/|title = The conundrum of phoenix activity: Is further reform necessary?|last = Matthew|first = Anne F.|date = 2015|journal = Insolvency Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 February 2016|volume = 23|page = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several common characteristics have been identified as indicating harmful phoenix activity:{{sfn|Roach|2010|pp=95{{endash}}96}}

#the failed entity is formed with only a nominal share capital
#the failed entity is under-capitalized
#the directors/managers/controllers of the failed and successor company are the same
#the failed entity is trading whilst insolvent
#assets of the failed company are depleted shortly before the cessation of business
#the failed company makes preferential payments to key creditors to assure supply to the successor company
#the failed entity was operated to evade prior liabilities
#the successor company operates in the same industry
#the successor company trades with the same or similar name
#the successor company commences trading immediately prior to, or within 12 months of, the cessation of the failed entity
#assets of the failed company are transferred at below market value to the successor company
#many of the employees of the failed company are re-employed by the successor company

==United Kingdom==
[[Company law]] in the UK has been formed to enable such activity in order to protect and promote [[entrepreneurship]], by reducing risk and improving the chances of continued trading and [[business development]]. The [[National Fraud Authority]] has observed that:

{{quotation|
It is perfectly legal to form a new company from the remains of a failed company. Any director of a failed company can become a director of a new company unless he or she is:

:* subject to a [[Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986|disqualification order or undertaking]];
:* personally adjudged [[bankrupt]];
:* subject to a [[Enterprise Act 2002|bankruptcy restriction order or undertaking]].}}

Other less scrupulous directors may undertake such activity in order to evade liabilities to workers that accrue from [[continuous employment]], such as the right to claim for [[unfair dismissal]], or to receive statutory [[redundancy payment]]s. The [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] has held that such moves are generally barred under s. 218 of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Workers’ rights on insolvency|date = 2 July 2009|url = http://www.thompsons.law.co.uk/ltext/123-workers-rights-insolvency.htm|publisher = Thompsons Solicitors}}, discussing ''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2008/0241_08_1808.html Da Silva Junior v Composite Mouldings &amp; Design Ltd]'', [2008] UKEAT 0241_08_1808 (18 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The law allows the directors of a failed company to be reinstated in the same, or similar posts in the phoenix company, within limits. The [[Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986]] prohibits directors whose conduct led to the insolvency of a company from taking on similar roles elsewhere for a prescribed length of time. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/216 S. 216] of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] provides for both criminal and civil liability where directors or shadow directors of a company that has entered into liquidation become a director, or otherwise involved in the formation or management of another company that operates under the same or a similar name to the insolvent one, within the following twelve months of such liquidation.{{efn|Except where leave of the court has been granted, or prescribed circumstances are met, in which case [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1925/group/2/part/4/chapter/22/made Part 4, Chapter 22] of the [[Insolvency Rules 1986]] governs the manner in which notice must be given to creditors.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jim Davies|title = Stop the phoenix rising from the ashes|url = http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/feature/1784910/stop-phoenix-rising-ashes|publisher = ''[[Accountancy Age]]''|date = 4 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remedies include petitioning the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to wind up a company, as in the 2014 case of Pinecom Services Limited and Pine Commodities Ltd (which had continued a business previously shut down in the public interest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Two carbon copy companies that raked in nearly £2m are shut down after Insolvency Service investigation|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-carbon-copy-companies-that-raked-in-nearly-2m-are-shut-down-after-insolvency-service-investigation|date = 11 July 2014|publisher = [[Insolvency Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
There has been criticism in both the media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller|first= Robert|date= 28 February 2006|title= Phoenix firms spark fly-by-night fears|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/2933144/Phoenix-firms-spark-fly-by-night-fears.html|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Parliamentary quarters, as to the adverse effect on small to medium-sized suppliers to a failed company, whose position as creditors leaves them having to write off [[bad debt]] from the former company, with the phoenix company having shed all [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]] to cover the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Government urged to re-think decision not to offer creditors more legal protection from 'phoenix' companies|url = https://www.fpb.org/press/january-2012/government-urged-re-think-decision-not-offer-creditors-more-legal-protection-|publisher = Forum for Private Business|date = 27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the House of Commons' Business and Enterprise Select Committee also raised concerns that the law may "adversely affect competitors, who will continue to carry costs which the phoenix company has shed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Sixth Report: The Insolvency Service|chapter = 3: Confidence in the Insolvency Regime |chapterurl = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmberr/198/19806.htm|date = 21 April 2009|publisher = Business and Enterprise Committee, House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- needs a Reasoning section to balance this out a bit, explaining possible govt reasoning behind allowing such practice. --&gt;

==Australia==
Phoenix activity was identified in government reports as early as 1994,{{sfn|Anderson|2012|p=413}} and the 2003 Final Report of the [[Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry]] devoted a chapter to its practice in that sector of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cole|first= Terence|date= 2003|title= Final Report|volume=8|chapter=12: Phoenix Companies|url= http://www.royalcombci.gov.au/docs/finalreport/V08NatIss2_PressFinal.pdf|location= Canberra|publisher= [[Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry]]|pages= 111{{endash}}217|isbn= 0-642-21080-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has attracted the attention of the [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission]], the [[Australian Taxation Office]] and the [[Fair Work Ombudsman]], who have been pursuing those undertaking such practices to evade liability under their respective statutes.{{efn|being, respectively, the ''[[Corporations Act 2001]]'', the [[Taxation in Australia|taxation]] and [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation]] statutes, and the ''[[Fair Work Act 2009]]''}}{{sfn|Anderson|Haller|2014|pp=472{{endash}}473}} The [[Treasurer of Australia]] issued proposals in 2009 on options to deal with fraudulent phoenix activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Actions against Fraudulent Phoenix Activity: Proposals Paper|url= http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/1647/PDF/Phoenix_Proposal_Paper.pdf|location= Canberra|publisher= Commonwealth of Australia|page= |date= 2009|isbn= 978-0-642-74528-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Parliament of Australia]] passed several Acts in 2012 as a result.{{efn|{{cite act |title= Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Act 2012|number= 48|date= 2012|url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00048}} and {{cite act |title= Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Act 2012|number= 99|date= 2012|url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00099 }}}} An exposure draft was also issued for comment on the question of whether to assign [[joint and several liability]] to directors of phoenix companies in certain circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exposure Draft: Corporations Amendment (Similar Names) Bill 2012|url = http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Consultations/2011/Corporations-Amendment-Similar-Names-Bill-2012|publisher = [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|The Treasury]]|date = 20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but limited legislation directed at illegal phoenix activity was passed.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Act 2012'' (Cth)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 two significant government reports were released that included a consideration of how best to address phoenix activity: the Productivity Commission Report ''Business Set Up, Transfer and Closure,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Business Set up, Transfer and Closure|last = |first = |publisher = Australian Government, Productivity Commission|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate Economic References Committee Report: ''I just want to be paid: Insolvency in the Australian Construction Industry.''&lt;ref&gt;Australia, Senate Economic References Committee, December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the frequency and volume to attention given to phoenix activity by government and regulators, scholars note that "[t]here is no law in Australia that defines 'phoenix activity' , nor declares it illegal";&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "phoenix activity is an operational term, not a legal one".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The economic cost of phoenix activity has been estimated in 1996 by the Australian Securities Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phoenix Companies and Insolvent Trading Research Paper No 95/01|last = |first = |publisher = Australian Securities Commission|year = 1996|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 by the Fair Work Ombudsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Phoenix Activity: Sizing the Problem and Matching Solutions|last = |first = |publisher = Fair Work Ombudsman|year = 2012|isbn = |location = https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/access-accountability-and-reporting/research-reports|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is economic cost associated with all phoenix activity, the underlying behaviour is not always illegal and this makes estimating the economic costs associated with illegal phoenix activity extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Enforcement activity has been active under the ''Corporations Act'':

:* Several significant cases have dealt with the liability of directors conducting such activity.{{efn|''Jeffree v National Companies and Securities Commission'', [1990] WAR 183 (where a director transferred the business name and assets from one company to another, in order to avoid paying an arbitration award); {{cite AustLII|litigants=R v Heilbronn|link=|court=QCA|num=95|year=1999|parallelcite=(1999)
150 FLR 43|date=26 March 1999}} (where the director of a company with substantial sales tax
liabilities stripped the company of its assets and transferred them to another
company, and then to a third company, while carrying on the same business under the same trading name, and without adequate consideration being given in each transfer to satisfy outstanding liabilities).{{sfn|Anderson|2012|p=420}}}}
:* In ''ASIC v Somerville'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=ASIC v Somerville &amp; Ors|link=|court=NSWSC|num=934|year=2009|pinpoint=|parallelcite= 77 NSWLR 110|date=8 September 2009|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New South Wales Supreme Court]], in a significant extension of liability, found that a legal advisor was not just complicit in certain directors’ breaches of duty, but was in fact instrumental in structuring new companies into which the assets of various insolvent companies were transferred.{{sfn|Anderson|Haller|2014|p=473}} ASIC only sought disqualification for the advisor, but there has been debate as to whether it should have also sought compensation for creditors or a penalty in the circumstances.{{sfn|Anderson|Haller|2014|p=490}}

The Fair Work Ombudsman has also investigated several high-profile cases:{{sfn|Anderson|Haller|2014|p=477}}

:* An abattoir business in New South Wales was pursued several times: initially for closing a business, terminating the staff, and setting up a new one while refusing to rehire ex-employees who were union members;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Fair Work Ombudsman v Ramsey Food Processing Pty Ltd|link=|court=FCA|num=1176|year=2011|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later for hiring workers through a separate subsidiary who worked for another connected company, and then draining the first company of funds after terminating several workers, before sending it into liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Fair Work Ombudsman v Ramsey Food Processing Pty Ltd (No 2)|link=|court=FCA|num=408|year=2012|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Praetorianism''' means excessive or abusive [[Politics|political]] influence of the [[Armed Forces]] in a country.

[[Daniel R. Headrick]], professor of History and Social Sciences at [[Roosevelt University]], describes praetorianism as a type of [[militarism]] oriented to the interior life of a nation, often related to minor countries, that does not aspire to fight or win international wars, but instead to maintain its influence in the domestic political system, controlling decisions that could affect the interests of the military as a corporation, or supporting some particular political faction or party.

[[File:Presidential Memorandum Regarding Military Service by Transgender Individuals.pdf|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''Presidential Memorandum'' of August 25, 2017]]
The '''Presidential Memorandum on Military Service by Transgender Individuals''', officially the '''Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security''' is the 27th [[presidential memorandum]] signed by [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] on August 25, 2017. On October 30, 2017, in the case of ''[[Jane Doe v. Trump]]'', Judge [[Colleen Kollar-Kotelly]] granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the provisions of the memorandum prohibiting open [[Transgender people and military service|military service and enlistment of transgender people]].&lt;ref name=NYT-171030 /&gt; On November 21, 2017, in the case of ''[[Stone v. Trump]]'', Judge [[Marvin J. Garbis]] granted the planintiffs a preliminary injunction on the entirety of the Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security.&lt;ref name="Federal judge says Trump administration can’t stop funding sex-reassignment surgery for military members" /&gt; Also that day, the [[United States Department of Justice]] appealed the preliminary injunction in the case of ''Jane Doe v. Trump''.&lt;ref name="DOJ appeals ruling against Trump’s transgender military ban"&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/21/doj-appeals-ruling-against-trump/ DOJ appeals ruling against Trump’s transgender military ban]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pentagon's six-month delay on accession of transgender individuals into military service expired January 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/10/30/federal_judge_blocks_trans_troops_ban.html Federal Judge Blocks Trump’s Trans Troops Ban, Calling It Inexplicable and Unjustified]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original policy, which this Memorandum replaced, had been blocked in 2017 (''Jane Doe v. Trump''), when it was ruled that as far as could be seen, ''"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-transgender-20171030-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2017cv1597-61 Doe v Trump, 30 October 2017, District Court for Columbia, memorandum opinion]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 policy was itself stayed on 13 April 2018 when a Washington court ruled in ''[[Karnoski vs. Trump]]'' (Western District of Washington), that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a [[protected class]] entitled to [[strict scrutiny]] of adverse laws (or at worst, a [[quasi-suspect class]]), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/judge-blocks-trump-transgender-military-ban/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2018/04/district-judge-holds-transgender-military-ban-subject-to-strict-scrutiny.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/karnoskivtrump.pdf District Court, West District Washington, Karnoski v Trump, 13 April 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2017/12/another-district-judge-issues-preliminary-injunction-against-transgender-military-ban-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
* Maintain the currently effective policy regarding accession of transgender individuals into military service beyond January 1, 2018, until such time as the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], after consulting with the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], provides a recommendation to the contrary. This provision takes effect on January 1, 2018.&lt;ref name="US White House"/&gt;
* Prohibit open military service of transgender individuals "until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above." However, until the Secretary of Defense has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy of this memorandum. This provision takes effect on March 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="US White House"/&gt;
* Prohibit all use of [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] or [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] resources to fund [[sex reassignment]] surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex. This provision takes effect on March 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="US White House"/&gt;
* By February 21, 2018, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to me a plan for implementing both the general policy set forth in this memorandum and the specific directives set forth in this memorandum.  The implementation plan shall adhere to the determinations of the Secretary of Defense, made in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, as to what steps are appropriate and consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law.  As part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military.&lt;ref name="US White House"/&gt;

==Enactment==

On August 29, 2017, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] [[James Mattis]] announced that currently serving transgender troops would be allowed to remain in the armed services, pending further study. Mattis stated he would set up a panel of experts from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide recommendations on implementing the President's policy direction.&lt;ref name="guardian-29aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siddiqui|first1=Sabrina|title=Transgender troops can stay in US military for now, James Mattis says|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/29/transgender-troops-can-stay-now-james-mattis-trump-ban|accessdate=August 29, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On August 9, 2017, the first of four lawsuits was filed in United States District Court seeking to block the Presidential Memorandum from being implemented.&lt;ref name=apvnp /&gt;&lt;ref name=aug9 /&gt; 

===''Jane Doe v. Trump''===
{{main|Jane Doe v. Trump}}
On August 9, 2017, five transgender United States military personnel filed a lawsuit, ''Jane Doe v. Trump''. They sued Trump and top [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon officials]] over the proposed banning of transgender people from serving in the military. The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect,&lt;ref name=apvnp&gt;{{cite news |author=Savage, Charlie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/5-transgender-service-members-sue-trump-over-military-ban.html |title=5 Transgender Service Members Sue Trump Over Military Ban |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2017-08-09 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aug9&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/lawsuit-opposes-trump-s-ban-transgender-military-service-n791241 |title=Lawsuit Opposes Trump's Ban on Transgender Military Service |publisher=NBC News |date=9 August 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the equal protection and [[due process clause]]s of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=17-cv-1597-170809&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AS-FILED-COMPLAINT_Doe.v.Trump_-1.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

On October 4, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in ''Jane Doe v. Trump'' and to oppose the application for a preliminary injunction, arguing instead "that challenge is premature several times over" and that Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance, issued on September 14, 2017, protects currently-serving [[Transgender personnel in the United States military|transgender personnel]] from involuntary discharge or denial of reenlistment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4067310/Doe-v-Trump-Defendants-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf |title=''Jane Doe, et. al. v.

{{main|Stone v. Trump}}
On August 28, 2017, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) of [[Maryland]] filed a federal lawsuit, ''[[Stone v.

==Revoked==
As requested by the memorandum of August 25, Secretary Mattis submitted a memorandum and report regarding military service by transgender individuals. The [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Kirstjen Nielsen]], concurred with Mattis's recommendations as applied to the Coast Guard. One of the recommendations made was "that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances." On March 23, 2018, President Trump announced the prior memorandum of August 25 was revoked. With respect to future policies, the memorandum of March 23 went on to declare the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security "may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals."&lt;ref name=17-cv-01297-doc214-1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4420627/3-23-18-Trump-Memo.pdf |title=''Karnoski, et. al. v.

}}'''''Pro Swing Inc v Elta Golf Inc''''' 2006 SCC 52 is a leading Canadian case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on [[conflict of law]]s. The Court held that foreign non-monetary judgments may be enforced in Canada where they have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rendering is final, and the nature of the judgment is such that [[comity]] requires it to be enforced.

==Background==
Pro Swing is an American company that sells golf equipment under the "trident" trade-mark. Elta Golf is an Ontario company that sells golf equipment that includes products with a trade-mark similar to that of the "trident".

Pro Swing sued for trade-mark infringement in Ohio. A settlement was reached which ordered Elta Golf to refrain from selling any products with the trident logo.

In 2002, Pro Swing filed to an Ohio court for contempt of court for Elta's breach of the settlement. The court granted the order. Pro Swing then filed in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] for enforcement of the order.

The motions judge found that the non-monetary order was valid, but found certain parts duplicative and had them severed from the order.

On appeal to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]], the court found the order was unenforceable due to ambiguity in the order regarding its scope of application.

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice Deschamps wrote the majority opinion. She ordered the appeal dismissed.

The old rule for foreign judgments required that they be final, conclusive, and for a monetary amount. Deschamps found this rule to be outdated and stated that a new rule for non-monetary orders based on comity was needed. 

She proposed that non-monetary judgments should be enforced when
# judgment is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction
# the judgment is final 
# the nature of the judgment is such that comity requires enforcements.

On the current facts she found the order unenforceable. The contempt order is quasi-criminal which should never be enforced. This public law element eclipses any other private law element. She further advised in ''[[obiter]]'' that courts should ensure there will be no conflict once the order is rendered, and should not allow punishments that are not available under the foreign jurisdiction.

==Dissent==
McLachlin, in dissent, argued that incremental change was a preferable approach. The standard should be based on comity, order, and fairness. 

When assessing an application, the court should not look at the judgment's merits. The only restrictions upon enforcement of foreign non-monetary judgments should be:
# issue court does not have jurisdiction 
# where non-monetary orders are not final or clear
# where the order is criminal in nature

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">In '''''R v K''''', an important case in South African criminal law, the Appellate Division held that, in cases of private defence, the assault on the accused need not be committed culpably. It is also possible to act in private defence against someone who lacks criminal capacity, such as a mentally disordered person. Centlivres CJ compared&lt;ref&gt;359.&lt;/ref&gt; the law in South Africa with what Holmes J said in ''[[Brown v United States]]'':&lt;ref&gt;256 USR 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Web. &lt;http://www.cpexecutive.com/newsletters/capitalmarkets-newsletter/financecolumn/five-ways-to-reduce-re-trades/1004026997.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; is the practice of [[Negotiation|renegotiating]] the purchase price of [[real property]] by the buyer after initially agreeing to purchase at a higher price.  Typically this occurs after the buyer gets the property under [[contract]] and during the period that it is performing [[due diligence]].  The buyer may raise a due diligence issue and demand a [[purchase price adjustment]] to a lower re-trade price.  The seller can be left in a bad situation where it must either accept the lower price or lose the sale and re-market the property.  Moreover, loss of the sale can affect an entire chain of related transactions (such as when the sale is a down-leg in a [[Internal Revenue Code section 1031|tax-deferred "1031" exchange]]), thereby increasing even further the pressure upon the seller to accept the lower price in order to salvage the related transactions and avoid a [[ripple effect]].&lt;ref&gt;"What Is a Retrade?" Healthcare Mergers and Acquisitions Blog. N.p., 6 Oct. 2011. Web. 7 July 2015. &lt;http://healthcaretransactionsgroup.blogspot.com/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a due diligence period is to allow the buyer to fully investigate all of the claims, [[Warranty | warranties]], and representations a seller has made.  There are times when buyers are justified in seeking an adjustment, as in the case of a discovery that certain deal fundamentals are not supportable under the scrutiny of the buyer's due diligence.  Other times, however, buyers may seek to utilize perceived leverage in a transaction to drive the price down.&lt;ref&gt;Steven H. Sneiderman, What's a retrade, and how do I prevent one? Crain's Cleveland Business http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20130206/BLOGS05/130209898/whats-a-retrade-and-how-do-I-prevent-one Retrieved April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the buyer fails to turn up anything significant, but still wants to lower the price.  

In troubled real estate markets, like that experienced in the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s, it was common for some buyers to intentionally misuse the due diligence process and to initially offer a higher price than they are actually willing to pay in order to control the property and renegotiate later.  This strategy preyed upon the desperation of sellers and the paucity of buyers in the market.    

Some sophisticated sellers are adopting the strategy of refusing to renegotiate so as not to reward the practice and to discourage re-trade buyers. On the other side of the purchase/sale transaction, some buyers attempt to distinguish themselves from the practice and pride themselves as having a strict "no re-trade" policy, touting that they do all their due diligence up front and don't demand last minute purchase price reductions.  See, for example, [[AIC Ventures LP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10479">{{Conflict of laws}}

In [[Private international law|conflict of laws]], '''renvoi''' (from the [[French language|French]], meaning "send back" or "to return unopened") is a subset of the [[choice of law]] rules and it may be applied whenever a forum [[court]] is directed to consider the law of another [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]].

==The procedure for conflict cases==
#The court must first decide whether it has the [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case (which will involve addressing the question of whether the [[plaintiff]] is attempting to manipulate the judicial system by [[forum shopping]]).
#[[Characterisation (conflict)|Characterisation]]. The court must analyse the case as pleaded and allocate each component to its appropriate legal classification, each of which will have one or more [[choice of law]] rules attached to it.
#The court will then apply the choice of law rules. In a limited number of cases, usually involving [[Family Law]] issues, an [[incidental question]] may arise which will complicate this process.

==Discussion==
To limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law be applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.

But if that second country actually has choice of law rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a ''Single Renvoi'' system. A single renvoi forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, [[equality of outcome]] is always achieved so long as the competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. ''Forgo's Case'' (1882) and ''Soulié's Case'' (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the ''Introductory Law of the German Civil Code'' (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no renvoi system or single renvoi systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem.

Hence, there is another system called ''Double Renvoi'' or the ''Foreign Courts Doctrine'' which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other relevant law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single renvoi system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach.

==Application of renvoi==
Because the doctrine is considered difficult and its results are sometimes unpredictable, its application has generally been limited to:
*the validity of wills and intestate succession (the validity of transfers of real property); and
*retrospective legitimation by the [[marriage]] of the natural parents (validity of divorce decrees).

However, there are indications in some states that it might also apply to two issues in [[family law]], namely the capacity to marry and the formal validity of marriage.

===EU===
In the [[European Union]], application of renvoi is expressly excluded in contract cases under article 20 of the [[Rome I Regulation]] (regulation (EC) 593/2008l formerly in Article 15 EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, Rome 1980). It has also been rejected for contracts by most Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v. Kuwait Insurance Co'' [1984] 1 A.C. 50 (H.L.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states also exclude it in tort cases e.g. in the UK section 9(5) of the [[Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995]]. Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the [[Rome II Regulation]]) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides:'' "The application of the law of any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law."'' hence excluding the possibility of renvoi throughout the EU in tort cases.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the doctrine of renvoi was revived by the decision of the High Court in ''Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd'' [2005] HCA 54 (29 September 2005).  In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China.  Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred.  Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or ''[[lex loci delicti]]'' governs [[tort]] situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: ''Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang'').  This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China.  However under [[Chinese law]], the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the [[Statute of limitations|limitations period]] (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China).  However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law.  Article 146 provided that:

"With regard to compensation for damages resulting from an infringement of rights, the law of the place in which the infringement occurred shall be applied. If both parties are nationals of the same country or domiciled in the same country, the law of their own country or of their place of domicile may also be applied"

As a consequence, the Supreme Court trial judge concluded that Art 146 "gives me a right to choose to apply the law of [[Australia]] because both parties are nationals of Australia."  This decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.

On appeal to the High Court, Neilson succeeded.  In six separate judgments, the majority of the High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong.  Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer [[statute]] barred.

This decision has received strident criticism by Martin Davies,&lt;ref&gt;''Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Limited'':  Renvoi and Presumptions about Foreign Law (2006) 30(1) ''[[Melbourne University]] Law Review'' 244&lt;/ref&gt; and both the High Court and Full Court decisions have received very close attention by leading contemporary conflicts scholars including Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll,&lt;ref&gt;''Ignored No More'':  Renvoi and International Torts Litigated in Australia (2005) 1(1) ''Journal of Private International Law'' 35&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Crawford,&lt;ref&gt;The Uses of Putativity and Negativity in the conflict of laws (2005) 54 ''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'' 829&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Keyes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Doctrine of Renvoi in International Torts: Mercantile Mutual Insurance v Neilson (2005) 13 ''Torts Law Journal'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the "forum most interested" analysis. However, since ''John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson'' (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the ''lex loci delicti''.

===US===
In the [[United States]] most courts try to solve conflict of laws questions without invoking renvoi.  ''In Re Schneider's Estate'', 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where renvoi is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court.  This is most likely to happen in cases involving immovable property or domestic relationships.

==The main difficulties==
There are three main difficulties in cases where renvoi may be an issue:
#It gives undue weight to the evidence of the experts on foreign laws.
#The reference to the conflicts system used in other laws may reveal differences that would have arisen in [[characterisation]] or in the [[choice of law]] rules to be applied. If these differences would lead to onward transmissions, the forum court will follow the references into third (or further) legal systems. This is unpopular because it requires the parties and the court to consider evidence of multiple legal systems.
#There may be an "inextricable circle" between sets of laws using either single or double renvoi systems which do not have adequate safeguards built in to guarantee when to stop accepting remissions.

'''Robert Egerton''' (22 May 1915 - 25 September 2000) was a legal and social reform campaigner known for his work in advocating [[legal aid]].

==Early life==
Son of a Mancunian cloth manufacturer, he was educated at Oundle and Cambridge. In his early career, Egerton worked as an articled clerk on [[Wallis Simpson]]’s (of Edward and Mrs Simpson) divorce. He was later asked to work on the [[Kray twins]] defence, which he declined.

==Career==
His major work was in social legal reform.  As a solicitor and conscientious objector he attended a course at Toynbee Hall&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criminallawandjustice.co.uk/news/%E2%80%9CPoor-Man%E2%80%99s-Lawyer-Service%E2%80%9D-Celebrates-115-Years&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently  worked as a "poor man’s lawyer" firstly in a basement in [[Fitzroy Square]], London and afterwards at Cambridge house settlement in Camberwell.  After two years of this work he saw the need for a greatly extended legal aid system. He researched in the Law Society Library and the [[Reading Room of the British Museum]], devising questionnaires to send out to assess the existing provisions. He published his findings to form the basis of a comprehensive Legal Aid system in a book “Legal Aid” published by Kegan Paul,&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3179448&lt;/ref&gt; He championed the case for a more accessible legal system through this and other writing including an article in the ''[[Spectator Magazine|Spectator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/1st-february-1975/14/on-not-going-to-law&lt;/ref&gt;

Egerton attended the [[House of Lords]] to give oral evidence. A report came out in 1946 in which the principle of comprehensive system was endorsed. The [[Legal Aid and Advice Act]] was passed in 1949. He was then asked by [[Sir George Hayes]] – Director of the National Council for Social Service to be honorary legal advisor to the [[National Citizen’s Advice Bureau]]. Egerton later became the Vice Chair of the National Council of the Citizen’s Advice Bureau. During his time in this post he dealt with concern over legal advice offered by CAB workers and dealt with legal profession issues. He was a member of the Lord Chancellor’s Departmental Committee (the [[Payne Committee]])&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1968/jan/24/payne-committee-report&lt;/ref&gt; to abolish imprisonment for the non-payment of debt. He also served on the National Council for Social Service on Charitable fundraising.

Egerton also was president of the [[Westminster Law Society]] and set up the London branch of the Small Claims Court – an initiative introduced in Manchester.

For the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) tax or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] tax in the United States, the '''Social Security Wage Base''' (SSWB) is the maximum earned gross income or upper threshold on which a wage earner's Social Security tax may be imposed. The Social Security tax is one component of the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] (FICA) and [[Self-employment tax]], the other component being the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] tax. It is also the maximum amount of covered wages that are taken into account when [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings|average earnings]] are calculated in order to determine a worker's [[Primary Insurance Amount|Social Security benefit]].

In 2018, the Social Security Wage Base was $128,400 and the Social Security tax rate was 6.20% paid by the employee and 6.20% paid by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;Publication 15, ''Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E)'' (April. 2018), p. 23, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with $10,000 of gross income had $620.00 withheld as Social Security tax from his check and the employer sent an additional $620.00. A person with $130,000 of gross income in 2017 incurred Social Security tax of $7,886.40 (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 6.07% - the rate was lower because the income was more than the 2017 "wage base", see below), with $7,886.40 paid by the employer. A person who earned a million dollars in wages paid the same $7,886.40 in Social Security tax (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 0.79%), with equivalent employer matching. In the cases of the $130k and $1m earners, each paid the same amount into the social security system, and both will take the same out of the social security system.

==Details==

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] considers the employer share of taxes to be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid, and counts them as part of the employees’ tax burden.&lt;ref name="cbo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979 to 2005| url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-11-historicaltaxrates.pdf| publisher=Congressional Budget Office| date=December 2007| accessdate=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-employed individuals pay the entire amount of applicable tax.

When an employee works for several different companies during a tax year, his or her Social Security deductions could exceed the cap, because each employer may not know how much the employee has already paid in Social Security tax in other jobs. The Social Security tax coverage will be calculated on his or her personal return, and any excess is applied towards his or her Federal taxes. For example, in 2017 an employee works two jobs (either concurrently or consecutively) paying $70,000 each. Since each employer calculates the social security taxes independently, each employer will withhold 6.2% of the $70,000 employee’s salary, or $4,340, for a grand total of $8,680 -- which exceeds the cap of $7,886.40 by $739.60. The over-payment would be entered on the applicable line of Form 1040 and, assuming the employee did not owe any other Federal taxes, would be refunded to the employee. The employers who each paid $4,340 will not get a refund, since they are not aware that the employee overpaid in aggregate for the year. The government keeps the $818.40 overage. Even if the employers become aware of the overpayment, there is no method to claim the overpayment.

Several occupations are exempted from the current cap with a far lower cap, such as food service employees and domestic help employees. For the year 2014, the cap was $6,500 in wages.

(*) The maximum employee share in 2011 is reduced to $4,485.60, but the maximum employer share remains at $6,621.60. The maximum employee share in 2012 is reduced to $4,624.20, but the maximum employer share remains at $6,826.20.  Effectively, this was a 4.2% rate charged to the employee, and 6.2% rate to the employer.  This resulted in an approximately 40/60 split but reduced the total contribution.
See [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html here] for a complete historical list of the Social Security Wage Base.

(**) Since 1990, the employer &amp; employee share has usually been 6.2% each for a 50/50 split of the 12.4% combined total. The changes shown below applied In 2011 and 2012 when the rates were temporarily lowered to 4.2% for the employee (but remained at 6.2% for the employer). In 2013, the employee rate returns to 6.2% for a 50/50 split with the employer and a higher Maximum Contribution. For self-employed people, the 2013 guidance from SSA indicates the full rate OASDI is 12.4% for 2013.  [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html See footnote a. at 2013 SSA.gov link]. Returning to the traditional 6.2% OASDI employee share for 2013 effectively reduces take home pay by 2% and increases the maximum OASDI contribution by the same amount, returning it to traditional levels. The dip in the maximum OASDI contributions for 2011 and 2012 causes the 2013 rate to appear as a spike, when in fact it is a return to the levels imposed in the years 1990 through 2010.

Note that although self-employed individuals pay 12.4%, this is mitigated two ways. First, half of the amount of the tax is reduced from salary before figuring the tax (you don't pay Social Security tax on the tax your employer pays for you.)  Second, the "employer" half is an adjustment to income on the front page of Form 1040. 

===Employee Contribution changes in 2011===
As part of the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2008]] enacted on December 17, 2010, the employee Social Security tax rate is reduced from 6.2% to 4.2% for wages paid during the year 2011 and 2012.  The employer Social Security tax rate and the Social Security Wage Base were not directly impacted by this act, though they did change; only the employee's tax rate changes.  This is reflected in the above table, showing the reduction from $6,621.60 to $4,485.60.

==Use in pension plans==
Because taxes and benefits are based only on earnings up to the SSWB, pension plans can base contributions and or benefits in greater degree on earnings above the SSWB (excess plans) or reduce benefits or contributions below the SSWB (offset plans).

The pension compensation nondiscrimination laws (Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(4)) require that qualified pension plans not discriminate in benefits, rights and features in favor of ''highly compensated employees'' (in 2007, the threshold is $100K of 2006 gross pay including bonuses and overtime). Because Social Security provides a progressive benefit formula and stops taxation at the SSWB, pension plans may ''integrate'' benefits or contributions according to a wage base, frequently at a fraction (e.g. 50%) of the SSWB.

===Defined contribution plans ===
Plans can contribute a higher percentage to base salaries above an integration base.  If that integration base is identical to the SSWB the contributions may be double above the base not to exceed 5.7% for excess plans.  For offset plans the defined-contribution plan may base contributions on total base salary and then reduce or "offset" the contribution rate for salary below the integration base.  If the integration base for such offset plans is identical to the SSWB, then the reduction could be up to 5.7%.

===Defined benefit plans ===
For defined benefit plans the integration base is a career average of the SSWB for each year of the worker's career, which in pension law is called "covered compensation" base.  Under pension law, the SSWB may not be projected to increase in the future so a new hire's covered compensation base would contain all future years at the current year's SSWB.  Excess and offset plans also exist for defined-benefit plans.

'''Sub-irrigated planter''' ('''SIP''') is a generic name for a special type of planting box used in [[container garden]]ing and commercial landscaping. A SIP is any method of watering plants where the water is introduced from the bottom, allowing the water to soak upwards to the plant through [[capillary action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantertechnology.com/train/faq_cont.html Sub-irrigated planter FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913214632/http://www.plantertechnology.com/train/faq_cont.html |date=2008-09-13 }}, from Planter Technology&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to automate the watering and thus SIPs are popular with professional landscapers in buildings or urban settings. SIPs are available as products, under brand names such as Planter Technology (commercial) and EarthBox (consumer), Ollie Plant Sipper (consumer), Octopot (consumer), The Refuge Garden (consumer/commercial) or as [[do-it-yourself]] projects made from plastic buckets and boxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenroofgrowers.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-make-two-bucket-sub-irrigated.html How To Make a Two Bucket Sub-Irrigated Planter]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages of closed systems like Earth Boxes and SIPs is that soluble salts cannot be flushed into the lower soil profile and build up over time.&lt;ref name="salts"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Potential For The Sequential Production Of Vegetables In The Field With The ‘Earth Box’ System |journal=Acta Hortic |year=1998 |last=Csizinszky |first=A.A. |volume=513 |pages=137–144 |doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.1998.513.16 |url=http://www.actahort.org/books/513/513_16.htm |accessdate=2016-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21826">The definition of '''Taiwanese identity''' has been an ongoing issue for several decades arising from the political rivalry between [[Taiwan]] (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Taiwanese are frustrated by the political rivalry which is the cause of confusion both inside and outside Taiwan.

== Identity from a historic perspective ==

=== Qing Empire ===
{{See also|Taiwan under Qing rule|Kingdom of Tungning}}

Of the 23 million people in Taiwan, most are descendants of immigrants from [[Fujian]] and identify themselves as [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] whilst 15% are descendants of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] from [[Guangdong]] (Canton) and also [[Fujian]]. Periodic migrations started before the 12th century. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition to the [[Taiwanese aborigines]], it is primarily the descendants of the early immigrants from the province of Fujian in China.  The ancestors of these people were laborers that crossed the [[Taiwan Strait]] to work on plantations for the [[Taiwan under Dutch rule|Dutch]]. It is believed that some of these male laborers married aborigine women, creating a new small ethnic group of mixed people.  In 1683, the [[Qing Empire]], which controlled China, conquered Taiwan. The Qing ceded Taiwan to the Japanese in 1895.

=== Empire of Japan ===
{{Main|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}
Japan took control of Taiwan when China, then under the control of the [[Qing Dynasty]] since its conquest in 1683, lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese rule of Taiwan lasted from 1895 until 1945, when Japan was defeated by the allied forces at the end of World War II. Taiwanese perceptions of the Japanese are significantly more favorable than perceptions in other parts of [[East Asia]], partly because during its 50 years (1895&amp;ndash;1945) of Japanese rule Japan developed Taiwan's economy and raised the standard of living for most Taiwanese citizens, building up Taiwan as a supply base for the Japanese main islands. Later Taiwanese also adopted Japanese names and practice [[Shinto]], while the schools instilled a sense of "Japanese spirit" in students. By the time of [[World War II]] began, many ethnic Taiwanese were proficient in both [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]], while keeping their unique identity. Many Taiwanese were conscripted by the Japanese army to aid in their military campaigns against China. Many Taiwanese units, alongside the regular Japanese army, took part in some of the most noteworthy campaigns of that time against China, including the [[Nanking Massacre]].

Towards the last decade of the Japanese rule, the occupation force started a systematic campaign of {{nihongo||皇民化|Kōminka|Transformation into Imperial subjects}} to instill the {{nihongo|"Japanese spirit"|大和魂|[[Yamato damashii]]}} to assimilate ethnic Taiwanese into imperial subjects of the Japanese empire. This process was stopped when Japan was defeated at the end of World War II, ending efforts on the part of the Japanese forces, to integrate Taiwan, as with [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaidō]], into the Japanese empire. During this last decade, Taiwanese were encouraged to adopt Japanese names. Many older generation Taiwanese have fond memories of the Japanese rule in comparison to the later KMT occupation.

After the Republic of China relocated its capital to [[Taipei]] in 1949, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] intended to eventually return to Mainland China and retake control of it. In order to do this, the KMT attempted to "[[sinicize]]" the Taiwanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan’s Evolving Identity | url =https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-evolution-taiwanese-national-identity Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government's legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese.

It indeed pushed the US to conclude a mutual security treaty with the ROC since they did not want the Communists to take over the island. Thus protected by the US, the people on Taiwan continued developing their own identity, separate from mainland China.

In 1979, diplomatic relationships between the US and the ROC broke down, and more and more governments started to view the PRC as the sole government of China. Thus, the ROC's political focus gradually shifted its attention from mainland China to the island of Taiwan, and many citizens started to consider themselves as part of a [[nation]], separate from mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/wp-2004-01.htm |title=New National Identity Emerges in Taiwan |publisher=Washington Post |date=2004-01-02 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first transition of power from the KMT occurred in 2000 when [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] won the presidential election. His efforts favoring [[Taiwan independence]] included advocacy of [[One Country on Each Side]]; referendums on [[Taiwanese cross-Strait relations referendum, 2004|Cross-Strait relations]], [[Taiwanese transitional justice referendum, 2008|transitional justice]], and [[Taiwanese United Nations membership referendums, 2008|United Nations membership for Taiwan]]; along with the abolishment of the [[National Unification Council]]. In recent years, there has been a trend, known as [[Taiwanization]], to emphasize the importance of Taiwan's culture rather than to regard Taiwanese as solely an appendage of [[China]]. The movement stems from the continued hostility displayed by the [[People's Republic of China]] towards Taiwan independence and the memory of the Chinese-controlled [[Kuomintang]] occupation. This involves the teaching of [[history of Taiwan]], [[Taiwanese geography|geography]], and [[culture of Taiwan|culture]] from a Taiwan-centric perspective, as well as promoting languages locally established in Taiwan, including [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]] and [[Formosan languages|aboriginal languages]].

The place of Taiwanese identity (台灣人) in relation to the Chinese identity (華人) has been a matter of intense debate.  While pro-[[Cross-Strait Unification|unification]] Taiwanese (海外華人) prefer to think of the Taiwanese identity as a subset of the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as a component of the [[Chinese diaspora]] (海外華人 or 華裔), pro-independence Taiwanese place the Taiwanese identity outside the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as (海外台灣人 or 台裔).

While the concept of Taiwanese identity was originally limited of the [[Taiwan independence]] movement, it is now endorsed by some supporters of [[Cross-Strait unification]] on Taiwan in a rejection of a monolithic officially sponsored [[Han Chinese]] identity in favor of one rooted in a unique, Taiwan-centric culture.

A new term, known as "'''Republic of China People'''" (中華民國人）is used to resolve the national identity crisis (pertaining to the diverse ethnic groups living in Taiwan, as well as Penghu, Kinmen and other minor islands, as well as overseas Taiwanese/Chinese who are still holding the Republic of China citizenship). It appeared particularly during the 2011 celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the [[Republic of China]].

== Taiwanese opinion ==
Polls conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in 2001 found that 70% of Taiwanese would support a name change of the country to Taiwan if the island could no longer be referred to as the Republic of China.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1993608.stm | title = Taiwan's identity crisis | publisher = BBC News | author = Michael Bristow | date = 17 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, especially after the 1990s, there has been a growth in the number of people identifying themselves as Taiwanese. In polls conducted by the [[National Chengchi University]] back in 1991, only 13.6% of respondents identified themselves as Taiwanese. This figure rose to 45.7% in 2004. In contrast, the number of respondents that identified themselves as Chinese was 43.9% in 1991 and fell to just 6.3% in 2004. Half of respondents responded with dual-identity, both Chinese and Taiwanese, and the statistic has remained steady with just a slight decline from 49.7% in 1992 to 45.4% in 2004.&lt;ref name="Chang2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/03/12/2003296948 |title='Taiwan identity' growing: study |work=Taipei Times |author=Chang |first=Rich |date=12 Mar 2006 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Academia Sinica]] conducted a survey between 1992 and 2004 to further explore the identity issue by asking questions such as whether people would support independence if it wouldn't result in war, and whether Taiwan should unite with China if there were no political, economic or social differences between the two sides. Results showed that a third of respondents maintained "double-identities" over the years whilst a similar number of respondents were "Taiwanese nationalists" (those that would never support unification with China even if there were no differences with China). This number doubled as a result of provocation from the PRC in the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|1996 missile crisis]]. There has been a sharp decline in "Chinese nationalist" (those that would support unification with China if the social conditions were the same as Taiwan) from 40% to 15%.&lt;ref name="Chang2006"/&gt; The opinion of Taiwanese continues to change, reflecting the problem of national identity which is easily affected by political, social and economic circumstances.

In a poll dated June 2009,  52.1% of Taiwan's population consider themselves to be only Taiwanese while 39.2% consider themselves to be both Taiwanese and Chinese and only 4.4% consider themselves to be Chinese only.[http://esc.nccu.edu.tw/newchinese/data/TaiwanChineseID.htm].

In a poll dated 2016 about 78% see themselves as Taiwanese only, 20% as both and only 2% see themselves as Chinese only.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Different perspectives of history ==

During the period of Martial Law, when the Kuomintang (KMT) was the only authorised party to govern Taiwan, the KMT government has "modified" Taiwan's history from a [[Greater China]] perspective and lump the pre-existing [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] with the [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]] as ''Chinese'', who came to Taiwan and forced aboriginal communities into the mountains. The early Hoklo and Hakka who arrived in Taiwan have intermarried with lowland aborigines in Taiwan. Also, due to several government factions that ruled Taiwan prior to Japanese rule, many lowland aborigines were forcefully assimilated, and it was in their incentives to ''pass'' as [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]].

Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Brown 2004]. pp. 156-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between "short-route" and "long-route".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=long+route+han&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MtpJVOqAO--LsQTBxYLoDA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=long%20route%20han&amp;f=false Brown 2004]. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic identity of assimilated Plains Aboriginals in the immediate vicinity of Tainan was still known since a pure Hoklo Taiwanese girl was warned by her mother to stay away from them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q=wall&amp;f=false Brown 2004]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The insulting name "fan" was used against Plains Aborigines by the Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/06/15/2003592824&lt;/ref&gt; Hoklo Taiwanese has repalced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/26/2003415773&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal status has been requested by Plains Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/07/15/2003595134&lt;/ref&gt;

The deep-rooted hostility between [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities' effective KMT networks contribute to Aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the Aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damm|first1=Jens|editor1-last=Damm|editor1-first=Jens|editor2-last=Lim|editor2-first=Paul|title=European perspectives on Taiwan|date=2012|publisher=Springer VS|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783531943039|page=95|chapter=Multiculturalism in Taiwan and the Influence of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; But since 2016, Aboriginals started to vote for the DPP instead of the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2014/11/30/dpp-vote-share-in-aboriginal-townships/|title=DPP vote share in Aboriginal townships|date=2014-11-30|website=Frozen Garlic|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalia.info/new/10792/taiwan-president-to-apologize-to-aboriginal-people-promises-law-on-autonomy|title=Taiwan president to apologize to Aboriginal people, promises law on autonomy|work=Nationalia|access-date=2017-04-10|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity ==

{{Main|Taiwanese nationalism}}

Supporters of [[Taiwan Independence]] recognize themselves to be Taiwanese only and reject the designation "Zhongguoren 中國人" (Chinese national or Chinese). In particular, they have emphasized that, politically and legally, they are not Chinese. A portion of Taiwanese feel that the country's official name [[Republic of China]] has legally imposed upon them the identity of Chinese national, and therefore are discontent to a certain degree, thus wishing to seek [[Taiwan Independence]]. However, the majority of the supporters of [[Taiwan Independence]] do not deny themselves as "huaren 華人" (ethnic Chinese) or "huayi 華裔" (person of Chinese descent), meaning that they seek more of a political and legal separation from the Chinese national identity, rather than one based on a cultural or ancestral separation. This forms part of the [[Taiwanese nationalism]] ideology.

Before the 1990s, more than half of Taiwanese population recognized themselves as "Zhongguoren 中國人' (Chinese national or Chinese) or "both Taiwanese and Chinese". However, with the increasing exchange of information between [[mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]], particularly with the rise of the Chinese internet, which has inclined more in favor of the [[People's Republic of China]], the Taiwanese have strengthened the [[Taiwan localization movement]] as a response and rejection of the unification propaganda war from the [[People's Republic of China]]. Thus, by 2008, the proportion identifying themselves as Chinese has dropped while the proportion identifying as "Taiwanese but not Chinese" has increased.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Since the term "China" has become identified with the [[People's Republic of China]], Taiwanese who hate [[Chinese nationalism]] do not recognize themselves as Chinese nationals. The negative image of the [[Fenqing]] (angry youth) from the [[People's Republic of China]] on the internet who have pursued aggressive Chinese nationalism, and their threats to freedom, human rights, and democracy in [[Taiwan]] are the main reasons many Taiwanese do not identify themselves as Chinese nationals or Chinese. In response, Taiwanese Fenqing or angry youth have resorted to pursuing aggressive [[Taiwanese nationalism]] in retaliation against the Fenqing from the PRC on the internet.&lt;ref name="TVBS民意調查中心, polls from TVBS"&gt;[http://www.tvbs.com.tw/FILE_DB/DL_DB/even/200806/even-20080610175239.pdf TVBS民意調查中心, polls from TVBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 ''Global Views Monthly''(遠見雜誌) poll, Taiwanese who recognized themselves as "Chinese national" (Zhongguoren 中國人) constitute 46%, "Huaren 華人" (ethnic Chinese) or "[[Zhonghua minzu]]" (中華民族; Chinese race) constitute 70%. In a poll conducted by [[TVBS]] in 2008, given the choice of only one between the two identities (and not both), "Taiwanese" or "Chinese", 68% chose Taiwanese, while only 18% chose Chinese.&lt;ref name="TVBS民意調查中心, polls from TVBS"/&gt;

Many Taiwanese wish to change the [[sovereign state|state]]'s official name from [[Republic of China]] to [[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]], in order to separate the identity and conceptual link between the two sides of the strait. However, this viewpoint has been strongly opposed by supporters of [[Chinese nationalism]] from the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]].

'''Tanistry''' is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] system for passing on titles and lands.  In this system the '''Tanist''' ({{lang-ga|[[Tánaiste]]}}; {{lang-gd|Tànaiste}}; {{lang-gv|Tanishtey}}) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[patrilineal]] dynasties of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Isle of Man|Mann]], to succeed to the [[Chiefs of the Name|chieftainship]] or to the [[kingship]].

==Origins==
Historically the Tanist was chosen from among the heads of the ''roydammna'' or "righdamhna" (literally, those of ''kingly material'') or, alternatively, among all males of the ''[[Sept (social)|sept]]'', and elected by them in full assembly.  The eligibility was based on patrilineal relationship, which meant the electing body and the eligibles were [[agnate]]s with each other.  The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon male-line descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Early Irish laws and institution'' (1934) Eoin MacNeill stated that, according to the annal evidence, tanistry originated only about century after the Anglo-Norman invasion, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; A story about [[Cormac mac Airt]] refers to his eldest son as his Tanist.  Following his murder by a member of the [[Deisi]], another ''roydammna'', [[Eochaid Gonnat]], succeeded as king.

In Ireland, the tanistry continued among the dominant dynasties, as well as lesser lords and chieftains, until the mid-16th/early 17th century when it was replaced by English common law.&lt;ref&gt;''Case of Tanisrry'' (1608), Davis 28 180 E.R 516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGinty,M. 2017 Tanistry, primogeniture and divided clans https://soundcloud.com/history-hub/matthew-mcginty-tanistry-primogeniture-and-divided-clans?in=history-hub/sets/2017-tudor-and-stuart-ireland&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1943 Ireland appointed its first new [[Chief Herald of Ireland|Chief Herald]], it did not reintroduce tanistry. The state granted courtesy recognition to Irish chiefs based on [[primogeniture]] from the last known chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/register.htm |title=Irish Chiefs: Historical Background and a Register |work=Irish Chiefs |publisher=Centre for Irish Genealogical and Historical Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaels exported tanistry and other customs to those parts of Scotland which they controlled after 400 [[Common Era|CE]].  The [[Picts]] (the other indigenous people of today's [[Scotland]]), did not share the succession principles of their neighbours of Ireland and Scottish Gaels.  No female succession, or male succession via female lines, is allowed in the Irish and Gaelic succession model.  By contrast, Pictish succession often used links through females (maternal grandson was apparently preferred heir to grandfather; and/or maternal nephew to uncle in Pictish custom).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic]] or male line of the ''Siol Alpein'' ([[House of Alpin]]) until the accession of [[Malcolm II of Scotland|King Malcolm II]] in 1005. This monarch was the first to introduce the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland.  He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the [[elective monarchy|elective law]], which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the Throne.  Since Malcolm had only daughters, he also introduced the right of female-line succession in Scotland.  This gave rise to conflict by competitors for generations thereafter. The Irish monarchies never at any stage allowed for female line succession, a position which is maintained to the present day.

==Candidates and functions==
{{Essay-like|section|date=June 2018}}
The Tanist held office for life and was required by custom to be of full age, in possession of all his faculties and without any remarkable blemish of mind or body. At the same time, and subject to the same conditions, a tanist or next heir to the Monarchy was elected, who if the king died or became disqualified, at once became king. Most usually a former king's son became tanist (sometimes the son of the king simultaneously elected, however perhaps more often a son of a rival branch of the dynasty), but not because the system of [[primogeniture]] was in any way recognised; indeed, the only principle adopted was that the dignity of chieftainship should descend to the eldest and most worthy of the same male-line blood of the clan.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Image:Flag of Ulster.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Ulster]] with the [[Red Hand of Ulster|Red Hand]].]]
The usual rules for qualification as a ''roydammna'' was that a candidate had to be a member of the ''[[Derbfine|"Derbfhine"]]'', a kindred all descended in the male line from a common ancestor (usually a great-grandfather). This is recalled in the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of representatives of the many clans and septs descended from the [[Uí Néill]] royal dynasty, many of which feature the Red Hand. The joints in the fingers, the fingernails, and the hand, represented the four/five generations that qualified for inclusion within the ''Derbfhine''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This meant that the group became highly exclusive, keeping the kingship within the dynasty. Many in the wider clan might be reduced to gentry or peasant status (though they might share the surname). These features make tanistry an [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic succession]] mode, and a succession by appointment, as it was an [[elective monarchy]]. Tanistry evades the basic requirement of the [[hereditary monarchy]], i.e. that the outcome of the succession is predictable, up to the identity of successor and next heirs, by [[genealogy]].

The downside of the large group of eligibles was that increases in ''roydammna'' in each generation might lead to internecine dynastic civil war.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Such was the case among the descendants of King and High King [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1088–1156). His dynasty, the ''Sil Muirdeag'' (who took the surname hUa Conchobhair/O'Connor), had successfully ruled as [[List of kings of Connacht|Kings of Connacht]] since at least the mid-5th century. Their increasing consolidation via the annexation of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Meath|Mide]] and [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]], plus suborning neighboring states and lordships to vassalage, led to Tairrdelbach becoming the first of his dynasty to become High King.

Competition between Tairrdelbach's many sons caused corrosive warfare among at least four competing main lines, in addition to allied lordships' and kingdoms' striving for the main chance. Coupled with the incursions of the [[Normans]] from 1169 onwards, this fragmented Ó Conchobhar rule. By the early 16th century, they were reduced to ruling a fraction of their former patrimony.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Another example of ''Derbfhine'' or ''Roydammna'' proliferation comes from the ''[[Annals of Connacht]]''. It states that at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August 1316, in addition to King Tadc Ó Cellaig of [[Uí Maine]], "there fell with him ... twenty-eight men who were entitled to succeed to the kingship of Uí Maine."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Further points==
This system often led to rotation among the most prominent branches of the clan or the reigning house, particularly in the [[Middle Ages]]. Tanistry, though not necessarily intended to be so, was perceived to create balance between branches of family. A quite usual pattern was that the chief (king, lord) was succeeded by his Tanist, elected earlier and from another branch than that which the incumbent chief belonged to. Perhaps simultaneously upon that succession, a Tanist was elected from another branch, to fill the position vacated by the one now risen to chieftainship. He may have come from the branch to which the deceased belonged. The next vacancy would be handled in a similar way. If a chieftain attempted to have his own son (or brother) chosen over a representative of another branch, the electors were outraged, as they feared subjugation to one branch.

In 1296, the Bruce candidate to inherit the crown of Scotland pleaded the traditional tanistry in his favor. In terms of [[primogeniture]], he was from a cadet branch of the old royal descent, and thus would not have succeeded. The idea of rotation and balance (and his seniority in physical age and experience) made him a credible competitor. A Pictish aspect was that both the [[House of Balliol]] and Bruce descended through female lines from the royal house, and were allowed to present candidacy. Bruce also claimed tanistry through a female line. (This may be an indication that in Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. The judicial resolution of the succession quarrel, directed by the English king, favoured the Balliols on the basis of primogeniture. Subsequent political events reverted that result to a more "clannish-tradition" direction. [[Robert the Bruce]], grandson of the candidate who argued for tanistry, ascended the throne despite descending from a rather junior [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of the original Royal House. All future monarchs of Scotland after that succeeded by the rights of the Bruce.)

Tanistry as the system of succession left the headship open to the ambitious. It was a frequent source of strife both in families and between the clans, but it was conversely quasi-democratic. Tanistry was abolished by a legal decision during the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], who later was named James I of England and Ireland. The [[English land law]] was substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/2001/37.html#Heading3 |title=The Case of Tanistry (Le Case de Tanistry) |journal=Australian Indigenous Law Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of succession of the [[House of Alpin]] of [[list of Scottish monarchs|Scottish monarchs]] (a dynasty legendarily of mixed Pictish and Gaelic origin) and their successors, abided by tanistry rules until at least 1034. They also used them in certain successions in the 1090s, and tanistry was used as an argument in succession litigation as late as the 1290s. A similar system operated in [[Wales]], where under [[Welsh law]] any of the sons or brothers of the king could be chosen as the ''[[edling]]'' or heir to the kingdom.

==Current political uses==
The word is preserved in the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]], where the prime minister is the ''[[Taoiseach]]'' while the deputy prime minister is the ''[[Tánaiste]]''.

==Uses in literature and popular culture==
* The concept of the tanist or substitute for the [[sacred king]] was incorporated as a central element in Sir [[James Frazer]]'s study of European mythologies, ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.
* The figure of the tanist has appeared in modernist poetry, such as [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.
* The tanist influenced [[Robert Graves]]' interpretation of ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955) and ''[[The White Goddess]]''.
* In the "Proteus" episode of  ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[James Joyce]] used the term in an [[irony|ironic]] context.
* In the [[Deryni novels|Deryni novel]] ''[[The Bishop's Heir]]'' by [[Katherine Kurtz]], the character [[Dhugal MacArdry]] is Tanist of Clan MacArdry. After his actual parentage becomes more widely known (he is the only child of the secret marriage between then-Lord [[Duncan McLain]] and Lady Maryse MacArdry) late in ''[[The King's Justice]]'', Dhugal's gillie Ciard O Ruane tells [[Kelson Haldane|Kelson]] and Cardiel: "I canna' speak for the clan, Sair, but young Dhugal is ''my'' chief, an' will be sae long as he lives, whether he's Caulay's son or only his grandson. Th' borders inherit by tanistry. Dhugal was ''chosen'' as th' next chief, an' could hae been, even if he'd been nae blood relative to Caulay at all. I dinna' think yon Duke of Cassan [Duncan] can pass his title in th' same manner, however."
* In the "[[Sister Fidelma]]" series by [[Peter Tremayne]].
* In the [[Paradox Interactive]] Grand Strategy Game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' Tanistry is available as an optional succession law when playing as a ruler of the Celtic culture (Irish, Scottish, Breton or Welsh).

==Blood tanistry==
Blood tanistry is the principle that "the most talented male member of the royal dynasty should inherit the throne, commonly by murder and war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fletcher|Fletcher, Joseph]].  1979.  "Turco-Mongolian Monarchic Traditions in the [[Ottoman Empire]]”, ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 3: 236–251&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe the practical ramifications of the Turco-Mongol, as well as other [[Central Asian]] steppe [[nomad]], principles of inheritance and succession.  Because all male members of the royal clan are considered to have equally legitimate claims on power, the ruler is the individual who eliminates competitors and re-subjugates the rest of the state formation.  The structure may be determined by bonds of personal loyalty to the ruler, which are considered to be dissolved on the ruler's death.

{{Legislature}}
'''Tetracameralism''' ({{lang-el|tetra-}}, four + {{lang-la|camera}}, chamber) is the practice of having four legislative or [[parliamentary]] chambers. It is contrasted to [[unicameralism]] and [[bicameralism]], which are far more common, and [[tricameralism]], which is rarely used in government. No [[Sovereign state|state]] currently has a tetracameral system.

[[Medieval]] [[Scandinavia]]n [[Deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]] were traditionally tetracameral, with four estates; the [[nobility]], the [[clergy]], the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] and the [[peasants]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Riksdag of the Estates]] maintained this tradition the longest, having four separate legislative bodies. Finland, as a part of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] used the tetracameral [[Diet of Finland]] until 1906, when it was replaced by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Finnish Parliament|Parliament]].

The "'''thirty-year rule'''" is the informal name given to laws in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth of Australia that provide that certain government documents will be released publicly thirty years after they were created.  Other countries' national archives also adhere to a thirty-year rule for the release of government documents.

== United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Public Records Act 1958]] stated that "Public records...other than those to which members of the public have had access before their transfer...shall not be available for public inspection until they have been in existence for fifty years or such other period...as the Lord Chancellor may,...for the time being prescribe as respects any particular class of public records";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/51/section/5/enacted?view=plain UK Public Records Act 1958]&lt;/ref&gt; the closure period was reduced from fifty to thirty years by an [[Public Records Act 1967|amending act of 1967]], passed during [[Harold Wilson]]'s government. Among those who had repeatedly urged the scrapping of the fifty-year rule was the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]].

There were two elements to the rule: the first required that records be transferred from government departments to the [[Public Record Office]] (now [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]) after thirty years unless specific exemptions were given (by the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s [[Advisory Council on Public Records]]); the second that they would be opened to public access at the same time unless their release was deemed likely to cause "damage to the country's image, national security or foreign relations".

Significant changes were made to the rules as a consequence of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] (FOIA) (which came into full effect on 1 January 2005). FOIA essentially removed the second of the thirty-year rules (the access one), and replaced it with provisions allowing citizens to request a wide range of information before any time limit has expired; and also removed some of the exemptions which had previously applied at the thirty-year point. After thirty years, records are transferred to The National Archives, and are reviewed under FOIA to see if they should be opened. The only rationale for keeping them closed within The National Archives is if a FOIA exemption applies.

As a result of this change, releases now happen monthly, rather than annually, and include more recent events, rather than only those over thirty years old.

An independent inquiry chaired by [[Paul Dacre]], editor of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', recommended in January 2009 that the last restrictions on the release of information, such as [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] minutes, should be reduced to a fifteen-year embargo and phased in over a 15-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Summers [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/29/30-year-rule "30-year rule on government disclosure should be halved, Dacre inquiry says",] ''The Guardian'', 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Change to a twenty-year rule ===

Under the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]], the UK Government started moving towards a twenty-year rule.  Files from 1983 were released in August 2013 rather than January 2014 as would previously have been the case, and files from 1984 in January 2014.  There will continue to be two releases per year until 2022 when the National Archives will receive the files from 2001 and 2002, having caught up with the transition.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/20-year-rule.htm "20-year rule"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In Australia, the thirty-year rule applied to Commonwealth (federal) government records, except for [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] handbooks (closed for fifty years) and raw census records (closed for 99 years). These periods were set out in the ''Archives Act 1983''.

In 2009, the Archives Act was amended to reduce the closed period from thirty to twenty years, with Cabinet notebooks reduced from fifty to thirty years. Census records remain closed for 99 years to protect the privacy of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.gov.au/consultation/foi_reform/docs/FOI_reform_bill_2008-explanatory_memorandum.pdf|title=Explanatory Memorandum to Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Bill 2008|publisher=Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514121044/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/consultation/foi_reform/docs/FOI_reform_bill_2008-explanatory_memorandum.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet papers for a full year are released on 1 January each year. From 2011, two years of cabinet papers and three years of cabinet notebooks are released together until 2020 when the new periods are reached.

==Canada==

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has recognized that Cabinet confidentiality is essential to good government. In the decision ''[[Babcock v AG Canada]]''&lt;ref&gt;2002 SCC 57 at paragraph 18&lt;/ref&gt; the Court explained the reason as:&lt;ref name=tb&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/privacy/confidences-queen-privy-council-canada-cabinet-confidences.html canada.ca: "Confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (Cabinet confidences)"], 2014-04-30&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The process of democratic governance works best when Cabinet members charged with government policy and decision-making are free to express themselves around the Cabinet table unreservedly.}}
To preserve this rule of confidentiality, subsection 70(1) of the [[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]] provides that the Act does not apply to confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Other notable cases that expand upon the doctrine of cabinet confidentiality include ''Canada (Minister of Environment) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), 2003 FCA 68'' and ''Quinn v. Canada (Prime Minister), 2011 FC 379''.&lt;ref name=tb/&gt; As of 2013, after a time lag of 20 years Canadians can submit access-to-information requests for cabinet records through the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]], but this comes at a cost of $5 per request and can take months to process.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; In May 2018, it was disclosed that the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] under Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]] had placed a "50-year from the time they rule on a case" embargo on public access to files related to the deliberations of the judges.&lt;ref name=gam&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-supreme-court-of-canada-places-50-year-embargo-on-public-access-to/ theglobeandmail.com: "Supreme Court of Canada to keep records of deliberations secret for at least 50 years"], 14 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Archivist Michael Dufresne, it was not until 1940 and the advent of the [[Second World War]] that Cabinet kept an agenda and minutes of its deliberations.&lt;ref name=laccc&gt;[https://thediscoverblog.com/tag/government-records/ Library and Archives Canada Blog: "The beginning of the Conclusions: documenting the exercise of power"], 16 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; From 1867 to 1940, a succession of six men served as [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]], and their duties included serving as the only institutional memory bank of the Government of Canada. The appointment in 1940 of [[Arnold Heeney|Arnold Danforth Patrick Heeney]]&lt;ref&gt;''sic?''&lt;/ref&gt; as Clerk and as first Secretary to the Cabinet changed the format of memory bank from biological to scriptural. Heeney was surprised upon arrival by the informal ways in which important business was conducted:&lt;ref name=laccc/&gt;
{{cquote|I found it shattering to discover that the highest committee in the land conducted its business in such a disorderly fashion that it employed no agenda and no minutes were taken. The more I learned about Cabinet practices, the more difficult it was for me to understand how such a regime could function at all.}}

Order-in-Council PC 1940-1121 of March 25, 1940 ushered in a significant change in the documentation of government. The Order-in-Council read, in part:&lt;ref name=laccc/&gt;
{{cquote|The great increase in the work of the Cabinet... has rendered it necessary to make provision for the performance of additional duties of a secretarial nature relating principally to the collecting and putting into shape of agenda of Cabinet meetings, providing of information and material necessary for the deliberations of the Cabinet and the drawing up of records of the results, for communication to the departments concerned...}}

Heeney established procedures and for the first time recorded the minutes and conclusions of a cabinet body - the Cabinet War Committee.&lt;ref name=ccgc/&gt; In 1942, the Statutory Orders and Regulations Division was set up under PC 7992, 4 September 1942. Also under PC 7992, a registry for maintaining orders and minutes of council, Treasury Board Minutes and other government orders was established.&lt;ref name=ccgc&gt;[http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=1 "Archives Search"], 2018-05-20
&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1944 that the formal collection of "Cabinet Conclusions" was created.&lt;ref name=laccc/&gt;

In the early 1980s, the PCO began a voluntary transfer of cabinet records, which had been declassified after a 30-year holding period, to the National Archives (which became [[Library and Archives Canada]] in 2004) where they became publicly available,&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; under the label "Cabinet Conclusions".&lt;ref name=cc&gt;[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/cabinet-conclusions/Pages/cabinet-conclusions.aspx Library and Archives Canada: "Cabinet Conclusions"], 2018-02-16&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial document dump that included records dated from 1937 to 1952, the PCO released the records on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

In 2008, two years after Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] was elected, the tradition of annual voluntary releases of Cabinet Conclusions stopped.&lt;ref name=fb&gt;[http://o.canada.com/news/national/release-of-government-documents-backlogged canada.com: "Release of government documents backlogged"], 2 Sep 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 while the Harper government was in power, PCO spokesman Raymond Rivet told a news organisation that the office was “committed” to making government documents and information accessible but that “Processing these records requires a significant investment of resources. We will continue to process and release records as resources permit.”&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

In May 2017, it came to light that the Government of Canada was under no obligation to release documentary records after a number of years. [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Murray Rankin]], a legal scholar, said at the time:&lt;ref name=rankin&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/government-records-archives-history-1.4129935 cbc.ca: "Government accused of hoarding Canadian history in 'secret' archives"], 25 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|It's a question of political will. Some countries do this a lot better than Canada. The Americans do. The Swedes do. The British do. We have to catch up.}}

==Israel==
{{further|Israel State Archives}}

Israel adopted the British model of a thirty-year rule as the basis for reviewing and declassifying its foreign policy documents.&lt;ref name=Pappe&gt;{{cite book|last=Pappe|first=Ilan|title=The Israel/Palestine Question|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415169488|pages=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjuKhNEmFvoC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=thirty+year+rule+Israel+archives&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M1j9NZgmdT&amp;sig=yLVi0c0pEMIFNfD0uTP49CqVHNs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xsR_UIvGI8fWtAao2oCICQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thirty%20year%20rule%20Israel%20archives&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli declassification policy is based on the Archives law of 1955. The principle of the law is that all material is to be released after thirty years, subject to limitations based on damage to state security, foreign policy or personal privacy. In practice this means that declassification of documents are fixed at different periods based on type of material and date of production.&lt;ref name=LF&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Louise|title=8e Conference Internationale Des Editeurs de Documents Diplomatiques 8th International Conference of Editors of Diplomatic Documents: Des Etats Et de ... about States and Uno (Diplomatie Et Histoire)|year=2008|publisher=European Interuniversity Press|isbn=9052013896|pages=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfdDCiwZBY8C&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;ots=CPOPfmn3Gm&amp;dq=%22Archives%20Law%20of%201955%22%20Israel&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Archives%20Law%20of%201955%22%20Israel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original law has been modified and updated a number of times.&lt;ref name=LF/&gt; Following a 2010 update of the legislation, the office of the Prime Minister released as statement explaining that "the new regulations shorten the period after which non-security-related material may be viewed, from 30 to 15 years, while lengthening the confidentiality period of certain defense-related documents to 70 years in cases in which Israel's security conditions require it".&lt;ref name=HzBR&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=State archives to stay classified for 20 more years, PM instructs|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/state-archives-to-stay-classified-for-20-more-years-pm-instructs-1.304449|accessdate=2012-10-18|newspaper=Haaretz|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Federal Archives]] generally makes its holdings available after 30 years.  Exceptions are for personnel files, which are opened only 10 years after the death of the individual or 100 years after the person's birth if the date of death is unknown, and records dealing with taxation, credit, and banking, which are sealed for 60 years. 

Additionally, Federal Archives holdings originating with the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and communist organizations of the former [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) have been available for decades with almost no limitations.  The Federal Archives has also worked to make East German government records available with a minimum of time limitation.  In any event, in October 2020, 30 years will have passed since the [[German reunification|dissolution of the GDR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/benutzung/voraussetzungen/allgemeinehinweise/nutzungsbeschraenkungen/index.html.de|title=Fristen zur Benutzung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tortious interference''', also known as '''intentional interference with contractual relations''', in the [[common law]] of [[tort]]s, occurs when one person intentionally damages someone else's [[contract]]ual or business relationships with a third party causing economic harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ash|first1=Elliott T.|title=Intentional interference with contractual relations|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intentional_interference_with_contractual_relations|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, someone could use blackmail to induce a contractor into breaking a contract or they could obstruct someone's ability to honor a contract with a client by deliberately refusing to deliver necessary goods.&lt;ref name=FindLaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Tortious Interference|url=http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/liability-and-insurance/tortious-interference.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tort of negligent interference''' occurs when one party's [[negligence]] damages the contractual or business relationship between others, causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout that prevents the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=S.|first1=J. C.|title=Negligent Interference with Contract: Knowledge as a Standard for Recovery|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=June 1977|volume=63|issue=5|pages=813–839|doi=10.2307/1072614|jstor=1072614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Tortious interference with contract rights can occur when one party convinces another to [[Breach of contract|breach its contract]] with a third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods). The [[tortfeasor]] is the person who interferes with the contractual relationship between others. When a tortfeasor is aware of an existing contract and deliberately induces a breach by one of the contract holders, it is termed, "tortious inducement of breach of contract".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freehills|first1=Herbert Smith|title=Tort of inducement to breach of contract requires actual knowledge and an intention to interfere|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f0e1e1ff-bc35-4251-9935-31ef03e808d7|website=Lexology|accessdate=24 January 2017|date=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tortious interference with business relationships occurs where the tortfeasor intentionally acts to prevent someone from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships with others. This tort may occur when one party knowingly takes an action that causes a second party not to enter into a business relationship with a third party that otherwise would probably have occurred. An example is when a tortfeasor offers to sell a property to someone below market value knowing they were in the final stages of a sale with a third party pending the upcoming [[closing (real estate)|settlement date]] to formalize the sale writing. Such conduct is termed "tortious interference with a business expectancy".&lt;ref name=FindLaw/&gt;

The above situation are actionable only if someone with actual knowledge of, and intent to interfere with, an existing contract or expectancy between other parties, acts improperly with malicious intent and actually interferes with the contract/expectancy, causing economic harm.&lt;ref name=FindLaw/&gt; Historically, there has not been actionable cause if the interference was merely {{em|negligent}}.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint'', 175 U.S. 303 (1927) (lost profits held remote damage); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766C (1979). See also ''Venhaus v. Shultz'', 155 Cal. App. 4th 1072, 1079—1080, 66 Cal. Rptr. 3d 432 (2007) ("[W]e have been directed to no California authority, and have found none, for the trial court’s conclusion that the wrongful conduct must be intentional or willful. The defendant’s conduct must ‘fall outside the boundaries of fair competition’.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. but negligent misconduct or the violation of a statutory obligation suffice.") (internal citations omitted.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some jurisdictions recognize such claims,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Union Oil Co. v. Oppen'', 501 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1974) (holding negligent interference with prospective advantage actionable when risk of harm was foreseeable); ''In re Kinsman Transit Co.'', 388 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 1968) (dictum: stating that negligent interference with contract should receive same legal treatment as other negligent acts); ''J’Aire Corp. v. Gregory'', 24 Cal. 3d 799, 804, 157 Cal. Rptr. 407, 598 P.2d 60 (1979) (“Where a special relationship exists between the parties, a plaintiff may recover for loss of expected economic advantage through the ''negligent'' performance of a contract although the parties were not in contractual privity.”) (emphasis supplied); ''Settimo Associates v. Environ Systems, Inc.'', 14 Cal. App. 4th 842, 845, 17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 757 (1993) (“The tort of intentional ''or negligent'' interference with prospective economic advantage imposes liability for improper methods of disrupting or diverting the business relationship of another which fall outside the boundaries of fair competition.”) (emphasis supplied) (internal citation omitted). There used to be California authority that no cause of action exists for negligent interference with contractual relations. See ''Fifield Manor v. Finston'', 54 Cal.&amp;nbsp;2d 632, 636—637, 7 Cal. Rptr. 377, 354 P.2d 1073 (1960). But the ''J'Aire'' decision, ''supra'', appears to have overruled ''Fifield''. Nevertheless, however illogical it may seem, it is arguable that California does not recognize a tort of negligent interference with contractual relations, but does recognize a tort of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. See [http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020101104A06 ''Young v. Fluorotronics''], S.D. Calif. 2010). (This is comparable to recognizing manslaughter but decriminalizing murder.)&lt;/ref&gt;  although many do not.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Ramirez v. Selles'', 784 P.2d 433, 436 (Or. 1989) ("Negligent injury to one person that harms another's contract or other economic relationship is not a tort, at least not unless some duty of defendant outside negligence law itself protects the injured interest of the plaintiff against negligent invasion.").&lt;/ref&gt; A tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's [[negligence]] damages the contractual or business relationship between others causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout preventing the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

==Case law==
An early, perhaps the earliest, instance of recognition of this tort occurred in ''[[Garret v Taylor]]'', 79 Eng. Rep. 485 (K.B. 1620). In that case, the defendant drove customers away from the plaintiff’s quarry by threatening them with mayhem and also threatening to “vex [them] with suits.”  The King's Bench court said that “the defendant threatened violence to the extent of committing an assault upon ... customers of the plaintiff ... whereupon ‘they all desisted from buying.’’  The court therefore upheld a judgment for the plaintiff.

In a similar case, ''[[Tarleton v McGawley]]'', 170 Eng. Rep. 153 (K.B. 1793), the defendant shot from its ship Othello off the coast of Africa upon natives while “contriving and maliciously intending to hinder and deter the natives from trading  with” plaintiff’s rival trading ship Bannister.  This action caused the natives (plaintiff’s prospective customers) to flee the scene, depriving the plaintiff of their potential business. The King's Bench court held the conduct actionable.  The defendant claimed, by way of justification, that the local native ruler had given it an exclusive franchise to trade with his subjects, but the court rejected this defense.

The tort was described in the case of ''[[Keeble v Hickeringill]]'', (1707) [[Case citation|103 Eng. Rep. 1127]], styled as a "[[trespass on the case]]". In that case, the defendant had used a shotgun to drive ducks away from a pond that the plaintiff had built for the purpose of capturing ducks. Thus, unlike the foregoing cases, here the actionable conduct was not directly driving the prospective customers away, but rather eliminating the subject matter of the prospective business. Although the ducks had not yet been captured, the [[John Holt (judge)|Justice Holt]] wrote for the court that "where a violent or malicious act is done to a man's occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood, there an action lies in all cases." The court noted that the defendant would have the right to draw away ducks to a pond of his own, raising as a comparison a 1410 case in which the court deemed that no cause of action would lie where a schoolmaster opened a new school that drew students away from an old school.

The application of the above has since been modified in UK law. In OBG v Allan ''et al.'' 2008 1AC 1

Wrongful interference: the unified theory which treated causing loss by unlawful means as an extension of the tort of inducing a breach of contract was abandoned; inducing breach of contract and causing loss by unlawful means were two separate torts.
inducing a breach of contract was a tort of accessory liability, and an intention to cause a breach of contract was a necessary and sufficient requirement for liability; a person had to know that he was inducing a breach of contract and to intend to do; that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact could be treated as knowledge for the purposes of the tort; that a person who knowingly induced a breach of contract as a means to an end had the necessary intent even if he was not motivated by malice but had acted with the motive of securing an economic advantage for himself; that, however, a breach of contract which was neither an end in itself nor a means to an end but was merely a foreseeable consequence of a person’s acts did not give rise to liability; and that there could be no secondary liability without primary liability, and therefore a person could not be liable for inducing a breach of contract unless there had in fact been a breach by the contracting party.

Causing loss by unlawful means: acts against a third party counted as unlawful means only if they were actionable by that third party if he had suffered loss; that unlawful means consisted of acts intended to cause loss to the claimant by interfering with the freedom of a third party in a way which was unlawful as against that third party and which was intended to cause loss to the claimant, but did not include acts which might be unlawful against a third party but which did not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant.  Strict liability for conversion applied only to an interest in chattels and not to chooses in action; this was too radical to impose liability for pure economic loss on receivers who had been appointed and had acted in good faith. This also left open the position where they breached the duty of good faith.

== Typical examples ==
#Tortious interference of business.- When false claims and accusations are made against a business or an individual's reputation in order to drive business away.
#Tortious interference of contract.- When an individual uses "tort" (a wrongful act) to come between two parties' mutual contract.

==Elements==
Although the specific elements required to prove a claim of tortious interference vary from one jurisdiction to another, they typically include the following:

#The existence of a contractual relationship or beneficial business relationship between two parties.
#Knowledge of that relationship by a third party.
#Intent of the third party to induce a party to the relationship to breach the relationship.
#Lack of any privilege on the part of the third party to induce such a breach.
#The contractual relationship is breached.
#Damage to the party against whom the breach occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Jared|url=http://trucounsel.com/index.php/nevadas-theories-of-liability/intentional-interference-with-contractual-relations|title=TruCounsel.com|work=Nevada Theories of Liability|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first element may, in employment-at-will jurisdictions, be held fulfilled in regards to a previously unterminated employer/employee relationship.

In California, these are the elements of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, which the plaintiff must establish:

# an economic relationship existed between the plaintiff and a third party which contained a reasonably probable future economic benefit or advantage to plaintiff;
# the defendant knew of the existence of the relationship and was aware or should have been aware that if it did not act with due care its actions would interfere with this relationship and cause plaintiff to lose in whole or in part the probable future economic benefit or advantage of the relationship;
# the defendant was negligent; and
# such negligence caused damage to plaintiff in that the relationship was actually interfered with or disrupted and plaintiff lost in whole or in part the economic benefits or advantage reasonably expected from the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court'', 59 Cal. App. 4th 764, 786, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 466 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases add that a defendant acts negligently only if "the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care."&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Limandri v. Judkins'', 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 348, 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 539 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

California and most jurisdictions hold that there is a privilege to compete for business. “Under the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant’s interference is somehow wrongful—i.e., based on facts that take the defendant’s actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.”&lt;ref&gt;''Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan &amp; Eisenberg''. 216 Cal. App. 3d 1139, 1153—1154, 265 Cal. Rptr. 330 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he competition privilege is defeated only where the defendant engages in unlawful or illegitimate means." ''&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Design Center Associates v. Portman Companies'', 41 Cal. App. 4th 29, 42, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 716 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;
"Wrongful" in this context means “independently wrongful”—that is, "blameworthy" or " independently wrongful apart from the interference itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Lange v. TIG Insurance Co.'', 68 Cal. App. 4th 1179, 1187, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 39 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; This may be termed use of improper means. “Commonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.”&lt;ref&gt;''PMC, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc.'', 45 Cal. App. 4th 579, 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of "wrongful conduct" are "fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation, coercion, obstruction or molestation of the rival or his servants or workmen."&lt;ref&gt;''Charles C. Chapman Building Co. v. California Mart'', 2 Cal. App. 3d 846, 857, 82 Cal. Rptr. 830 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damages==
Typical legal damages for tortious interference include economic losses, if they can be proven with certainty, and mental distress.  Additionally punitive damages may be awarded if malice on the part of the wrongdoer can be established.

Equitable remedies may include injunctive relief in the form of a negative injunction that would be used to prevent the wrongdoer from benefiting from any contractual relationship that may arise out of the interference, i.e., the performance of a singer who was originally contracted with the plaintiff to perform at the same time.

==Additional example==
Tortious interference with an expected inheritance - One who, by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received, is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=Commerce Bank v. Deborah Flavin Durland |vol=141 |reporter=S.W.3d |opinion=434 |pinpoint= |court=Mo.Ct.App. |date=2004 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mo-court-of-appeals/1333697.html |accessdate=29 October 2013 |quote= }} (Believed to be the first claim for tortious interference with inheritance expectancy to withstand appeal in the State of Missouri).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Mr Wong exercised his power of sale and put up Mr Tse’s property for auction, a building with about 100 units in [[Kowloon]], the Kwong Hing Building. It was only shortly advertised with limited details. The reserve price was fixed without the guidance of a qualified valuer at $1.2m. There was only one bid. It was Mrs Wong. She was acting on behalf of the company owned by Mr Wong and his family. They had apparently had a board meeting before resolving that they would bid up to a maximum of $1.2m.

The trial Judge found that $1.2m was not a proper price, but refused to set the sale aside because of the borrower’s delay in pursuing the counterclaim.&lt;ref name="Trial"&gt;''Wong Chit-Sen v Tse Kwong-Lam'' [http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/1979/39.html &amp;#91;1979&amp;#93; HKCFI 39] [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt; He awarded damages instead. The Court of Appeal set aside the judge’s award.&lt;ref&gt;''Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen'' [http://www.hklii.org/eng/hk/cases/hkca/1980/264.html &amp;#91;1980&amp;#93; HKCA 264] [[Court of Appeal of Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The [[Judicial committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] restored the judge’s award, holding that although the sale could not be set aside, given that too long was taken, damages could be awarded. There was a clear conflict of interest here, importing a necessity to show that reasonable precautions had been taken to get the best price. The Board advised that although the respondent was free to sell to a company in which he was interested, he had failed to demonstrate he had taken reasonable care in the conduct of the sale. An auction was not necessarily the most appropriate mode of sale. Expert advice should have been sought for valuing and the sale mode. Lord Templeman said:

{{quote|... the sale must be closely examined and a heavy onus lies on the mortgagee to show that in all respects he acted fairly to the borrower and used his best endeavours to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the mortgaged property.&lt;ref name="Wong v Tse PC"/&gt;{{rp|p 7}}}}

The '''Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation''' (VCGLR) is the independent statutory authority, which regulates liquor and gambling industries in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  The VCGLR is responsible for liquor and gaming licensing, compliance and education. It is also committed to minimising any potential harm the gambling and liquor industries may have on individuals and the community.

== Background ==
The VCGLR commenced operations on 6 February 2012. The VCGLR replaces the functions of the Director of Liquor Licensing, the Liquor Licensing Panel and the Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation. The VCGLR has the power to undertake liquor disciplinary actions, which replaced the role of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. In addition, the VCGLR has assumed the administrative and educative functions of Responsible Alcohol Victoria.

The statutory obligations are set out in several Acts of Parliament. These include regulating:
* the liquor industry in accordance with the ''Liquor Control Reform Act 1998''
* all forms of legalised gambling in accordance with the ''Gambling Regulation Act 2003'', the ''Casino Control Act 1991'' and the ''Casino (Management Agreement) Act 1993''.

== Commissioners ==
The Commissioners of the VCGLR are accountable for statutory decision-making and governance. They are required to make decisions, either individually or collectively with other Commissioners on a range of matters relating to the grant, variation and transfer of licences and permits, conditions attached to licences and permits, disciplinary actions against licensees and permittees and reviews of decisions made under delegation by individual Commissions or members of staff.

== Organisation structure ==
The organisation structure provides support for responsive business systems and flexible processes to respond to the changing needs of the Commission and industries.

The VCGLR has six functional divisions, each report to the Chief Executive Officer
* Licensing
* Compliance
* Strategy and Planning
* Legal Services
* Finance and Business Services
* People and Culture.

== Organisation ==
The VCGLR is located at 49 Elizabeth Street, North Richmond.

A '''webcast''' is a media presentation distributed over the Internet using [[streaming media]] technology to distribute a single content source to many simultaneous listeners/viewers. A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is "[[broadcasting]]" over the Internet.

The largest "webcasters" include existing radio and TV stations, who "[[simulcast]]" their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet only "stations". Webcasting usually consists of providing non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific "webcasting licenses" to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material.

==Overview==
Webcasting is used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations [[presentation]]s (such as annual general meetings), in [[e-learning]] (to transmit [[seminar]]s), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to [[web conferencing]], which is designed for many-to-many interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/112104/Webcasting-101-Planning-and-Executing-High-Quality-Webcasts|title=Webcasting 101: Planning and Executing High Quality Webcasts|last=Shiao|first=Dennis|date=26 December 2012|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed [[independent media]] to flourish.  There are many notable independent shows that [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, [[technology]], and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly.

Webcasting differs from [[podcast]]ing in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmarketcentral.com/webcast_podcast_overview.htm|title=Overview of Webcasting and Podcasting|publisher=WebMarketCentral|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Webcasting is the distribution of media files through the internet.

The earliest graphically-oriented web broadcasts were not streaming video, but were in fact still frames which were photographed with a web camera every few minutes while they were being broadcast live over the Internet. One of the earliest instances of sequential live image broadcasting was in 1991 when a camera was set up next to the Trojan Room in the computer laboratory of the [[University of Cambridge]]. It provided a live picture every few minutes of the office coffee pot to all desktop computers on that office's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/qsf/coffee.html | title=The Trojan Room Coffee Pot|author=Quentin Stafford- Fraser|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of years later its broadcasts went to the Internet, became known as the [[Trojan Room coffee pot | Trojan Room Coffee Pot webcam]], and gained international notoriety as a feature of the fledgling [[World Wide Web]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gizmodo.com/5993583/the-worlds-first-webcam-was-created-to-check-a-coffee-pot-remotely | title=The World's First Webcam Was Created to Check a Coffee Pot |author=Jamie Condliffe | accessdate=2 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1996 an American college student and [[conceptual art]]ist, [[Jenny Ringley]], set up a web camera similar to the Trojan Room Coffee Pot's [[webcam]] in her dorm room.&lt;ref name="disobey"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgotten Web Celebrities: Jennicam.org's Jennifer Ringley |url=http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/2004_05_19_archive.html |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |date=May 19, 2004 |first=Steve |last=Baldwin |publisher=Disobey.com: Content for the discontented (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; That webcam photographed her every few minutes while it broadcast those images live over the Internet upon a site called ''JenniCam''. Ringley wanted to portray all aspects of her lifestyle and the camera captured her doing almost everything&amp;nbsp;– brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, and even having sex with her boyfriend.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book|first=Jamie|last=Bartlett|chapter=Chapter 6: Lights, Web-camera, Action|pages=166–192||title=The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlUBAAAQBAJ|location=London|publisher=Melville House|year=2014|isbn=9780434023172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Senft1&gt;{{cite book|first=Theresa |last=Senft| chapter=Chapter 1 - Keeping it Real on the Web: Authenticity, Celebrity, Branding | pages=15–17 |title=Camgirls: Celebrity &amp; Community in the Age of Social Networks |location= New York | publisher=  Peter Lang Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8204-5694-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her website generated millions of hits upon the Internet, became a pay site in 1998, and spawned hundreds of female imitators who would then use streaming video to create a new billion dollar industry called ''camming'', and brand themselves as [[webcam model|camgirls]] or [[webcam model]]s.&lt;ref name=Richtel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richtel|first1=Matt|title=Intimacy on the Web, With a Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/technology/intimacy-on-the-web-with-a-crowd.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest webcast equivalent of an online [[concert]] and one of the earliest examples of webcasting itself was by [[Apple Computer]]'s Webcasting Group in partnership with the entrepreneurs [[Michael Dorf (entrepreneur)|Michael Dorf]] and [[Andrew Rasiej]]. Together with [[David B. Pakman]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], they launched the Macintosh New York Music Festival from July 17–22, 1995. This event audio webcast concerts from more than 15 clubs in New York City. Apple later webcast a concert by [[Metallica]] on June 10, 1996 live from Slim's in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heavy Metal Metallica Plans to Rock Cyberspace: Apple Computer to 'Webcast' band's concert |date=May 30, 1996| location=San Francisco, CA, USA |publisher= SFGate |url = http://articles.sfgate.com/1996-05-30/business/17775287_1_xing-technology-technology-startups-fastest-growing-technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 1996, UK rock band Caduseus broadcast their one-hour concert from 11{{nbsp}}pm to 12{{nbsp}}midnight (UT) at Celtica in Machynlleth, Wales, UK&amp;nbsp;– the first live streamed audio and simultaneous live streamed video multicast&amp;nbsp;– around the globe to more than twenty direct "mirrors" in more than twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/wales/archive/bbc-mid-wales-mystory-caduseus-1996-internet-broadcast.pdf |date=November 24, 2005 |title=Internet Innovators |publisher=BBC |access-date=December 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIBggEZqSW0 |title=

In September 1997, Nebraska Public Television started webcasting Big Red Wrap Up from Lincoln, Nebraska which combined highlights from every Cornhusker football game, coverage of the coaches' weekly press conferences, analysis with Nebraska sportswriters, appearances by special guests and questions and answers with viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scarlet.unl.edu/scarlet/v7n25/v7n25nibs.html |title=Big Red Wrap-Up Now on World Wide Web |newspaper=Scarlet |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |date=September 26, 1997 |access-date=December 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 1998, it is generally believed the first webcast wedding took place, between Alan K'necht and Carrie Silverman in [[Toronto]] [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Year in reviews August |date= December 25, 1998 | location=Montreal, CA|publisher= The Montreal Mirror | url = http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1998/122498/august.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Various TV News Clips |date=August 13, 1998|work=Online|location=Toronto, CA | publisher=Various | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2359180177110889920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 1998, the first Billy Graham Crusade was broadcast live to a worldwide audience from the [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa Florida courtesy of Dale Ficken and the WebcastCenter in Pennsylvania. The live signal was broadcast via satellite to PA, then encoded and streamed via the BGEA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billygraham.org/assets/media/pdfs/development/annualreports/BGEA1998AnnualReport.pdf|title=Occupying Till He Returns|last=Graham|first=Billy|publisher=BillyGraham.org|access-date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first teleconferenced/webcast wedding to date is believed to have occurred on December 31, 1998. Dale Ficken and Lorrie Scarangella wed on this date as they stood in a church in Pennsylvania, and were married by Jerry Falwell while he sat in his office in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19981231wed5.asp|title=Hollidaysburg couple plans to be virtually wed on the Web|last=Gibb|first=Tom|date=31 December 1998|publisher=Post-Gazette|access-date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually all major broadcasters now have a webcast of their output, from the [[BBC]] to [[CNN]] to [[Al Jazeera]] to [[DWAO-TV|UNTV]] in television to Radio China,  Vatican Radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.vaticanradio.org/ | title = Radio | publisher = Vatican}}.&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations Radio and the [[World Service]] in radio.

On November 4, 1994, Stef van der Ziel distributed the first live video images over the web from the Simplon venue in Groningen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Webcast|publisher=Jet-Stream|date=November 4, 1994|url=http://www.jet-stream.com/blog/first-webcast/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 1994, [[WXYC]], the [[college radio]] station of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Communications: Picture the scene|last=Grossman|first=Wendy|date=January 26, 1995|work=Online|location= Manchester, United Kingdom|publisher=''The Guardian''|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=WXYC announces the first 24-hour real-time world-wide Internet radio simulcast|publisher=WXYC 89.3 FM|date=November 7, 1994|url=http://www.wxyc.org/about/first/release.html|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedcast==
A '''wedcast''' is a webcast of a [[wedding]].&lt;ref name=iht&gt;{{cite news|title=Can't make the ceremony?

It is sometimes used for weddings in exotic locations, such as Cancun and the Riviera Maya, [[Hawaii]] or the [[Caribbean]], for which it is very expensive or difficult for people to travel to see the wedding in person.&lt;ref name=iht/&gt;

Webcasting a funeral is also a service provided by some funeral homes. Although it has been around for a decade, cheaper broadband, the financial strain of travel, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have all led to a recent increase in this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=IEEE|journal=Spectrum|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/funeral-webcasting-is-alive-and-well|title=Funeral webcasting is alive and well}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Bengal Judicial Academy''' is a training institution for the Judges of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and officers of the [[West Bengal Judicial Service]]. The institution organises Induction Level Training for newly appointed Judicial Officers as well as entry level District Judges of West Bengal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/|title=West Bengal Judicial Academy|last=|first=|date=|website=wbja.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The [[Law Commission of India]] recommended to establish Judicial academies in various state of [[India]] for training of all Judges of the subordinate Judiciary. Subsequently the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted those recommendations and on 28 February [[Calcutta High Court]] issued a notification to set up a state Judicial Academy under the name of West Bengal Judicial Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/wbja_adm/files/Establishment.pdf|title=The Kolkata Gazette|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2005, the [[Chief Justice of India]] Mr. Justice [[Y.K.

'''Zero-rating''' is the practice of providing [[Internet access]] without financial cost under certain conditions, such as by only permitting access to certain websites or by subsidizing the service with [[advertising]].&lt;ref name="Berkman Oct 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bates|first1=Samantha|last2=Bavitz|first2=Christopher|last3=Hessekiel|first3=Kira|title=Zero Rating &amp; Internet Adoption|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2017/10/zerorating|website=cyber.harvard.edu|publisher=[[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]]|language=en|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators discussing zero rating often present it as a subtopic of [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="Berkman Oct 2017"/&gt; While most sources report that use of zero-rating is contrary to the principle of net neutrality, there are mixed opinions among advocates of net neutrality about the extent to which people can benefit from zero-rating programs while retaining net neutrality protections.&lt;ref name="Berkman Oct 2017"/&gt; Supporters of zero-rating argue that it enables consumers to make choices to access more data and leads to more people using online services, but critics believe zero-rating exploits the poor, creates opportunities for censorship, and disrupts the [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Berkman Oct 2017"/&gt;

== Existing programs ==
Internet services like [[Facebook]], [[Wikipedia]] and [[Google]] have built special programs to use zero-rating as means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets. The benefit for these new customers, who will mostly have to rely on mobile networks to connect to the Internet, would be a subsidised access to services from these service providers. The results of these efforts have been mixed, with adoption in a number of markets, sometimes overestimated expectations and perceived lack of benefits for mobile network operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since June 2014, U.S. mobile provider [[T-Mobile US]] has offered zero-rated access to participating music streaming services to its mobile internet customers. T-Mobile launched its plan called “Music Freedom” which would exempt users of [[T-Mobile]] from having to pay premium prices for access to music content; additionally, this content access would not count as part of an individual's cap, which is the limit they can reach before they are charged for data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality|title=T-Mobile's 'Music Freedom' is a great feature — and a huge problem|last=Ziegler|first=Chris|date=June 18, 2014|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Verizon joined AT&amp;T by creating its own sponsored data program, FreeBee Data, which "enables content providers to pay a wireless provider to allow its subscribers to engage with or consume a piece of content without it counting against the customers' monthly allotments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored data on behalf of content providers through AT&amp;T or Verizon covers the costs for the viewers and attracts more consumers. Some people have characterized this as ISPs having created a [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free]] service for online users.

Advocates of net neutrality state that sponsored data "allows well-heeled content providers to pay for placement to the disadvantage of smaller companies that can't afford the same luxury".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verizon's FreeBee Data program which allows its own customers to access certain content, like ESPN and its video streaming service, for free along with any other relevant app access and the data will not count against their monthly caps. In this way, big ISPs discriminate against data and content from those who do not pay to have their content included in the FreeBee or other sponsored programs.

Similarly, mobile network operators are also able to use the underlying classification technology like [[deep packet inspection]] to redirect enterprise-related data charges for employees using their private tablets or smartphones to their employer.&lt;ref name="Fitchard1"&gt;{{cite web

== Reception and impact ==

Zero-rating certain services, ''fast lanes'' and ''sponsored data'' have been criticised as anti-competitive and limiting [[open market]]s.&lt;ref name="Drossos1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/04/26/forget-fast-lanes-the-real-threat-for-net-neutrality-is-zero-rated-mobile-traffic/

|accessdate = July 3, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables internet providers to gain a significant advantage in the promotion of in-house services over competing independent companies, especially in data-heavy markets like video-streaming. A service provider, who is offering unlimited access to their service, will naturally seem more favourable to consumers over one where usage is limited. If the first provider is the one restricting access, they are creating a considerable advantage for themselves over their competition, thereby restricting the freedom of the market. As many new internet and content services are launched targeting primarily mobile usage, and further adoption of internet connectivity globally (including broadband in rural areas of developed countries) relies heavily on mobile, zero-rating has also been regarded as a threat to the open internet, which is typically available via [[Internet access#Broadband access|fixed line networks]] with [[Internet access#Pricing and spending|unlimited usage tariffs]] or [[flat rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The concern raised about how zero-rating can violate net neutrality is that when companies pay large [[Internet service provider|ISP’s,]] then that ISP will prioritize that given platform over others. This gives companies who are able to pay a large sum of money to an ISP an advantage over others who did not pay the premium cost. This idea violates [[net neutrality]] as it gives large companies a leg up in comparison to their smaller, less known counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality|title=T-Mobile's 'Music Freedom' is a great feature — and a huge problem|last=Ziegler|first=Chris|date=June 18, 2014|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Net neutrality is centered on the idea that all ISP’s treat data contents equally, yet with [[T-Mobile|T-Mobile’s]] example of “Music Freedom”, net neutrality is no longer viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151029/13114132669/t-mobile-wades-into-net-neutrality-minefield-with-plan-to-zero-rate-netflix-hbo.shtml|title=T-Mobile Wades Into Net Neutrality Minefield With Plan To Zero Rate Netflix, HBO|last=Bode|first=Karl|date=October 30, 2015|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has not officially made a decision on the regulation of zero-rating providers; instead, adopting a “wait-and-see” approach to the matter. The FCC has therefore elected to examine on a case-by-case basis under a “general conduct rule” that “prohibits unreasonable interference with end users’ ability to select content and content providers’ ability to reach end users”.&lt;ref&gt;2015 Open Internet Order, supra note 13, at 5666–69 paras. 151–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the Trump inauguration, the Obama Administration FCC issued a report expressing concerns with T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&amp;T and their sponsored data programs. The FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau found issues in wireless broadband services that vertically integrate their own affiliated programming, along with service providers allowing unaffiliated content providers to sponsor data. The report concluded that vertically affiliated broadband providers that zero-rate affiliated content most likely violate the general conduct rule.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Report: Policy Review of Mobile Broadband Operators’ Sponsored Data Offerings for Zero-Rated Content and Services. Jan. 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the EU, specific cases such as those of Portugal were under scrutiny by national and EU regulators as of 2017, following the BEREC regulation on net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Andrei Khalip &amp; Agnieszka Flak|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-eu-analysis/false-paradise-eu-is-no-haven-of-net-neutrality-say-critics-idUSKBN1E92SC|title=False paradise? EU is no haven of Net neutrality, say critics|last=|first=|date=2017-12-15|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to commercial interests, governments with a cultural agenda may support zero-rating for local content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Kate|title=Is exempting Cancon from data charges the best way to promote it?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/is-exempting-canadian-content-from-data-charges-the-best-way-to-promote-it/article34906304/|accessdate=6 May 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical Infeasibility==
Developments in data protocols have made many Zero-rating practices ineffective, depending on how the website is accessed. For example, if HTTPS is used, it is impossible for an ISP to inject additional advertisements into the web page. If the user is using a VPN, it would be impossible for the ISP to restrict what sites the user has access to, as only the VPN provider can see the user's activity.

The following countries and telecommunications carriers currently offer these notable instances of zero-rated services.
