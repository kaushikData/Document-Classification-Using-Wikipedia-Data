'''Al-Merrikh Stadium''', also known as the Red Castle, is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Omdurman]], [[Sudan]], used mostly for football matches and also sometimes for athletics. Established in 1962. The stadium is used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] games and is considered the home stadium of both [[Al-Merrikh SC]] and the [[Sudan national football team|Sudan national team]]. Currently, the stadium has a capacity of 43,000. In the 2016 CAF Champions League season, Al-Merrikh drew an average home attendance of 17,250. They usually draw much lower crowds for their domestic league games.

==Overview==
The stadium officially opened on November 30, 1964. It had first opened in 1962 while still under construction to host a meeting between [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal Club]] and [[Al-Mourada SC]] for a national holiday in November 1962. It closed its doors after the festivities and was officially inaugurated two years later, on November 30, 1964, with a match between Al-Merrikh and [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. In 2003, the Board of Al-Merrikh, chaired by Jamal Al-Wali, undertook the renovation of the stadium to build a new gallery and include new seats. The cost of its new renovations was estimated at 2 million dollars.

Al-Merrikh Stadium is located on Al-Baladya Street, Al-Arda (Arabic:العرضة) in the city of Omdurman, Sudan.

The stadium was the neutral site of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF Third Round|World Cup qualifier]] between [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] and [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] on November 18, 2009, which Algeria won 1–0 to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Algeria beats Egypt 1-0 to reach World Cup |author= |newspaper=Yahoo!

'''Alex Box Stadium''', sometimes pronounced as "Elec" or "Alec" Box&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/lsu/baseballblog/18839889.html 2theadvocate.com | LSU Baseball Blog | Alex? Alec? or Elec? — Baton Rouge, Louisiana]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719191607/http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/lsu/baseballblog/18839889.html |date=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], United States. It was the home field of the [[LSU Tigers baseball]] team. The stadium was located across the street from [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]], which is visible in right field.  It was most notable for ''The Intimidator'', a large billboard behind the right-field fence featuring the five years in which LSU won the [[College World Series]].

The stadium opened in 1938 and closed in 2008. It was replaced with a new stadium 200 yards to the south named [[Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field]]. Both structures were named for Simeon Alex Box, an LSU letterman (1942) who was killed in North Africa during World War II. The stadium was called LSU Diamond or LSU Varsity Baseball Field when it first opened.

The [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] held spring training at the ballpark in 1938 and 1939. The Giants played the first baseball game at the park, defeating the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] 6-5. The first LSU game was March 21, 1938. LSU led Minnesota, 4-2, after three innings when the game was halted due to rain. The first official LSU Game at the stadium was March 24, 1938 when Minnesota defeated LSU, 6-5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&amp;ATCLID=177194 LSU Baseball Facilities – LSUsports.net – The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final regular season series at Alex Box Stadium was played between LSU and [[Mississippi State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=27865&amp;SPID=2173&amp;DB_OEM_ID=5200&amp;ATCLID=1467715 Storylines Aplenty as Baseball Plays Final Series at Alex Box – LSUsports.net—The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it appeared this would be the last series ever at Alex Box Stadium; however, LSU was selected to host a regional in the NCAA Tournament (which it won), and subsequently hosted a [[Super Regional]] as the #7 national seed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&amp;ATCLID=1474516 Baseball Earns No. 7 National Seed, Faces TSU – LSUsports.net—The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared that Alex Box stadium would close on a sour note for the Tigers, as LSU dropped Game 1 to [[UC Irvine]] 11-5, and in Game 2, LSU was three outs away from elimination, trailing 7-4 in the ninth inning. However, UC Irvine was unable to close out the LSU Tigers and LSU came from behind to win the game 9-7.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/baseball/2008-06-08-lsu-urvine_N.htm LSU beats UC Irvine 9-7 to stay alive – USATODAY.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was thus given one final chance to close on a high note, which it did in Game 3 of the Super Regional played on June 9, 2008, as LSU defeated UC Irvine 21-7. As a result of the victory, LSU won the Baton Rouge Super Regional two games to one and advanced to the [[College World Series]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. In the final play at the stadium, [[Tyler Hoechlin]] hit a grounder to pitcher Anthony Ranaudo, who threw to first baseman Buzzy Haydel for the final out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/lsu/19704714.html?index=14&amp;c=y Some "lasts" at Alex Box Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has been dismantled and sold to fans.

The '''Bluegrass Balloon Festival''', formerly called the '''Adam Matthews Balloon Festival''', was the fifth largest [[hot air balloon festival]] in the [[United States]], and the largest in the state of [[Kentucky]]. From 1999 to 2009, it was held annually in late September at [[Bowman Field (airport)|Bowman Field]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

The festival features up to 100 hot air balloons participating in three early morning balloon races and two evening balloon glows. Other events include four live concerts, 11 free children's activities, and a car show featuring more than 150 classic, exotic, and modified cars. There is also a balloon education center teaching the fundamentals of ballooning, as well as food, a beer garden, and other activities. It is common to have crowds of more than 100,000 on the busiest day of the festival. Many events are held during the three days. One of the more popular attractions is the evening balloon glow, when balloons are inflated and glow to music after dark. Another is the early morning balloon race with a cash prize for the winner.

The Adam Matthews Balloon Festival celebrated its last festival in September 2006. The festival was purchased by The Spirit of Kentucky Foundation and was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival.

==History==
[[File:פסטיבל כדורים פורחים בלוגראס בלילה.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Hot air balloons light up for an evening balloon glow at the Adam Matthews Balloon Festival.]]

For many years, local pilots gathered to give back to the community by holding a year-end balloon glow at Bowman Field. When the local event was canceled due to the lack of funds, Adam Burckle, the founder of the Adam Matthews Cheesecake Company, came up with an idea that led to the festival.

The first year event was held with 52 balloons in attendance. Many balloons were local, although some pilots traveled from far across the United States. The initial event raised $20,000 for the Dream Factory, an organization that helps grant wishes to children with life-threatening diseases.

The second annual event was held in 2000 with 70 balloons from across the country. The event became so popular that the entry was limited to 70 balloons and there was a waiting list.

The events of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] put some doubt into the flights of the festival, as civil aviation flights (including ballooning) were restricted for a period of time after the attacks. The festival petitioned the [[National Safety Council]] and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] to allow the flight of hot air balloons, which was approved only two days before the festival. Approximately 75 balloons attended the event that year, making it the largest balloon festival held in Kentucky's history.

By 2002, the event had grown to 85 registered balloons, and [[WHAS-TV]] 11, a local [[television station]] in Louisville, featured the evening Balloon Glow during its prime time broadcast. [[Meijer]]s sponsored the Starship Concert, and Dean's Milk sponsored the balloon races with more than $27,500 in prize money. Pilots travelled from as far as away as [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]] and the Western U.S.; they raised more than $35,000 for the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], the [[Louisville Zoo]], and the [[WHAS Crusade for Children|Crusade for Children]].

By 2003, the festival had grown to 100 registered balloons, with more than $40,000 in prizes awarded. There was also six hours of live TV coverage, and more than 120,000 people attended the event over three days. Portions of the parking fees benefited the [[WHAS Crusade for Children|Crusade for Children]], and additional funds were raised for the [[Louisville Zoo]] and several other local non-profit groups.

In 2007 the Adam Matthews Balloon Festival was purchased by the Spirit of Kentucky Foundation for $1, and the event was renamed the Bluegrass Balloon Festival. It continued to be the largest ballooning event in Kentucky and the fifth largest in the United States.

The festival was cancelled in 2010 for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101231175930/http://www.bluegrassballoons.com/&lt;/ref&gt; It was to return in 2011 with a new name, "Spirit of Kentucky Balloon Festival", but that was cancelled as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/SpiritofKYBalloonFestival/posts/283291378353039&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no sign of the existence of the festival since that time.

[[File:CrickBoatShow.jpg|thumb|right|Crick Boat Show]]
The '''Crick Boat Show''' &amp; Waterways Festival is an event that has been held annually at Crick Marina in Northamptonshire, England, since its inception in 2000.

==Location==
The show takes place every year on the [[Grand Union Canal]] at Crick Marina. This is located on the Leicester Line, to the north of Crick Tunnel, on the level section of canal between the tops of the [[Watford Locks|Watford flight]] and the [[Foxton Locks|Foxton flight]]. The site is close to junction 18 on the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and the event has traditionally taken place on the last bank holiday weekend in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The show was first held in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; when it was organised by [[British Waterways]], and has been held every year since then. Responsibility for its organisation was passed to Waterways World Magazine in 2011, where it has remained ever since in partnership with the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]] and Crick Marina.

The event is the focal point of the inland boating calendar and provides the opportunity for boat-builders and sellers to promote new and second-hand boats to visitors considering buying a boat. Every conceivable type of product and service for canal boats is represented by the exhibitors, ranging from equipment to finance and insurance. In a dedicated lecture theatre, a series of free seminars are held throughout the event, covering such topics as boat maintenance, living afloat and boat-buying on a budget.

Free boat-trips along the Grand Union Canal are provided – but must be booked upon arrival at the show – and boat-handling courses are available for an additional fee.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is also billed as a 'Waterways Festival', with continuous live music, a large beer festival (organised by The Wheatsheaf public house from the local village) with up to 40 real ales, food and crafts stalls and a range of children's activities broadening its appeal. The live music has included headline performances by recording artists such as Toyah Wilcox (2014), Hazel O’Connor (2015) and Tom Robinson (2016). But also features well-known tribute acts such as T-Rextasy (2017) and Abba Revival (2018).

The 2017 show was attended by 27,000-plus people &lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and included around 40 'boats on show' among nearly 200 exhibitors.

==Favourite Boat in Show Award==
A well established tradition of the event is the 'Favourite Boat in Show' award, which is voted for by show visitors and presented to the winner on the Monday. In 2017 the scheme was updated to include separate categories for narrowboats and wide-beam craft. The winner of that year's 'Favourite Narrowboat in Show' was Bourne Boat Builders with its 60&amp;nbsp;ft luxury craft, ''Threpence Ha'penny,'' while Elton Moss Boatbuilders was presented with the 'Favourite Wide-beam in Show' accolade for its 65&amp;nbsp;ft by 12&amp;nbsp;ft Kingsley Barge.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous winners are as follows:

2016 
Boating Leisure Services – ''Silver Melody'': a 58&amp;nbsp;ft semi-trad narrowboat with a bright interior.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

2015 
Boating Leisure Services – ''Columbus'': a 60&amp;nbsp;ft Josher tug-style traditional narrowboat with an oak interior.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

2014 
Boating Leisure Services – ''Shackleton'': a 58&amp;nbsp;ft semi-trad narrowboat contrasting a fairly traditional exterior with a bright modern interior.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 
Navigations Narrowboats – ''Emily'': a 58&amp;nbsp;ft tug-style narrowboat with a Tyler Wilson shell.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

2012
MGM Boats – ''Snail’s Pace:'' a 58&amp;nbsp;ft cruiser-stern, reverse layout narrowboat that had been custom built for its owners.&lt;ref&gt;Waterways World, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crosley Field''' was a [[Major League Baseball]] park located in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. It was the home field of the [[National League]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]] from [[1912 in baseball|1912]] through June 24, 1970, and the original [[Cincinnati Bengals (AFL)|Cincinnati Bengals]] football team, members of the [[AFL II|second]] (1937) and [[AFL III|third American Football League]] (1940–41). It was not the original home of the current [[Cincinnati Bengals|NFL franchise of the same name]] - the home of those Bengals in 1968 and 1969 was nearby [[Nippert Stadium]], located on the campus of the [[University of Cincinnati]].  Crosley Field was on an asymmetrical block bounded by Findlay Street (south), Western Avenue (northeast, angling), York Street (north) and McLean Avenue (west) in the [[Queensgate, Cincinnati|Queensgate]] section of the city.  Crosley has the distinction of being the first major-league park with lights for playing night games.

The "'''Findlay and Western'''" intersection was the home field of the Reds from [[1884 in baseball|1884]] until mid-season 1970, when the team moved to [[Cinergy Field|Riverfront Stadium]].  The location of the [[infield|diamond]] and consequently the main [[grandstand]] seating area was shifted several times during the 86½ seasons that the Reds played at the site.  Three different parks stood there:

:1884–1901: '''[[League Park (Cincinnati)|League Park]]'''
:1902–1911: '''[[Palace of the Fans]]'''
:1912–1970: '''Redland Field''', renamed '''Crosley Field''' in 1934

==History==
[[File:Redland Field.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Redland Field c. 1920]]

=== Rebuilding ===
Between the [[1911 in baseball|1911]] and [[1912 in baseball|1912]] seasons, the entire seating area of the '''Palace of the Fans''' as well as the remaining seating from the original '''League Park''' were demolished.  They were replaced with the third steel-and-concrete stadium in the National League.  It consisted of a double-deck grandstand around the diamond, positioned in the southwest corner of the lot. Beyond first and third base were single-deck covered pavilions extended to the corners, with bleachers in the right field area. The unusual angle of the covered areas down the lines, and behind home plate gave that area a distinctive "'''V'''" shape, giving rise to one of several nicknames the park had,  "'''The Old Boomerang'''."

'''Redland Field''', whose name was a reference to the Reds' name and color, was built for $225,000 by [[Harry Hake|Harry Hake Sr.]]'s architectural firm. It was one of many classic steel and concrete ballparks constructed during the first ballpark boom era of 1909–1923.  [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] and [[Boston]]'s [[Fenway Park]] were also built during this era and remain in use today. Although occupying the site since 1884, the Reds dated their ballpark from the permanent structure opened in 1912.

Throughout its history, Redland/Crosley Field was usually among the smallest parks in the major leagues. It accommodated 25,000 fans in [[1912 in baseball|1912]]; even at its peak, it barely exceeded 30,000 seats, excluding temporary seating areas created for opening day and World Series games. Contributing to this was the fact that there were no bleachers in left or center fields; all outfield seating (about 4,500 seats), were in the semi-[[trapezoid]]-shaped right field stands that came to be known as the "Sun Deck" (or, in the case of night games, the "Moon Deck").

Groundskeeper Mathias "Matty" Schwab, who had been hired in [[1894 in baseball|1894]], had the sod laid just in time for the Reds' first game at the new park, April&amp;nbsp;11, 1912. In the game, the Reds rallied from a 5–0 deficit to defeat the [[Chicago Cubs]] 10–6, the same team that had opened and closed at the Palace in 1902 and 1911 respectively. Schwab would be the Reds' groundkeeper until he retired at age 83 in [[1963 in baseball|1963]].

The Reds' on-field success continued to be sparse most of the time, but the club won the National League pennant in 1919, the franchise's first league title in 37 years, going back to the AA inaugural season. It was also the 50th anniversary of the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]]' historic tour, and was a celebratory occasion for Cincinnati fans, especially when they scored an upset win over the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1919 World Series|World Series]]. The win was tainted by the fact, made public a year later, that [[Black Sox Scandal|the Series had been "thrown"]] by the heavily favored Sox. The Reds gradually returned to mediocrity and attendance flagged.

===Crosley and lights===
When local businessman [[Powel Crosley Jr.]] bought the struggling Reds in [[1934 in baseball|1934]], team president [[Larry MacPhail]] insisted that the ballpark be renamed in honor of the man many thought had rescued the franchise. Thus, the park was renamed "Crosley Field", and Crosley himself took the opportunity to advertise his [[Crosley|Crosley cars]].  Under Crosley's ownership, the park underwent notable structural renovations.
 
[[File:Crosley Field from behind home plate.jpg|thumb|left|Crosley's lights are visible in this photo, taken in the late 1940s.]]
With the effects of the [[Great Depression]] in Cincinnati, the Reds convinced baseball owners to allow night baseball at Crosley Field. Without lights, Larry MacPhail insisted, the team would fold because of low attendance. Lights had been installed in a number of [[Minor League baseball]] parks in the early 1930s, with positive results. The major league owners acquiesced; 632 individual lamps in eight metal stanchions were erected and on May 24, 1935, the Reds hosted the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] under the lights. In attendance at the game was [[Ford Frick]], President of the National League. In the [[White House]], President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a button that lit up Crosley Field, where a crowd of 20,422 fans, sizable for a last-place team in the middle of the Great Depression, came out to watch the game. [[Lou Chiozza]] was the leadoff man for the Phillies and thus has the distinction of being the first player to bat under the lights in a night game in the majors.  The Reds won the game 2–1 behind right-hander [[Paul Derringer]].

The sixth night game at Crosley Field was particularly notable for its wildness. The visiting [[St. Louis Cardinals]], the Reds' rival and the defending [[World Series]] champions, were in town, and the fans showed up in droves. As the game progressed, the throng of Reds fans forced people onto the field of play which caused mass confusion for the police and umpires. (This was during a time in baseball when overflow crowds were often allowed to sit or stand on the fringes of the playing field.) Reds manager [[Chuck Dressen]] could only follow the game via the scoreboard. At one point, he was heard to say: "I see the Cardinals got a run — but I don't know how they got it".

During a lull in the eighth inning, a local burlesque performer named [[Kitty Burke]] came out of the crowd, picked up the Reds outfielder [[Babe Herman|Floyd "Babe" Herman's]] bat, stepped into the batter's box, and dared the Cardinals' starter, [[Paul Dean (baseball)|Paul "Daffy" Dean]], to throw her a pitch. He accommodated Burke with a soft toss; Burke grounded weakly to [[first base]]. The "[[pinch hit]]" appearance was never recorded as an official at bat, of course, but nonetheless, Burke began promoting herself as the first woman in major league history. Allegedly, the Reds gave her a uniform.

The late 1930s finally brought some prosperity to the club again, along with some changes to the ballpark. After the [[1937 in baseball|1937]] season, home plate was moved 20 feet toward center field, decreasing the park's outfield dimensions while expanding foul ground. Left field was reduced from 339 to 328 feet; right field from 377 to 366 feet; and the deepest part of center field, at the corner of the Sun Deck, was reduced from 407 to 387 feet.

The following summer, Crosley was the host site for Cincinnati's first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. In the middle of a pennant winning season of [[1939 in baseball|1939]], their first in 20 years, the Reds added roofed upper decks to the left and right side pavilions. This gave Crosley Field some 5,000 additional seats and the appearance it would retain for the rest of its existence. The Reds lost the [[World Series]] to the powerful [[New York Yankees]] in 1939, but would bounce back to win the pennant again in 1940, and defeat the [[Detroit Tigers]] in a seven-game thriller.

===Later years===
[[File:Crosley Field 1969.jpg|thumb|280px|Crosley Field on August 16, 1969 during its final full season. Note the [[Coca-Cola]] ad behind the bleachers, and a [[Pepsi]] logo outside the park]]

By the 1950s, the Reds were back to mediocrity, but they had some sluggers, including the muscle-bound [[Ted Kluszewski]], who took full advantage of Crosley's cozy dimensions. Crosley Field again hosted the All-Star Game in [[1953 in baseball|1953]].

After a poor season in 1960, the "Ragamuffin Reds" put everything together in 1961 and won the National League pennant, an effort documented in pitcher [[Jim Brosnan]]'s book, ''Pennant Race''. The dream season ended for the Reds at the hand of the Yankees, whose slugging duo of [[Roger Maris]] and [[Mickey Mantle]] had demolished the rest of the American League. Maris, who had set a record with 61 home runs that season, also knocked one into the Moon Deck in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1961 World Series|World Series]].

Crosley Field was the site of the major leagues' first [[save (baseball)|save]], after the save became an official statistic in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Bill Singer]] earned the save on April 7, 1969, in the season-opener, working three scoreless [[inning]]s after taking over for Dodgers starting and winning [[pitcher]] [[Don Drysdale]]. Singer did not allow a hit, walking one batter and striking out one, as the Dodgers beat the [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]], 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=The editors of the Sporting News|title=Baseball A Doubleheader Collection of Facts, Feats, &amp; Firsts|year=1992|publisher=The Sporting News Publishing Co.|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0-88365-785-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reds would continue to be a frequent contender, gradually building up toward what would become known as the "Big Red Machine". By the time the Reds reached that peak, though, Crosley would be but a memory.

Crosley Field's decline had begun in earnest in the mid-1950s with the [[automobile]] supplanting the train as the main method of transportation. The ballpark was located in the dense west end. Businesses (such as the Superior Towel and Linen Service, a.k.a. "The Laundry", as well as a large factory) bounded the park on three sides. The neighborhood was not suited for the automobile; parking increasingly became a major problem in the last 15 years of Crosley Field's existence, as did crime — especially during night games.

Around 1960, Powel Crosley was courted by a group seeking to return a [[National League]] franchise to New York City to replace the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] and the [[New York Giants (NL)|Giants]], who had moved to [[Los Angeles]] and  [[San Francisco]] respectively after the [[1957 in baseball|1957]] season. The moves left the [[American League]] [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] as the city's sole baseball team. Crosley was unwilling to move. However, he died the following year and his estate sold the team a few months later to [[Bill DeWitt]], who kept Crosley's name on the park.

Complicating matters was that legendary football coach [[Paul Brown]], the founder of the [[Cleveland Browns]], who had been deposed by new owner [[Art Modell]] in 1963, was wanting to get back into professional football. He was granted an [[American Football League]] franchise for Cincinnati, the [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]]. A contingency of that agreement was that an appropriate facility be ready by the time the 1970 [[National Football League]] season began, which would be the first season that the AFL was fully [[AFL–NFL Merger|merged]] with the NFL.

[[File:Crosley Field.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Aerial view of Crosley Field c. 1970.]]
An agreement was struck to build a multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. [[Riverfront Stadium]] seated about 60,000 people and was deemed a logical solution to a myriad of problems. The Reds were part of that agreement, and Crosley Field's end was in sight.

It was believed that the Sunday, September 28, 1969 game against the [[Houston Astros]], which was that year's last home game for the Reds (who won 4–1), would be the final game ever at Crosley Field. However, delays in final construction of Riverfront Stadium, led to the Reds opening the 1970 season at Findlay and Western, against the [[Montreal Expos]]. New additions to the Reds that season were figures who would become Reds legends: [[baseball manager|manager]] [[Sparky Anderson|George Lee "Sparky" Anderson]] and [[shortstop]] [[Dave Concepción]], who had actually been signed by the Reds as an amateur [[free agent]] in [[1967 in baseball|1967]] as a pitcher. The 1970 Reds were pennant-bound, but Crosley Field did not figure into that event.

The Reds' last game at Crosley Field was played on June 24, 1970, against the [[San Francisco Giants]]. With the Reds trailing [[Juan Marichal]] and the Giants 4–3 in the eighth inning, [[catcher]] [[Johnny Bench]] tied the game on a solo [[home run]]. The next batter, [[first baseman]] [[Lee May]] won it on a solo [[home run]] of his own. The ninth inning was a relatively easy one for Reds [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[Wayne Granger]]; [[Bobby Bonds]] grounded out to [[first base]].

One of the highlights of the closing festivities was mayor [[Gene Ruehlmann]] taking home plate out of the ground and taking it via [[helicopter]] (which had landed on the field), to [[Riverfront Stadium]] and installing it in the [[artificial turf]].  After a brief road trip to Houston, which saw them sweep the Houston Astros, they returned to Cincinnati and opened Riverfront Stadium against the [[Atlanta Braves]].  They lost 8–2.

==The Terrace==

This photo was taken during the first game of a Reds/[[St. Louis Cardinals]] doubleheader on June 9, 1968. The Reds' [[Alex Johnson]] is the player shown here in left field, and, according to the scoreboard information, [[Lou Brock]] is at bat. Brock hit a fly ball to center for the second out, but the next nine Cardinals reached base safely, scoring ten runs. The Cards won the game 10-8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN196806091.shtml |title= June  9, 1968 St. Louis Cardinals at Cincinnati Reds Play by Play and Box Score |website= Baseball-Reference.com |date=1968-06-09 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

As previously noted, Crosley Field was usually among the smallest parks in Major League Baseball, both in [[seating capacity]] and playing field size.

Probably the most notable (or infamous) feature of Crosley Field otherwise was the fifteen-degree [[left field]] incline, called "the terrace". Terraces were not unusual in old ballparks. Most of them were constructed as a way to make up the difference between field level and street level on a sloping block. And most of them were leveled out ("Duffy's Cliff" at [[Fenway Park]] and Left Field bump at [[Wrigley Field]] are two examples) or covered by bleachers ([[Ebbets Field]] for example).

The story of the Crosley Terrace is the reverse of the long-departed "Duffy's Cliff". There was no terrace in evidence during the ballpark's days as the Palace, which had a fairly high wall whose base was below street level. The terrace came about when the new ballpark was constructed for 1912. The club received permission to expand the playing field, by way of the city closing the eastbound lane of York Street. Instead of building a very high wall and retaining a level playing field, the club built a somewhat shorter wall with its base at roughly street level, with the sloping terrace making up the difference in grade.

As baseball boomed during the 1920s, many clubs built additional seating in their once-spacious outfield areas. The outfield area at Findlay and Western was already small, so building inner bleachers was not practical, and the Crosley terrace persisted and became one of the park's trademarks. It was used, as Duffy's Cliff had been, for temporary spectator seating, in the days when standing-room-only crowds would be allowed at the fringes of the field behind ropes. The terrace also served as a [[warning track]], in lieu of the more typical dirt or gravel warning tracks that began to appear at most other ballparks by the 1950s. The slope was at least as much warning to an outfielder as a flat track was. Although the terrace was most prominent in left field, it extended clear across the outfield.

In later years, box seats were added to the terrace in the left field corner, in foul ground, directly facing the infield as the fair-territory seating once had. Behind the corner boxes, visible in some photos, was a stairway up to a street-level exit gate to York Street. Another street-level exit gate was on the center field side of the scoreboard. The terrace was shallow enough there to avoid the need for stairs.

The Crosley terrace was nowhere near as extreme as the terrace at Nashville's [[Sulphur Dell]], but it still frustrated many outfielders, mostly left fielders and mostly from visiting teams. [[Babe Ruth]] was victimized by it on May 28, 1935, playing for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] in his brief final season. He was headed for the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]], but one day as Ruth was headed up the Crosley terrace, he fell down on his face. Less dramatically, [[Yogi Berra]] had to negotiate the terrace on a Frank Robinson double in Game 3 of the [[1961 World Series]].

[[File:Crosley Field LF terrace 1946.jpg|thumb|260px|The terrace in 1946.]]
[[Frank Robinson]], however, loved it. In the early 1990s, when the [[Baltimore Orioles]] were planning their future home, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], Robinson, an Orioles executive and one-time Reds star, unsuccessfully lobbied to get the team to install a terrace in left field.  

When the [[Houston Astros]]' new facility, [[Minute Maid Park|Enron Field]], was being built, a prominent addition to the field was a 30° center field incline with a flagpole, which was dubbed "[[Tal's Hill]]" in reference to its proponent, Astros executive [[Tal Smith]]. However, like many terraces of the past, it too has been removed and replaced with seating.

To commemorate their Crosley Field years, the main entrance of the Cincinnati Reds' new park, [[Great American Ball Park]], features a monument called "Crosley Terrace" that features inclines and statues of Crosley-era stars [[Joe Nuxhall]], [[Ernie Lombardi]], [[Ted Kluszewski]], and [[Frank Robinson]]. References to the terrace are also visible. This monument was designed by architecture firm [[Populous (architects)|Populous]] and sculptor [[Tom Tsuchiya]].

==Other uses==
Through much of its history, Crosley Field was used for other events besides Cincinnati Reds baseball games.

The [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues']] [[Cincinnati Tigers]] in [[1936 in baseball|1936]] and [[1937 in baseball|1937]] called Crosley home.

The original [[1937 in baseball|1937]] Cincinnati Bengals football team played home games there.

During World War I, the city's police force staged a review at Redland Field on October 17, 1917.

On August 21, 1966, Crosley Field hosted [[The Beatles]], who were in the midst of their final American and Canadian tour.  The concert had been scheduled for the previous day, but was rained out.

On June 13, 1970, Crosley Field hosted The Cincinnati Pop Festival. The band lineup included: [[The Stooges]], [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Mighty Quick]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Mott The Hoople]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Bloodrock]], [[Savage Grace]], [[Brownsville Station (band)|Brownsville Station]], [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], [[Damnation Of Adam Blessing]], and [[John Drakes Shakedown]].

Other events held there included a [[Roy Rogers]] [[rodeo]], a political rally for [[Wendell Willkie]], and even an [[Ice Capades]] show.

==After the Reds==
After the 1970 season, the Cincinnati Reds and the city, which had agreed to buy Crosley Field, were at an impasse over how much Crosley Field was worth. The Reds wanted $3.5&amp;nbsp;million; the city countered with a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million offer. Eventually the case went to court. The city contended that since Crosley Field's playing field was extremely depressed, it would need to be filled — a costly and time-consuming affair. The Reds countered that since [[Interstate 75]] ran by it, the site would become premium real estate, and they should be fairly compensated for the increase in value. They also brought in an expert witness: [[Pete Rose|Peter Edward Rose]]. Rose espoused the positives of Crosley Field.

Eventually, a [[jury]] set the sale price at $2.5 million. After the sale was made official, the city turned the park into an auxiliary auto impound lot while the Queensgate project was finalized. Ironically, given the parking shortage for many years, Crosley had itself become a parking lot. Two years later, the demolition of Crosley Field began in earnest. The park was soon gutted; seats sold for $10 and fans and present and former club employees scrounged for mementos. On April 19, 1972, [[Pete Rose, Jr.]] pulled a lever that sent a [[wrecking ball]] into the side of Crosley Field.  By autumn, just the faint outline of the grandstand remained.

Today, seven buildings occupy the site and a street runs through it.  The former site of [[home plate]] has been painted in an alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=AB&amp;Dato=20120405&amp;Kategori=SPT04&amp;Lopenr=204050803&amp;Ref=PH | title=Site of Crosley Field as it is today | work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | date=April 5, 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old left field terrace area is now a parking lot, but it's still distinguishable due to its slope and its location next to York Street. Dalton Street, which formerly dead-ended into Findlay Street, was extended through the former field of play.

==Rebirth==
In [[1974 in baseball|1974]], Larry Luebbers of [[Union, Kentucky]], built a replica of the Crosley Field playing field on his farm. To that, he added memorabilia that he had harvested during Crosley's demolition, such as seats, signage, and the old Crosley ticket booth; painted advertising on the fences; and opened it for the Cincinnati Suds professional [[softball]] team, which he also owned. However, by [[1984 in baseball|1984]], it was gone, too. Luebbers was forced to sell his farm to pay off his creditors. Luebbers' son, [[Larry Luebbers]], played for the Reds and several other clubs in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/L/Pluebl001.htm |title=Larry Luebbers |website=Retrosheet.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the time Larry Luebbers' Crosley recreation failed, Marvin Thompson, then city manager of the Cincinnati suburb of [[Blue Ash, Ohio|Blue Ash]], came up with the idea to make one of the ballfields of a planned community sports complex a recreation of Crosley Field. Administrative aide Mark Rohr was put in charge. He tracked down memorabilia for the park; what he couldn't find was often donated by fans. Items such as usher's uniforms, signage, rooftop pennants, and a field microphone were given to the new project, which opened in [[1988 in baseball|1988]] with an Old Timer's game (which has since been discontinued). The scoreboard, which is a recreation, carries information from the final game at the old park. The field also has a white wall with "CROSLEY FIELD" in red letters in the appropriate font.  This recreation was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews from fans old enough to remember the real park, as well as many retired Reds players such as Pete Rose, [[Joe Nuxhall]], and [[Jim O'Toole]]. A wall features a number of plaques commemorating Crosley-era Reds greats.  Additionally, 400 seats from the original field were installed at the Blue Ash replica.

In an interview with author [[Greg Rhodes]], Rohr, who wasn't a baseball fan when the project began, stated: "Sometimes I have a hard time understanding the people who come and stare at this place with tears in their eyes; a woman actually hugged the ticket booth and kissed it". The field is also used regularly by teams in various levels of play.  [[Moeller High School]]'s Varsity Baseball team plays its home games at Crosley.

==Home runs==
Crosley Field was known as a hitter-friendly park, though it was less so in its early days when the diamond was farther from the fences.
*The first over-the-fence home run struck at Redland/Crosley Field was by outfielder Pat Duncan on June 2, 1921.
*[[Ernie Lombardi]] once hit a home run that landed in a truck traveling beyond the outfield fence. The truck carried the ball for 30&amp;nbsp;miles. Writers facetiously called this the "longest home run" in history.
*The Goat Run, additional rows of seats which decreased the right field porch from 366&amp;nbsp;feet (111.5&amp;nbsp;m) to 342&amp;nbsp;feet (104.2&amp;nbsp;m), was added specifically for slugging, sleeveless left-handed batter [[Ted Kluszewski]], presumably to increase his home run total. However, "Klu" rarely hit home runs in the area and it was removed after the [[1958 World Series|1958]] season. Crosley's normal right field layout had the rare element of a foul line farther away (366) than the power alley (360); this meant that balls hit down the right-field line "died" in the corner, with the batter often getting a triple, due to the long distance to third base from right field.
*The scoreboard in left-center field was a major impediment to home-run hitting.  At 55&amp;nbsp;ft (16.8 m) tall, and entirely in play (yellow lines appeared on walls many years later), many hits that would be home runs anywhere else became two-base hits, bouncing back to the outfielder.  A sign to the right side of the clock at the very top of the scoreboard offered a free suit from a local tailor to any Reds player to hit the sign.  Small consolation for a near miss on a home run.
*On June 10, 1967, [[Houston Astros|Houston]] outfielder [[Jimmy Wynn]] hit a home run to center, onto future [[Interstate 75|I-75]]. This shot has been portrayed in many films and television shows.

In 1937, the [[Mill Creek (Ohio)|Mill Creek]] flooded, submerging the field under {{convert|20|ft}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8S1LFG_KAEC&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=insider%20cincinnati&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=insider%20cincinnati&amp;f=false |title=Insiders' Guide to Cincinnati|publisher=Globe Pequot|year=2007|accessdate=May 8, 2013|first1=Felix|last1=Winternitz|first2=Sacha|last2=DeVroomen Bellman|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a lark, Reds [[pitcher]] Lee Grissom and the team's traveling secretary, John McDonald, got into a rowboat and entered Crosley Field over the left field fence and rowed to the area of the pitcher's mound. There was a photographer present, of course, and the picture has been well-circulated since then. For example, it can be seen on p.&amp;nbsp;40–41 of ''Lost Ballparks'', by Lawrence Ritter.

==Neighbors==
Across the left field wall on York Street, a sign on the Superior Towel and Linen Service plant advertised a downtown clothier, Seibler Suits, which rewarded any player hitting the sign with a suit. [[Wally Post]], who won 11, led the Reds in this unofficial statistical category; [[Willie Mays]] led all visitors with seven.  Its demolition in the early-1960s netted 38 parking spaces.

[[File:Curtis hixon hall 1965.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Brand-new Curtis Hixon Hall, 1965]]
'''Curtis Hixon Hall''' was an indoor sports [[arena]], [[convention center]], concert venue, and special events center which was located at 600 Ashley Drive along the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] in [[Downtown Tampa|downtown]] [[Tampa, Florida]]. It opened in 1965, and was the primary concert, indoor sports, and civic gathering place for the city of Tampa for about twenty years. The construction of newer and more specialized facilities around town during the 1980s gradually reduced the number of events held at Curtis Hixon Hall, and the opening of the much larger [[Tampa Convention Center]] in 1990 made it obsolete.

Curtis Hixon Hall was demolished in 1993, and the land was converted into a public park. The park was redesigned and incorporated into the [[Tampa Riverwalk]] in 2010, and the facility's former footprint is now home to the [[Tampa Museum of Art]], the [[Glazer Children’s Museum]], and the northern portions of [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]].

The Hall's namesake, [[Curtis Hixon]], was a long-time mayor of Tampa who died in 1956 while serving his fourth term in the office.

==Construction==
Curtis Hixon Hall was planned and built in the early 1960s during the administration of Tampa mayor [[Nick Nuccio]], who pushed for the construction of many public works projects around town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/nick_chillura_nuccio.asp Nick C. Nuccio – 47th and 49th Mayor of Tampa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105000000/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/nick_chillura_nuccio.asp |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for [[Curtis Hixon]], the mayor of Tampa from 1943 until he died while still in office in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/curtis_hixon.asp Curtis Hixon – 45th Mayor of Tampa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012123019/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/curtis_hixon.asp |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local architect Norman Six designed the uniquely shaped building in a modified [[Googie architecture]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/54208387.html?FMT=FT&amp;dids=54208387:54208387&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+17%2C+1992&amp;author=MICHAEL+CANNING&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;desc=Norman+Six+Sr.%2C+designed+Curtis+Hixon+Center&amp;pf=1 Norman Six obituary, St. Petersburg Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the {{convert|62,000|sqft|m2}} facility cost approximately $5 million and was mostly financed by [[municipal bonds]] issued by the city of Tampa. It was dedicated on January 23, 1965.&lt;ref name="compare"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7tSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4285%2C11769 | title=How Bayfront Center, Hixon Hall Compare | work=The Evening Independent | date=1 July 1964 | accessdate=22 September 2016 | author=Derrickson, Sally | location=St. Petersburg, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Curtis Hixon Hall could be reconfigured and subdivided to accommodate many different events. It had a maximum capacity of about 8000 in a concert setup.&lt;ref name="compare" /&gt;&lt;ref name="communitycenter"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/17458231 | title=Who Needs a Community Center | work=Tucson Daily Citizen | date=27 February 1965 | accessdate=20 September 2016 | author=McKalip, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted concerts and sports, conventions and trade shows, large community events such as New Year's Eve dances and [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival|Gasparilla-related]] festivities, and political events, such as a large 1968 campaign rally for presidential candidate [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name="compare" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50621707.html?dids=50621707:50621707&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+8%2C+1991&amp;author=JENNIFER+L.+STEVENSON&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.1&amp;desc=Tampa+set+to+tackle+fate+of+Curtis+Hixon Tampa set to tackle fate of Curtis Hixon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Curtis Hixon Hall was the site of a wide variety of sporting events. The first event in the new facility was a [[boxing]] card held on February 15, 1965,&lt;ref name="newarena"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/24188615 | title=New Arena Opens With Twin Bill | work=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times | date=15 February 1965 | agency=AP | accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it hosted many subsequent boxing and [[wrestling]] cards throughout its lifetime, including a nationally televised 1971 [[light heavyweight]] championship bout between [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] and [[Ray Anderson (boxer)|Ray Anderson]].&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wc4vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Au0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7161%2C1393303 | title=Bob Foster to Defend on Free TV | work=The Spokesman-Review | date=18 April 1971 | accessdate=31 May 2014 | author=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable fighters appearing at Curtis Hixon Hall included [[Earnie Shavers]], [[Emile Griffith]], [[José "King" Roman]], [[Vicente Rondón]], and [[Maurice Watkins]].&lt;ref name="boxrec"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxrec.com/location.php?country_code=US&amp;region_name=FL&amp;towncity_name=&amp;towncity_id=18398&amp;venue_name=&amp;venue_id=32605&amp;yyyy=&amp;submit=Go | title=List of Curtis Hixon Hall boxing cards from boxrec.com | publisher=boxrec.com | accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis Hixon Hall also hosted many [[basketball]] games. It was the first home court of the [[University of South Florida]]'s basketball teams and the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|ABA]]'s [[The Floridians|Floridians]], and it was also used for [[basketball#High school basketball|high school basketball]] games and tournaments.

===Music===
Curtis Hixon Hall was Tampa's primary concert venue from the mid-1960s until the early 1980s, with only a handful of the biggest acts playing at much larger [[Tampa Stadium]]. Many of the top musical performers of the era played at Curtis Hixon Hall, including [[Bob Dylan]] (both solo and as part of the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bjorner.com/DSN03275%201976%20Rolling%20Thunder%20Revue%20II.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), [[The Who]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[U2]], and [[Cat Stevens]], among many others.

Notable shows included:

*[[Jimi Hendrix]] played Curtis Hixon Hall twice in 1968, on August 16 and November 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia/document,19681123,1.html the jimi hendrix encyclopedia (November 23, 1968) - jimihendrix.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019203548/http://www.jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia/document%2C19681123%2C1.html |date=October 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In between those dates, [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] released their #1 charting album [[Electric Ladyland]]. 
*[[Janis Joplin]] was arrested by the Tampa Police for "obscenity" while playing a show with [[B.B. King]] and others in the hall on November 16, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.tampabay.rr.com/rootbound/outlaws/history_ch1.htm The Outlaws Miscellaneous History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210024711/http://home.tampabay.rr.com/rootbound/outlaws/history_ch1.htm |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Duane Allman]] made one of only two public performances with [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Derek and the Dominos]] in the hall on December 1, 1970.
*[[David Bowie]] played the Hall during his 1974 [[Diamond Dogs Tour]]. The tour featured very elaborate staging and costumes, but a truck carrying much of the scenery crashed on the way to Tampa. Bowie went on and played a less theatrical concert that focused on the music. During his last tour,. Bowie commented that the forced simplification of his 1974 Tampa show gave him the confidence to give music-centered performances later in his career.&lt;ref name="bowie"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tbo.com/events-tampa-bay/bowies-stripped-down-tampa-tour-stop-in-1974-still-resonates-20160111/ |title=Bowie's stripped down Tampa tour stop in 1974 still resonates |last=Spata |first=Christopher |date=11 January 2016 |work=Tampa Tribune |access-date=25 March 2017 |publisher=tbo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Elvis Presley]] played Curtis Hixon Hall in 1970 (2 sellout concerts on Sept 13 at 3:00 PM AND AT 8:30 PM), and again in 1977, just months before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/13443324.html?dids=13443324:13443324&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;date=Aug+10%2C+1997&amp;author=JACQUIN+SANDERS&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.F&amp;desc=WHEN+ELVIS+CAME+TO+TOWN When Elvis Came to Town]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and demolition==
Curtis Hixon Hall was considered small and outdated by the mid-1980s and was relegated to hosting smaller events such as small trade shows and local events such as [[High school diploma#Graduation|high school graduation]]s while most major concerts shifted to places such as the [[Sun Dome|USF Sun Dome]] (which opened in 1980) and the nearby restored [[Tampa Theater]].

When the much larger [[Tampa Convention Center]] opened in 1990 and Tampa began making plans to build a new downtown sports arena (the [[Amalie Arena]], then known as the Ice Palace, which opened in 1996), city leaders agreed Curtis Hixon Hall had outlived its usefulness. [[List of mayors of Tampa, Florida|Mayor Sandy Freedman]]'s administration decided to tear down the building and replace it with Curtis Hixon Park. Demolition of the facility began in 1993 and the park was dedicated in 1995. Aquamarine-colored tiles from the hall were set into each bench at the park.

The site was redeveloped again in the late 2000s to integrate the area into [[Tampa Riverwalk|the city's Riverwalk project]]. A new [[Tampa Museum of Art]] and the [[Glazer Children's Museum]] opened in 2010 on the footprint of Curtis Hixon Hall, while the open space immediately to the south became a redesigned [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]].

On 5 September 2017, Nepomuceno signed a one-year contract, with an option for a further year, with [[EFL League One|League One]] side [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oldhamathletic.co.uk/news/2017/september/05092017-gevaro-nepomuceno-signs/|title=SIGNING: Winger Signs For Latics|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

'''Heinz Field''' is a [[stadium]] located in the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. It primarily serves as the home to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). The stadium opened in 2001, after the [[building implosion|controlled implosion]] of the teams' previous stadium, [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The stadium is named for the locally based [[H. J. Heinz Company]], which purchased the [[naming rights]] in 2001. It hosted the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]] between the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and [[Washington Capitals]] on January 1, 2011. On September 10, 2016, it hosted the Keystone Classic, which featured a renewal of the [[Penn State-Pitt football rivalry]], setting a new attendance record at 69,983 people. In 2017 it hosted the Coors Light Stadium Series game featuring the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers.

Funded in conjunction with [[PNC Park]] and the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]], the $281 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|281|2001|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) stadium stands along the [[Ohio River]], on the [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]] of Pittsburgh in the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s of steel into construction.&lt;ref name=FactSh/&gt; Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 68,400&amp;nbsp;seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972 (a year before local telecasts of sold out home games were permitted in the NFL){{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the Great Hall.

==History==

===Planning and funding===
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] shared [[Three Rivers Stadium]] from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pirates building a full-time [[PNC Park|baseball park]], a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility.&lt;ref name=Bflawed/&gt; Though met with negative reaction from Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a "fallback position" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.&lt;ref name="Steelers Sell Bonds to Help Raise Money for New Stadium"/&gt; Steelers ownership stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the other three teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new football-only stadiums.&lt;ref name="Heinz Field: Standing Up to the Competition"/&gt; In June 2001, the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] purchased the naming rights to the stadium.&lt;ref name="deckard"/&gt; As per the deal, Heinz will pay the Steelers a total of $57&amp;nbsp;million through 2021; the "57" being an intentional reference to [[Heinz 57]].&lt;ref name="Stadium naming rights"/&gt; Despite Heinz later announcing its acquisition of [[Kraft Foods Group]] to form [[Kraft Heinz Company]] in 2015, the stadium's name will remain Heinz Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2015/03/25/CEO-Heinz-Field-name-will-not-change-with-merger-deal/stories/201503250174 Officials: Heinz Field name will not change with merger deal] ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' (03/25/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, a [[sales tax]] increase was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion of the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]]. After the rejection of this proposal in a 1997 referendum known as the "[[Regional Renaissance Initiative]]", the city developed the alternate funding proposal ''Plan&amp;nbsp;B''.&lt;ref name="Plan B"/&gt; Similarly controversial, the proposal was labeled ''Scam&amp;nbsp;B'' by opponents.&lt;ref name="TD"/&gt; The Steelers' pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50&amp;nbsp;million to $76.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Bflawed/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cranmer Still Optimistic on Plan B Deal"/&gt; Other local government members criticized the $281&amp;nbsp;million of public money allocated for ''Plan B''.&lt;ref name="Bflawed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team Sale Would Trigger Review of Public Stadium Funding"/&gt; One member of the [[Allegheny Regional Asset District]] board called the use of tax dollars "corporate welfare".&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt; The plan, totaling $809&amp;nbsp;million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arena Won't Be Part of Plan B"/&gt; Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031.&lt;ref name="TD"/&gt; The total cost of Heinz Field was $281&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Premium/&gt;

===Design and construction===

[[Populous (company)|HOK Sport]] designed the stadium.&lt;ref name="Football Stadium Architect Selected"/&gt; HOK Sport's project manager for the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the [[Rooney family]] asked for the stadium's design to "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going."&lt;ref name=Lehman/&gt; In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally.&lt;ref name=Lehman/&gt; The stone used in Heinz Field's design is [[Cast stone|artificial]], in order to decrease cost.&lt;ref name=Lehman/&gt; Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, "The glass is a more modern building element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in [Downtown] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas."&lt;ref name="Lehman"/&gt; The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design.&lt;ref name="New Steelers, Panthers Locker Rooms Are Separate, Simple"/&gt; As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is [[Aramark]]; over 400&amp;nbsp;eateries are located throughout the stadium.&lt;ref name="Heinz Field1"/&gt; A bronze statue of Steelers founder [[Art Rooney]], similar to [[PNC Park#Design and construction|those located outside PNC Park]], was moved {{convert|100|ft|m}} from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium.&lt;ref name=HFboss/&gt; In addition, a statue of a [[Panthers of Pittsburgh#Panther outside Heinz Field|Pitt Panther]] over a paved depiction of Pitt's [[Cathedral of Learning]] was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;96&amp;nbsp;foot [[Sony]] [[JumboTron]] was the largest scoreboard in the NFL.&lt;ref name="Game-Day Entertainment Built Around NFL's Biggest Scoreboard"/&gt; In 2007, ESPN named the "tipping" of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.&lt;ref name="Best NFL Touchdown Rituals (continued)"/&gt;

[[File:Heniz Field Pittsburgh PA.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Heinz Field from across the river.]]

Ground was broken for Heinz Field on June 18, 1999, at a ceremony co-hosted by the Steelers and the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="Steelers Break Ground for New Football Stadium"/&gt; The stadium was constructed by [[Hunt Construction Group]] and Mascaro Corporation.&lt;ref name="Heinz Field Graphics"/&gt; The two companies directed 1,400&amp;nbsp;workers over two years, in which there were no construction accidents or lawsuits.&lt;ref name="HFboss"/&gt; The stadium is inspected yearly, along with PNC Park, by Chronicle Consulting, LLC, for structural defects and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Sports &amp; Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County"/&gt;

===Opening===
[[File:Heinz Field Pittsburgh.jpg|left|thumb|Heinz Field in 2007 with Downtown Pittsburgh in the background]]
The first event held at Heinz Field was a concert hosted by the band [['N Sync]], on August 18, 2001. Coincidentally, they were also the last band to perform at the Steelers' previous home, Three Rivers Stadium.&lt;ref name="'N Sync Thrills Fans at Heinz Opening"/&gt;&lt;ref name=grass/&gt; Prior to the [[2001 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers regular season schedule]], the team played a [[Season (sports)#Preseason|pre-season game]] against the [[Detroit Lions]] on August 25, 2001.&lt;ref name="Detroit Lions at Pittsburgh Steelers – Preseason Week 3"/&gt; Pittsburgh won the stadium's unofficial opening game 20–7, with 57,829 spectators in attendance.&lt;ref name=NFLhis/&gt; The first official football game played in the stadium was between the Pittsburgh Panthers and [[East Tennessee State University#Football|East Tennessee State]], on September 1. The Panthers won the game 31–0, with [[quarterback]] David Priestley scoring the first touchdown on an 85-yard run.&lt;ref name="Heinz Field2"/&gt; The Steelers were scheduled to open the regular season play at Heinz Field on September 16 against the [[Cleveland Browns]]; however, due to the [[September 11 attacks]], all NFL games of the week were [[Postpone to a certain time|postponed]],&lt;ref name="NFLhis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob3"/&gt; thus moving the stadium's premiere to October 7, against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].&lt;ref name=Rob3/&gt; Prior to the game, a speech from US President [[George W. Bush]], ordering attacks on [[Taliban]]-controlled [[Afghanistan]], was shown live on the stadium's [[JumboTron]].&lt;ref name="The Big Picture: Home Opener Almost Normal"/&gt; The speech was met with much applause and support from the spectators in attendance.&lt;ref name=Rob3/&gt; Pittsburgh defeated the Bengals, 16–7. Steelers kicker [[Kris Brown]] scored the first NFL points in the stadium on a 26-yard field goal, and quarterback [[Kordell Stewart]] scored the first touchdown on an eight-yard run.&lt;ref name="Box Score – Week 4"/&gt;

That same year, two [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) video displays from [[Daktronics]] were installed at the field. The larger, high definition video display measures approximately {{convert|28|ft|m}} high by nearly {{convert|96|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name="display"/&gt;

In 2007, writer Bill Evans named Heinz Field the second best stadium in the NFL, behind [[Lambeau Field]], in an article for [[ESPN.com]].&lt;ref name="BestNFL"/&gt; Although both stadiums received a score of 54 out of 70, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named Heinz Field the second best stadium in the NFL, also behind Lambeau Field.&lt;ref name="NFL Fan Value Experience: Pittsburgh Steelers"/&gt;

===Future===
While the Steelers continue to make capital improvements to Heinz Field as well as expand seating, the future of the Pitt Panthers at the stadium as been more murky. Attendance for Panthers games has varied from an average high of 59,197 people per game throughout the 2003 season to a low of 43,680 in 2007.&lt;ref name="Off-Campus Location a Factor in Pitt Game Attendance"/&gt; Most recently, Pitt averaged 48,150 in home attendance during the 2015 season.&lt;ref name="Pitt football sees biggest crowd increase of Power 5 schools"/&gt; Nonetheless, Pitt's average attendance is significantly less than that of [[Pitt Stadium]], which was located on campus and torn down to make way for the [[Petersen Events Center]]. Much of Pitt's average attendance has been attributed to Heinz Field being a distance from Pitt campus in [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]], with games currently being largely attended by alumni as well as fans of the opposing teams. Most of Pitt's students that live on or near campus don't own a car or chose not to bring their car from home, leaving many to rely on the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County]] or [[Transportation network company|TNC]] drivers for [[Uber]] or [[Lyft]].

While there has been talk of extending the [[Pittsburgh Light Rail]] to Oakland, significant costs were cited during construction of the [[North Shore Connector]], which terminates at Heinz Field.&lt;ref name="O'Neill 2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08160/888095-155.stm|title=North Shore Connector, you're looking good|last=O'Neill|first=Brian|date=8 June 2008|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution has mentioned moving the games back on campus with a purpose-built stadium, which has gained support from Pitt's administration.&lt;ref&gt;https://triblive.com/sports/columnists/timbenz/breakfastwithbenz/14240141-74/podcast-how-likely-is-an-on-campus-football-stadium-at-pitt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://triblive.com/sports/college/pitt/14237349-74/pitt-ad-heather-lyke-says-possibility-of-on-campus-football-stadium-is-something&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/11/02/pitt-ad-heather-lyke-hints-at-potential-for-on-campus-football-stadium/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==
In addition to football games, Heinz Field has hosted other various activities.

===Football===
On August 4, 2012, Heinz Field hosted the [[Women's Football Alliance]]'s National Championship Game, becoming the first NFL stadium to host a title game for any [[women's American football|women's football]] league.&lt;ref name="wfanationaltitle"/&gt;

The quickest score in NFL history occurred on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the [[Tennessee Titans]], when the Steelers scored a [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] on the opening kickoff three seconds into the game. [[Darius Reynaud]] of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards (into the south end zone) for what was ruled to be a safety, not a [[touchback]], because the ball was not in the end zone when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000239923/article/darius-reynaud-tennessee-titans-have-rough-start Darius Reynaud, Tennessee Titans have rough start – NFL.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest NFL field goal ever kicked in Heinz Field is 53 yards.  Dallas Cowboys kicker Dan Bailey first set the record in 2016.  That record was tied on November 26, 2017 by Pittsburgh Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] in a game-winning effort over the Green Bay Packers with 4 seconds remaining in the game, resulting in a 31-28 win.  In collegiate play, University of Pittsburgh kicker Alex Kessman kicked a 55-yard field goal against the Syracuse Orangemen on October 6, 2018.

===Concerts===
Since its opening in 2001, bands and artists including 'N Sync, [[Beyoncé]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Kenny Chesney]], and [[LeAnn Rimes]] have performed at the stadium. In addition, hometown bands [[The Clarks]] and the [[Povertyneck Hillbillies]] have played multiple shows at the stadium.&lt;ref name="Hungry for Some Entertainment? Hit Heinz Field"/&gt;

===In Film &amp; TV===
The 2011 ''[[American Idol]]'' Auditions chose Pittsburgh of one of six cities and scheduled signups at Heinz Field on July 12–13 and auditions on July 15, 2011.

Heinz Field served as the home field of the Gotham Rogues in the 2012 film ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''.&lt;ref name="Fans Can Be a Part of The Dark Knight Rises Filming"/&gt; An estimated 15,000 unpaid extras filled the stadium during shooting on August 6, 2011.&lt;ref name="'Dark Knight' Snows on Downtown Streets"/&gt;

During Episode 4 of [[The Bachelorette (season 12)|''The Bachelorette'' (season 12)]], eleven contestants competed in a five on five football game. In addition, they met with football players from the Steelers, including [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Hines Ward]], and [[Brett Keisel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/6/8/11881780/the-bachelor-recap-episode-4-jordan-rodgers-jojo-pittsburgh-steelers|title=The Bachelorette recap, episode 4: Jordan Rodgers dominates at quarterback on the Steelers' field|date=8 June 2016|work=SBNation|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other events===
In 2002, the [[Pittsburgh Marathon]] concluded at Heinz Field; the course was altered from past years to allow competitors to cross the finish line on the field.&lt;ref name="Marathon Finds New Home at Heinz Field"/&gt;
 
In 2005, the Pittsburgh Wine Festival was held at Heinz Field, over 2,000&amp;nbsp;people attended.&lt;ref name="Wine Festival Scores Big at Heinz Field"/&gt;

==Features==
===Playing surface===
In June 2001, [[Smooth Meadow-grass|Kentucky Bluegrass]] was laid on the field,&lt;ref name="FactSh"/&gt; at half the height of most NFL field's {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of [[antifreeze]] and hot water, to keep the field at around 62&amp;nbsp;°F (17&amp;nbsp;°C) in order to keep the grass growing year-round.&lt;ref name="grass"/&gt; The field was re-surfaced multiple times, until the synthetic-enhanced [[Desso GrassMaster]] was installed in 2003.&lt;ref name="Greener"/&gt; Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game play. Despite this players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their opponents supported keeping the current turf.&lt;ref name="Debate Rages Over Heinz Field Turf"/&gt;

{{quote box|width=23em|I need the grass. I like the mud. I like the sloppiness, I'm used to it. Mr. Rooney, can we please keep the grass? I don't want no FieldTurf. It's bad on your knees.|—[[Ike Taylor]]&lt;ref name=Turflobby/&gt;}}

On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four [[Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League|WPIAL]] championship football games which were followed the day after with a game between Pitt and [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]]. After discussion with the NFL,&lt;ref name="Steelers Aim to Dry Out Heinz Field Sod"/&gt; Steelers ownership made the decision to re-surface the field for their [[Monday Night Football|nationally televised game]] against the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A layer of sod was laid overtop the {{convert|2.5|acre|adj=on}} Desso GrassMaster surface.&lt;ref name="Turf Topper: Heinz Field Surface Sporting New Temporary Sod"/&gt; The field's condition was exacerbated by 1½&amp;nbsp;inches of rain after the new sod had been laid,&lt;ref name="Turfpond"/&gt; which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began.&lt;ref name="Heinz Field Surface 'Like a Beach'"/&gt; The field conditions during the game ended up being so bad that at one point during the game, a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] by Dolphins punter [[Brandon Fields]] ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7DTNEa2E7w Stick 'em punt – Dolphins @ Steelers MNF – YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] by [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] with 17&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining in regulation;&lt;ref name="Dolphins Continue Woeful Ways, Fall to 0–11 After Sloppy Game"/&gt; it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the [[New York Giants]] and [[Detroit Lions]] played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943.&lt;ref name="Dolphins Continue Woeful Ways, Fall to 0–11 After Sloppy Game"/&gt; Scott Brown, of the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', called the field a "veritable mud pit".&lt;ref name="Upshaw"/&gt; While [[Gene Upshaw]], head of the [[National Football League Players' Association]], also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league.&lt;ref name=Upshaw/&gt; Steelers receiver [[Hines Ward]] called the playing conditions "horrendous" after the game.&lt;ref name="Steelers Prevail in 'Horrendous' Conditions"/&gt; However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, "I think everybody wants to keep the grass."&lt;ref name="Turflobby"/&gt; Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] on the road at the team's request.

[[File:SteelersWarmUp.JPG|thumb|right|Heinz Field before a Steelers game]]

Debate continued over the field later in the season when Jacksonville running&amp;nbsp;back [[Fred Taylor (American football)|Fred Taylor]] called the field "a lawsuit pending".&lt;ref name="Taylor No Fan of Steelers' Muck-Like Conditions at Heinz Field"/&gt; Pittsburgh's ownership stated that the decision was up to the players, who once again defended the natural surface.&lt;ref name="Grass or Fake Grass? Steelers Haven't Decided Yet"/&gt; In February 2008, the Steelers announced that they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface.&lt;ref name=Turfpond/&gt; During the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2008 season]] quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was given a [[concussion]] after being hit at Heinz Field. He later stated, "I'm glad we weren't on FieldTurf. That grass—you know, the soft Heinz Field—might've helped a little bit."&lt;ref name="Roethlisberger: Heinz Field's Natural Turf Lessened Injury"/&gt; After the 2008 season, a poll of 1,565&amp;nbsp;NFL players rated the surface at Heinz Field as the worst of the 18&amp;nbsp;natural surfaces in the League.&lt;ref name="Players Rate Heinz Field Worst Grass Playing Surface"/&gt;

The DDGrassmaster surface was removed in January 2009 and replaced with the old sod placed on top of the DDGrassmaster surface for the AFC Championship also in January 2009.&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"/&gt;

===Field design===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Initially, the south end zone had either "Steelers" or "Panthers" painted in the end zone, depending on the game itself. The north end zone has always read "Pittsburgh", which is painted in gold lettering and trimmed in either black for the Steelers or dark blue for Pitt. Although there is typically no midfield logo when both Pitt and the Steelers are in season, both teams have applied their logo if the field's schedule allows for a sufficient break to remove or apply the other team's logo for that team's next upcoming game. The Steelers have typically added their logo to midfield after Pitt's football season has ended.

In 2003, the Steelers played the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in a [[National Football League exhibition season|preseason]] game to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the [[Steagles]] team, when the two merged as a result of player shortages caused by World War II. Steelers president [[Dan Rooney]] had initially considered wearing a [[throwback uniform]] for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.

Although the Steelers lost the game 21–16, Rooney liked the look of the south end zone being "plain", and decided to keep it permanently. As with the team's logo at midfield, the Steelers paint "Steelers" in the south end zone once the college football season ends. The [[Green Bay Packers]] also adopted the plain diagonal white lines in the end zones at [[Lambeau Field]] for 2007 due to an Anniversary logo being painted on each end, before switching back to wordmark endzones in 2008 which have remained since.

{{wide image|Heinz Field Panorama.JPG|700px|Panorama of Heinz Field from club seating during Steelers vs. [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] post-game on December 21, 2014. Note the "Steelers" painted in the south endzone, added after the college football season.}}

===Seating and tickets===
As of 2008, the Pittsburgh Steelers have sold out every home game since the [[1972 NFL season|1972 season]].&lt;ref name="CopeDeath"/&gt; Entering the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2008 season]], the Steelers average ticket price of $69.47 was the 15th highest out of the NFL's 32&amp;nbsp;teams.&lt;ref name="Steelers Ticket Prices Again Below League Average"/&gt; The majority of the 65,050&amp;nbsp;seats are colored "Steeler gold", though club seats are dark gray.&lt;ref name=FactSh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lehman/&gt; Heinz Field features 1,500&amp;nbsp;seats in 129&amp;nbsp;luxury&amp;nbsp;boxes, with prices ranging from $64,000 to $135,000 depending on location and size. These boxes were predicted to increase the Steelers' profits from $10 to $11 million per season over those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600&amp;nbsp;club&amp;nbsp;seats that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $2,000 per person.&lt;ref name="Premium"/&gt; For the 2010 season, season ticket prices for Panthers games range from a maximum of $295&amp;nbsp;per club seat with required donations per seat between $250 and $500&amp;nbsp;depending on location, to as low as $87&amp;nbsp;per seat with no required donation for upper end zone sections. Individual game ticket prices ranged from $30 to $65 depending on the seat location and the opponent.&lt;ref name="2010 Ticket Information"/&gt;

===Great Hall===
[[File:GreatHallEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Hall]]
The Great Hall spans approximately {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} on the east side of the stadium and houses a collection of Steelers and Pittsburgh Panthers memorabilia. The Hall includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise's major events, an oversized Steelers helmet hangs from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows entertainment for fans throughout game days.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt; The Great Hall also features the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame members]] [[Franco Harris]], [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], and [[Bill Dudley]].&lt;ref name=GH/&gt; Six large [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Super Bowl trophies]]-shaped display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship the Steelers have won including replica trophies.&lt;ref name=SGH/&gt; Two display columns are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from the Panthers' teams. The floor is painted to resemble the field at Three Rivers Stadium, with the word "Steelers" painted in black over a gold background.&lt;ref name="GH"/&gt; University of Pittsburgh players are featured on two large murals within the Hall. Eight additional tile murals created by local high schools represent western Pennsylvania football history.&lt;ref name="SGH"/&gt; In 2007, the Great Hall was named the best concourse at an NFL stadium by writer Bill Evans, in an article for [[ESPN.com]].&lt;ref name=BestNFL/&gt;

==Seating expansion==
The Steelers notified the [[Pittsburgh Stadium Authority]] in December 2010 of their intention to add up to 4,000 seats to the lower southern end of the stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season.&lt;ref name="Steelers Consider Expanding Heinz Field"/&gt; Seating was added in that section for the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]], which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.&lt;ref name="Steelers Climb Stairway to Seventh Heaven"/&gt;

On April 12, 2012, the Steelers confirmed they would seek approval from the NFL to expand seating by 3,000.&lt;ref name="Steelers Move to Add 3,000 Seats to Heinz Field"/&gt; On May 19, 2014, after more than two years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 seats to the venue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2014/05/19/Steelers-reach-agreement-with-Sports-Exhibiition-Authority-on-new-seats-at-Heinz-Field/stories/201405190165&lt;/ref&gt; After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase capacity to a total of 68,400. The seating was put in place by the summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2014/12/02/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Heinz-Field-south-end-zone-expansion/stories/201412020188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation access==
Heinz Field is located at Exit 1B of [[Interstate 279]] within a mile of direct access to both [[Interstate 376]] and [[Interstate 579]]. The stadium also has dedicated elevated walkway access to the [[Allegheny (PAT station)|Allegheny Station]] of the [[Pittsburgh Light Rail|Light Rail/Subway]] system. On Steelers and Pitt Panthers game days, access is also provided from [[Station Square]] parking facilities via the [[Gateway Clipper Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatewayclipper.com/shuttle/university-of-pittsburgh-football/|title=Pittsburgh Panthers/Heinz Field Shuttle|publisher=Gateway Clipper Fleet|accessdate=July 8, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724183329/http://www.gatewayclipper.com/shuttle/university-of-pittsburgh-football/|archivedate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14054">'''Juggling world records''' comprise the best performances in the fields of endurance and numbers [[juggling]].

== Criteria ==
For ratification as a world record, the claimed record 
* must be proved by video evidence, either available to the general public or 
* must be validated by organizations such as ''Guinness World Records''

Up until 2012 any record must have been proved by either of the two methods above or by video evidence, available to the members of the former ''[[Juggling Information Service]] Committee on Numbers Juggling (JISCON)''&lt;ref name=JIS&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Numbers Juggling Records |publisher=Juggling Information Service Committee on Numbers Juggling (JISCON) |url=http://www.juggling.org/records/records.html |accessdate=February 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. JISCON is no longer active.

Records begin where each object being juggled has been thrown and successfully caught at least once (e.g. 11 catches of 12 balls is not listed). This is known as a '[[flash (juggling)|flash]]'. Where each object is thrown and caught more than once the term used is a 'qualify'.

=== Notes on defining the props ===
* [[Juggling ball|Balls]], which include ''beanbags'', must be roughly spherical objects.&lt;ref name=Rules&gt;{{cite web |title=Numbers Juggling Rules &amp; Definitions |publisher=Juggling Information Service Committee on Numbers Juggling (JISCON) |url=http://www.juggling.org/records/rules.html |accessdate=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Juggling club|Clubs]], which include ''sticks'' and ''batons'', must be long, roughly cylindrical objects.&lt;ref name=Rules/&gt;
* [[Juggling ring|Rings]], which include ''plates'' and ''hoops'', must be flat, roughly circular objects.&lt;ref name=Rules/&gt;
* [[Forms of juggling#Bounce Juggling|Bouncing balls]] must be bounced off a solid, flat, horizontal surface with just one bounce per ball between each throw and catch.

== Solo juggling records ==
Props must be thrown individually from each hand, and counting of catches commences once all props bar one have been thrown. 
Multiplexing (throwing more than one prop at a time from the same hand) is not allowed. 
Catches are counted only for throws made while no props have been dropped. According to JISCON definition, a drop is "a failure to catch an object that, as a result, hits the ground or any foreign object. A drop is considered to have happened at the moment the object should have been caught or touched, not when it hits the ground."&lt;ref name=Rules/&gt;

== Passing records ==
[[Image:Juggling Clubs Manuel and Christoph Mitasch 11 club passing.jpg|thumb|300px|Manuel and [[Christoph Mitasch]], world record-holding club passers.]]
When [[Passing (juggling)|passing]], only the props thrown between two separate jugglers are counted. In some patterns (ultimates or one-count) all the throws are caught by the opposite juggler but in other patterns each juggler makes some throws to themselves. The reason for excluding self throws is that two jugglers could make a single pass to their partner and then go on to juggle solo patterns for as long as they wanted therefore undermining the record for 'passing'.

The '''Kookaburra Beast''' is a line of cricket bats manufactured by the Australian company [[Kookaburra Sport]]. This bat is popular with many international players, however after a decision in February 2006, the graphite backed model has been banned by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in international [[test cricket|test match]]es due to a speculation that the bat's graphite backing unlawfully strengthens the bat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239032.html Cricinfo - Kookaburra takes legal advice against MCC ruling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
'The Beast' as it is commonly known, is one of Kookaburra's premier bats. It is made of the highest grade of [[Salix alba|English willow]] wood which is naturally air dried after harvesting.

The senior model weighs between 2&amp;nbsp;lbs 7oz and 2&amp;nbsp;lbs 11oz and comes in only 'short handle' and 'long blade' sizes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kookaburra.biz/cricketdetail_aus.php?PID=487&amp;MenuCat=1&lt;/ref&gt; Junior models exist in an array of qualities from high-grade English willow to comparatively low-grade [[Kashmir willow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rebelsport.com.au/?action=view&amp;id=902503&amp;cat=78 Rebel Sport - Australia's best sports store for AFL, NRL, Soccer and much more&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Britt_Assombalonga.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A young man wearing a yellow shirt, red shorts and red socks, standing on a grass field|Academy graduate [[Britt Assombalonga]] made his Watford debut in 2012.]]
[[Watford Football Club]] is an English [[association football]] club, based in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]]. The club's history can be traced back to 1881; it took its current name in 1898, following the merger of West Hertfordshire and Watford St. Mary's. Since moving from a ground in Cassio Road in 1922, they have played their home matches at [[Vicarage Road]] stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Jones p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Many players have contributed significantly to the history of the club, despite playing a relatively small number of games. [[Paul Atkinson (footballer born 1961)|Paul Atkinson]], [[Mo Johnston]] and [[Neil Price (footballer)|Neil Price]] all featured for Watford in the [[1984 FA Cup Final]]. [[Nick Wright (footballer born 1975)|Nick Wright]] scored the opening goal in Watford's 2&amp;ndash;0 win over Bolton in the [[1999 Football League First Division play-off Final]], a game that [[Israel national football team|Israel international]] [[Alon Hazan]] also participated in. Several players have gone on to become [[Premier League]] footballers following successful loan spells at Watford, including [[Chris Eagles]] and [[England national football team|England international]] [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]]; others such as [[Alexandre Bonnot]] and [[Steve Brooker]] played their only top division games in English football with Watford. In the [[2009&amp;ndash;10 Watford F.C. season|2009&amp;ndash;10 season]], on-loan [[Tom Cleverley]] became the first person ever to win the club's [[Watford F.C. Player of the Season|Player of the Season award]] having made fewer than 50 Watford appearances. Others made significant contributions to the club after their careers ended. Examples include [[Ron Gray (footballer)|Ron Gray]], who managed the club after he retired as a player, and Price, who at various points commentated on the club's matches for the BBC, worked for the club, and formed the Watford Former Players' Association.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Frank (30 March 2012). "A pub 'to call home and their own'". ''Watford Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This list contains players who have made 49 or fewer competitive appearances for Watford. It includes appearances and goals in the [[Premier League]], [[Football League]], [[Southern Football League]], [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]], [[Football League Trophy]], [[Full Members Cup]], [[UEFA Cup]] and the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]]. Appearances and goals in other competitions or non-competitive matches are not included. The table does not include appearances and goals from [[1939&amp;ndash;40 in English football|1939&amp;ndash;1940]], when the season was abandoned after three matches due to the [[Second World War]]. Two players&amp;mdash;William McKenzie Law and Thomas Postlethwaite&amp;mdash;made their only competitive appearances for the club in this season, and are therefore not listed.&lt;ref&gt;Jones p.253&lt;/ref&gt; International appearances and goals given are for the senior national team only. Where a player represented his country, but not at full international level, details are given in the notes column.

'''Maguss''' is a [[free-to-play]] [[Location-based game|location-based]] mobile [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] with a [[fantasy]] theme. The game offers players a wizarding experience, allowing them to cast [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] by drawing [[glyph]]s, collect [[ingredient]]s, brew various [[potion]]s, battle [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]], and [[duel]] other [[Game player|players]] for glory and [[Treasure Chest (video games)|treasure]]. Developed by [[Central Europe]]an [[software]] company Mawa s.r.o., Maguss is set for an [[Software release life cycle|open-beta]] launch in February 2018.

== Gameplay ==
Using a mobile device’s [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] function and [[augmented reality]] technology, Maguss brings a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard’s]] world to life by populating real locations with beasts and [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]] to fight, [[ingredient]]s to gather, and [[Treasure Chest (video games)|treasure chests]] to unlock. Players choose from one of four [[Character class|classes]] (Paladin, Rogue, Druid, or Warden), each with its own blend of starting [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]], spells, strengths, and weaknesses. Players also customize an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] to represent their [[Player character|character]]. [[Player character|Characters]] possess an array of skills (Brewing, Exploration, Herblore, Sorcery, Invocation, Charms, and Dark Arts) that they can raise by accomplishing related activities. For example, collecting and opening a [[Treasure Chest (video games)|chest]] raises Exploration, while casting Sorcery spells raises the Sorcery skill. By exploring the world [[map]], players may encounter monsters, harvest ingredients, and discover [[Treasure Chest (video games)|treasure]]. They can also replenish their [[Health (gaming)|health]] by walking from one location to another. Players raise their overall [[Character level|Player Level]] from defeating opponents—monsters or other players. As they advance in [[Character level|level]], they can raise their attributes and gain access to various tiered equipment and wandering monster encounters.

=== Spellcasting ===
Spellcasting in Maguss allows players to engage monsters (and each other) in arcane combat. Casting spells involves unlocking them, assigning them to [[glyph]]s, practicing their use, and applying them in [[duel]]s. Spells fall under four categories: Sorcery (direct damage), Charms (healing and buffs), Invocations (defense), and Dark Arts (damage while also debuffing enemies). Players unlock additional spells as they gain [[Experience point|experience]] in a particular spell category. Players have access to a set of [[glyph]]s which function as slots for spells. To ready a spell, the player must first assign it to a specific [[glyph]]. In [[combat]], they have to draw the corresponding [[glyph]] within a given time limit in order to cast the spell it contains. This adds an element of skill to casting, as one needs to trace [[glyph]]s both quickly and correctly to unleash their effects.

=== Dueling ===
In Maguss, players may challenge monsters or other players in a [[combat]]. [[Duel]]s are [[Turn-based MMORPG|semi-turned based]]: each combat cycle, both participants cast spells during the allotted time, after which the spell effects are resolved one at a time, in a sequence alternating between the player and the enemy. The winner is awarded [[In-game currency|gold]] and [[experience point]]s. Another [[Game mechanics|game mechanic]] to duels is Heat, indicated by a meter and representing a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard’s]] stamina for spellcasting. The more powerful a spell, the more Heat it generates when used. Once a player overheats, they cannot cast a spell until they cool off again. The game offers 2 PvP modes: [[Distance|Proximity Mode,]] where players may duel nearby wizards, or a Ranked League through a global [[Matchmaking (video games)|matchmaking system.]] Ranked Leagues run for 30-day long seasons, each with their own unique theme. For each Ranked League win, players earn Competitive [[In-game currency|Points]] which they can exchange for that season’s unique [[armour]] illusions. Based on their final rank at the end of the season, players gain various rewards consisting of [[In-game currency|Competitive Points]], League Badges, and Season icons.

=== Brewing ===
Another activity players may partake in is [[Potion|potion-making]]. By using [[recipe]]s, player may collect the [[ingredient]]s to use in a [[potion]] brewing [[Minigame|mini-game]], the results of which determines the [[Potion|drink’s]] effectiveness. [[Potion]]s may have a multitude of effects, ranging from healing to [[Buff (gaming)|buffing]] [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]]. More advanced [[recipe]]s become available as the player improves their Brewing Skill.

=== Equipment ===
Players may collect a variety of equipment: [[Magic wand|wands]], [[headgear]], tops, bottoms, [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s, [[amulet]]s, and [[book]]s. Each piece of gear can boost [[Statistic (role-playing games)|stats]] or provide a unique benefit, such as giving bonus [[In-game currency|gold]] or experience points upon winning duels. These boosts depend on the item’s tier as well as its quality (Poor, Good, Mint, Excellent, Legendary). Besides regular equipment, players can also wear [[armour]] illusions. These can be worn over equipment, allowing players to alter their look while maintaining their current gear.

=== Monetization ===
The [[Monetization|monetization model]] consists of [[in-app purchases]] and optional [[In-game advertising|rewarded ads]]. The game includes 2 [[In-game currency|currencies]]: Gold ([[In-game currency|soft currency]]) and Magic Dust ([[In-game currency|premium currency]]). While some items (potions and recipes) can be purchased for both [[In-game currency|currencies]] others (equipment, spells) are only available for [[In-game currency|gold]]. Luxuries, such as cosmetics (armor illusions, alternate spell effects), [[ingredient]] and [[Legendary creature|magical creature]] packs and boosters are only available for [[In-game currency|premium currency]]. All [[In-game advertising|ads]] are optional and rewarding. Watching an ad can speed up brewing time, prolong booster for a little bit more or earn Bazaar [[Voucher|tokens]]. In Bazaar (a special shop category) players can exchange Bazaar [[Voucher|tokens]] earned from watching [[Advertising|ads]] for premium items such as [[Armour|armor]] illusions, boosters or even [[In-game currency|Magic Dust]].

== Development ==

=== History ===
Ondrej Tokar first conceived of Maguss in July 2014, and later formed the [[Software Company|software company]] Mawa s.r.o., a remote indie team based in [[Central Europe]]. By June 2015, the team had a [[prototype]] of a Maguss Wand ready for a [[Kickstarter]] campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magusswand/maguss-wand-prepare-to-be-spellbound|title=Maguss Wand - Prepare to be spellbound!|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched a month later. On October 10, 2017, Maguss launched on [[Indiegogo|IndieGogo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/maguss-the-mobile-multiplayer-spell-casting-game/x/15006087#/|title=Maguss: The Mobile Multiplayer Spell Casting Game|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually reaching 214% of targeted funding within 30 days. Game testing followed until November 10. December 2017 saw the end of the IndieGogo campaign and the launch of the closed [[Software release life cycle|alpha]] iteration.

=== Maguss Wand ===
Part of Maguss’s development was the creation of [[Physical device|device]] that mimicked a [[magic wand]]. The Maguss Wand provides an immersive approach to [[Spell (paranormal)|spellcasting]]—instead of drawing [[glyph]]s on their [[mobile device]], players may trace them in the air instead. Composed of a 350mm long [[plastic]] body with a single button and [[USB|micro USB]] port for charging, the Maguss [[Magic wand|Wand]] is compatible with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (version 4.1 [[Android Jelly Bean|Jellybean]] and newer) and [[iOS]] (version 7) and tethers to mobile devices using [[Bluetooth Low Energy|BLE]] (Bluetooth Low Energy). The [[Magic wand|wand]] may be customized by replacing the grip, tip, and metal rings. Due to the high cost of [[mass production]], [[Distributed production|distribution]] of the Maguss [[Magic wand|wand]] is currently on hold, pending [[investor]]s’ help.

=== Future ===
Maguss is set for a [[Beta launch|soft beta launch]] in February 2018, to last until December 2018. The team is set to add additional features to the [[Game|core game]], but plans have not yet been made public. While Mawa s.r.o remains interested in continuing Maguss [[Magic wand|Wand]] production, its future remains uncertain.

== Awards ==
In December 2016, Maguss won the [http://www.startupawards.sk/ Slovak Startup Awards] in the Art and Design category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startupawards.sk/archive-2016|title=STARTUP AWARDS 2016|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-02-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Maguss also received the [[Forbes 30 Under 30|Slovak Forbes 30 under 30]] Award. It has also received mentions in [[CNET]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/this-wand-tethers-to-your-smartphone-for-real-life-wizard-wars/|title=This wand tethers to your smartphone for real-life wizard wars|date=2015-08-08|work=CNET|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engadget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/12/maguss-harry-potter-go-pokemon-go/|title='Maguss,' the game that definitely isn't 'Harry Potter Go'|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nerdmuch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nerdmuch.com/games/46161/maguss-game-indiegogo-augmented-reality-ar-wizardry-fantasy/|title=Maguss: The AR Wizardry Game Now Live on IndieGoGo|date=2016-10-10|work=Nerd Much?|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other media.

A '''pleasure craft''' (or '''pleasure boat''') is a [[boat]] used for personal, family, and sometimes sportsmanlike [[recreation]]. Such [[watercraft]] are divided into two main categories: [[motorboat]]s and [[sailboat]]s. There are also [[Rowing|rowboat]]s and [[canoe]]s. They are used for holidays, for example on a [[river]], [[lake]], [[canal]], [[waterway]], in an [[archipelago]] or [[coast]]al area. Pleasure craft are normally kept at a [[marina]]. They may include accommodation for use while moored to the bank. 

In [[Great Britain]], many [[narrowboat]]s were converted into pleasure craft from their previous use for cargo transport on canals, and today the same hull style is commonly used for new pleasure craft using the canal system.

'''Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion''' is a football stadium in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]]. It is named after German athlete [[Rudolf Harbig]], and is the current home of [[Dynamo Dresden]]. Sports facilities have existed on the site of the stadium, the Güntzwiesen, since 1874. The stadium also hosts events other than soccer games and has hosted several home games of the [[Dresden Monarchs]] American Football team of the [[German Football League]], including their lone home appearance in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] in 2014.

==History==

=== Güntzwiesen, Hermann Ilgen and Georg Arnhold ===
[[File:Hermann Ilgen.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Hermann Ilgen (1856–1940)]][[File:Ilgenkampfbahn postal card.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The postal card of Ilgenkampfbahn, 1923]] The [[terrain]] was called English district of Dresden, where the [[bourgeoisie]] and the nobility have been here before their leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tom-connect.de/Staedtebau-Dresden/verdichtung.html |title='&amp;#39;Verdichtung der Vorstädte'&amp;#39; |publisher=Tom-connect.de |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more than 110 years the 8 courts equipped venue included a flat [[velodrome]], [[tennis]], [[cricket]] and finally a [[soccer pitch]]. The quiet field became a playground, because the sports culture was not used to such a high-level standard as today, in 1874. When the "''Verein für Volkssport Dresden''" was caring for these courts, the administration of Dresden and then a little time ago the [[Dresden English Football Club]]  (D.E.F.C.) substituted for this ground of professional further also first representative organisation soccer pitch for [[Cambridge rules]], in early times. The D.E.F.C. belonged therefore to the first soccer clubs established outside [[Great Britain]] and here starts on the same known ground for competitors which flung the leather ball into the net, "With naked legs!". Until 10 March 1894, a game was never lost (during 20 years record period), without somebody not conceding a [[Goal (sport)|goal]]. Some of the first soccer players were: Beb ([[Captain (association football)|Captain]]), Burchard, Graham, Crossley, Spencer, Atkins, Ravenscraft, Johnson, Le Maistre, Luxmoore and Young. The president of the club and venue was the [[Anglican]] '''Rev. Bowden'''. He came from the neighborhood and later by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]'s blasted [[All Saints Church, Dresden|All Saints Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/denkmal/VerloreneKirchen_72ES.pdf |title=VerloreneKirchen |website=www.dresden.de |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition here was the fathoming of the youth football, what it takes to turn into – invincible versus other clubs. In 1883, the venue at ''"Güntzwiesen"'' was in first time recorded in public interests of organized [[gymnastics]] federations. In 1885 the VI. German Gymnastics Festival (transl.: ''Deutsches Turnfest'') took place, with 20,000 participants and 270,000 marching athletes&lt;ref&gt;OStR Prof. Dr. Rudolf Gasch (Hrsg.): ''Handbuch des gesamten Turnwesens / und der verwandten Leibesübungen''. Wien u. Leipzig (Verlag von A. Pilchers Witwe &amp; Sohn), 1928&lt;/ref&gt; from the today known ''Deutscher Turnerbund''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtb-online.de/cms/content.php?navId=558&amp;pageId=1&amp;showDownloads=article_792&amp;dlDesc=Deutsche%20Turnfeste%20im%20DTB |title='&amp;#39;Deutscher Turner-Bund – Fitness und Gesundheit, Service für Übungsleiter, Top-Athleten, Spitzensport-Events'&amp;#39; |publisher=DTB-Online.de |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1896, the city of Dresden has been purchased additional surrounded land to setting it up into a proportional manner of living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/buergerwiese.htm |title='&amp;#39;Reiseführer Dresden – Bürgerwiese, Blüherpark, Güntzwiesen'&amp;#39; |publisher=Dresden-und-sachsen.de |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground of this constructed stadium was a part of about 8 courts, which every citizen of Dresden could use for free. The surface spread over 70,000&amp;nbsp;m². So far the complete area has been well-kept by gardeners. Every few years the area has been advanced in small ways. For a long time the ''Georg-Arnold-Bath'' has been an unknown part of the stadium. A 5m diving platform with extra 60m stands for swimming competitions existed. It was to be demolished in World War II again. Costs conducting oneself for all about 36,000 [[Reichsmark|RM]], to the extent of stronger money value. The new successor was the Dresdensia FC.

Before creation of [[tribune]]s, would it come nearly for a time of big fountains, but still when the German [[Imperium]] lost World War I and the [[town hall]] had only liabilities, because o fpaying [[War reparations|reparations]]. So it came the time of the noble donator, by an [[agent (law)|agent]]. He would be a patron of the new stadium. In 1922, on 21 December, workers laid the foundation stone. A quarter year later, the modern, up-to-date stadium had more than 24,000 admissions, including 300 seats and sheltered places. In opposite of the VIP today. The suites have been located towards the south side, before including a field for parades of the inside through the north side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamostadion.de/geschichte.html |title=Stadionhistorie |publisher=Dynamostadion.de |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed on 16 June 1923, a stadium in total amount of 500,000 [[German reichsmark]]s allocated for the expansion to ''Ilgen-Kampfbahn'' centrally located at inner city. As recently as 1937, it had been named after the [[Freemason]], Saxon [[royalist]] and inventor of the [[rat poison]]: Friedrich Hermann Ilgen (1856–1940), before the English and Americans went to other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freimaurer-lesebuch.de/download/Logendokumentation.pdf|title=freimaurer-lesebuch.de - This website is for sale! - freimaurer-lesebuch Resources and Information.|website=www.freimaurer-lesebuch.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After everything else exists a spoken opening poem by himself for the youth:

The main part should turn into a with 40,000 seats equipped ''Saxon Hall'', in ensemble for the [[Adolf Hitler]] square in front, due to the fact that the stadium has been also created for troops parades of the [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] [[Reichswehr]] until World War I, before. If the complex would have ever finished, main segments of the forum had get chiefly the management houses of the [[NSDAP]], the German Hygiene Museum, [[Hall]] and the Bell Tower. It would outclass the [[baroque]] part of Dresden, if ever finished, but this was underlined as mad. Also the sense was to give propaganda for make war for citizens of Dresden, they had to imagine the triumphatic symbol for a heroic future. Models in instance were the Gauforum in [[Weimar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-weimarplatz.de/ |title=Forum Weimarplatz – Index |publisher=Forum-weimarplatz.de |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frankfurt Oder]], [[Augsburg]], [[Hanover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langeleine.de/?p=5694 |title=Das Online-Journal für Hanover » Blog Archive » '&amp;#39;Vom Gauforum zum Fußball-Stadion'&amp;#39; |publisher=langeleine.de |date=11 July 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bochum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doew.at/frames.php?/service/ausstellung/1938/23/23.html |title=DöW – '&amp;#39;Dokumentationsarchiv des österreichischen Widerstandes'&amp;#39; |publisher=Doew.at |date= |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in future it should stand in every ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of the [[Third Reich]]. The style corresponded to [[bauhaus]] – [[neoclassicism]] with monumental dimensions in order. The first three positions of 277 of elaborated designs were won Western Germans, but they lose the [[architecture]] competition because of none presently membership of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]].

The suggestion of the area made Prof. Paul Wolf (Building mayor of Dresden). The area had stabile ground and was undeveloped. City mayor Ernst Zörner and [[Paul Wolf]] proposed for the institute for [[eugenics]] and [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]].

The stadium was renamed to the Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion in 1951, which lasted until 1971. In 1953, the [[Sportvereinigung Dynamo]] took over the stadium and on 23 September 1953, the stadium was renamed after German athlete [[Rudolf Harbig]]. [[Bench (furniture)|Bench]]es were replaced via individual seats and the pitch was re-sodded, the first time 1956.
''[[Geliebte weiße Maus|Loved white mouse]]'' movie was held for final credit scene in overfilled oval, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058134/|title=Beloved White Mouse|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 October 1966, the rest of the ice hall is use for repairing the new stand. 1967, however, an international match versus the [[Rangers F.C.]]: soccer teams must go to ''[[Heinz-Steyer-Stadion]]'', by the reason of slight capacity. Once upon a time, the new [[floodlights (sport)|floodlights]], nicknamed "[[Giraffe]]s", were first used during a match involving Dynamo Dresden and [[East Germany national football team|GDR]]'s national football team. Floodlights were built by PGH Electro-Construction Dresden. The four floodlight pylons, had a height of about 60 meters, an incline of 20 degrees, and a weight of 60 [[ton]]s per example. Each [[Radio masts and towers|mast]] has six stages, which are equipped with 26 x 6.7 [[lux]] floodlights. At the end following in the last day's emphasize in 2008, if cars drove into the [[Elbe valley]] of the [[City]], it was a lightning [[symbol]] beside the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] donated golden Cross of the [[Frauenkirche Dresden|Church of Our Lady]]. The visibility in the heights around the city in radiant shine captivated all footers.

In 1971, the stadium was renamed to the Dynamo-Stadion, which was used until 1990. Since 15 September 1971, a new steel stand would build on the west side, inasmuch as the [[European Cup]] attracted the masses. After it should cut back, [[fan (person)|fan]]s resist again. With a speaker tower included over 6 [[TV]] commentator cabins. In addition came three TV podiums, which must mount with in a close steel stepladder. The speaker tower was also the lost-and-found office for [[match]] day's. If anybody lost possessions, the speaker informed the complete stadium with implied tens of thousands of spectators mocking attentiveness.

The electric scoreboard was first used on 6 July 1979, during a match between [[Dynamo Dresden]] versus [[1. FC Magdeburg]]. It is made up of over 4,333 lamps, and is driven by a [[computer]], searched in a 15 years period in imperfection.
1971, it was done the name "Dynamo-Stadion-Dresden". In a case of constructions, the capacity won measures of 36.000 seats, 1976. Four years later, 38,500 seats done installed for cup matches. In the summer of 1971, it was renamed Dynamo-Stadion for the SG Dynamo which used the stadium as its home ground for martial arts [[Stasi|State Security]] and [[Volkspolizei|People's Police]] games, or small publicity festivals, with [[SV Dynamo]] and [[Freie Deutsche Jugend|Free German Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picasaweb.google.de/marilynmonroe050/Einrichtungen#5273017663709062626|title=Picasa-Webalben – Dynamo deleter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other club which needs these oval, was the SG Dynamo Zentral Dresden. Fences stood only between the block and [[grass]], with a quantity such as in a garden. The new parking area was an ice skating course before. The capacity of the stadium was twice expanded: to 36,000 in 1976 and then to 38,500 in 1980. It should be noted that often the capacity has been beautified by officials. Years ago, here hold championships of [[Dynamo Dresden]] or couples have been married at the inner soccer circle, for their live together.&lt;ref&gt;Info material of the City of Dresden, April 2006, February 2007 und December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the stadium was upgraded to meet [[German Football Association]] and [[FIFA]] standards and the national building code. This included improved security measures to help protect players and referees. Benches have been replaced by individual seats and the pitch was re-sodded, the first time since 1956 that the playing surface has been renewed with the €375,000 cost being borne by the city of Dresden. That same year, the facility was again named for Rudolf Harbig.

In 1990, the name was restored to Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion, which remained until 2010. Since 1 January 1992, the stadium has been under the control of the city of Dresden in order to protect the site should Dynamo Dresden ever face financial problems. On 9 May 2007, German sports magazine [[Kicker (sports magazine)|kicker]] reported that an agreement has been reached with the city to finance the complete renovation of the stadium into a modern 32,400-seat arena by 2009. The stadium in its new form was opened on 15 September 2009 with a sold-out friendly match against Schalke 04, which Dynamo lost 1–2.

In December 2010, the naming rights were sold for 5 years to Bavarian energy company Goldgas which wanted to promote its Glücksgas brandname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/dynamo-fans-wollen-stadionnamen-kaufen-2428144.html Dynamo-Fans wollen Stadionnamen kaufen], Sächsische Zeitung online, 15 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/gluecksgas_get_naming_rights_to_dynamo_dresden_stadium/ Gluckgas get naming rights, retrieved 2011 04 07.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Women's World Cup host==
On 30 September 2008, it was announced that Dresden had been chosen to be a host city for the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. As a result, the old stadium that had stood on the site for over 100 years was torn down and completely rebuilt.&lt;ref name="FIFA host"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5001653/index.html|title=FIFA profile of Dresden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial "first kickoff" in the newly-rebuilt stadium was taken by the director of the German organizing committee for the World Cup, [[Steffi Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamo-dresden.de/foto/details.php?image_id=28937|title=Aktuelles|first=Sportgemeinschaft Dynamo Dresden|last=e.V.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North American sports, '''"running up the score"''' occurs when a team continues to play in such a way as to score additional points after the outcome of the game is no longer in question and the team is assured of winning. In the United States and Canada, it is considered poor [[sportsmanship]] to "run up the score" in most circumstances (exceptions are listed below). Sporting alternatives include pulling out most of the team's [[starting lineup|first string]] players, or calling plays designed to [[running out the clock|run out the clock]] (''e.g.'', in [[American football]], [[quarterback kneel|kneeling]] or running the ball up the middle). The term and the concept are not common elsewhere in the world. [[Mercy rule]]s are used in many amateur sports, which ends the game when the score reaches a certain point.

The most common negative consequences of running up the score are [[injuries]] to a game's starting players, lack of experience for the [[junior varsity|non-starting]] players on the team (in those cases where starters are left in a game well after the outcome is certain), and motivating future opposing teams. Players on the losing side who feel disrespected may decide to vent their frustration through violent or unsporting play, which can lead to injuries and fights, and even post-game punishment such as fines or suspension from future play.

Some have advocated in favor of running up the score using arguments which include catering to polls, getting additional experience, and to prevent [[Comeback (sports)|comebacks]].

Running up the score is considered poor sportsmanship by many fans, players, and coaches but with different opinions how big an insult it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04132007/sports/knicks/skiles_on_running_up_score__pure_bull_knicks_brian_lewis.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110549/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04132007/sports/knicks/skiles_on_running_up_score__pure_bull_knicks_brian_lewis.htm| archivedate=2007-09-29 | work=New York Post | first=Brian | last=Lewis | title=Skiles On Running Up Score: Pure Bull | date=April 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-04-13/news/0704130229_1_shot-clock-chris-duhon-knicks |title=Getting grilled |work=Chicago Tribune |date=April 13, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427102410/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-04-13/news/0704130229_1_shot-clock-chris-duhon-knicks |archivedate=2014-04-27 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/jun/19/ron-kantowski-on-need-for-passing-rules-against-ru/ |title=Ron Kantowski on need for passing rules against running up the score |date=June 19, 2006 |work=Las Vegas Sun News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527200755/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/jun/19/ron-kantowski-on-need-for-passing-rules-against-ru/ |archivedate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of poor sportsmanship are often brought up soon after a team scores multiple times near the end of a one-sided match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/preps/20051011-9999-1s11p-preptu.html |title=Some high school coaches say others aren't practicing proper blowout etiquette |author=Dickens, Bill |date=October 11, 2005 |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003020518/http://www.utsandiego.com/sports/preps/20051011-9999-1s11p-preptu.html |archivedate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifications==

===Benefits in the BCS and other polls===
Some sports have used polls for determining matches and championships. Certain coaches are notorious for running up the score to impress coaches and sportswriters who vote in the [[Coaches Poll|Amway Coaches Poll]] or [[Associated Press|AP]] [[AP Poll|Poll]].{{Cn|date=April 2018}}  It is a common allegation that some poll voters simply look at [[box score]]s before punching in their votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/melkiper/s/2000/1002/796872.html |author=Kiper, Mel |title=Like it or not, blowouts count |date=November 3, 2000 &lt;!--poss. October 1--&gt; |work=ESPN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040222130121/http://proxy.espn.go.com/melkiper/s/2000/1002/796872.html |archivedate=2004-02-22 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) existed in college football, the votes had a huge impact on who went to BCS games, including the [[BCS National Championship Game|national championship]]. Only by watching the game or game tape (or by careful box-score scrutiny) can a coach determine if a 49–21 score was caused by a fairly one-sided game or the winning team trying to make the score look more impressive when the game's outcome was certain. The BCS computers originally included margin of victory as a component, but the BCS removed that element after noticing large increases in teams running up the score.

From the 2014 season, the BCS was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP). Polls do not play a role in determining CFP participants; instead, these teams are chosen by a selection committee similar to that used in the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process]].

===Practice===
Some fans of teams whose coaches frequently run up the score may also note that running up the score has its advantages. Though many coaches who run up the score do it with only their first-string players, a coach who uses his third- and fourth-string players can give them vital in-game experience if he allows them to do more than just [[quarterback kneel|kneel on the football]] or run the ball up the middle. When they are not allowed to make passing and running plays that the first- and second-stringers get to make, their skills may not develop as quickly.

Alternatively, in college sports with many players from successful teams having hopes of becoming professionals, running up the score gives players the chance to improve their statistics and to show off skills that the conventional offense would not allow. While it may be seen as poor sportsmanship, as there is no guarantee that any player will be picked for the professional leagues, every opportunity to bolster stats and impress scouts can be seen as improving the professional prospects of the players.

=== Gameplay ===
It is also argued that it can be used as a preventative measure to prevent a huge [[Comeback (sports)|comeback]]. In 2006, Penn State lost to Notre Dame 41–17. Notre Dame justified running up the score because Penn State was known for late comebacks. Supporters of preventatively running up the score will often point to games such as the [[2006 Insight Bowl]] where Minnesota blew a 38–7 lead in the third quarter, to eventually lose 44–41 to Texas Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=263630135 |title=Texas Tech Red Raiders vs. Minnesota Golden Gophers – Box Score |date=December 29, 2006 |work=ESPN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200228/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=263630135 |archivedate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many leagues use tiebreakers if two or more teams are tied in the standings; one common tiebreaker when multiple teams are involved (such as when three teams are tied, with no team having beaten both of the others) is "point differential" (calculated as the difference between the number of points a team scores vs. the number of points a team allows against common opponents); "running up a score" can help their chances of winning positions and stop the other team from scoring as well (though some leagues counter that by placing a cap on the number of points which can be counted in a point differential, such as no more than 14; then, even if the score is 49–0, only 14 points will count in the tiebreaker).

=== Other justifications ===
An argument frequently used in favor of running up the score is the belief that it is not the coach's or winning team's fault if a weak team is unable to stop a high-powered offensive juggernaut.&lt;ref name="Fernami"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/Fernami/76485|title=Fernami's SportingBlog – Running Up The Score|date=April 11, 2007|work=SportingNews.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930115733/http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/Fernami/76485|archivedate=2007-09-30|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] coach [[Bobby Bowden]] contended that it was not his job to call plays that are inconsistent with his regular offense. He felt that the prevention of further scoring was the responsibility of the opposing team's defense. Also, some coaches advocate running up the score to make another point, such as showing disapproval of comments made by opposing players, coaches, etc., in the media.

Running up the score in professional leagues generally generates significantly less controversy and indeed the term is far less common. While there are numerous reasons to run out the clock, there is no reason not to score more points if the situation allows. As all teams are professionals, even perceived underdogs have the potential to score points quickly if they are given the chance. Even teams with a dominant lead have a strong interest in maintaining possession to run down the clock, which often puts them in the position to score more points.

At all levels of play, it is generally accepted that players or teams close to breaking significant records can run up the score without it being seen as overtly disrespectful. In fact, many offensive records almost require running up the score to be in contention as a result of records set in eras in which leagues were less balanced, seasons were of a different length, or rules were substantially different.

==In American football==
===College football===
{{Undue weight section|date=April 2018}}

====Florida====
With Alltel Stadium (now [[EverBank Field]]) still under construction in 1995, [[Florida–Georgia football rivalry|Florida visited Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia]] at [[Sanford Stadium]] for the first time in 63 years. With a 38–17 lead going into the fourth quarter over Georgia, Florida head coach Steve Spurrier decided to run up the score to "hang half a hundred" on the scoreboard to humiliate their opponents on their home field, something that had never been done before. His team succeeded with a final score of 52–17. That record still stands today as the most points ever scored by an opposing team at Sanford Stadium.

====Georgia Tech====
{{Main article|1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game}}
On October 7, 1916, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] defeated the [[Cumberland University|Cumberland College Bulldogs]] 222–0. Cumberland had previously disbanded their football team, but quickly formed a scrub team when faced with fines if they refused to play. Georgia Tech scored 63 points in the first quarter and 63 points in the second quarter, then 54 points in the third quarter and 42 points in the fourth. Cumberland did not record a first down during the game. Georgia Tech won under the coaching of [[John Heisman]], who wanted revenge after an embarrassing 22–0 loss earlier that year to a Cumberland baseball team that he suspected of having used professional players posing as students.

====Houston====
On November 23, 1968, the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] defeated the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|University of Tulsa]] 100–6. Though they had a 24–0 advantage at halftime, Houston scored 11 touchdowns in the second half for an astounding 94-point blowout. They came close again in [[1989 NCAA Division I-A football season|1989]], routing a [[1989 SMU Mustangs football team|Southern Methodist]] (SMU) team fresh off the so-called [[Death penalty (NCAA)|death penalty]] by a score of 95–21.

Houston coach [[John Jenkins (American football coach)|John Jenkins]] was known for leaving his starters in to pad their stats during blowout games but against SMU he did not. In 1990, Houston defeated [[Eastern Washington Eagles football|Eastern Washington University]] 84–21 to help QB [[David Klingler]] set an NCAA record 54 touchdown passes in 11 games that season.  The next year, 1991, they would blow out [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech University]] 73–3 in the opening game of the season.

====Miami====
On November 30, 1985, the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] Hurricanes were playing the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish of Notre Dame]] in [[Gerry Faust]]'s final game as Notre Dame head coach. The Hurricanes, led by [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], were trying to impress pollsters since they were ranked fourth in the polls prior to the game. The Hurricanes called a fake punt on fourth-and-11 in the fourth quarter with a 44–7 lead, scored a touchdown off a blocked punt with less than six minutes left, and went on to win 58–7. Miami was rewarded in the AP poll as it passed idle [[1985 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] to reach No. 3 and set up a possible national championship with a victory over [[1985 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] in the [[Sugar Bowl]]. Receiving criticism after the game, Johnson replied, "Nobody apologized to me when Oklahoma did it", a reference to a [[1980 NCAA Division I-A football season|1980]] rout by the score of 63–14 when Johnson was head coach at [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State University]]. Miami would go on to lose to Tennessee, 35–7, in the [[1986 Sugar Bowl]].

====Notre Dame====
[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] crushed [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] 69–14 in 1977.  The Fighting Irish led 21–7 at halftime but scored 21 points in the third quarter and 27 in the fourth.  Only a missed extra point after ND's eighth touchdown kept the Irish from scoring 70 points for the first time since 1932 and only the second time in [[Notre Dame Stadium]] history.  After ND took a 62–7 lead, Georgia Tech scored its only second half points on a kickoff return for a touchdown by [[Eddie Lee Ivery]]; the Irish would not surrender another kickoff return for a touchdown until 21 years later, against [[Kevin Faulk]] and [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] in 1998.  The blowout was payback for a 23–14 upset victory by Georgia Tech over Notre Dame in 1976, after which Yellow Jacket players were quoted as deriding the Fighting Irish as fat and slow.  There also was bad blood between ND coach [[Dan Devine]] and GT coach [[Pepper Rodgers]], dating back to the days when they coached arch-rivals [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] and [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], respectively; Devine's Tigers had mauled Rodgers's Jayhawks 69–21 in the 1969 season finale in Lawrence.  The 1977 humiliation of Georgia Tech did not impact Notre Dame's poll standing; they remained No. 5 in the AP poll—but the Fighting Irish won the rest of their games to finish 11–1 and win the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1977 national championship]].

Notre Dame annihilated [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] 54–7 in a 1992 game where Fighting Irish coach [[Lou Holtz]] called a fake punt on the first series of the third quarter, with his team already possessing an enormous (albeit not technically insurmountable) 37–0 lead.  A year later, Boston College stunned then-No. 1 Notre Dame 41–39 in the final regular season game of the year, knocking the Fighting Irish to No. 4 in the AP poll and paving the way for [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] to be voted national champions.

While playing at longtime rival [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] in 2003, Notre Dame head coach [[Tyrone Willingham]] allowed his punter to call a fake punt in response to a punt block read while the Fighting Irish led 57–7 late in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/10/09/spt_FBCnotebook.html |title=Irish's fake punt in rout still gnaws at Cardinal |date=October 9, 2004  |work=cincinnati.com (from Associated Press)&lt;!-- Blocked from archive --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willingham was formerly head coach at Stanford.

====Ohio State====
In 1968, the [[1968 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]], en route to a national championship, defeated their bitter rival, the [[1968 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan Wolverines]], 50–14.  Late in the game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common [[extra point]] kick, Ohio State head coach [[Woody Hayes]] opted for a [[two-point conversion]], which was unsuccessful. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, "Because I couldn't go for three!", though players have commented that there was some sort of confusion on the extra point kick, and Hayes was just covering for his players.

The following season, the heavily favored Buckeyes fell to the Wolverines, with Bo Schembechler using the 50-14 blowout as a motivation.

====Oklahoma====
On November 8, [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]], the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] showed little mercy against [[2003 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|Texas A&amp;M Aggies]], cruising to a 49–0 halftime lead. Oklahoma head coach [[Bob Stoops]] denied running up the score as his second string players came out in the 3rd quarter and put up 28 more points to finish with a final score of 77–0 and 639 yards of total offense. This was the worst loss in Texas A&amp;M football history. In Stoops' defense, the coaches agreed to a running clock during most of the second half and the entire 4th quarter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Also, at one point in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma had first and goal inside the A&amp;M five-yard-line with a chance to score over 80 points, but Stoops called four consecutive runs up the middle to prevent another score.

====Oklahoma State====
In their 2012 season opener, the [[2012 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State Cowboys]] defeated the [[2012 Savannah State Tigers football team|Savannah State Tigers]] 84–0. In defense of the lop-sided result, interim defense coordinator Glenn Spencer claimed the shutout was a tribute to the team's full-time defensive coordinator Bill Young, who had recently undergone an undisclosed medical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8331106/oklahoma-state-cowboys-dedicate-shutout-ill-coordinator-bill-young |title=Oklahoma State Cowboys dedicate shutout to ill coordinator Bill Young |date=September 2, 2012 |work=ESPN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902191528/http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8331106/oklahoma-state-cowboys-dedicate-shutout-ill-coordinator-bill-young |archivedate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended up as the most lopsided victory for OSU since a 117–0 rout of Southwestern Oklahoma in 1916 and Savannah State's worst loss since a 98–0 defeat against Bethune-Cookman in 1953, a season when the Tigers were outscored 444–6.

====Penn State====
Although longtime [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] head coach [[Joe Paterno]] was regarded by some as one who did everything he could to avoid running up the score, such as in a 63–10 win over [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] in 2005 where Penn State held a 56–3 halftime lead, Pitt partisan journalist [[Beano Cook]] claimed he made an exception in 1985 against [[Penn State–Pittsburgh football rivalry|hated rival]] [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]]. The game was well in hand with the score 31–0 when the assistants called the first string team off the field. Paterno supposedly immediately ordered them back in, saying, "I want to bury Pitt."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_19b4cad4-03a6-592b-832c-54cb5879e3cf.html?mode=jqm&lt;/ref&gt;   Paterno's 1991 Penn State team is often accused of running it up on [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] 81–0, but this was refuted by the Bearcat's coach [[Tim Murphy (American football coach)|Tim Murphy]], who said "I think Joe's a class guy and I don't believe he'd do that in a hundred years," Murphy said. "We made too many mistakes even for a first game of the season and that's my fault. I'm embarrassed, not Joe Paterno."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-08/sports/sp-2993_1_penn-state&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stanford====
In the early 2000s, [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] was considered the bottom-dweller of the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]], whereas in-state rival [[USC Trojans Football|USC]] was named the "Team of the Decade" by both CBSSports.com and Football.com, as well as the "Program of the Decade" by SI.com.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/11prenotes.fb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the arrival of head coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] to The Farm in 2007 and [[2007 Stanford vs. USC football game|Stanford's record-breaking upset of the Trojans that fall]], the [[Stanford-USC football rivalry|Stanford-USC rivalry]] began to pick up in intensity and importance. During their 2009 meeting, Stanford was crushing USC in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]], leading 42–21 midway through the fourth quarter. After a touchdown run by future [[Heisman Trophy]] runner-up [[Toby Gerhart]] to bring the score to 48–21, Harbaugh kept the Cardinal offense on the field to attempt a two-point conversion. When asked what was going on, Harbaugh said, "I want to put fifty on these motherfuckers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/06/27/rags-to-roses-excerpt-going-for-two/&lt;/ref&gt; The two-point conversion was unsuccessful, but Stanford would later score in the final minutes of the game, and ultimately won 55–21 after scoring 27 points in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=293180030&lt;/ref&gt; It was the worst home loss in USC history at the time, and is USC's largest margin of defeat in the Stanford-USC rivalry.

After the game, USC head coach [[Pete Carroll]] approached Harbaugh and, visibly angry, asked "What's your deal? You alright?" To which Harbaugh retorted "I'm fine. What's ''your'' deal?" This moment (in addition to the aforementioned Stanford upset of #1 USC in 2007) is seen by many as the turning point of the Stanford Cardinal football program, which since 2010 has been one of the winningest programs in college football.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.teamrankings.com/ncf/trends/win_trends/?range=yearly_since_2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Texas A&amp;M====
In the same [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003 season]] that [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] defeated [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]] 77–0 (see above), A&amp;M themselves ran up the score in a 73–10 home romp against [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor University]]. A&amp;M naturally entered the rematch a year later as huge favorites, and the game was to be played the week prior to the major rematch game against Oklahoma. Perhaps too busy awaiting their moment of revenge against the Sooners the week to come, Texas A&amp;M succumbed to the Baylor team they had humiliated the year before. As the Bears only managed three wins [[2004 Baylor Bears football team|that entire 2004 season]], the revenge-minded Baylor team's 35–34 overtime victory was arguably the biggest upset of the year. (Texas A&amp;M did end up losing to Oklahoma again the following week, as well, although this time only by a score of 42–35.)

====Washington and Oregon====
The largest margin of victory turnaround in Division I-A football in successive years belongs to the [[Washington Huskies football|University of Washington]] and the [[Oregon Ducks football|University of Oregon]] and showcased two prime examples of running up the score. In 1973, Oregon ran up the score at [[Autzen Stadium|home]], burying [[1973 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 58–0. A year later, [[1974 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] responded with a 66–0 drubbing of Oregon back home in [[Husky Stadium|Seattle]]. In that game, Washington's starting quarterback Chris Rowland played longer than necessary and suffered a season-ending knee injury. Rowland recalled that Washington head coach [[Jim Owens]] "wanted me in and said, 'We're going to beat these guys more than they beat us.' He [Owens] apologized to me because it was a personal thing for him."

====BYU and Utah====
The [[Holy War (Utah vs. BYU)|BYU-Utah football rivalry's]] history is replete with lopsided games on both sides.  During the early days of the [[BYU Cougars football|BYU football]] program, the Cougars would frequently be blown away by physically superior [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] teams.  At one point, between the years of 1931–37, Utah outscored BYU by a combined score of 200–6.&lt;ref&gt;http://sltrib.cougarstats.com/teams.php?id=13&lt;/ref&gt; The tide changed with BYU's hiring of [[LaVell Edwards]], who brought the program credibility (not to mention a consensus national championship in [[1984 BYU Cougars football team|1984]]).  During the Edwards years, the Cougars were regularly accused of running the score up mercilessly against the Utes.  Years where this was particularly true included 1977 (38–8), 1980 (56–6), 1981 (56–28), 1983 (55–7), and 1989 (70–31).  Normally, this practice was orchestrated by Edwards' assistants, such as touchdown-happy offensive coordinator [[Doug Scovil]].  Perhaps the most infamous example of Scovil's tendency toward scoring at all times was the 1977 match-up between the two teams.  BYU quarterback [[Marc Wilson (American football)|Marc Wilson]] was in the midst of a spectacular sophomore season, and Utah was struggling defensively.  During the fourth quarter, having already passed for 555 yards and four scores, Wilson was benched with his team leading 31–8.  However, a member of the stadium press contingent recognized that Wilson had left the game just six yards shy of the NCAA single-game passing record.  Scovil was informed, and promptly sent Wilson back into the game; the quarterback promptly threw an eight yard pass that gave him the record.  Scovil indicated for him to remain in the game, and he subsequently threw a fifth touchdown pass, giving BYU a 38–8 victory.  Utah head coach [[Wayne Howard]] was enraged, and that incident helped fuel the venom of the rivalry moving forward.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Lee. And They Came to Pass. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional football===
[[File:Explosion 138, Force 0.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Erie Explosion]], earning 138 points in a shutout win against the [[Fayetteville Force (SIFL)|Fayetteville Force]], ran up the score to set a modern professional football record in 2011.]] Running up the score is rarely done by teams in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and other professional American football leagues. A primary reason is that starting players and coaches are paid hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each year, which is affected by how the players and the team performs during the season. Any attempt to run up the score increases the risks of losing a key player to an injury that could affect the team's chances for the rest of the season. Thus, if a team decides to keep their stars in during a blowout, it is usually viewed by the opponent as an insult. Another factor is that the parity that the [[salary cap]] has brought to the NFL in the 1990s has evened out competition somewhat, with less talent disparity between the best and worst teams compared to the past. It is much more difficult to run up the score to embarrassing (50+ point) margins in the modern game at the pro level. The greatest margin of victory at the professional level happened in the [[1940 NFL Championship Game]] won by the [[Chicago Bears]] over the [[Washington Redskins]] 73–0. In 1976, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 59–0, a margin which was matched in 2009 when the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the New England snow. Most recently, the [[New Orleans Saints]] defeated the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 62–7 on October 23, 2011, and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] defeated the [[Arizona Cardinals]] 58–0 on December 9, 2012.

The one exception to this general rule is in regards to the NFL's tiebreaking rules that are used to determine which teams qualify for the playoffs if they are tied in the standings. One criterion to break ties is comparing the total number of points scored by each team during the regular season. Under this scenario, running up the score in a late season game is not considered poor sportsmanship because there is a benefit to having the score higher. This scenario almost occurred during the 1999 season when the [[Green Bay Packers]] could possibly have made the playoffs if the [[Dallas Cowboys]] had lost and they had scored enough points against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in their final regular season game to surpass the [[Carolina Panthers]] in total points scored.  They ended up beating the Cardinals 49–24 (not a huge margin of victory by football standards), but Dallas went on to beat the Giants later that day to earn the final playoff spot and knock the Packers out of the playoff picture anyway.

Accusations of running up the score are unusual in the NFL (except in playoff races), but not unheard of. One of the most notorious occurred on November 17, 1985, when the [[New York Jets]] defeated the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 62-28 in a regular season game. The two teams had last met in the final game of [[1984 NFL season|the previous season]], when Tampa Bay had somewhat controversially appeared to stop playing defense and allowing the Jets to score late in a 41–21 victory in an apparent effort to get the ball back so that [[running back]] [[James Wilder]] could attempt to break the NFL record for most yards from scrimmage in a season. Commentators wondered if the Jets' huge margin of victory was a way of retaliating against the Bucs for such poor sportsmanship, but the Jets and their coaches denied that there had been any conscious effort to run the score up.  The Jets' denials may be valid since Bucs coach [[John McKay (football coach)|John McKay]], who allowed the Jets to score late in the 1984 contest, retired after the '84 season and had been replaced by [[Leeman Bennett]], and also the Jets were 11-5 in 1985 and reached the playoffs, while Tampa Bay was in the midst of back-to-back 2-14 seasons in 1985 and '86.

A [[Monday Night Football]] game in 1996 between the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]] ended in a 21-6 Cowboy victory &lt;ref&gt;https://www.footballdb.com/games/boxscore.html?gid=1996111801&lt;/ref&gt; and some complaints by Green Bay players that the home team's final [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] was an insult to them, as Dallas had the ball deep in Green Bay territory with the game well in hand as it ended, yet chose to score more points anyway.  However, the final field goal was not an attempt at embarrassment, but at a record – Cowboys coach [[Barry Switzer]] wanted to give kicker [[Chris Boniol]] a chance to tie the then-NFL record for most field goals in a game (seven). Similarly, during the 2011 Saints' 62-7 victory, while the margin of victory was very large and the game was almost beyond doubt at halftime, [[Drew Brees]] had thrown below his average number of yards. Keeping him and the first offense playing contributed towards his breaking of the single season all time passing record later in the year, and edging out [[Tom Brady]] who also broke the old record that season. While it may be considered derisive to the opponents for coaches to push for records, they are a mark in history for the players and the coaches and it is generally accepted among critics {{who|date=February 2013}} that chasing records is not bad sportsmanship or running up the score per se.

While some teams who regularly score very large number of points are occasionally criticized for running up the score, it is debatable at exactly what point scoring additional points become running up the score. Given recent comebacks such as [[The Miracle at the New Meadowlands]] and [[Super Bowl LI]], and how quickly points can be accumulated (through interception returns, onside kicks and kick returns), it is understandable that coaches are cautious about becoming overconfident in their offenses and they normally prefer to run out the clock rather than risk an unlikely but certainly possible comeback late in the game, particularly for teams who have a strong offense but a weaker defense.

During the 2011 season, the three teams with the best offenses (New England, Green Bay and New Orleans) also had the worst defenses, which explains why none of those teams were happy to run out the clock, instead always pressuring for points. The current salary cap rules mean that it is nearly impossible for a team to have an excellent offense and defense over any period of time, particularly as cheaper players who play very well one year will likely cost more in the next year. Such tactics are generally referred to as 'Keeping their foot on the gas', and is generally not frowned upon in the NFL.

The most egregious known case of running up the score in professional football is believed to have taken place in 1904, when the [[Massillon Tigers]], in the pre-[[forward pass]] era, racked up 26 touchdowns and 18 extra points to amass a score of 148-0 against a team from [[Marion, Ohio]]. (Touchdowns only counted five points in this era.) A similar rout had occurred in 1903 when the [[Watertown Red &amp; Black]] obliterated an opponent from [[Cortland, New York]] by a score of 142-0. Under then-current rules, the team that had scored ''received'' the kickoff instead of kicking it as it is today; however, it was much easier and more common to perform [[onside kick]]s in this era, and as far as it's known, neither Marion nor Cortland attempted one. As such, neither team ever touched the ball after receiving the opening possession. The third-highest total in professional football history is much more recent, and happened in an indoor football game, where scores tend to be much higher than in the traditional outdoor game. In 2011, the [[Erie Explosion]] indoor football team racked up 138 points in a shutout victory over the [[Fayetteville Force (SIFL)|Fayetteville Force]]. Having blown out the Force 42-0 in the first quarter alone thanks to three Force pick-sixes (including one achieved by a lateral), the Explosion continued to pile on, offering free tickets if the Explosion hit 100 points; when the players and head coach [[Shawn Liotta]] were told that the indoor record was 133 points (they were not informed of the overall pro record), they decided to attempt to break it, a feat they succeeded in achieving.

There is one definite instance of running up the score in NFL History. In 1987, during the NFL strike, the Dallas Cowboys, who had many starters cross the picket line  such as Hall of Famers Randy White and Tony Dorsett, and starting QB Danny White. The Cowboys destroyed the Eagles 41-22 in one of the three strike games played in the 1987 season. To get back at the Cowboys, when the teams faced off again later in the season, Coach Buddy Ryan called a passing play on 3rd down with 1:00 left to play in the game after taking a knee on first and second down, even though the Eagles has the game won handily at a score of 30-20. The pass was incomplete but was called for pass interference, moving the Eagles to the 1 yardline, where the foul was called. The Eagles then proceeded to score another touchdown and finish the game 37-20. Because both teams finished 7-8 and failed to make the playoffs that season, this moment is not remembered as much as the 1987 Replacement game between the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys. This moment was also overshadowed by the future success of the Eagles, the Cowboys failures in the late 1980’s, and Buddy Ryan’s heavily publicized feud against his former coach Mike Ditka. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20110522%2FFOOTBALL09%2F305219895 |title=Erie Explosion set record in 138-0 win |author=Rankin, Duane |date=May 22, 2011 |work=Erie Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other sports==

===Basketball===
In [[basketball]], some coaches of vastly superior teams team will keep in their starters in the latter stages of a grossly one-sided game (e.g., less than ten minutes left in the second half of a college game; or well into the fourth quarter of a high school or [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game). Players may be told to continue to aggressively apply full-court pressure (in order to steal the ball), block shots, break away for slam dunks, or try three-point baskets and other fan-pleasing shots.

A team that is trailing by an undefined margin sometimes may prolong the game by fouling the opponent on every possession, in an effort to extend its chances of a comeback — although teams that utilize this strategy often do so only when the game is still somewhat competitive. However, this strategy does not always work, particularly if the fouled players or team is able to connect on free throws.

In cases where the score is lopsided much earlier in the game, the most common option is to just "play it out" as if it were a scrimmage, by trying to take the best shot possible and also attempt some sort of defense (without any taboos against fan-pleasing shots and plays). This is usually referred to as "[[garbage time]]", and while generally frowned upon for a lack of excitement it is considered to be the best way of ending a thoroughly uncompetitive game with minimal amounts of pride lost by the weaker side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://girlshoops.scout.com/2/491610.html |title=Elite 11: Running It Up |date=January 22, 2006 |work=Scout.com |author=Nelson, Glenn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232733/http://girlshoops.scout.com/2/491610.html |archivedate=2007-02-07 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running up the score was a key element in the [[Knicks–Nuggets brawl]] on December 16, 2006, as [[New York Knicks|New York]] coach [[Isiah Thomas]] accused [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]] coach [[George Karl]] of implementing it late in the game. Karl defended himself by citing many games where his team had lost large leads late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18047387/ |title=Angry Knicks accuse Bulls of running up score |date=April 11, 2007 |work=MSNBC (from Associated Press) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524002036/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18047387/ |archivedate=2007-05-24 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]] basketball coach [[Billy Tubbs]] was often accused of running up the score against inferior opponents. On November 29, 1989, [[1988–89 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team|Tubbs' team]] went so far as to score 97 points in the first half of a game against [[Alliant International University|U.S. International]]. Oklahoma won the game in a 173–101 rout. Asked repeatedly about running up the score against opponents, Tubbs once famously replied, "If they don't like it, they should get better."

Occasionally, teams will run up the score because of crowd encouragement. Crowd encouragement can occur whether or not there is a physical incentive involved. Often, a crowd will start chanting "X more points" near the end of a game, where X is the number of points needed to reach 100.  This usually occurs when the team is within 5 points of reaching the 100-point mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0WmW7K7ZA8 |title=Lutheran High Just Misses 100 pts In A Game |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, crowd encouragement can happen as the result of a promotion for ticket-holders.  In a [[Bradley Braves men's basketball|Bradley]] home game against [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]], coach Jim Les put in some reserve players during the last 1–2 minutes of the game after the score got to 62–50.  During the final possession, the crowd started to yell "Shoot shoot shoot" because the season ticket-holders would get a buy-one-get-one-free rib-eye steak dinner at a local restaurant if the score reached 63.  One of the Bradley players launched a buzzer-beating 3 because of the crowd encouragement and it went in, making the final score 65–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pjstar.com/sports_bu/x869016682/Bradley-snaps-Shockers-winning-streak |title=BU zone tenderizes Wichita |work=Journal Star |location=Peoria, Illinois |date=January 29, 2009 |author=Reynolds, Dave  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103001312/http://www.pjstar.com/x869016682/Bradley-snaps-Shockers-winning-streak |archivedate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.pjstar.com/index.php/wessler/article/live_wichita_state_at_bradley/ |title=Live: Wichita State at Bradley|date=January 28, 2009 |author=Wessler, Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427120342/http://blogs.pjstar.com/wessler/2009/01/28/live-wichita-state-at-bradley/ |archivedate=2014-04-27 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, during a 2014 game against Southern Virginia, [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|BYU basketball]] led 98-48 with the clock running down.  In response to chants of "Hundred! Hundred!" from the student section, Cougar reserve guard Jake Toolson launched a deep three-pointer as time expired.  It was good, making the final score 101-48.  Although the BYU fans and bench reacted with delight, Cougar head coach [[Dave Rose (basketball)|Dave Rose]] was upset by the incident.  Toolson himself was privately reprimanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://byucougars.com/m-basketball/byu-vs-southern-virginia-notes-quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===
In [[baseball]], an unwritten [[gentlemen's agreement]] between teams is said to discourage a team from [[sacrifice bunt]]ing, [[stolen base|stealing bases]], or other [[small ball (baseball)|small ball]] tactics when leading by a large margin late in a game, even though a losing team can theoretically come back from any deficit to win. Batters do not specifically try to make outs (e.g. by swinging at pitches with no intent to hit them) as this would insult the opposing team, violate the spirit of the game, and hurt their own batting average.

Amateur, high school, and international baseball games often have a [[mercy rule]] so that games end sooner when the lead is deemed to be insurmountable (e.g. by 10 runs after 5 innings). However, since the home team always gets one final at-bat if they are trailing, the visiting team can in theory score unlimited runs in the top half of the inning.

===Curling===
One of the unique rules of [[curling]] allows for the losing team to concede a match at any time, thereby preventing [[blowout (sports)|blowouts]] from occurring. In fact, it is sometimes considered unsportsmanlike for a team that is losing badly to not concede. For some major events, a game must play a certain amount of ends to be considered complete. As a protest, some teams that would have conceded earlier in the match may not take the game seriously at that point.

Before teams were allowed to concede matches well before the normal end of the game, blowouts were common.

===Ice hockey===
In [[ice hockey]], complaints are quite rare, for the simple reason that unless there is a gross disparity in skill, teams generally do not score large numbers of goals at will against the opposition. A [[mercy rule]] also may come into effect at pre-high-school levels, where such disparities might come into play as a matter of course. Another tactic could be the coach of the leading team telling his team that everybody must touch the puck before a shot is taken.

===Association football===
In professional [[soccer]], the concept of "running up the score" is mostly unheard of; many league competitions use [[goal difference]] or goal average as a tiebreaker, meaning there is considerable incentive to win by as wide a margin of victory as possible. This method resulted in the world record for the number of goals scored in a single game, in [[Australia 31–0 American Samoa|the 2001 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] between [[Socceroos|Australia]] and [[American Samoa national football team|American Samoa]], in which the Australian team scored a record 31 goals.

In 2002, a club team from Madagascar called [[SO l'Emyrne]] ran up the score on themselves while protesting what they believed to be unfair officiating during an end of season round-robin series.  They kicked the ball into their [[own goal]] [[AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne|149 times in a row during a game against local rival AS Adema]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/soccer/news/2002/1102/1454712.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
There is no negative stigma associated with running up the score in [[Australian rules football]]. The only tiebreaker used in most leagues is the [[goal average|ratio of points for versus points against]], so this system encourages teams to record large scores and winning margins, and this occurs frequently when there is a disparity between ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Herald Sun|publication-place=Melbourne|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/alastair-clarkson-plots-attacking-plan-to-give-hawthorn-best-chance-of-playing-home-finals/story-fni5f8ge-1227462190838|title=Alastair Clarkson plots attacking plan to give Hawthorn best chance of playing home finals|author=Jon Ralph|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs in all levels of play, particularly in metropolitan and country leagues, where weaker teams can often be beaten by as much as 200 points. Significantly, the sport lacks any obvious means to kill off a match quickly and painlessly, and time-wasting is both unpopular with fans and discouraged by the [[Laws of Australian rules football|laws of the game]].

===High schools===
Vast talent discrepancies between opponents happen more often in [[high school]] sports than in college or professional sports. This is especially prevalent in district competition (where schools of similar size are grouped based on geography) and regional [[single-elimination tournament]]s in which all schools (regardless of record) participate. It is even more prevalent in Kentucky high school basketball, in which [[Sweet Sixteen (KHSAA State Basketball Championship)|a single state championship for each sex]] is conducted; this in turn means that district and regional competitions, and even the state tournaments, will feature games involving schools that differ vastly in enrollment. Often, a state's athletic association will [[Seed (tennis)|seed]] a vastly superior team (one that has gone undefeated or has very few losses) against a very weak team in the first round (so as to avoid early-round matchups against high-seeded teams, hoping to leave those matchups for later rounds), and the talent disparity between the two teams quickly becomes obvious. (Kentucky has never seeded its state tournaments, using a blind draw to fill its brackets.)

One notorious example of many such incidents that happen each year throughout the United States was the state-ranked [[Walkerville, Michigan]] High School's (enrollment 98) 115–2 victory against [[Hart, Michigan]] Lakeshore Academy (enrollment 49) in a Class D district opener during the 2004 [[Michigan]] High School Girls' Basketball state tournament.

In light of similar incidents, coaches are often accused of running up the score and taking the opportunity to humiliate and embarrass a weak opponent. At times, large margins of victory occur in games where the winning school's reserves (second-string and [[junior varsity]] players) played a good share of the contest and simply were able to score at will against the weaker opposition. However, when the star players are left in to set scoring records, as happened with Epiphanny Prince's 113-point basketball game in 2006, criticism usually follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojnarowski_adrian&amp;id=2316846 |title=Allowing a player to score 113 points is absurd |work=ESPN.com |author=Wojnarowski, Adrian |date=February 2, 2006  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114202209/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojnarowski_adrian&amp;id=2316846 |archivedate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, the [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference]] has considered any victory margin of 50 points or more in a football game to be unsportsmanlike. If this occurs, the winning team's coach will be [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] for the team's next game. This was in response to one coach, Jack Cochran of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], whose teams won that way four times during 2005. During the 2005 season, Jack Cochran's New London High School football team, the highest scoring offense in CT, was shut out 16–0 by the Windham High School Whippets. In response to being shut out for the first time in his career, the following week Cochran had his team run up the score 90–0 against a much weaker opponent. The victory provoked a brawl and led to [[disorderly conduct]] charges against the losing coach. Coach Cochran defended himself by saying that in one 90–0 blowout, he had tried to get both teams and the timekeeper to run the clock continuously, as is done in [[Iowa]] when one team has a 35-point lead. The CIAC considered a similar proposal but rejected as several members felt it would cut into backups' playing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/news/story?id=2457707 |title=Coaches face suspension for wins of 50-plus points |date=May 25, 2006 |work=ESPN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518151607/http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/news/story?id=2457707 |archivedate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2007 [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] playoff game, [[Smith Center High School]] set a [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] record by scoring 72 points in the first quarter vs. Plainville. Coincidentally, the same two teams played each other only 25 days prior to the playoff contest, with Smith Center winning 72–0. During the regular season game, a continuous clock was triggered when the score differential reached 40 points, but there was no such provision in the rules at the time for its use in the playoffs. Smith Center administrators called the KSHSAA office and received permission to use the running clock starting with the second quarter of the second game with Plainville. (To avoid a recurrence, in 2011 the KSHSAA adopted a modified mercy rule for the playoffs, stating any 11-man postseason contest prior to the championship game would use a running clock in the second half once the margin reached 45 points.)

In October 2008, [[Naples High School]] defeated [[Estero High School]], [[Florida]] 91–0. Naples was the defending [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] Class 3A champion. Despite accusations that Naples ran up the score, Coach Bill Kramer kept most of his star players out of the game for most, if not all of the game. Some Naples parents consequently called the coach to complain that their sons did not play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/highschool/rise/football/news/story?id=3641717 |title=Fallout over 91-0 final score affects two Florida high school teams |date=October 14, 2008 |work=ESPN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025121500/http://espn.go.com/high-school/football/story/_/id/3641717/fallout-91-0-final-score-affects-two-florida-high-school-teams/ |archivedate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The comic strip ''[[Funky Winkerbean]]'' had a week-long storyline in September 2015 where Westview High School football's coach, Bull Bushka, is brought before the school board after a parent from an opposing high school filed a complaint that Bushka had intentionally run up the score; Westview, which often is comically portrayed as being on the losing end of one-sided games, had defeated rival Optimism High 93–0. Bushka, however, is quickly vindicated when he mentions that he had pulled his starters, there was a continuous clock in the entire second half and he had not run a passing play.

{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}
'''Seam bowling''' is a [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] technique in [[cricket]] whereby the ball is deliberately bowled on to its seam, to cause a random deviation. Practitioners are known as ''seam [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]]s'' or '''seamers'''.

Seam bowling is generally classed as a subtype of [[fast bowling]], although the bowling speeds at which seam can be a factor include medium-pace bowling. Although there are specialist seamers that make deliberate use of [[off cutter]] and [[leg cutter]] at the expense of bowling slower than regular fast bowlers, most bowlers employ the seam to some effect and so the terms "seamer" and "fast bowler" are largely synonymous.

==Physics==
A [[cricket ball]] is not a perfect [[sphere]]. The seam of the ball is the circular stitching which joins the two halves of the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the stitching is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled in such a way that the seam hits the [[cricket pitch|pitch]] when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batsman has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select his shot.

In order to achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually delivers the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Swing and seam – the basic grip|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/skills/4174422.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2005-09-06|access-date = 2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the [[batsman]], making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Consistently hitting the seam is not as easy as it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger at the time of the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's [[Glenn McGrath]] are arguably a perfect example.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The direction and degree of deviation from a straight path are dependent on the small-scale alignment of the seam and any irregularities in the pitch surface. This means that deviation caused by seam is [[chaos theory|chaotic]] and unpredictable.

However, it is also possible, by holding the seam at an angle and rolling the fingers over the surface of the ball, to produce a deliberate [[off cutter]] in which the ball veers away from the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]] when it bounces on the pitch, or [[leg cutter]] in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler [[Dennis Lillee]] employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement one way or the other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch.

Often the deviation caused by seam is not large enough to cause a batsman significant problems with playing the ball. Occasionally, however, the ball can deviate far enough to hit the edge of the [[cricket bat]] instead of the middle, producing a catch for nearby [[fielding positions in cricket|fielders]]. [[Swing bowling]] is a way of getting greater deviation, but is harder to control.

Australian fast-medium bowler [[Glenn McGrath]] has used his seaming ability to great effect in his career.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The ball 'seams' at its best at the start of a team's [[innings]], when the ball is new. A pitch which has cracks in it may assist a seam bowler as well.
The genuine 'Yorker' may be used by seam bowlers, but bounces ('pitches') so close to the batsman's feet that it has no opportunity to deviate from its original line.

Another good example of seam bowling technique are the fast bowlers [[Courtney Walsh]] and [[Curtly Ambrose]].  Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100th Test Match at Lords, England Vs West Indies in 2000, A thriller|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpf1RVZhKoU|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Walsh and Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand.  However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit [[precession]] (similar to a [[gyroscope]]), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock position (if viewed from the bottom of the seam).  This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing and inswing seam positions through the air).  Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate).  However, when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball contacts the pitch at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman).  It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching.  This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.

'''State Farm Center''', stylized as '''StateFarm Center''', is a large [[dome]]-shaped [[indoor arena]] located in [[Champaign, Illinois]], owned and operated by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The arena hosts games for the [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini women's basketball|women's basketball]] teams. It also doubles as a performance and event center, and is one of the largest venues between [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. It opened in 1963 and was known until 2013 as '''Assembly Hall''' until [[State Farm Insurance]] acquired [[naming rights]] as part of a major renovation project.

==Opening==
{{see also|Construction of Assembly Hall (Champaign)}}
State Farm Center opened as Assembly Hall on March 2, 1963, and continues to attract attention for its design and construction. From 1963 to 1965 Assembly Hall was the largest dome structure in North America until the opening of the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. The roof is supported by {{convert|614|mi|km}} of one-quarter inch steel wire wrapped at the base of the dome under intensive pressure. The architect was [[Max Abramovitz]], a University of Illinois alumnus.

==Fighting Illini Basketball==
State Farm Center hosts home games of [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini women's basketball]] and has earned a reputation as one of the toughest places to play in college basketball, thanks to the [[student cheering section]], the "[[Orange Krush]]," which occupies the floor around the court as well as some seats.

At the annual "Paint the Hall Orange" game, everyone in attendance would wear an orange shirt, resulting in an impressive and intimidating environment. In recent years, however, it has become customary for Illini fans to wear orange at all home games and so the official "PTHO" game was discontinued after the 2007-08 season.

In August 2015, prior to the reopening of the newly renovated State Farm Center, the hardwood floor was dedicated and named '''Lou Henson Court''' in honor of the [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball]] all-time leader in victories [[Lou Henson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-lou-henson-court-20150824-story.html| title=Illinois names basketball court for former coach Lou Henson| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=2015-08-24| accessdate=2015-08-25| last=Ryan| first=Shannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size==
The third largest [[Illinois]] arena after the [[United Center]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Allstate Arena]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]], State Farm Center has 15,500 permanent seats, with an official capacity of 16,618 for basketball games, but when portable chairs are placed on the floor for an in-the-round performance there is a potential for an additional 1,000 depending on the stage configuration.

==IHSA==

[[Image:Assembly Hall.jpg|thumb|Exterior in 2003]]

State Farm Center has hosted a variety of [[Illinois High School Association]] events. It has been the home of the state individual wrestling tournament since 1967. From 1963 to 1995, State Farm Center played host to the state finals of the boys' basketball tournament. From 1978 to 1995, it also hosted the IHSA girls' basketball tournament.

State Farm Center is also the venue for the annual WCIA 3 Broadway Series, which features popular musicals such as ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=WCIA 3 Broadway Series not the same old song and dance| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/arts-entertainment/local/2017-03-02/wcia-3-broadway-series-not-same-old-song-and-dance.html| last=Wood| first=Paul| date=March 2, 2017| newspaper=The News-Gazette| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Illinois Renaissance" renovation==
In the autumn of 2008, school officials, led by Athletics Director [[Ron Guenther]], conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the then-named Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Guenther Assesses Assembly Hall's Fate| first=Terry| last=Bannon| url=http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/illinois/cs-080821-illinois-ron-guenther-athletic-director,1,6759120.story| newspaper=Chicago Tribune| date=August 21, 2008| accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the university opted to renovate the existing structure and selected the architectural firm [[AECOM]] to design the renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Board Approves Assembly Hall Architect, Natural History Building Funds and Easter as Interim Vice Chancellor| first=Darshan| last=Patel| url=http://www.dailyillini.com/article_7f45bfa4-a86e-5886-aed8-e126b9284aa5.html| newspaper=[[Daily Illini]]| location=Champaign| date=December 2, 2011| accessdate=December 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725230435/http://www.dailyillini.com/article_7f45bfa4-a86e-5886-aed8-e126b9284aa5.html| archivedate=July 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athletic department sent surveys to I-Fund and season ticket holders to gauge demand for various premium seating options. Architects used this information to create schematic drawings and architectural renderings near the end of 2012, which then Athletics Director [[Mike Thomas (athletic director)|Mike Thomas]] used to aid in fundraising for the project.  The anticipated renovation cost was between $150 and $160 million, and construction would not start before spring of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=U of I Gauges Demand for Premium Seats in Assembly Hall| first=John| last=Supine| url=http://www.sj-r.com/sports/x1167779048/Illini-Hoops-School-gauges-demand-for-premium-seats-in-Hall| newspaper=[[The State Journal-Register]]| location=Springfield| date=August 14, 2012| accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the renovations, [[State Farm Insurance]] purchased the naming rights to the arena for $60 million over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Illini's Assembly Hall Renamed| agency=[[Associated Press]]| url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9225290/illinois-fighting-illini-assembly-hall-renamed-state-farm-center| website=[[ESPN]]| date=April 29, 2013| accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Farm Center began renovations after the 2013–14 men's basketball season. Work included adding luxury suites, club/loge seating, new blue seats  included in the renovation. In the luxury suites and club level seats, there will be concessions where alcoholic beverages will allowed to be served as well as a buffet area. The total budget for the renovation was estimated at $169.5 million.&lt;ref name="statefarmcenter"/&gt;

The construction process did cause some conflicts with scheduled sporting events at the beginning of the 2015-16 basketball season. The men's basketball team played the first five games of the 2015 at the [[Bank of Springfield Center|Prairie Capital Convention Center]] in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], while the 2015 Women's basketball team played their first five games at [[Parkland College]].  The renovated arena hosted its first game on December 2, when the Fighting Illini fell to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] 84–79.&lt;ref name="statefarmcenter"&gt;{{cite web| title=Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://statefarmcenter.com/faq.html| website=Illinois Division of Intercollegiate Athletics| access-date=2018-08-28| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219220915/http://statefarmcenter.com/faq.html| archivedate=2016-02-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=PCCC to host Illini Basketball for 5 games in November 2015| date=October 30, 2014| url=http://www.springfieldpc3.com/news/tabid/125/pccc-to-host-illini-basketball-nov-2015.aspx?TabId=125&amp;PostId=9| publisher=Prairie Capital Convention Center| access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Virgil Sweet (Olmos) is a veteran baseball scout for the [[California Angels]]. He is in danger of losing his life's work because the Angels' new owner, Gil Lawrence (Kinney), is unhappy with the [[Farm team|farm system]] and threatening to eliminate the team's scouts.

Virgil hasn't discovered a great young prospect for quite a while. One day, when the car that he and girlfriend Bobbie (Bracco), who also is employed by the team, are driving breaks down on a rural road, Virgil happens upon a country boy named Sammy Bodeen (Corbett) who has a pitching arm worthy of the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]].

Greeted back in [[Anaheim]] with considerable skepticism, Virgil arranges a tryout for Sammy. The boy is wild at first and Virgil's great find appears to be a big joke. Once he calms down, however, Sammy proves to have everything it takes to make it big.

Team management, desperate for a new star, immediately begins to overplay the arrival of Sammy with wildly overblown hype. A public-relations blitz promotes the boy as baseball's next great star, even though he has yet to throw a pitch in a big-league game. By the time Sammy takes the mound for his first Angels game, expectations are so high that he cannot possibly live up to them.

He is roughed up by opponents in the first inning, humiliating the owner and making fans furious. But, gradually, with a surprise assist from Virgil on the field, Sammy settles down and begins to look like a star in the making.

The '''Townsville Stadium''' (previously Townsville RSL Stadium) is a multi-purpose indoor venue located at the Murray Sports Complex in [[Annandale, Queensland]]. The facility features an international standard wooden sports floor, multi-purpose function rooms, a public gym, stadium administration and the Townsville City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/facilities-and-recreation/sport-and-leisure-facilities/townsville-stadium|title=Townsville Stadium|publisher=City of Townsville|accessdate=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stadium, which opened in 2011, is owned and operated by the [[City of Townsville]], has a total spectator capacity of 2,500 (1,700 seated) and is the home court of the [[Townsville Fire]] ([[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]]). From the [[2014–15 NBL season]], the [[Townsville Crocodiles]] moved out of their long time home, the [[Townsville Entertainment and Convention Centre|Townsville Entertainment Centre]], and into the RSL Stadium.

The largest attendance at the venue was recorded on 27 July 2011 for an women's international basketball game when the [[Australian Opals]] played [[China women's national basketball team|China]] in front of 2,200 fans.

The Stadium can also host other sports such as [[netball]], [[volleyball]] and [[badminton]], and can also be used for indoor events such as expos, conventions, conferences or dinners.

An '''ultralight trike''' is a type of powered [[hang glider]] where flight control is by [[weight-shift control|weight-shift]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/FAA-H-8083-5.pdf Weight-Shift Control Aircraft Flying Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[light-sport aircraft|aircraft]] have a fabric [[Rogallo wing|flex-wing]] from which is suspended a [[tricycle]] fuselage pod driven by a pusher [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]]. The pod accommodates either a solo pilot, or a pilot and a single passenger. Trikes grant affordable, accessible and exciting flying, and have been popular since the 1980s.

Trikes&lt;ref&gt;While many aircraft have tricycle landing gear, the term "trike" refers specifically to the form of aircraft described here.&lt;/ref&gt; are referred to as "[[microlight]]s" in Europe. Such aircraft are also known as '''2-axis microlights''', '''flex-wing trikes''', '''weight-shift-control aircraft''',&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|14|61|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''microlight trikes''', '''deltatrikes'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltatrike.es/ Deltacat ULM AVIATION: deltatrike]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''motorized [[deltaplane]]s''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to-motorized-deltaplane/ Motorized [[Delta plane]] term]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of hang gliding}}
The history of the trike is traced back to the invention of [[Francis Rogallo]]'s flexible wing and subsequent development by the [[Paresev]] engineering team's innovations and then others. On 1948, engineer [[Francis Rogallo]] invented a self-inflating wing which he patented on March 20, 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Article: How ''to Fly Without a Plane'' by Robert Zimmerman, aerospace writer. {{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_22.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301062811/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_22.shtml |archivedate=March 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Rogallo wing|Flexible wing]]. It was on October 4, 1957, when the Russian satellite [[Sputnik]] shocked the United States and the space race caught the imagination of its government, causing major increases in U.S. government spending on scientific research, education and on the immediate creation of [[NASA]]. Rogallo was in position to seize the opportunity and released his patent to the government and with his help at the wind tunnels, NASA began a series of experiments testing Rogallo's wing – which was renamed '''Para Wing''' – in order to evaluate it as a recovery system for the Gemini [[space capsule]]s and recovery of used Saturn [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|rocket stage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4308/ch11.htm#382 SPACEFLIGHT REVOLUTION]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On 1965 [[Jack Swigert]], who would later be one of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, softly landed a full-scale Gemini capsule using a Para Wing stiffened with inflatable tubes along the wing's edges&lt;/ref&gt; F. Rogallo's team adapted and extended the totally flexible principle into semi-rigid variants. This mainly involved stabilizing the leading edges with compressed air beams or rigid structures like aluminum tubes. By 1960, NASA had already made test flights of a powered heavily framed cargo aircraft called the [[Ryan XV-8]] or ''Fleep'' (short for 'Flying Jeep')&lt;ref&gt;The earliest photographic press release of a Rogallo flexible wing in record dates to August 14, 1961, by ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; and by March 1962, of a weight-shift experimental glider called [[Paresev]]. By 1967, all Para Wing projects were dropped by NASA in favor of using round parachutes without officially considering development of personal ultralight gliders, but the airfoil's simplicity of design and ease of construction, along with its capability of slow flight and its gentle landing characteristics, did not go unnoticed by hang glider enthusiasts. The challenge then, was to modify and fit a Rogallo flexible wing with an appropriate frame to allow it to be used as a [[hang glider]].

===Some modern Rogallo flexible-winged aircraft===
A crucial development toward the trike was introduction of several mechanical innovations developed by the [[Paresev]] and the Fleep engineers&lt;!-- Barry Palmer has specified in an interview with Gerard Farell that he was unaware of the Paresev and that his HG was inspired on the Fleep, when published by the Aviation Weekly magazine. --&gt;; they proved the Rogallo wing suitable for free-flight gliding, powered and unpowered, and for safe landing.

Publicity from the [[Ryan XV-8|Fleep]]&lt;ref&gt;Press release of the XV-8 'Fleep': August 14, 1961, by ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Paresev]] tests sparked interest in the design among several tinkerers, including [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]], and Sport Aviation of 1962 shown Jim Hobson of Experimental Aircraft Association (wing shown on US national TV in Lawrence Welk Show in 1962). An Australian engineer Mike Burns developed and used the boat-towed Rogallo-airfoiled SkiPlane starting in 1962 through the 1960s. A fellow countryman of Mike Burns, [[John W. Dickenson]], made ski-kites and eventually partnered with Mike Burns to improve the ski-kite; he formatted a ski-kite that used what could be found in the 1929 George A. Spratt simple triangle control bar or A-frame with single-point pendulum weight-shift control.

Although by the early 1970s many rigid wings were developed, none sold well, while dozens of flexible-wing hang glider companies were springing up worldwide, building variants of Dickenson's Ski Wing. In 1972, [[Popular Mechanics]] and [[Popular Science]] magazines published articles on hang gliding which further increased its popularity,&lt;ref&gt;Hang gliding articles on ''Popular Mechanics'' and ''Popular Science'' magazines: {{cite web |url=http://support.atmos.com/hg/early/early.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911061815/http://support.atmos.com/hg/early/early.htm |archivedate=September 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ''Sky Raiders'' hang gliding movie released in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;The Swallowtail hang glider was featured in the 1976 movie ''Sky Riders'' (filmed in Greece during 1975) starring James Coburn, Robert Culp, Susannah York, and Charles Aznavour. After filming of the action was complete, the Wills Wing team toured Europe and stopped by in England to win the British Championships at Mere, Wiltshire, in August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Rogallo]], [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]], John Dickenson, and others never made any money out of their innovations.&lt;ref name="flexwing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bchpa.org/newsletter/may04/hghistory.htm Article by Mark Woodhams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509154730/http://www.bchpa.org/newsletter/may04/hghistory.htm |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Profit to manufacturers of hang gliders and Rogallo-winged hang gliders came once organized and insured sporting events grew in popularity. Dickenson's adaptation and innovations eventually produced a foldable hang glider that dramatically reduced difficulty in control, storage, transport, assembly and repair. In addition, the flexible wing lends itself to design changes for possible improvements.

The crucial developments put together by the [[Paresev]] engineers, Barry Palmer, John Dickenson, Bill Bennett, Bill Moyes, Richard Miller, and then hundreds of other innovators gave success to the flexible-wing hang glider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovated.gov.au/Innovated%5Ccase_studies%5CHang_Glider.pdf "Order of Australia" award for contributions to aviation given in 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831065553/http://www.innovated.gov.au/Innovated%5Ccase_studies%5CHang_Glider.pdf |date=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First trikes===
[[File:XV-8A Fleep Prototype - GPN-2000-001271.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ryan XV-8]] 'Fleep' flown in the Full Scale Tunnel at Langley, 1962]]
[[File:PierreAubert.jpg|thumb|left|'''Pierre Aubert''', Switzerland, 1964]]

In 1961, Engineer '''Thomas Purcell''' built a towable Rogallo-wing glider with an aluminum frame, wheels, a seat and basic control rods; soon he replaced the wheels for floats and motorized the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Hang-Glider.html Thomas Pourcell]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Swiss inventor '''Pierre Aubert''' saw a photo of NASA's [[Ryan XV-8|Fleep]] and completed construction of a similar trike. As with the Fleep, his [[Rogallo wing]] was fixed and did not allow for pendulum weight-shift control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trike-expeditions.com/CapeToCape/Olivier_Aubert/OliviersAncestor/oliviersancestor.html Pierre Aubert]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1967, aeronautical engineer [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]] completed the earliest example of a true weight-shift powered trike: the '''Paraplane''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/hiitec/kite/trike.html Palmer's trike]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrI4qnhL3mE Original video on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; it was controlled by a single vertical control bar as the [[Paresev]] experimental glider that inspired him. The Paraplane used two ''West Bend-Chrysler'' 820 engines of 8&amp;nbsp;hp at 6000 RPM, reduced to 4700&amp;nbsp;RPM for about 6.5&amp;nbsp;hp each, for a total of 13&amp;nbsp;hp. Each engine had a direct drive to a 27-inch-diameter two-blade propeller made of polyester and fiberglass. On March 24, 1967, Palmer registered the trike with the [[FAA]] as the ''Palmer Parawing D-6'', serial number 1A, registration number N7144; no restrictions were noted.

The second Palmer trike, '''Skyhook''' (FAA registration N4411), in spite of its early date of origin, had most of the attributes of a modern ultralight, except it used a single-cylinder [[snowmobile]] engine, as the two-stroke twin-cylinder engines were not available yet. It was powered by a 17&amp;nbsp;hp at 5000 RPM single-cylinder JLO L297 two-stroke engine, driving a composite propeller designed and built by Palmer himself and driven by a 2.1/1 reduction gearbox. The engine had electric start and the craft had fiberglass composite spring landing gear. Airframe construction was bolted 6061-T6 aluminum thin-wall tube, with 6061 T-6 extruded angle. The craft took off, flew, and landed at around 30&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/hiitec/kite/trike.html Palmer's web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial availability of Dickenson's hang glider made the [[Rogallo wing]] very popular, and prompted several builders during the 1970s to attempt motorization of their flexible-wing aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/pulma1/Un%20peu%20d'histoire.htm Some early powered hang gliders]&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]] – who placed the center of gravity well below the keel – most builders were mounting the engine to the wing, where a fine balance existed between applying too much power, causing the aircraft to overtake the pilot, or not enough power for flight. It was not until Roland Magallon took a long look at the ''Motodelta'' ultralight&lt;ref&gt;[http://golfo1.free.fr/historique_pendulaire.htm Motodelta – images]&lt;/ref&gt; (a hybrid Rogallo wing designed by Jean-Marc Geiser had a 'fuselage' and a rudder) that Magallon decided to replace the Motodelta's 'fuselage' with a simple tubular framework pendulum and dispensing with the [[rudder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=6 Rolland Magallon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807184715/http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=6 |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magallon is thus generally thought to have invented the trike because it was he who first marketed it. He called the first version 'Mosquito' and marketed it from October 1979 through 1981. The prototype had flown with a [[McCulloch MC-101A]] motor of 125 cc, delivering 10&amp;nbsp;hp at 8000 RPM to a direct-drive prop with ground-adjustable pitch. Later he offered it with a [[Solo 210]] engine which produced {{convert|15|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at much smaller RPM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=6 Roland Magallon's trike] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807184715/http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=6 |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "trike", as it soon became known, quickly became popular in the [[UK]] and [[France]], where it had been reborn. Trike technology still shows its hang gliding origins, though the wings are no longer converted hang gliders, but are designed for power. In fact, none of the commercially available trike wings can be used as foot-launched hang gliders as they are too heavy and too fast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerialpursuits.com/trikes/primer.htm ''Aerial Pursuits'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturers ==
Many trike manufacturers produce only the undercarriage and procure their wings elsewhere. The majority of these companies are found in [[Europe]], with a number appearing in the [[United States]]. Manufacturers can also be found in [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and elsewhere. At their most basic, manufacturers often sell single-place ultralight trikes at a price of around $10,000–$17,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultralight-airplanes.info/How-To-Fly-Easier-With-Flex-Wing-Ultralight-Aircraft-%28Ultralight-Trikes%29.html UL trikes general pricing]&lt;/ref&gt; Prices often depend on whether the wing is included. Two-person, high-performance trikes may cost from $15,000–$30,000 and up. For instance, the two-seater [[Air Creation Tanarg]] can cost up to $85,000 when loaded with every available performance option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elitechoice.org/2009/02/22/tanarg-will-let-you-touch-the-skies/ Tanarg Pricing]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records ==
[[Brian Milton]] flew from London to Sydney in 1987 in the Dalgety flyer which at the time was the longest recorded microlight flight taking 59 days. The Dalgety Flyer is now on display at [[Sydney Airport]]. In 1998, he made the first circumnavigation of the world by ultralight, completing the flight in 80 flying days (over a period of 120 days) in the Global Flyer, a [[Pegasus Quantum]], including crossing the Alps and being buzzed by a Syrian MiG, setting a [[Guinness World Record]] for the first and fastest ultralight circumnavigation of the world and resulting in the award of both the [[Britannia Trophy]] and the [[Segrave Trophy]].

On January 19, 2008, Mark Jackson from [[Altrincham]], [[UK]], flew over [[Kilimanjaro]]. In doing so, he broke the record for the highest altitude attained in a microlight, {{convert|24262|ft|m}}, and the fastest climb to {{convert|20000|ft|m}} (25 minutes). He also broke the British record for the fastest climb to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} (19 minutes). He did the flight with Eve Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://menmedia.co.uk/news/s/1051786_a_microlight_fantastic MEN news]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''võ phục''' ([[chu Han|Sino-Vietnamese]]: 武服) is a Vietnamese term that refers to a martial arts uniform (which may include a ranking belt), mainly associated with [[Vietnamese martial arts]] (Việt Võ Đạo, 越武道), particularly [[Vovinam]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lawler Martial Arts For Dummies 2011 "vo phuc (Vietnamese): Traditional uniform."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The term ''võ phục'' may be used alone in the context of Vietnamese [[martial arts]] (Việt Võ Đạo, 越武道) or '''often''' to refer to the martial arts suit worn by practitioners of Vovinam. The [[Vietnamese alphabet]] pronunciation (and writing) of the word ''võ phục'' differs from another common Vietnamese term ''vô phúc'' (無福) "bad luck."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor -Social Inequality in Vietnam and the Challenges to Reform - 2004 Page 316 "I was at home, my mother sighed all the time. She told me: "It is not important to me whether you get married or not but I cannot stand it when the neighbours say that we are unfortunate (vo phuc). "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Confucianism and the Family: A Study of Indo-Tibetan Walter H. Slote, George A. De Vos - 1998  Page 322 "Based on the manner in which one lives one's life, it can be a force for evil (vo phuc) as well as good."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage with Other Martial Art Forms===
Võ phục may be used before the accepted name of another martial art in order to refer to the uniform of that particular martial art. For example, ''võ phục Judo'' refers to the martial arts uniform used in Judo, known in Japanese as a Jūdōgi'' ([[:wikt:柔道着]]). The term functions in the same way as "martial arts uniform of," in English: ''võ phục'' (martial arts uniform of) Judo.''

===History===
From 1938 to 1964, there was no official coloration associated with ''võ phục''. However, after a meeting between Vietnamese martial arts masters in 1964, indigo/deep blue was chosen to be the official color of Vietnamese martial arts uniforms.

The official color was not necessarily adopted by all practitioners, as evidenced throughout 1973-1990 when many practitioners under a separate development of Vovinam, the "Viet Vo Dao Federation," wore black uniforms. By 1990, however, after further meetings between councils, indigo had been adopted by the majority of Vovinam practitioners in and outside of [[Vietnam]]. Deep blue/indigo (Vietnamese: Lam) is now the internationally accepted color of Vo Phuc for Vietnamese martial arts.

==Construction==
The ''võ phục'' of Vovinam are very similar, if not nearly identical, to the ''[[keikogi]]'' of Japanese martial arts. Both top and bottom of the uniform are constructed in much the same way as ''keikogi'', and the two are likely interchangeable if not for obvious differences in coloration.

The thickness of ''võ phục'' varies by school, preference, or size of a practitioner.

==Wearing==
As with the Japanese ''[[keikogi]]'', the ''võ phục'' top should be worn with the left front panel tied over the right. Pants are worn the same way as Japanese ''keikogi'' pants, and are adjusted according to the preference of the practitioner by loosening or tightening the appropriate fitting cords provided.

==Belt==
The ''võ phục'' is often worn with the corresponding ranking belt (Vietnamese [[:wikt:đai]], [[:wikt:帶]]) of the practitioner around the waist. Belts worn with ''võ phục'' for Vovinam are similar to those of Japanese martial arts in that they are constructed using the same techniques and materials.

[[Cricket]] in Zimbabwe suffered a crisis that lasted from 2003 to 2011 where player withdrawals such as the "Black-armband protest" by [[Andy Flower]] and [[Henry Olonga]] along with a mass loss of players in 2004 due to a general strike resulted in very poor performances by the national team. Presently Zimbabwe is in the period of rebuilding itself as the domestic structure was re-structured in 2009. Many people allege that the administration of cricket in Zimbabwe was corrupted by the influence of [[Robert Mugabe]]'s government, who were widely accused of following racist, in particular anti-white, policies. Positive signs began to emerge for Zimbabwe after the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] especially when in the [[2007 World Twenty20]] Zimbabwe defeated what was arguably the strongest side in the world at the time, Australia. Along with this Zimbabwe gradually began to show encouraging signs of improvement and four years later they returned to the highest format of the game, [[Test Cricket]]. In their first match since their return in August 2011 they comprehensively defeated [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]].

==Crisis emerges==
During the 2000–01 season, players began to allege political interference in the running of the game in Zimbabwe.  There had already been a reduction in government funding for the sport's development.  The players alleged that selection of the national team was subject to interference and particularly resented the imposition of a quota system to ensure a minimum number of black players would be included.  The players argued that the black players were gradually emerging, as in South Africa, and that they would increase in due course.  For example, [[Hamilton Masakadza]] had already made his mark as a batsman, and [[Mluleki Nkala]] and [[Henry Olonga]] were making their mark as bowlers. 

The matter came to prominence before the [[2003 cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]], when both the British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] and the Australian prime minister [[John Howard]] said they would prefer it if their teams did not travel to Zimbabwe, but did not ban them from doing so. In the event, only England refused to travel to [[Harare]] to play Zimbabwe as they considered it morally wrong to do so, thereby forfeiting the match. In Zimbabwe's first match, two players, one white, one black ([[Andy Flower]] and [[Henry Olonga]]) wore black armbands in protest against "the death of democracy in Zimbabwe". Both players subsequently retired and emigrated from Zimbabwe, under intense political pressure, with the black Olonga being denounced as not really Zimbabwean as he was born in [[Zambia]].

==Team hits rock bottom==
In 2004, the [[Zimbabwe Cricket Union]] sacked their white captain [[Heath Streak]] after he had confronted them with the team's grievances, several other players having also resigned by this time.  Streak was replaced by the young and untested [[Tatenda Taibu]]. Fifteen senior players were involved in a stand-off over this and other selection issues, resulting in their dismissal from Zimbabwean cricket. Following poor performances by a second-string (and almost all black) [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe team]] against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]], the ZCU and ICC agreed that Zimbabwe would play no [[Test cricket]] in 2004, and this self-imposed suspension remained in force from 10 June 2004 to 6 January 2005. 

In their first match after the suspension, Zimbabwe lost to [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]] at the [[MA Aziz Stadium]] in [[Chittagong]] by 226 runs.  The second and final match in the series was drawn.  Bangladesh had until then been generally considered the weakest team in Test cricket, and by beating Zimbabwe, recorded its first ever Test match and series victories.  Bangladesh then defeated Zimbabwe in a limited overs series.

In February and March 2005, Zimbabwe toured [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] to play three LOIs and two Tests.  Zimbabwe was completely and hopelessly outclassed, and Wisden 2006 described the tour as "''gruesome''" and "''embarrassing to all who saw it''".

Meanwhile, in domestic cricket, the [[Logan Cup]] had been played, with just four participants, and had been won as usual by [[Mashonaland cricket team|Mashonaland]].  But it is debatable if the competition should have retained first-class status and there were grave doubts about its future: see [[2004-05 Zimbabwean cricket season]].

In August 2005, the [[New Zealand cricket team]] arrived in Zimbabwe to play two Test matches and duly won both by an innings with embarrassing ease.  The tour was inevitably preceded by controversy because of strong feeling in New Zealand about Mugabe.  As with the previous England and Australia situations, the New Zealand government advised the team not to go but did not actually bar them from doing so.  Since the ICC would not accept any other reason for non-attendance, the New Zealand players turned up and won easily.  However, the NZ government did have some fight in them because they effectively banned a return tour by refusing to issue visas to the Zimbabwean party.

During the New Zealand series, [[Zimbabwe Cricket]] fired national coach [[Phil Simmons]].  The players signed a petition to denounce the decision and Simmons took ZC to court while they tried to have him deported.

In September 2005, the visitors were [[Indian cricket team|India]]; like New Zealand, India was not barred from going to Zimbabwe and decided to go to avert ICC sanctions.  In India's case, controversy erupted within its own team on account of arguments between team captain [[Sourav Ganguly]] and the new coach [[Greg Chappell]].  This row diverted the sport's attention from Zimbabwe and shifted the focus onto India.  Despite its problems, the Indian team won both matches easily against sub-standard opposition.

There had been a brief reconciliation with some of the rebel players, Heath Streak and [[Andy Blignaut]] having played in some of the 2005 Tests, but then the Simmons affair sparked a wider mutiny under Taibu's leadership.  In October 2005, Streak announced his retirement from international cricket and indicated that he would concentrate on a county career with [[Warwickshire CCC]] in England.  In November 2005, Taibu resigned as captain.  He stated that: "If we don't do anything, cricket in Zimbabwe will die within a year".  Taibu is now playing as an overseas player for [[Namibian cricket team|Namibia]] in South African provincial competition. He, however, was surprisingly a member of the 07/08 squad for the series against Pakistan in Pakistan. Taibu was then a key cog in the national team.

==Hopes fade in 2006==
As 2006 began, Mugabe's government replaced the board of [[Zimbabwe Cricket]] with an interim committee and this announced a further twelve month withdrawal from Test cricket.  Meanwhile, the 2005–06 Logan Cup did not get under way and all the matches were indefinitely postponed.  However the 2006–07 Logan Cup did take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ZIM/2006-07_f_Match_List.html|title=The Home of CricketArchive|website=www.cricketarchive.co.uk|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, Zimbabwe played a few LOIs only but was soundly beaten by Bangladesh and also lost twice to ICC associate member [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]].

The domestic game seemed to have all but deteriorated and hopes of a return to the promise that Zimbabwe showed in the 1990s looked to be forlorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2006'' (p. 1373-1377) concludes its account of the Zimbabwean situation with the comment: "But the point of no return cannot be too far away".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket resurgence (2007–2011)==
By late 2007 the Zimbabwean team had defeated Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and gradually signs emerged as Zimbabwe began to build on these small blocks and improve their performance bit by bit. By 2010 [[Zimbabwe Cricket]] informed the [[International Cricket Council]] that they intended to return to Test Cricket after the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]], the ICC agreed as a result of Zimbabwe's improving performance. In August 2011 Zimbabwe played their first Test Match in 6 years and won comprehensively defeating Bangladesh. Following the victory in the one-off Test Match, Zimbabwe sealed the ODI series 3–2. 

During this period of time Zimbabwe Cricket restructured itself domestically and from grassroots levels, new domestic teams emerged and a full-fledged Domestic Twenty20 tournament has seen the country's cricket infrastructure improve. The team also plans to build a stadium near Victoria Falls and has renovated [[Harare Sports Club]] along with [[Queen's Sports Club]] in Bulawayo.

== Player pay dispute == 
In 2013, another dispute engulfed Zimbabwe Cricket. Players threatened to strike during Zimbabwe's ODI series against Pakistan in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/zimbabwe-players-threaten-strike/73921|title=Zimbabwe players threaten strike again|date=30 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations made sure that players went out to play against Pakistan. Surprisingly, the unpaid Zimbabwe players defeated Pakistan in one of the three ODIs. &lt;br /&gt;
The first test of the Test series was also under threat of a player strike but ZC made sure a team was fielded for the Test. Brendan Taylor decided not to believe ZC and sat out of the first test. Zimbabwe went on to beat a lacklustre Pakistan side in the second test match, sparking hopes of recovery for Zimbabwean cricket.&lt;br /&gt;
These hopes were short-lived as the pay dispute got intense in December 2013, when Zimbabwean players went on strike which led to a suspension of the four- and one-day tournaments that were underway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cricketbadger.com/2013/12/15/strike-sees-zimbabwe-season-stalls-again-over-finances/ Zim Cricketers strike again]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/712299.html|title=CSA offers Test to Zimbabwe|date=23 January 2014|website=Cricinfo|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
