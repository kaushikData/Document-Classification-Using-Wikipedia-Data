[[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist thought]] and [[Western philosophy]] include several interesting parallels. Before the 20th century, a few European thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] had engaged with Buddhist thought. Likewise, in Asian nations with Buddhist populations, there were also attempts to bring the insights of Western thought to [[Buddhist philosophy]], as can be seen in the rise of [[Buddhist modernism]].

After the post-war [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|spread of Buddhism to the West]] there has been considerable interest by some scholars in a comparative, cross-cultural approach between Eastern and Western philosophy.  Much of this work is now published in [[academic journals]] such as ''[[Philosophy East and West]]''.

==Hellenistic philosophy==
According to [[Edward Conze]], [[Philosophical skepticism#Ancient Western Skepticism|Greek Skepticism]] (particularly that of [[Pyrrho]]) can be compared to Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian [[Madhyamika]] school.&lt;ref name=Conze&gt;Conze, Edward. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/conze2.htm Buddhist Philosophy and Its European Parallels]. Philosophy East and West 13, p.9-23, no.1, January 1963. University press of Hawaii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian Skeptics']] goal of [[ataraxia]] (the state of being untroubled) is a [[soteriological]] goal. The core teaching of Pyrrho was that things are [[adiaphora]] (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), astathmēta (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and anepikrita (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). This is strikingly similar to the Buddhist [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beckwith |first=Christopher I. |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2015 |page=28 |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf |isbn=9781400866328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They promoted withholding judgment ([[Epoché]]) about facts of the world as a way to reach that goal. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and [[Nagarjuna]]'s "relinquishing of all views ([[drsti]])". Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought. In ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism'', Kuzminski writes:  "its origin can plausibly be traced to the contacts between Pyrrho and the sages he encountered in India, where he traveled with [[Alexander the Great]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism; for a recent study see Halkias "The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic World" Jocbs. 2015 (8): 163–186. https://www.academia.edu/12679460/The_Self-immolation_of_Kalanos_and_other_Luminous_Encounters_Among_Greeks_and_Indian_Buddhists_in_the_Hellenistic_World&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Buddhist thought can also be compared to [[Classical Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]], in that all of these world views sought to develop a set of practices to reach a state of equanimity by the removal of desires and passions.

==Hume and Not-Self==
{{buddhism | terse=1}}
The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception"&lt;ref name=Hume&gt;Hume, David. A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I Part IV Section VI: Of Personal Identity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hume then there is nothing that is constantly stable which we could identify as the self, only a flow of differing experiences. Our view that there is something substantive which binds all of these experiences together is for Hume merely imaginary. The self is a fiction that is attributed to the entire flow of experiences.&lt;ref name=James&gt;Giles, James. The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 43, No. 2 (Apr., 1993), pp. 175-200, University of Hawai'i Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently there is no such idea...I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement.&lt;ref name=Hume /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This '[[Bundle theory]]' of personal identity is very similar to the Buddhist notion of [[Anatta|not-self]], which holds that the unitary self is a fiction and that nothing exists but a collection of [[five aggregates]].&lt;ref name=James /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;Gopnik, Alison. Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism? Charles Francois Dolu, the Royal College of La Flèche, and the Global Jesuit Intellectual Network. Hume Studies, Volume 35, Number 1&amp;2, 2009, pp. 5–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, both Hume and Buddhist philosophy hold that it is perfectly acceptable to speak of personal identity in a [[Two truths doctrine|mundane and conventional way]], while believing that there are ultimately no such things.&lt;ref name=James /&gt; Hume scholar Alison Gopnik has even argued that Hume could have had contact with Buddhist philosophy during his stay in France (which coincided with his writing of the ''Treatise of Human Nature'') through the well traveled [[Jesuit]] missionaries of the [[La Flèche#History|Royal College of La Flèche]].&lt;ref name=Gopnik /&gt;

British philosopher [[Derek Parfit]] has argued for a reductionist and deflationary theory of [[personal identity]] in his book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''. According to Parfit, apart from a causally connected stream of mental and physical events, there are no “separately existing entities, distinct from our brains and bodies”. Parfit concludes that "Buddha would have agreed."&lt;ref&gt;Parfit, Reasons and Persons 1984, p 273&lt;/ref&gt; Parfit also argues that this view is liberating and leads to increased empathy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the truth depressing? Some may find it so. But I find it liberating, and consoling. When I believed that my existence was such a further fact, I seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my lives and the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others.&lt;ref&gt;Parfit, Reasons and Persons 1984, pp. 280-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s Larissa MacFarquhar, passages of ''Reasons and Persons'' have been studied and chanted at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Larissa. HOW TO BE GOOD, An Oxford philosopher thinks he can distill all morality into a formula. Is he right? 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Western philosophers that have attacked the view of a fixed self include [[Daniel Dennett]] (in his paper 'The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity') and [[Thomas Metzinger]] ('The Ego Tunnel').

==Idealism==
[[Idealism]] is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Some Buddhist philosophical views have been interpreted as having Idealistic tendencies, mainly the cittamatra (mind-only) philosophy of [[Yogacara]] Buddhism&lt;ref&gt;Tola &amp; Dragonetti, Philosophy of mind in the Yogacara Buddhist idealistic school, History of Psychiatry, 16(4): 453–465. {{cite web |url=http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/51564/1/PEER_stage2_10.1177%252F0957154X05059213.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325112856/http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/51564/1/PEER_stage2_10.1177/0957154X05059213.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as outlined in the works of [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Xuanzang]].&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, Sean. Idealism in Yogācāra Buddhism, The Hilltop Review, Western Michigan University.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical Idealism has been the orthodox position of the [[East Asian Yogācāra|Chinese Yogacara]] school or Fǎxiàng-zōng.&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;Chan, Wing-cheuk, Yogacara Buddhism and Sartre’s Phenomenology.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist philosopher Vasubhandu "The transformation of consciousness is imagination. What is imagined by it does not exist. Therefore everything is [[Mind-only#Representation-only|representation-only]]." This has been compared to the Idealist philosophies of [[Bishop Berkeley]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. [[Category (Kant)|Kant's categories]] have also been compared to the Yogacara concept of karmic ''vasanas'' (perfumings) which condition our mental reality.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;

===Buddhism and German Idealism===
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Transcendental Idealism]] has also been compared with the Indian philosophical approach of the [[Madhyamaka]] school by scholars such as T. R. V. Murti.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. V. Murti, The Central Philosophy of Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt; Both posit that the world of experience is in one sense a mere fabrication of our senses and mental faculties. For Kant and the Madhyamikas, we do not have access to 'things in themselves' because they are always filtered by our mind's 'interpretative framework'.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David. Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus both worldviews posit that there is an ultimate reality and that Reason is unable to reach it. Buddhologists like [[Edward Conze]] have also seen similarities between [[Kant's antinomies]] and [[the unanswerable questions]] of the Buddha in that "they are both concerned with whether the world is finite or infinite, etc., and in that they are both left undecided."&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/conze1.htm Spurious Parallels to Buddhist Philosophy], Philosophy East and West 13, no.2, pp105-115 January 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was influenced by Indian religious texts and later claimed that Buddhism was the "best of all possible religions."&lt;ref&gt;Urs App, Richard Wagner and Buddhism, pg 17&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's view that "suffering is the direct and immediate object of life"&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, On the Sufferings of the world&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is driven by an "restless willing and striving" are similar to the [[four noble truths]] of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;oregonstate.edu page on Schopenhauer &amp; Buddhism http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Schopenhauer/schopenhauer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer promoted the saintly ascetic life of the Indian [[Shramana|sramanas]] as a way to renounce [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"|the Will]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Wicks, Robert, "Arthur Schopenhauer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/schopenhauer/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His view that a single world-essence (The Will) comes to manifest itself as a multiplicity of individual things (''[[principium individuationis]]'') has been compared to the Buddhist [[trikaya]] doctrine as developed in [[Yogacara Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Finally, Schopenhauer's ethics which are based on universal compassion for the suffering of others can be compared to the Buddhist ethics of [[Karuṇā]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Kenneth [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2014/12/Hutton-Schopenhauer.pdf Compassion in Schopenhauer and Śāntideva. ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Vol. 21 (2014)] and (2009) Ethics in Schopenhauer and Buddhism. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow http://theses.gla.ac.uk/912/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nietzsche==
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] admired Buddhism, writing that it "Buddhism already has -- and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity -- the self-deception of moral concepts behind it -- it stands, in my language, [[Beyond Good and Evil]]."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ, R. J. Hollingdale (Trans and Ed.) (Harmondsworth: Penguin), No. 20, p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche saw himself as undertaking a similar project to the Buddha, “I could become the Buddha of Europe,” he wrote in 1883, “though frankly I would be the antipode of the Indian Buddha.”&lt;ref&gt;Panaïoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche (as well as Buddha) accepted that all is change and becoming, and both sought to create an ethics which was not based on a God or an Absolutist Being.&lt;ref&gt;Panaïoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that Buddhism's goal of Nirvana was a form of life denying [[nihilism]] and promoted what he saw as its inversion, life affirmation and ''[[amor fati]]''. According to Benjamin A. Elman, Nietzsche's interpretation of Buddhism as pessimistic and life-denying was probably influenced by his understanding of Schopenhauer's views of eastern philosophy and therefore "he was predisposed to react to Buddhism in terms of his close reading of Schopenhauer."&lt;ref name="Elman, Benjamin A 1983 pp. 671-686"&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. Nietzsche and Buddhism, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 44, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1983), pp. 671-686.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this writes Elman, Nietzsche misinterprets Buddhism as promoting "nothingness" and nihilism, all of which the Buddha and other Buddhist philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] repudiated, in favor of a subtler understanding of [[Shunyata]].&lt;ref name="Elman, Benjamin A 1983 pp. 671-686"/&gt;

Antoine Panaïoti argues in ''Nietzsche and Buddhist philosophy'' that both of these systems of thought begin by wrestling with the problem of [[nihilism]] and that they both develop a therapeutic outlook for dealing with the suffering and anxiety brought about by the crisis of nihilism. While Nietzsche and Buddhism do diverge in some ways, which is why Nietzsche saw himself as an 'Anti-Buddha", Panaïoti stresses the similarity of both systems as paths towards a “vision of great health” that allows one to deal with the impermanent world of becoming by accepting it as it truly is.&lt;ref&gt;Panaïoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 49&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately both world views have as their ideal what Panaïoti calls "great health perfectionism" which seeks to remove unhealthy tendencies from human beings and reach an exceptional state of self-development.

Robert G. Morrison has also written on the "ironic affinities" between Nietzsche and Pali Buddhism through close textual comparison, such as that between Nietzsche's 'self-overcoming' (''Selbstüberwindung'') and the Buddhist concept of mental development (''citta-bhavana'').&lt;ref&gt;MORRISON, ROBERT G. Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities.
Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison also sees an affinity between the Buddhist concept of [[tanha]], or craving and Nietzsche's view of the [[Will to Power]] as well as in their understandings of personality as a flux of different psycho-physical forces.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Robert G. Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities; Reviewed by Loy, David R. Asian Philosophy Vol. 8, No. 2 (July 1998) pp. 129-131 Copyright 1998 Journals Oxford Ltd. (UK), http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/loy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between Nietzsche's view of the Ego as flux and the Buddhist concept of [[anatta]] is also noted by Benjamin Elman.&lt;ref name="Elman, Benjamin A 1983 pp. 671-686"/&gt;

[[David Loy]] also quotes Nietzsche's views on the subject as "something added and invented and projected behind what there is" (Will to Power 481) and on substance ("The properties of a thing are effects on other 'things' ... there is no 'thing-in-itself.'" WP 557), which are similar to Buddhist nominalist views. Loy however sees Nietzsche as failing to understand that his promotion of heroic aristocratic values and affirmation of will to power is just as much of a reaction to the 'sense of lack' which arises from the impermanence of the subject as what he calls slave morality.&lt;ref&gt;Loy, David; Beyond good and evil? A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche. Asian Philosophy Vol. 6, No. 1 (March, 1996) pp. 37-58, http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/loy1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative work has also been done by Japanese interpreters of Nietzsche and Buddhism, such as Nishitani Keiji, in his ''The Self Overcoming Nihilism'' (Albany, N.Y., 1990), and Abe Masao in his essays on Nietzsche. In his "A History of Western Philosophy", [[Bertrand Russell]] pitted Nietzsche against the Buddha, ultimately criticizing Nietzsche for his promotion of violence, elitism and hatred of compassionate love.

==Phenomenology and Existentialism==
[[File:Nanavira_Thera.jpg|thumb|[[Nanavira Thera|Ñāṇavīra Thera]] developed an interpretation of the [[Pali Canon]] influenced by Phenomenology and Existentialism.]]
The German Buddhist monk [[Nyanaponika Thera]] wrote that the Buddhist [[Abhidhamma]] philosophy "doubtlessly belongs" to Phenomenology and that the Buddhist term [[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dhamma]] could be rendered as "phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika Thera, Abhidhamma studies, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Alexander Piatigorsky]] sees early Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy as being a "phenomenological approach".&lt;ref&gt;A. Piatigorsky The Buddhist philosophy of thought. — Totowa, N. J., 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dan Lusthaus]], Buddhism "is a type of phenomenology; Yogacara even moreso."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus. Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun. Curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism Series. London: Routledge, 2002. Page viii&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars reject the idealist interpretation of [[Yogacara]] Buddhist philosophy and instead interpret it through the lens of Western [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] which is the study of conscious processes from the subjective point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Sharf, R.H. Is Yogācāra Phenomenology? Some Evidence
from the Cheng weishi lun, Indian Philos (2016) 44: 777. doi:10.1007/s10781-015-9282-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Coseru argues in his monograph "Perceiving reality" that Buddhist philosophers such as [[Dharmakirti]], [[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]] "share a common ground with phenomenologists in the tradition of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty." That common ground is the notion of the [[intentionality]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Coseru, Christian; Perceiving Reality: Consciousness, Intentionality, and Cognition in Buddhist Philosophyu&lt;/ref&gt; Coseru compares the concepts of the object aspect (grāhyākāra) and the subject aspect (grāhakākāra) of consciousness to the Husserlian concepts of [[Noesis]] and [[Noema]].

Modern Buddhist thinkers who have been influenced by Western Phenomenology and [[Existentialism]] include [[Nanavira Thera|Ñāṇavīra Thera]], [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu]], [[R. G. de S. Wettimuny]], [[Samanera Bodhesako]] and Ninoslav Ñāṇamoli.

===Husserl===
[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|Husserl c. 1910s]]
[[Edmund Husserl]], the founder of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], wrote that "I could not tear myself away" while reading the Buddhist [[Sutta Pitaka]] in the German translation of [[Karl Eugen Neumann]].&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;Hanna, Fred; Husserl on the Teachings of the Buddha; in The Humanistic Psychologist 23(3):365-372 · September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;Lau Kwok Ying, Husserl, Buddhism and the problematic crisis of the European sciences; http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/rih/phs/events/200405_PEACE/papers/LAUKwokYing.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl held that the Buddha's method as he understood it was very similar to his own. [[Eugen Fink]], who was Husserl's chief assistant and whom Husserl considered to be his most trusted interpreter said that: "the various phases of Buddhistic self-discipline were essentially phases of phenomenological reduction."&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, D. Conversations with Husserl and Fink, p. 50; The Hague: Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; After reading the Buddhist texts, Husserl wrote a short essay entitled 'On the discourses of Gautama Buddha' (''Über die Reden Gotomo Buddhos'') which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Complete linguistic analysis of the Buddhist canonical writings provides us with a perfect opportunity of becoming acquainted with this means of seeing the world which is completely opposite of our European manner of observation, of setting ourselves in its perspective, and of making its dynamic results truly comprehensive through experience and understanding. For us, for anyone, who lives in this time of the collapse of our own exploited, decadent culture and has had a look around to see where spiritual purity and truth, where joyous mastery of the world manifests itself, this manner of seeing means a great adventure.

That Buddhism - insofar as it speaks to us from pure original sources - is a religio-ethical discipline for spiritual purification and fulfillment of the highest stature - conceived of and dedicated to an inner result of a vigorous and unparalleled, elevated frame of mind, will soon become clear to every reader who devotes themselves to the work. Buddhism is comparable only with the highest form of the philosophy and religious spirit of our European culture. It is now our task to utilize this (to us) completely new Indian spiritual discipline which has been revitalized and strengthened by the contrast.&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fred J Hanna and Lau Kwok Ying both note that when Husserl calls Buddhism "transcendental" he is placing it on the same level as his own transcendental phenomenology.&lt;ref name=Lau /&gt; Also, that Husserl called Buddhism a "great adventure" is significant, since he referred to his own philosophy in that way as well - as a methodology which changes the way one views reality which also brings about personal transformation.&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt; Husserl also wrote about Buddhist philosophy in an unpublished manuscript "Sokrates - Buddha" in which he compared the Buddhist philosophical attitude with the Western tradition. Husserl saw a similarity between the Socratic good life lived under the maxim "Know yourself" and the Buddhist philosophy, he argues that they both have the same attitude, which is a combination of the pure theoretical attitude of the sciences and the pragmatic attitudes of everyday life. This third attitude is based on "a praxis whose aim is to elevate humankind through universal scientific reason."&lt;ref name=Lau /&gt;

Husserl also saw a similarity between Buddhist analysis of experience and his own method of epoche which is a suspension of judgment about metaphysical assumptions and presuppositions about the 'external' world (assumptions he termed 'the naturalistic attitude). However Husserl also thought that Buddhism has not developed into a unifying science which can unite all knowledge since it remains a religious-ethical system and hence it is not able to qualify as a full transcendental phenomenology.&lt;ref name=Lau /&gt;

According to Aaron Prosser, "The phenomenological investigations of Siddhartha Gautama and Edmund Husserl arrive at the exact same conclusion concerning a fundamental and invariant structure of consciousness. Namely, that object-directed consciousness has a transcendental correlational intentional structure, and that this is fundamental -- in the sense of basic and necessary--to all object-directed experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, Aaron; Siddhartha, Husserl, and Neurophenomenology, Journal of Consciousness Studies, Volume 20, Numbers 5-6, 2013, pp. 151-170(20)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heidegger===
According to Reinhard May and Graham Parkes, Heidegger may have been influenced by [[Zen]] and [[Daoist]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Graham. Heidegger and Asian Thought&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, Reinhard, Heidegger's Hidden Sources: East-Asian Influences on his Work&lt;/ref&gt; Some of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophical terms, such as Ab-grund (void), Das Nichts (the Nothing) and [[Dasein]] have been considered in light of Buddhist terms which express similar ideas such as [[Shunyata|Emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf von Eckartsberg and Ronald S. Valle, Heideggerian Thinking and the Eastern Mind.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wing-cheuk Chan, HEIDEGGER AND CHINESE BUDDHISM&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heidegger]] wrote that: “As void [Ab-grund], Being ‘is’ at once the nothing [das Nichts] as well as the ground.”&lt;ref&gt;Backman, Jussi. THE ABSENT FOUNDATION HEIDEGGER ON THE RATIONALITY OF BEING.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's "Dialogue on Language", has a Japanese friend (Tezuka Tomio) state that "to us [Japanese] emptiness is the loftiest name for what you mean to say with the word ‘Being’”&lt;ref name=Storey&gt;Storey, David “Zen in Heidegger’s Way”, Journal of East-West philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's critique of [[metaphysics]] has also been compared to Zen's radical anti-metaphysical attitude.&lt;ref name=Storey /&gt; [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] held that Heidegger's philosophy was similar to [[Zen Buddhism]] and that Heidegger himself had confirmed this after reading the works of [[DT Suzuki]].&lt;ref name=Storey /&gt;

===Existentialism===
[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] believed that consciousness lacks an essence or any fixed characteristics and that insight into this caused a strong sense of [[Existential angst#Angst|Existential angst]] or [[Nausea]]. Sartre saw consciousness as defined by its ability of negation, this happens because whenever consciousness becomes conscious of something it is aware of itself not being that intentional object. Consciousness is nothingness because all [[being-in-itself]] - the entire world of objects - is outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;Phra Medidhammaporn (Prayoon Mererk): Sartre’s Existentialism and Early Buddhism. Publisher: Buddhadhamma Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for Sartre, being-in-itself is also nothing more than appearance, it has no essence.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, Sander. Notions of Selflessness in Sartrean Existentialism and Theravadin Buddhism. http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliLee.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the self as [[Being and Nothingness#Nothingness|nothingness]] and of reality as lacking any inherent essence has been compared to the Buddhist concept of [[Shunyata|Emptiness]] and [[Anatta|Not-self]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven William Laycock, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vJix57OfR5gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nothingness and Emptiness: A Buddhist Engagement With the Ontology of Jean-Paul Sartre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale,Sarah. Empty Selves: A Comparative Analysis of Mahayana Buddhism, Jean-Paul Sartre’s Existentialism, and Depth Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the Buddhists rejected the Hindu concept of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]], Sartre rejected Husserl's concept of the [[transcendental ego]].

[[Merleau-Ponty]]'s phenomenology has been said to be similar to [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Madhyamaka]] in that they all hold to the interconnection of the self, body and the world (the "[[lifeworld]]"). The unity of body and mind (''shēnxīn'', 身心) expressed by the Buddhism of [[Dogen]] and [[Zhanran]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s view of the [[Merleau-Ponty#Corporeity|corporeity of consciousness]] seem to be in agreement. They both hold that the conscious mind is inherently connected to the body and the external world and that the [[lifeworld]] is experienced dynamically through the body, denying any independent [[Descartes|Cartesian]] Cogito.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Y. Park, Gereon Kopf (editors). Merleau-Ponty and Buddhism, pg 4, pg84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German existentialist [[Karl Jaspers]] also wrote on the philosophy of the Buddha in his "The Great Philosophers" (1975). He recommended that Western Christians could learn from the Buddha, praised his cosmopolitanism and the flexibility and relatively non-dogmatic worldview of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Wautischer, Alan M. Olson, Gregory J. Walters; Philosophical Faith and the Future of Humanity, p 415-417&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kyoto School==
[[File:Kitaro_Nishidain_in_Feb._1943.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kitaro Nishida, Feb. 1943]]
The [[Kyoto School]] was a Japanese philosophical movement centered around [[Kyoto University]] that assimilated western philosophical influences (such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Heidegger]]) and Mahayana Buddhist ideas to create a new original philosophical synthesis.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Bret W., "The Kyoto School", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/kyoto-school/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, [[Kitaro Nishida|Nishida Kitaro]] (1870–1945) developed the central concept associated with the Kyoto school, that is the concept of “Absolute Nothingness” (zettai-mu) which is related to the Zen Buddhist term [[Mu (negative)|Mu]] (無) as well as [[Shunyata]].&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; Nishida saw [[the Absolute]] nature of reality as Nothingness, a "formless", "groundless ground" which envelops all beings and allows them to undergo change and pass away.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

==Buddhism and Process philosophy==
The [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] has several convergent points with Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Inada&gt;Inada, Kenneth K. ''The metaphysics of Buddhist experience and the Whiteheadian encounter'', Philosophy East and West Vol. 25/1975.10. P.465-487 http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/inada3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead saw reality as an impermanent constant process of flux and denied that objects had any real substance within them, but rather were ever changing occasions. This is similar to the Buddhist concepts of the [[anicca|impermanence]] and [[shunyata|emptiness]].&lt;ref name=McFarlane&gt;McFarlane, Thomas J. Process and Emptiness: A Comparison of Whitehead’s Process Philosophy and Mahayana Buddhist Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead also held that each one of these processes was never independent, but was interrelated and dependent all prior occasions, and this feature of reality which he called 'creativity' has been compared to [[dependent origination]] which holds that all events are conditioned by multiple past causes.&lt;ref name=Inada /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFarlane /&gt; Like Buddhism, Whitehead also held that our understanding of the world is usually mistaken because we hold to the ‘fallacy of misplaced concreteness’ in seeing constantly changing processes as having fixed substances.&lt;ref name=McFarlane /&gt; Buddhism teaches that suffering and stress arises from our [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] to the true nature of the world. Likewise, Whitehead held that the world is "haunted by terror" at this process of change. "The ultimate evil in the temporal world...lies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a ‘perpetual perishing’" ([[Process and Reality|PR]], p. 340). In this sense, Whitehead's concept of "evil" is similar to the Buddhist [[Dukkha#Three patterns|viparinama-dukkha]], suffering caused by change.&lt;ref name=Inada /&gt; Whitehead also had a view of God which has been likened to the Mahayana theory of the [[Trikaya]] as well as the [[Bodhisattva#In Mahāyāna Buddhism|Bodhisattva ideal]].&lt;ref name=Inada /&gt;

==Panpsychism and Buddha-nature==
[[Panpsychism]] is the view that mind or soul is a universal feature of all things, this has been a common view in western philosophy going back to the [[Presocratics]] and [[Plato]]. According to D. S. Clarke, panpsychist and panexperientialist aspects can be found in the [[Huayan school|Huayan]] and [[Tiantai]] (Jpn. [[Tendai]]) Buddhist doctrines of [[Buddha nature]], which was often attributed to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, D.S. Panpsychism: past and recent selected readings, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wittgenstein==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] held a therapeutic view of philosophy which according to K.T. Fann has "striking resemblances" to the Zen Buddhist conception of the dharma as a medicine for abstract linguistic and philosophical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;K. T. Fann, Wittgenstein's Conception of Philosophy, pg110&lt;/ref&gt; C. Gudmunsen in his ''Wittgenstein and Buddhism'' argues that "much of what the later Wittgenstein had to say was anticipated about 1,800 years ago in India." In his book, Gudmunsen mainly compares Wittgenstein's later philosophy with [[Madhyamaka]] views on the emptiness of thought and words.&lt;ref&gt;Gudmunsen, Chris ''Wittgenstein and Buddhism'', 1977, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Wittgenstein's students, the Sri Lankan philosopher [[KN Jayatilleke]], wrote ''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'' which interpreted the epistemology of the early Buddhist texts analytically.

Many modern interpreters of Nagarjuna (Jay Garfield, CW Huntington) take a Wittgensteinian or Post-Wittgensteinian critical model in their work on Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenquist, Tina. Demystifying the saint, Jay L Garfield's rational reconstruction of Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka as the epitome of cross-cultural philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Ives Waldo writes that [[Nagarjuna]]'s criticism of the idea of [[svabhava]] (own-being) "directly parallels Wittgenstein's argument that a private language (an empiricist language) is impossible. Having no logical links (criteria) to anything outside their defining situation, its words must be empty of significance or use."&lt;ref&gt;Ives Waldo, "Naagaarjuna and Analytic Philosophy, "Philosophy East and West 25, no. 3 (July p. 169 1975): 281-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2010 COSCUP door.jpg|thumb|COSCUP/ GNOME.Asia 2010, held in [[Academia Sinica]].]]

'''Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters''' ('''COSCUP'''; {{zh|c=開源人年會}}) is an annual conference held by Taiwanese [[Open source community]] participants since 2006. It's a major force of [[Free software movement]] advocacy in [[Taiwan]]. The event is often held in two days, with talks, sponsor and communities booths, and [[Birds of a feather (computing)]]. In addition to international speakers, many Taiwanese local [[Open Source]] contributors often give their talks here. The chief organizer, other staffs, and speakers are all volunteers.

COSCUP's aim is to provide a platform to connect [[Open Source]] coders, users, and promoters, and promote [[FLOSS]] with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend because of the enthusiastic sponsors and donators. Since the conference venue is limited, tickets are often sold out immediately after the online registration starts.

The lightweight [[Desktop Environment]] [[LXDE]] was announced at COSCUP 2006.

== History ==
COSCUP's predecessor was the community talks in [[International Conference on Open Source]] (Chinese: [[:zh:國際開放源碼研討會]], ICOS). In 2006, ICOS's topics no longer fit some attendees' demand; Taiwanese [[Open source community]] participators initiated COSCUP, as a "festival" for Taiwanese open source communities. The first event, COSCUP 2006, was held at [[National Taiwan University Sports Center]], and was a great success with almost 200 attendees. The number of attendees grew to almost 2000 by COSCUP 2014.

In 2014，COSCUP moved to [[Taipei International Convention Center]], with 1,500 attendees, and 110 talks. Later in 2014, COSCUP was back to [[Academia Sinica]] Humanities and Social Sciences Building, but the conference also extends to the neighboring [[Academia Sinica]] Academic Activities Center. This was the first time COSCUP was held in two venues simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COSCUP 開源人年會台灣舉行|url=http://linuxpilot.com/coscup|author=Mak Kenneth|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registration ==
COSCUP's registration set records in 2010, 2011, and 2012, as the server crashed within minutes after registrations began, the registration process is often done after hours, due to heavy server load.&lt;ref name="coscup2012-13reg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://speakerdeck.com/hlb/da-bu-dao-de-bao-ming-wang-zhan-2013-coscup-ban|title=打不倒的報名網站 2013 COSCUP 版|accessdate=4 August 2013|last=Liang|first=Bin Hsueh|date=4 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192337/https://speakerdeck.com/hlb/da-bu-dao-de-bao-ming-wang-zhan-2013-coscup-ban|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In COSCUP 2013, the conference started to use [[Registrano]] for registration. The system successfully sustained the heavy load of the registrations, this also led to the later success with [[KKTIX]] with COSCUP 2014.&lt;ref name="coscup2012-13reg" /&gt;

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{Western Buddhism}}
'''Carlo Zendo Tetsugen Serra''' (Milano, Italy 1953 -) is an Italian missionary Soto Zen master  (''Kokusaifukyoshi'' 国際布教師), one of the last successors of  [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]] (原田祖岳, 1871–1961).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Introvigne]], ''Enciclopedia delle religioni in Italia''. Torino, Elledici, 2001, p.571.&lt;/ref&gt;
He founded his sangha, of the "Sangha della foresta di Bambü" (Bamboo Forest's Sangha) and the monasteries  [[Ensoji il Cerchio]] in [[Milan]], and Sanbo-ji Tempio dei Tre Gioielli in [[Berceto]].
He also founded the "Scuola Zen di Shiatsu"&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. [http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/temples/outside_jp/Italy/98.html here], official site of Sōtō International.&lt;/ref&gt; (Zen Shiatsu School), that aims to use the art of shiatsu treatments as a zen practice.
He is one of the buddhist religious authorities in Europe signator of the interreligious Italian "Manifesto della pace" (Peace Manifesto).

==Biography==

After a short career in the world of photography and cinema, Carlo Serra arrives in Japan in 1983, and is ordained monk  (出家 ''shukke''),
with the Dharma name (戒名, ''kaimyō'') Tetsugen, at the Tosho-ji (東照寺) monkery of Tokyo. He became disciple of the abbot  [[Ban Tetsugyu Soin]] Roshi (伴鐵牛, 1910–1996).

During his training of monk, he attended the Institute of eastern medicine founded by [[Shizuto Masunaga]] (増永静人 1925–1981), from which, in 1988, he got a certificate of teacher of eastern medicine and Zen Shiatsu.&lt;ref name="monasterozen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monasterozen.it/it/il-lignaggio-i-maestri-del-buddhismo-zen/il-nostro-maestro.html|title=Il nostro Maestro|publisher=monasterozen.it|accessdate=2015-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020085823/http://www.monasterozen.it/it/il-lignaggio-i-maestri-del-buddhismo-zen/il-nostro-maestro.html#|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composite background of zen monk and shiatsu teacher opened to Tetsugen his intention to use the shiatsu discipline as zen practice, that will become one of particularity of his work in Italy.

After five years training in Toshoji, Tetsugen was sent as a buddhist missionary in Italy, and in 1988 grounded the first monastery in Milan, Enso-ji il Cerchio. In 1992 had birth also the Shiatsu Zen school ("Scuola Zen di Shiatsu"). In 1995 follows the beginning, even in Enso-ji, of the offering of shiatsu massage, which permitted to monks and shiatsu teachers to use and improve the abilities apprehended in the training, making a job of that.

A year later a second monastery is founded, the Sanbo-ji, tempio dei tre Gioielli (temple of three jewels) nearby Berceto, Parma.
Initially used for location for zen retreats and shiatsu seminaries, in the last years Sanbo-ji becomes seat of a monastic "Sangha", that opened to the lay people also to practise a monk's daily life for a short time.

In 1998 the zen master [[Tetsujyo Deguchi]] (出口鐵城, 1951), dharma heir of  [[Ban Tetsugyu Soin]] (伴鐵牛, 1910–1996) and current abbot of Sanbo-ji&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. the lineage [http://homepage3.nifty.com/toshoji/ here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226075712/http://homepage3.nifty.com/toshoji/# |date=2014-12-26 }} and about the link with the italian monastery ''Il Cerchio'', [http://homepage3.nifty.com/toshoji/ here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226075712/http://homepage3.nifty.com/toshoji/# |date=2014-12-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; certificates to Tetsugen the Dharma transmission of his lineage, recognizing him as missionary zen master (''Kokusaifukyoshi'' 国際布教師) with the name of Zendo.
The confirm of this title accompanied the acknowledgement of Tetsugen as independent master by the international association  "Sōtōshū shumucho" (曹洞宗宗務庁), to which belong many of the Soto temples and monasteries in Japan and in the World.
Between 2000 and 2003, Tetsugen covered the seat of member of the direction of UBI (Italian Buddhist Union).

The first years of 21st Century saw a gradual evolution of the approach of Tetsugen's doctrine, that began to put the basis for a new development of zen teaching and practising that could transfer the meanings of buddhist and zen tradition following the demands and the languages of the western society. The Italian zen master tested also an approach to management of the zen discipline of koan solving creating in 2003 the society "ZenEssere" (ZenBeing), deeping a theoretical path that took him to publish, for the publishing house Guerini ''Management by Zen Koan'', in which he develops an application of Zen teaching to management.

The work of Tetsugen Serra spreads itself also to experimentations that make from Zen teaching and cognitive psychology a lay path of self-improvement with the offering of counseling sessions, helping to solve daily problems about the attitude to life.
In 2012 Tetsugen finishes to perfect the path of consciousness development named ''MindfulZen'', that through sessions of meetings, seminars and appropriate essays achieve the Italian master's intention to build a path to mindfulness from zen teachings in a lay a contemporary way.

'''Conjecture (conjectural emendation)''' is a critical reconstruction of the original reading of a clearly corrupt, contaminated, nonsensical or illegible textual fragment. Conjecture is one of the techniques of [[textual criticism]] used by [[philologist]]s while commenting on or preparing editions of [[manuscript]]s (e.g. [[Biblical manuscript|biblical]] or other ancient texts usually transmitted in medieval copies). Conjecture is far from being just an educated guess and it takes an experienced expert with a broad knowledge of the author of the text, period, language and style of the time. Conjecture requires a close study of the text in its cultural and historical context and must be preceded with a thorough analysis of all [[extant literature|extant]] versions and readings of the given fragment. The [[paleography|knowledge of writing styles]] used by the [[scribe]]s throughout the transmission stages is also essential. Conjectural emendation must be clearly indicated in the [[critical apparatus]] or in the text itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30766">'''Constructivist epistemology''' is a branch in [[philosophy of science]] maintaining that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, who seek to measure and construct models of the natural world. [[Natural science]] therefore consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experience and measurements.

According to constructivists, the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Crotty, M. 1998. ''The Foundations of Social Science Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism opposes the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivism]], embracing the belief that a human can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[accuracy]].

According to constructivists there is no single valid methodology in science, but rather a diversity of useful methods.&lt;ref&gt;(Schofield, n.d.)

==Origin of the term==
The term originates from [[Constructivism (psychological school)|psychology]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|education]], and [[social constructivism]].  The expression "constructivist epistemology" was first used by [[Jean Piaget]], 1967, with plural form in the famous article from the "Encyclopédie de la Pléiade" ''Logique et connaissance scientifique'' or "Logic and Scientific knowledge", an important text for [[epistemology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} He refers directly to the mathematician [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his ''radical constructivism''.

The terms ''Constructionism'' and ''constructivism'' are often, but should not be, used interchangeably.  Constructionism is an approach to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, but it is very different. Constructionism involves the creation of a product to show learning.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8751190 Award Abstract #8751190, ''Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], as well as tables, chairs and atoms are [[social construction|socially constructed]]. [[Marx]] was among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of the power of ideas to inform the material realities of people's lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Constructivism stems from a number of philosophies. For instance, early development can be attributed to the thought of Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] (''Everything flows, nothing stands still''), [[Protagoras]] (''Man is the measure of all things''). Protagoras is clearly represented by Plato and hence the tradition as a relativist. The Pyrrhonist sceptics have also been so interpreted. (Although this is more contentious.){{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with the phenomenology and the event, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] gives a decisive contradiction to Cartesians' epistemology that has grown since Descartes despite [[Giambattista Vico]] calling in ''Scienza nuova'' ("New Science") in 1725 that "the norm of the truth is to have made it". The Enlightenment's claim of the universality of [[Reason]] as the only true source of knowledge generated a Romantic reaction involving an emphasis on the separate natures of races, species, sexes and types of human.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

* [[Gaston Bachelard]], who is known for his physics psychoanalysis and the definition of an "epistemologic obstacle" that can disturb a changing of scientific paradigm as the one that occurred between classical mechanics and Einstein's relativism, opens the teleological way with "The meditation on the object takes the form of the project". In the following famous saying, he insists that the ways in which questions are posed determines the trajectory of scientific movement, before summarizing "nothing is given, all is constructed" : "And, irrespective of what one might assume, in the life of a science, problems do not arise by themselves. It is precisely this that marks out a problem as being of the true scientific spirit: all knowledge is in response to a question. If there  were no question, there would be no scientific knowledge. Nothing proceeds from itself. Nothing is given. All is constructed.", Gaston Bachelard (''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'', 1934). While quantum mechanics is starting to grow, Gaston Bachelard makes a call for a new science in ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' (The New Scientific Spirit).
* [[Paul Valéry]], French poet (20th century) reminds us of the importance of representations and action: "We have always sought explanations when it was only representations that we could seek to invent", "My hand feels touched as well as it touches; reality says this, and nothing more".
* This link with action, which could be called a "philosophy of action", was well represented by Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]]: ''Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar''.
* [[Ludwik Fleck]] establishes scientific constructivism by introducing the notions of ''thought collective'' (''Denkkollektiv''), and ''thought style'' (''Denkstil''), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects can be described in terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by [[Thomas Kuhn]].
* [[Norbert Wiener]] gives another defense of [[teleology]] in 1943 ''Behavior, Intention and Teleology'' and is one of the creators of cybernetics.
* [[Jean Piaget]], after the creation in 1955 of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, first uses the expression "constructivist epistemologies" (see above). According to [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], Jean Piaget is "the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing" (in ''An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like it Radical'', 1990) and "the most prolific constructivist in our century" (in ''Aspects of Radical Constructivism'', 1996).
* [[J. L. Austin]] is associated with the view that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality to which it is applied through [[speech act]]s.
* [[Herbert A. Simon]] called "the sciences of the artificial" these new sciences (cybernetics, cognitive sciences, decision and organisation sciences) that, because of the abstraction of their object (information, communication, decision), cannot match with the classical epistemology and its experimental method and refutability.

==Constructivism and sciences==
===Social constructivism in sociology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[International relations]] --&gt;
{{Main|Social constructivism}}
One version of ''social constructivism'' contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.

Social activity presupposes human beings inhabiting shared forms of life, and in the case of social construction, utilizing [[semiotic]] resources ([[meaning-making]] and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term ''Social Constructivism'': [[psychology]] (after [[Lev Vygotsky]]), [[sociology]] (after  [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], themselves influenced by [[Alfred Schütz]]), [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[David Bloor]]), [[sociology]] of [[mathematics]] ([[Sal Restivo]]), [[philosophy of mathematics]] ([[Paul Ernest]]). [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for ''social constructivism'', with its key theoretical concepts of ''language games'' embedded in ''forms of life''.

===Constructivism in philosophy of science===
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice and changes in [[Paradigm shift|"paradigms"]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn2&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions |url=http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |author=Thomas S Kuhn |year=1966 |isbn=0226458121 |edition=2nd&lt;!--the 2nd edition is "enlarged" from the 1st, by addition of a postscript--&gt; |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=A paradigm governs, in the first instance, not a subject matter but rather a group of practitioners. Any study ... must begin by locating the responsible group or groups. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173641/http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican "revolution"]] replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.
{{quote|"But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. ... A decision of that kind can only be made on faith."|Thomas Kuhn|''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', pp 157-8}}

The view of reality as accessible only through models was called [[model-dependent realism]] by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]].&lt;ref name=Koonin&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |author=Eugene V. Koonin |publisher=FT Press Science, a division of Pearson Education, Inc |isbn=013262317X |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}
&lt;/ref&gt; While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent  realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.&lt;ref name=Mlodinow&gt;
{{Cite book |quote=We shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such ...theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather we are free to use whichever model is the most convenient. |title=The Grand Design |author=Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0553907077 |page=8 |year=2011 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiment.

In the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to "represent" social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.

===Constructivism and psychology===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
In [[psychology]], constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as [[education]] and [[psychotherapy]]), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the "associationist" postulate of empiricism, "by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality."&lt;ref name="Balbi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Balbi |first=Juan |date=2008 |title=Epistemological and theoretical foundations of constructivist cognitive therapies: post-rationalist developments |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–27 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205138/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In contrast, "constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding".&lt;ref name="Balbi"/&gt;{{rp|16}}
The constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raskin |first=Jonathan D. |date=Spring 2002 |title=Constructivism in psychology: personal construct psychology, radical constructivism, and social constructionism |journal=American Communication Journal |volume=5 |issue=3 |url=http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090209035603/http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivism and education===
{{Main|Constructivism (philosophy of education)}}

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a [[critical pedagogy|critical pedagogical]] perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.

Kincheloe's characteristics of critical constructivism:

*Knowledge is socially constructed: World and information co-construct one another
*Consciousness is a social construction
*Political struggles: Power plays an exaggerated role in the production of knowledge and consciousness
*The necessity of understanding consciousness—even though it does not lend itself to traditional reductionistic modes of measurability
*The importance of uniting logic and emotion in the process of knowledge and producing knowledge
*The inseparability of the knower and the known
*The centrality of the perspectives of oppressed peoples—the value of the insights of those who have suffered as the result of existing social arrangements
*The existence of multiple realities: Making sense of a world far more complex that we originally imagined
*Becoming humble knowledge workers: Understanding our location in the tangled web of reality
*Standpoint epistemology: Locating ourselves in the web of reality, we are better equipped to produce our own knowledges
*Constructing practical knowledge for critical social action
*Complexity: Overcoming reductionism
*Knowledge is always entrenched in a larger process
*The centrality of interpretation: Critical hermeneutics
*The new frontier of classroom knowledge: Personal experiences intersecting with pluriversal information
*Constructing new ways of being human: Critical ontology

===Constructivism and postmodernism===
For some{{who?|date=October 2017}} [[social constructionism]] has been described as a source of the [[postmodern movement]], and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to [[social constructionism]].

From a realist's point of view, both [[postmodernism]] and constructivism can be interpreted as [[relativism|relativist]] theories.

==Constructivist trends==

===Cultural constructivism===
Cultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.

===Radical constructivism===
{{See also|Francisco Varela|Humberto Maturana|Heinz von Foerster}}
[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to "link up" specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what "actually" occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but "circularly conjoined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalconstructivism.com|title=Radical Constructivism|author=|date=|website=www.radicalconstructivism.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419043612/http://radicalconstructivism.com/|archivedate=19 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' is a free online journal publishing peer reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.

===Relational constructivism===
{{main|Relational constructivism}}
[[Relational constructivism]] can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. ''self referentially operating cognition''). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. [[Björn Kraus]] puts it in a nutshell:

{{Zitat|„It is substantial for relational constructivism that it basically originates from an epistemological point of view, thus from the subject and its construction processes. Coming from this perspective it then focusses on the (not only social, but also material) relations under which these cognitive construction processes are performed. Consequently, it‘s not only about social construction processes, but about cognitive construction processes performed under certain relational conditions.“&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, {{cite web |url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044520/http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |archivedate=2017-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical constructivism===
A series of articles published in the journal ''Critical Inquiry'' (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the [[natural science]]s.   Not only truth and reality, but also "[[evidence]]", "[[document]]", "[[experience]]", "[[fact]]", "proof", and other central categories of empirical research (in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[statistics]], [[history]], [[law]], etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a "realist" or "rationalist" interpretation is subjected to criticism.  Kincheloe's political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.

While recognizing the constructedness of reality, many representatives of this critical paradigm deny philosophy the task of the creative construction of reality.  They eagerly criticize realistic judgments, but they do not move beyond analytic procedures based on subtle [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].  They thus remain in the critical paradigm and consider it to be a standard of scientific philosophy per se.

===Genetic epistemology===
{{main|Genetic epistemology}}
[[James Mark Baldwin]] invented this expression, which was later popularized by [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.

==Criticisms==
Numerous criticisms have been leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to [[relativism]]. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially "constructed" (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads to the charge of [[Self-refuting idea|self-refutation]]: if what is to be regarded as "true" is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of [[truth]] must itself be only regarded as being "true" in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.

Another criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.

Social Constructivists{{Who|date=July 2009}} often argue that constructivism is liberating because it either (1) enables oppressed groups to reconstruct "the World" in accordance with their own interests rather than according to the interests of dominant groups in society, or (2) compels people to respect the alternative worldviews of oppressed groups because there is no way of judging them to be inferior to dominant worldviews. As the [[Wittgenstein]]ian philosopher [[Gavin Kitching]]&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, G. 2008. ''The Trouble with Theory: The Educational Costs of Postmodernism''. Penn State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues, however, constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a [[deterministic]] view of language which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just "constructed" by language on this view, but are literally "determined" by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.

'''Creativity''' (formerly known as '''The Church of the Creator''' and '''World Church of the Creator''') is a [[Naturalistic pantheism|pantheistic]] [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]], [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] [[Religion|religion]] which has been classified as a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=10 February 2017|title=The Creativity Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Lighthouse Point, Florida]] by [[Ben Klassen]] as the Church of the Creator in 1973. The worldview of Creativity is purported to be based on the "survival, expansion and advancement of the White race",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-12/magazine/tm-915_1_hate-groups&lt;/ref&gt; according to the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense"&lt;ref&gt;Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the movement believe in a "racial holy war"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/church-creator-timeline&lt;/ref&gt; between the "white and non-White races" (including [[Jews]], [[black people]] and non-white people of "mixed race").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/297/662/505536/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: Issues and Tactics, page 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Adherents of Creativity are known as ''Creators''. The church was originally founded as the ''Church of the Creator'' by Ben Klassen in 1973. [[Matthew F. Hale]] in 1996 formed a separate group known as the ''World Church of the Creator'' which largely supplanted the original Ben Klassen Church. The World Church of the Creator which – as of 2003 – has devolved into ''The Creativity Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rights to use the name "Church of the Creator" was lost by Hale in the United States to the [[Church of the Creator]], an unaffiliated religious organization based in [[Ashland, Oregon]], in a trademark-infringement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 3, 2000 |quote=[4] The names "Creativity" and "Creator" are derived from the foreword of the first edition of ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' by Ben Klassen. It states, "We call our religion Creativity, and members thereof, Creators, because, we believe these words, in essence, best describe the characteristic soul of the White Race."A church based in Oregon filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Chicago against the World Church of the Creator, led by white supremacist Matthew Hale of Downstate East Peoria. |title=Church Sues Hale's Group Over Trademark |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-03/news/0005030331_1_white-supremacist-matthew-hale-world-church-trademark |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter=Foreword |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the Creativity movement is restricted to persons whose genetic heritage is "wholly or predominantly" from Europe or members of the white race, regardless of where they reside.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Creator" does not refer to a [[Creator deity|supernatural being]], but to adherents of Creativity and the White Race (which is credited with the creation of civilization).

Following the demise of the World Church of the Creator after Hale's arrest in 2003, there formed two distinct groups known as The Creativity Movement and the Creativity Alliance/Church of Creativity. The two groups are not known to interact with one another.

==Beliefs==
Creators are taught to hate non-whites and to avoid interacting with them socially. Creators are also expected to refute [[homosexuality]], [[miscegenation]], whining or complaining, and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014254/http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has sixteen race-based commandments and five fundamental beliefs which members regard as based on the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense". These include the belief that "race is their religion", that the white race is "nature's finest", belief that race-loyalty is transcendent and that the "survival, expansion and advancement" of the white race on Earth is the "highest virtue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] is becoming "more decadent," as evidenced by "black crimes, the growing acceptance of homosexuality, interracial marriage, increasing drug use, and the lack of racial identity among white people".&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], members believe that [[Jewish people]] are working towards the enslavement of all races, and in particular the "mongrelization of the white race". Creators are encouraged to recite the "five fundamentals" daily.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Klassen encouraged Creators to refer to [[Black people]] as "[[nigger]]s" and openly opposed white supremacists who used more polite terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Baofu |first1 = Peter|year = 2009 |title = The Future of Post-Human Creative Thinking |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fPcYBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages = 225-226 |access-date = 2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 2000s, they were encouraged to move to [[Central Illinois]] in order to establish a Creativity bastion.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"/&gt; 

Creativity promotes a religious diet and health doctrine, called the 14 Points of Salubrious Living (a form of [[Raw veganism|raw-food veganism]]), although it is not a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |title=The Little White Book: Fundamentals of the White Racial Religion Creativity for Daily Reading and Affirmation of the White Faith |editor=Victor Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

===Heaven, hell and the supernatural===
Creativity is a non-supernatural religion which rejects the [[supernatural]] while affirming a pantheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/racism/white-supremacy.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |website=PublicEye.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; view of nature, asserting that "everything is in nature" and defining it as "the whole cosmos, the total universe, including its millions of natural laws through space and time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter= The Laws of Nature Are Eternal |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Klassen, "A Creator is not superstitious and disdains belief in the supernatural. He will waste no time giving credence to, or playing silly games with imaginary spooks, spirits, gods and demons." Creators do not believe in a supernatural afterlife believing "immortality" to be genetic and memorial with a [[Eternal oblivion|cessation of consciousness]] at death. They believe that they should view [[Biological process|life]] and [[death]] on Earth in a "rational, fearless manner," concentrating on life's positive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/wmb-59.html | title = Life, Death and Immortality | publisher = Creativity movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial socialism===
The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Creativity's ideology as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite web |title=The Creativity Movement | url =http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/the-creativity-movement-0 |work=splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klassen, Creativity is not a rehash of Nazism and he listed eight differences between his political ideology and that of the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Little White Book | author = Ben Klassen | date = 1991 | publisher = Church of the Creator | chapter = 13. Creativity Unique}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the phrase "racial socialism" to describe his political ideology. Klassen was critical of [[democracy]] and advocated [[meritocracy]], believing that effective leaders should rule. Under racial socialism, "whites would work together toward common goals but without the massive economic planning in the style of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Gosplan]]." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michael |first=George |title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator |publisher = University Press of Florida |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3350-1}}{{Page needed|date = January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a limited [[market economy]], believing that social and economic activities should be in the best interests of white people. Klassen criticized "leftist proclivities" to recruit from the white working class: "All [white] members of the national or racial community ... had an important role to play."&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;

Klassen urged Creators to "work feverishly and aggressively to organize politically, to distribute literature on behalf of the White Race, to promote and foster White solidarity, and to get control of the government and the political machinery of the state by legal means if possible. If this is not possible by legal means, then we must resort to the same means as our forefathers used two hundred years ago to defend their liberty, their property, their homes and their families."{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Activism===
Creativity advocates [[proselytism]]. Its goal is to place 10 million copies of two books, ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' and ''The White Man's Bible'', into the hands of white people as part of its belief in "gird[ing] up for total war".{{cn|date=February 2017}} It teaches the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] in support of its perception that shifting population demographics is leading to [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Hate Crimes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara|title=Hate Crimes|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=The Victims of Hate Crime 37, Hate Crime Offenders 31}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], the Creativity Movement opposes illegal activity and violence, believing it to be counterproductive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The church's member handbook threatens expulsion from the church for members who commit crimes or encourage others to do so. Despite this, the church has been connected to multiple religiously and racially inspired violent crimes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc2.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators view "racial holy war" (Rahowa) as a [[religious war]] of racial self-defense.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=B. A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement: Church Practices |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''White Man's Bible'' calls for readers to, "use any means, legal or otherwise, available to us for our own survival," leading to the hunting down and eliminating of "tormentors".&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;

==Practices==
{{primary|section|date=March 2018}}

===Ceremonies===
{{anchor|Religious ceremonies}}
Creativity has four sacraments: marriage, pledging for children, confirmation, and eulogizing the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Ben Klassen |title=The Little White Book | publisher = Church of the Creator | date = 1991 | chapter = 25. The Creator Wedding Ceremony," "26. The Creator Child Pledging Ceremony," "27. Ceremony of Confirmation ," "28. The Saying of Goodbyes to our Departed Brethren }}&lt;/ref&gt; All ceremonies are performed by church ministers. At a wedding, the bride and groom exchange vows before Nature. The pledging ceremony is ideally conducted a week after a child's birth, with both parents pledging to raise their child as a "loyal member of the White Race and faithful to the church." The confirmation ceremony may be performed on or after a child's 13th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, B. A |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement |website=religioustolerance.org |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
{{anchor|Ordained ministers}}
On a now-defunct website, Klassen stated that anyone could be an ordained minister in his church, provided they were "a legitimate White Man or Woman over the age of 16."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D69%26Itemid%3D79 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426080729/http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=79 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective ministers must demonstrate worthiness and pass written and oral examinations. The written exams consist of 150 questions (requiring a one-paragraph response to each) and an essay. Applicants are encouraged to request recommendations from three established ministers, and the final requirement is the signing of an [[oath]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"/&gt;

==Books==
{{anchor|Religious texts|''White Man's Bible''}}
Creativity's founding text is ''Nature's Eternal Religion'', which was written by Klassen in 1973. The book proposes that white people are the "supreme act of creation", and only white people are capable of divine creativity.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror_99.pdf | title = Terrorism in the United States | year = 1999 | place = US | publisher = Justice Department, FBI | page = 4 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book critiques [[Christianity]], including the [[Christian Bible]]. Many biblical stories, including those of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Jonah]] and the whale and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], are considered historically unlikely. The [[historicity of Jesus]] is also questioned, with Klassen saying that he can find no independent evidence of his existence.&lt;ref name=compass&gt;{{cite news |title= World Church of Creator founded in 1973 | url= http://helenair.com/news/national/article_5773df3b-088c-5698-85d6-b1cf64811cf5.html |newspaper= Helena Independent Record |date= March 27, 2004 |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creativity, Christianity is a violent religion which has killed 1,000 fellow Christians for every Christian killed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt; Adherents do not believe in the existence of [[Jesus]], rejecting Christian teachings as a "suicidal poison" that was created by Jews and foisted on the white race. They reject the exhortation to love one's enemies, believing that enemies should be hated. Creators also reject the [[Golden Rule]], saying that it does not make "good sense" and at a "closer look" it is a "completely unworkable principle."&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt;

Klassen published other books on his white supremacist philosophy, including ''The White Man's Bible'', which called for violence against any perceived threats to white people.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

=={{anchor|Early years}}History==
Creativity was formed in 1973, when Klassen self-published ''Nature's Eternal Religion''. He attempted to recruit neo-Nazis into the church because, apart from disagreements over religion, there was no fundamental conflict between church doctrine and [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. Klassen developed a rapport with [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] leader [[William Luther Pierce]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Michael | first = George | title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator | page = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; he met Pierce twice in 1975, and they maintained an "on and off" relationship for the next 18 years. According to Klassen, he "never did understand the logic of what [Pierce] called his [[Cosmotheism]] religion ... it has not been of any significance as far as our common goal of promoting White racial solidarity was concerned."{{cn|date=February 2017}} In ''Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs'', Klassen called Pierce "a great man and an outstanding intellectual thinker, and ... one of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Klassen | first = Ben | title = Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs | page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Klassen established a Creativity headquarters in [[Otto, North Carolina]]. Although his family expected resistance from local residents, Klassen wrote: "We were not quite prepared for the viciousness of the onslaught by the local paper." Opposition grew, and a May 13, 1982 ''Franklin Press'' headline read: "Pro-Hitler, anti-Christ Leader Headquarters Here".&lt;ref&gt;Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013}}

===Matthew F. Hale===
{{main article|Matthew F. Hale}}
Several years after Klassen's 1993 death, white supremacist Matthew Hale founded the New Church of the Creator (later the World Church of the Creator). Hale made national news when he was denied admission to the Illinois State Bar three times due to his racist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evan Osnos]] and James Janega. "ACLU Sides With Supremacist on Right to Obtain Law License." Chicago Tribune 12 Aug. 1999: 4.

Johannes Grobbelaar and Jurgen White, [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] Creators and members of the National Socialist Partisans (the paramilitary branch of the [[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging]]), were killed in a November 1991 gun battle with South African police near [[Upington]] while attempting to smuggle weapons and explosives into a survivalist compound in [[Namibia]]. They were stopped by police, who were suspicious that their vehicle had been stolen. According to the report, while being escorted to a nearby police station they detonated a smoke bomb and attempted to escape. Police discovered their abandoned vehicle five miles away; Grobbelaar and  White ambushed them. Two officers were shot, one fatally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/media/1996/9607/s960717e.htm |title=SAPA – 17 July 96 – FEARS OF COMMUNISTS PROMPTED BRUTAL MURDERS: |publisher=Justice.gov.za |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ron McVan===
Ron McVan, co-founder of the [[Wotansvolk]] [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch]] pagan group, was once affiliated with the Church of the Creator for two years as its second-in-command;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.html |title=David Lane |website=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVan contributed articles and artwork to its periodical, ''Racial Loyalty'', and was a martial-arts instructor for the church. Although Klassen and McVan shared anti-Christian beliefs, McVan sought a more spiritual approach and felt that Creativity needed spirituality. He moved to the Pacific Northwest and founded Wotan's Kindred in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1992, saying that the group was rooted in the "genetic character and collective identity" of the white race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;pg=PA274|year=2003|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|authorlink=Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|title=Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0340-3|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|authorlink=Mattias Gardell|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIwwWSSL5JIC&amp;pg=PA222|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3071-7|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McVan's associate and co-founder of Wotansvolk [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] drew inspiration from Creativity, particularly ideas of a "racial religion", but didn't agree with Creativity's "atheistic" stance and considered himself [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobratz|first1=Betty A.|last2=Shanks-Meile|first2=Stephanie L.|title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!"|date=1997|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801865374|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Christopher Gibbs===
William Christopher Gibbs, a Church of Creativity adherent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and a member of the Creativity Alliance, was arrested for possession of the biological toxin [[Ricin#Chemical or biological warfare agent|ricin]]. Gibbs went to a hospital after he accidentally got the ricin on his hands while experimenting with it.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleary |first=Tom |url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/william-christopher-gibbs-georgia-white-supremacist-ricin-poison-photos-facebook-church-creativity/ |title=William Christopher Gibbs: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |website=Heavy.com |date=2017-02-09 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 21, 2018, a Federal judge ordered Gibbss' release from Federal custody because of a technicality: ricin had been inexplicably dropped from the list of illegal biological toxins which are known as "select agents" due to changes in the 2004 law and edits to regulations in 2005. The judge did not rule out the possibility that Gibbs could be potentially convicted under another Federal law.  Gibbs continued to be incarcerated in the [[Fannin County, Georgia]] jail under a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct which stemmed from his 2017 arrest and a probation violation connected to a 2010 conviction for burglary.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, Chris (October 2, 2018) [https://www.myajc.com/news/crime--law/ricin-charges-dropped-against-georgia-white-supremacist/0GWcj07MLSMvcthfnApsWM/ "Ricin charges dropped against Georgia white supremacist"] ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before and during McCarty's leadership, Creativity was plagued with legal problems; members were arrested for conspiracy, unlawful firearms possession and their association with the July 1993 firebombing of an [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] building in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930730&amp;slug=1713586|title=Business {{!}} FBI Says Bombing Of Naacp Just A Start -- Suspects Planned Racial Rampage, Court Papers Allege {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarty struggled to keep the group unified. The lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), seeking damages related to the May 1991 murder of Harold Mansfield, Jr. by Creator George Loeb, finally led to a March 1994 court ruling which fined the Church of the Creator $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/wcotc.html|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also ruled that Klassen's property sale to Pierce shortly before his suicide was collusion to deny payment to Mansfield's family, ordering Pierce to return his $85,000 profit from the resale of the property. With the church unable to pay the outstanding balance, the SPLC sued for its dissolution to settle the remaining damages and McCarty readily agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of State, Document # 237320644&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity Movement===
[[File:Trademarked logo of the creativity movement.jpg|thumb|alt=Letter W, crown and halo inside a black circle|Creativity Movement logo]]
Matthew F. Hale founded the New Church of the Creator in 1996 – later renamed the World Church of the Creator. Hale's World Church of the Creator was a new and separate group rather than a direct successor to Ben Klassen's Church of the Creator. Until his arrest in 2003, Hale was the only Pontifex Maximus of the now defunct World Church of the Creator. The current group known as The Creativity Movement is a [[white power skinhead]] oriented direct successor to Hale's World Church of the Creator.

Headquartered in [[Zion, Illinois]], with a heavy concentration of Creators in [[Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement |title=The Creativity Movement &amp;#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |website=Splcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 24 regional branches, it also claims to have local branches and members "all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc.htm | title = The Creativity Movement |publisher=Religious tolerance | accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the Oregon-based TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the Creator for using the name "Church of the Creator", since the Oregon group had trademarked and registered the name in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=64 | title=What's in a Name? | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=Winter 2002 |accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow ruled for the World Church of the Creator.&lt;ref name=SPLC2003&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/world-church-creator-turmoil-after-leader-matt-hale-imprisoned|title=World Church of the Creator in Turmoil After Leader Matt Hale Arrested|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=April 15, 2003|last1=Beirich|first1=Heidi|last2=Potok|first2=Mark|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=60 | title=Creator Crack-Up | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=Winter 2002 |accessdate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002, the World Church of the Creator was fined $1,000 for each day it continued using the old name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.adl.org/learn/news/WCOTC_1000.asp | title = White Supremacist Group Fined $1,000 a Day | publisher = The Anti-Defamation League | date = May 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hale church fined on trademark; U.S. judge sets penalty until it stops using name |author=Shia Kapos, Tribune staff reporter |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=April 25, 2003 |page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further appeals were denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.churchofthecreator.org/TM/7th%20Circuit%20Opinion%20of%20July%2025,%202002.pdf |title=Appeals Court ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://openjurist.org/297/f3d/662/te-ta-ma-truth-foundation-family-of-uri-inc-v-world-church-of-the-creator|title=297 F3d 662 Te-Ta-Ma Truth Foundation Family of Uri Inc v.

[[California]] [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] [[Maxine M. Chesney]] ruled against an imprisoned Creator who brought a suit against [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] based on an alleged violation of the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] in ''Conner v. Tilton'', 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111892 (ND CA, Dec. 2, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/white-supremacy-group-doesnt-qualify-as-religion |title=White-supremacy group doesn’t qualify as religion &amp;#124; First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition |website=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Creativity and several other organizations and belief systems (including [[MOVE]], [[veganism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/what-makes-a-religion-a-religion-under-law |title=What Makes a Religion a Religion Under Law? |website=Worldreligionnews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church of Marijuana) were declared to not constitute "religions" but [[morality|moral]] or [[secular ethics|secular philosophies]] under the definition of [[religion]] based on addressing of "fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexis.com/xlink?showcidslinks=on&amp;ORIGINATION_CODE=00142&amp;searchtype=get&amp;search=2009%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20111892%20%20 ]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a three-point test for determining religion developed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]. The court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue about whether Creativity is a religion; it found that to the extent Creativity deals with a "fundamental concern", the concern is with [[secular]] matters and not with what the court considered to be religious principles. Creativity is not "comprehensive" in nature because it was presented as confined to one question (or moral teaching), and that the structural characteristics of Creativity "do not serve to transform what are otherwise secular teachings and ideals into a religious ideology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1467028.html |title=Kaufman V.

==Leafletting campaigns==
In March 2015, leaflets were posted on doors in southern [[Liverpool]] in the United Kingdom saying: "The white race is nature’s finest". Cailen Cambeul, Creativity minister and then Pontifex Maximus for the Creativity Alliance, said that he was responsible for their distribution. Complaints were made to the police by local councilors. Sarah Jennings of the local [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] denounced Creativity as a "fringe group of blatant racists".&lt;ref name="Echo" /&gt; According to Cambeul, "Any politician claiming disgust at our flyers and seeking to make political gains via our 100-percent-legal message is partaking in an opportunistic abuse of power at the expense of innocent people exercising their rights to speak out against the injustices of a politically correct world."&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaflet claiming "the white race is nature's finest" slammed after being delivered in south Liverpool|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/leaflet-claiming-the-white-race-8907506|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, northwest Montana and in particular the [[Flathead Valley]], part-time home of [[Alt-Right]] leader [[Richard B. Spencer]] has seen a "flurry of racist fliers" promoting the Creativity movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://flatheadbeacon.com/2017/11/21/flurry-racist-fliers-prompts-concern/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] listed Creativity Alliance presence in the state in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-neo-nazi-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhāraṇā''' (from [[Sanskrit]] धारणा) is translated as "collection or concentration of the mind (joined with the retention of breath)", or "the act of holding, bearing, wearing, supporting, maintaining, retaining, keeping back (in remembrance), a good memory", or "firmness, steadfastness, ... , certainty".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit-English Dictionary by [[Monier Monier-Williams]], (c) 1899&lt;/ref&gt; This term is related to the verbal root ''dhri'' to hold, carry, maintain, resolve. Dharana is the noun.

''Dhāraṇā'' is the sixth stage, step or limb of eight elucidated by [[Patanjali]]'s Ashtanga Yoga or [[Raja Yoga]].  For a detailed account of the Eight Limbs, refer to the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeking Samadhi|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/seeking-samadhi/|journal= Yoga Journal|date = 29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dhāraṇā'' may be translated as "holding", "holding steady", "concentration" or "single focus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dharana|url=http://yoga.iloveindia.com/limbs-of-yoga/dharana.html|journal=yoga.iloveindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prior limb [[Pratyahara]] involves withdrawing the senses from external phenomena. ''Dhāraṇā'' builds further upon this by refining it further to ''ekagrata'' or ''ekagra chitta'', that is single-pointed concentration and focus, which is in this context cognate with [[Samatha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Yoga System|url=http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/yoga/yoga_11.html|journal=swami-krishnananda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maehle (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;234) defines Dharana as: "The mind thinks about one object and avoids other thoughts; awareness of the object is still interrupted."

''Dhāraṇā'' is the initial step of deep concentrative meditation, where the object being focused upon is held in the mind without consciousness wavering from it. The difference between ''Dhāraṇā'', [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyāna]], and [[Samādhi]] (their "integration" constituting [[Samyama]]) is that in the former, the object of meditation, the mystic, and the act of meditation itself remain separate.  That is, the mystic or the mystic's meta-awareness is conscious of meditating (that is, is conscious of the act of meditation) on an object, and of one's own self, which is concentrating on the object. As the seer becomes more advanced, dwelling in the subsequent stage of Dhyāna, consciousness of the act of meditation disappears, and only the consciousness of being/existing and the object of concentration register (in the mind). In the final stage of Samādhi, the ego-mind also dissolves, and the seer becomes one with the object. Generally, the object of concentration is [[God]], or the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]], which is seen as an expression of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dharana (Yoga of concentration)|url=http://www.yogateacher.com/text/yoga/essays/dharana.html|journal=yogateacher.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302021515/http://www.yogateacher.com/text/yoga/essays/dharana.html|archivedate=2015-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Duke#China|Duke]] of Yansheng''', literally "Duke Overflowing with Sagacity", sometimes translated as '''Holy Duke of Yen''', was a [[Chinese nobility|Chinese title of nobility]]. It was originally created as a marquis title in the [[Western Han dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 9) for a direct descendant of [[Confucius]].&lt;ref name="McNicholas2007"/&gt;

From the Western Han dynasty to the mid-[[Northern Song dynasty]] (960–1127), the title underwent several changes in its name, before it was finally settled as "Duke Yansheng" in 1005 by [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]] of the Northern Song dynasty. [[Kong Zongyuan]], a 46th-generation descendant of Confucius, became the first person to hold the title "Duke Yansheng".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/16/content_7616027.htm |title=Updated Confucius family tree has two million members |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dukes enjoyed privileges that other nobles were denied, such as the right to tax their domain in [[Qufu]] while being exempt from imperial taxes. Their dukedom had its own judicial system and the legal capacity to mete out capital punishment, although such sentences had to be ratified by the imperial court.

In 1935, the [[Nationalist government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] converted the Duke Yansheng title to a political office, "Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan" (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which simply means "'''Sacrificial Official to Confucius'''". This political office is not only hereditary, but also had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the [[government of the Republic of China]]. In 2008, with permission from the Kong family, the political office became an unpaid one which is purely ceremonial in nature. It is currently held by [[Kung Tsui-chang]], a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius.

There are also similar political offices for the descendants of the other notable members of the [[Confucianism|Confucian school]] (the [[Four Sages]]), such as "Sacrificial Official to [[Mencius]]", "Sacrificial Official to [[Zengzi]]", and "Sacrificial Official to [[Yan Hui]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2009-07-23/101716000328s.shtml|title=台湾儒家奉祀官将改为无给职 不排除由女子继任_新闻中心_新浪网|website=news.sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.rfi.fr/actucn/articles/115/article_15023.asp|title=台湾拟减少儒家世袭奉祀官职位并取消俸禄|website=[[Radio France Internationale]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.xuite.net/ahhsiang/TYDA/20446373-【文史雜記】大成至聖先師奉祀官&lt;/ref&gt; In the reformation of the law in 2009, "Sacrificial Official to [[Mencius]]" and "Sacrificial Official to [[Zengzi]]" would become unpaid honorable titles as well once the incumbent officials decease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://city.udn.com/54543/3538727|title=制度變革／奉祀官改無給職 可有女官 - 民生戰線 - udn城市|website=city.udn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tombs of the Dukes Yansheng of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties are located at the [[Cemetery of Confucius]] in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&amp;K=a&amp;A=71&amp;rec=442&amp;run=13 孔林: 墓葬] (Cemetery of Confucius: Burials)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kong Qiu (551–479 BC), better known as [[Confucius]], was a teacher, politician and philosopher of the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]] in the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of ancient China. He was a descendant of the royal family of the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1558–1046 BC) through the dukes of the [[Song (state)|State of Song]] (11th century – 286 BC).

===Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and the Western and Eastern Han dynasties (206 BC – 220 AD)===
During the reign of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 247–210 BC), the First Emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], Kong Fu (孔鮒), a ninth-generation descendant of Confucius, was awarded the title "Lord Wentong of [[Lu (state)|Lu]]" (魯國文通君) and the appointment of ''shaofu'' (少傅).

In 190 BC, [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]] of the [[Han dynasty]] awarded the title "Lord Fengsi" (奉祀君; "Lord Who Offers Sacrifices") to Kong Teng (孔騰), Kong Fu's younger brother.

During the reign of [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] (r. 48–33 BC), Kong Ba (孔霸), a 13th-generation descendant of Confucius, was granted the title "Lord Baocheng" (褒成君). In addition, the income gained from the 800 taxable households in Kong Ba's fief were used to finance the worshipping of Confucius. Kong Ba also instructed his eldest son, Kong Fu (孔福), to return to their [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] to serve as a sacrificial official to their ancestor.

The title "Marquis&lt;ref name="McNicholas2007"/&gt; Yinshaojia" (殷紹嘉侯) was conferred on Kong Ji (孔吉),&lt;ref name="IdemaZèurcher1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilt Lukas Idema|author2=Erik Zèurcher|title=Thought and Law in Qin and Han China: Studies Dedicated to Anthony Hulsewâe on the Occasion of His Eightieth Birthday|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZo3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=marquis+baocheng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hZrNsu7MAhXSDj4KHarhCyQQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=marquis%20baocheng&amp;f=false|year=1990|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-09269-2|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 14th-generation [[Dishu system|''di'']] descendant of Confucius, by 
[[Emperor Cheng of Han|Emperor Cheng]] (r. 33–7 BC). The emperor also allowed Kong Ji to perform ritual sacrifices to [[Tang of Shang|Cheng Tang]], the first king of the [[Shang dynasty]], and granted him the ''er wang san ke'' (二王三恪) ceremonial privilege.

During the reign of [[Emperor Ping of Han|Emperor Ping]] (r. 1 BC – 6 AD), granted the title "Marquis Baocheng" (褒成侯) to Kong Jun (孔均), a 16th-generation descendant of Confucius.&lt;ref name="Yao2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=The Encyclopedia of Confucianism: 2-volume set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOc4CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=marquis+baocheng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hZrNsu7MAhXSDj4KHarhCyQQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marquis%20baocheng&amp;f=false|date=11 May 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-79348-9|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yao2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=RoutledgeCurzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p06wlKoLcDIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=marquis+baocheng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hZrNsu7MAhXSDj4KHarhCyQQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=marquis%20baocheng&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=978-0-415-30652-2|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor An of Han|Emperor An]] (r. 106–125 AD) gave the title "Marquis of Fengsheng Village" (奉聖亭侯) to Kong Yao (孔曜),&lt;ref name="Crespigny2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rafe de Crespigny|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA393&amp;dq=marquis+baocheng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hZrNsu7MAhXSDj4KHarhCyQQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=marquis%20baocheng&amp;f=false|date=28 December 2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-1184-0|pages=393–}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 19th-generation descendant of Confucius.

This practice was referred to as [[w:zh:二王三恪|二王三恪]].

===Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD) through Northern and Southern dynasties era (420–589)===
During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the state of [[Cao Wei]] (220–265) renamed the title "Marquis Baocheng" (褒成侯) to "Marquis Zongsheng" (宗聖侯).

The [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] (265–420) and [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] (420–479) dynasties changed the title to "Marquis of Fengsheng Village" (奉聖亭侯).

The [[Northern Wei|Northern Wei dynasty]] (386–535) changed the title to "Marquis Chongsheng" (崇聖侯) while the [[Northern Qi|Northern Qi dynasty]] (550–577) called it "Marquis Gongsheng" (恭聖侯). Under the [[Northern Zhou|Northern Zhou dynasty]] (557–581), the title was promoted from a marquis title to a ducal title, "Duke of Zou" (鄒國公).

A fief of 100 households and the rank of 崇聖侯 ''Marquis who worships the sage'' was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui's lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius's lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of  崇聖大夫 ''Grandee who venerates the sage'' was bestowed on 孔乘 Kong Sheng who was Confucius's scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.&lt;ref name="LagerweyLü2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi Lü|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 Ad)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=30 October 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17585-7|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LagerweyLü2009 2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi Lü|title=Early Chinese Religion, Part Two: The Period of Division (220-589 AD) (2 vols)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSawCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=23 November 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2929-6|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties===
In the [[Sui dynasty]], [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] (r. 581–604) awarded the title "Duke of Zou" (鄒國公) to Confucius's descendants, but [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] (r. 604–618) downgraded and renamed the title to "Marquis Shaosheng" (紹聖侯).

During the early [[Tang dynasty]], the title was renamed to "Marquis Baosheng" (褒聖侯). In the Kaiyuan era (713–741) of the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], the emperor posthumously honoured Confucius as "Prince Wenxuan" (文宣王)&lt;ref name="xin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhong yang yan jiu yuan.

During the [[Jin–Song Wars|wars]] between the Song dynasty and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], the Song capital, [[Kaifeng]], was conquered by Jin forces in 1127. Remnants of the Song dynasty retreated south and established the Southern Song dynasty, with [[Emperor Gaozong of Song|Emperor Gaozong]] (r. 1127–1162) as their ruler. Kong Duanyou (孔端友), who then held the Duke Yansheng title, also moved to the south and settled in [[Quzhou]], [[Zhejiang]], where the southern branch of Confucius's descendants was created. Kong Duancao (孔端操), Kong Duanyou's brother, remained in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]], where he called himself the "acting Duke Yansheng". Later on, the Jin dynasty recognised Kong Duancao's legitimacy.

===Yuan dynasty (1271–1368)===
From 1127 up to the [[Mongol people|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]], there were two Duke Yanshengs – one in [[Quzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] (in the south) and the other in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]] (in the north). In 1233, [[Ögedei Khan]] (r. 1229–1241) granted the Duke Yansheng title to Kong Yuancuo (孔元措), a 51st-generation descendant of Confucius from the northern branch.

[[Kublai Khan]] (r. 1260–1294) originally wanted to merge the two Duke Yanshengs under the southern one by making Kong Zhu (孔洙), the southern branch's leader, the legitimate successor to the Duke Yansheng line. However, since Kong Zhu declined the offer, Kublai Khan abolished the southern Duke Yansheng title and appointed Kong Zhu as the ''jijiu'' (祭酒) of the [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]]. Since then, the northern branch has remained as the "legitimate" heir to the Duke Yansheng line.&lt;ref name="npm.gov.tw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nation observes Confucius anniversary|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-09/29/content_699183.htm|agency=China Daily|date=2006-09-29 &lt;!-- 07:31 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Confucius Anniversary Celebrated|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2006/Sep/182656.htm|agency=China Daily|date=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B10 p. 14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/all/B10.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053840/http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/all/B10.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248653434_The_Ritual_Formation_of_Confucian_Orthodoxy_and_the_Descendants_of_the_Sage p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China (1912–present)===
After the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]], most of the nobility titles used in the imperial era were abolished. The Duke Yansheng title, however, was an exception along with the Marquis of Extended Grace and the descendants of Mencius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui. During the revolution, some Westerners were told that a [[Han Chinese]] would be installed as the emperor.

In 1913, the [[Beiyang government]], led by [[Yuan Shikai]], passed a law allowing the Duke Yansheng title to be retained and held by Kong Lingyi (孔令貽), a member of the northern branch. The Wujing Boshi title, on the other hand, was renamed to "Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan" (大成至聖先師南宗奉祀官) and held by Kong Qingyi (孔慶儀), a member of the southern branch.

Yuan Shikai conferred the title of Prince on the Duke immediately before declaring the [[Empire of China (1915–16)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/chinaherhistoryd00park|title=China, her history, diplomacy, and commerce, from the earliest times to the present day|first=Edward Harper|last=Parker|date=14 February 2018|publisher=N.Y. : Dutton|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regent for the underage Duke Kong Te-cheng was Kong Lingjun 孔令儁.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lishi.zhuixue.net/renwu/kangyouwei/26387.html|title=第22章 康有为与孔令儁_中国历史网|website=lishi.zhuixue.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Kong Family Mansion steward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Food Culture in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLPACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=23 July 2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-938368-27-1|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoWang2015 3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rongguang Zhao|author2=Gangliu Wang|author3=Aimee Yiran Wang|title=A History of Food Culture in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn3FCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-938368-28-8|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the [[Nationalist government]] abolished the hereditary peerage systems of the imperial era and converted the Duke Yansheng title into a political office, "Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan" (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which simply means "Sacrificial Official to Confucius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/99727/6936558.html|title=Confucius - People's Daily Online|website=english.people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Kung Te-cheng]] (Kong Decheng), the Sacrificial Official to Confucius, evacuated to [[Hankou]], [[Wuhan]], where he was received by [[H. H. Kung|Kung Hsiang-hsi]] (Kong Xiangxi), a fellow descendant of Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign News: Warlike Confucian|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=Jan 17, 1938|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758870,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to [[Chongqing]] later, where the Nationalist government was based during the war.

After the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Kung Te-cheng evacuated with the Nationalist government to Taiwan where the current Sacrificial Official to Confucius is based. Until 2008, the office of "Sacrificial Official to Confucius" had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the [[government of the Republic of China]] in Taiwan. On the other hand, Yan Shiyung (顏世鏞, the last Sacrificial Official to [[Yan Hui]], 1903-1975) and Kung Xiangkai (孔祥楷, the last Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan, 1938-) didn't move to Taiwan, so their title was abolished after the establishment of [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qfsq.com/news/view.asp?id=3694|title=曲阜市情网－第二章　　近现代名人|website=www.qfsq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%94%E7%A5%A5%E6%A5%B7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Taiwanese government demolished the office building of the sacrificial official but retained the appointment. The hostel of [[National Chung Hsing University]] along Guoguang Road in [[South District, Taichung|South District]], [[Taichung]] is situated at the former location of the office building.

In 2008, with approval from the Kong family, Taiwan's [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)|Ministry of the Interior]] converted the sacrificial official appointment into an unpaid one. The office is currently held by [[Kung Tsui-chang]] (Kong Chuichang), a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius who was appointed in September 2009 after the death of his grandfather, Kung Te-cheng. The Ministry of Interior also declared that female descendants of Confucius are eligible for future appointment.

The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day, and the title of . Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Confucius Anniversary Celebrated|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2006/Sep/182656.htm|agency=China Daily|date=September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the southern branch is 孔祥楷 (Kong Xiangkai), a 75th-generation descendant of Confucius.&lt;ref name="JansenKlein2014 3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Jansen|author2=Thoralf Klein|author3=Christian Meyer|title=Globalization and the Making of Religious Modernity in China: Transnational Religions, Local Agents, and the Study of Religion, 1800-Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=21 March 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27151-7|pages=189–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the descendants of Confucius use [[Generation name#Generation poem|generation poems]] for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors along with the descendants of the other [[Four Sages]] [[w:zh:四氏|四氏]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ 孔姓 (The Kong family, descendents of Confucius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010033/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 孟姓 (The Meng family, descendents of Mencius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116060231/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yan family, one of the Four Sages and descendants of [[Yanyuan]], didn't use the poem eventually because Yanyuan is considered to be a possible maternal cousin of Confucius, so [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming]] made another generation poem for Yan family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=颜子家世|last=|first=|publisher=齐鲁书社|year=1998|isbn=9787533307400|location=|pages=|language=Chinese|trans-title=Family of Yanyuan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among humanists he enjoyed the [[sobriquet]] "Prince of the Humanists", and has been called "the crowning glory of the Christian humanists".&lt;ref&gt;Latourette, Kenneth Scott. A History of Christianity. [[New York City|New York]]: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1953, p. 661.&lt;/ref&gt; Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new [[Vulgate|Latin]] and [[Biblical Greek|Greek]] editions of the [[New Testament]], which raised questions that would be influential in the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].  He also wrote ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio|On Free Will]],''&lt;ref&gt;Written to refute Martin Luther's doctrine of "enslaved will", according to [[Alister McGrath]], Luther believed that only Erasmus, of all his interlocutors, understood and appreciated the locus of his doctrinal emphases and reforms. {{cite book | title=Iustitia Dei | publisher=Cambridge University Press| author=McGrath, Alister | year=2012 | location=3.4: "Justification in Early Lutheranism" | pages=xiv+ 448 | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Praise of Folly|In Praise of Folly]]'', ''[[Handbook of a Christian Knight]]'', ''[[On Civility in Children]]'', ''[[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style]]'', ''[[Julius Excluded from Heaven|Julius Exclusus]]'', and many other works.

Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious [[Reformation]], but while he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Melanchthon]] and continued to recognise the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, rejecting Luther's emphasis on faith alone.  Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church all his life,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Hoffmann, "Faith and Piety in Erasmus's Thought," ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1989), 20#2, pp. 241–58&lt;/ref&gt;
remaining committed to reforming the Church and its clerics' abuses from within.  He also held to the Catholic doctrine of [[free will]], which some Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of [[predestination]].  His middle road ("[[Via Media]]") approach disappointed, and even angered, scholars in both camps.

Erasmus died suddenly in [[Basel]] in 1536 while preparing to return to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and was buried in [[Basel Minster]], the former cathedral of the city.&lt;ref name="Church 1924"&gt;"He tried to remain in the fold of the old [Roman] Church, after having damaged it seriously, and renounced the [Protestant] Reformation, and to a certain extent even Humanism, after having furthered both with all his strength".

Hopman and Barbara Flower; New York: Harper and Row, 1924), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze statue of Erasmus was erected in 1622 in his city of birth, replacing an earlier work in stone.

==Early life==
[[File:Erasmus(buste).jpg|thumb|upright|Bust by [[Hildo Krop]] (1950) at [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], where Erasmus spent his youth]]

According to an article by historian Renier Snooy (1478–1537), Erasmus was born in Gouda.

The exact year of his birth is controversial, but most agree it was in 1466.&lt;ref name="seop2009"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/erasmus/#LifWor | title= Desiderius Erasmus | publisher= [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]| work= Winter 2009 Edition| last= Nauert | first= Charles | accessdate=2012-02-10| quote=Erasmus was a native of the Netherlands, born at Rotterdam in the county of Holland on 27 October of some year in the late 1460s; 1466 now seems to be the year that most biographers prefer.

Information on his family and early life comes mainly from vague references in his writings. His parents were [[illegitimacy|not legally married]]. His father, Gerard, was a Catholic [[priest]] and [[curate]] in Gouda.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cornelius Augustijn, ''Erasmus: His life, work and influence'', University of Toronto, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of his mother, although her known name was Margaretha Rogerius (Latinized form of Dutch surname 'Rutgers')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05510b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; and she was the daughter of a doctor from [[Zevenbergen]]. She may have been Gerard's housekeeper.&lt;ref name="seop2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The famous 19th century novel ''[[The Cloister and the Hearth]]'', by [[Charles Reade]], is an account of the lives of Erasmus's parents.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was born [[out of wedlock]], Erasmus was cared for by his parents until their early deaths from the [[Black Death|plague]] in 1483. This solidified his view of his origin as a stain, and cast a pall over his youth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Erasmus was given the highest education available to a young man of his day, in a series of monastic or semi-monastic schools. At the age of nine, he and his older brother Peter were sent to one of the best Latin schools in the Netherlands, located at [[Deventer]] and owned by the chapter clergy of the Lebuïnuskerk (St Lebuin's Church),&lt;ref name="seop2009"/&gt; though some earlier biographies assert it was a school run by the [[Brethren of the Common Life]].&lt;ref name="seop2009"/&gt; During his stay there the curriculum was renewed by the principal of the school, [[Alexander Hegius von Heek|Alexander Hegius]]. For the first time ever Greek was taught at a lower level than a university in Europe, and this is where he began learning it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nissen: ''Geloven in de Lage landen; scharniermomenten in de geschiedenis van het christendom''. Davidsfonds/Leuven, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He also gleaned there the importance of [[The Imitation of Christ (book)|a personal relationship with God]] but eschewed the harsh rules and strict methods of the religious brothers and educators.  His education there ended when plague struck the city about 1483, and his mother, who had moved to provide a home for her sons, died from the infection.&lt;ref name="seop2009"/&gt;

==Ordination and monastic experience==

He took vows there in late 1488,&lt;ref name="xivxv"/&gt; and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priesthood]] at about the age of 25, in 1492.&lt;ref name="cmsmlw"&gt;Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. ''131 Christians Everyone Should Know''. Nashville: Holman Reference, 2000, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he never seemed to have actively worked as a priest for a longer time,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and certain abuses in [[religious order]]s were among the chief objects of his later calls to reform the Church from within.

While at Stein, Erasmus fell in love with a fellow canon, Servatius Rogerus,&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''A History of Christianity'', 2010, p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a series of passionate letters in which he called Rogerus "half my soul". He wrote, "I have wooed you both unhappily and relentlessly".&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Works of Erasmus'', vol. 1, p. 12 ([[Toronto]]: University of Toronto Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] (2003). ''[[Reformation: A History]]''. pg. 95. MacCulloch says "he fell in love" and further adds in a footnote "There has been much modern embarrassment and obfuscation on Erasmus and Rogerus, but see the sensible comment in J. Huizinga, ''Erasmus of Rotterdam'' (London, 1952), pp. 11–12, and from Geoffrey Nutuall, ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 26 (1975), 403"; However Harry Vredeveld argues that the letters are "surely expressions of true friendship", citing what Erasmus said to Grunnius: "It is not uncommon at [that] age to conceive passionate attachments [''fervidos amores''] for some of your companions".{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoCY-z-mhTcC |title=Collected Works of Erasmus |editor=Harry Vredeveld |others=Translated by Clarence H. Miller |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1993 |isbn=9780802028679 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correspondence contrasts sharply with the generally detached and much more restrained attitude he showed in his later life. Later, while tutoring in [[Paris]], he was suddenly dismissed by the guardian of Thomas Grey. Some have taken this as evidence of an illicit affair.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest Tyler Stevens, essay on 'Erasmus's 'Tigress': The Language of Friendship, Pleasure, and the Renaissance Letter', in ''Queering the Renaissance'', Duke University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; No personal denunciation was made of Erasmus during his lifetime, however, and he took pains in later life to distance these earlier episodes by condemning [[sodomy]] in his works, and praising sexual desire in marriage between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Rummel, ''Erasmus'', London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his priestly ordination, he got his chance to leave the canonry when offered the post of secretary to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Bishop of Cambrai]], Henry of Bergen, on account of his great skill in [[Latin language|Latin]] and his reputation as a [[man of letters]]. To allow him to accept that post, he was given a temporary [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from his religious vows on the grounds of poor health and love of Humanistic studies, though he remained a priest. [[Pope Leo X]] later made the dispensation permanent, a considerable privilege at the time.

==Education and scholarship==
[[File:Rotterdam standbeeld Erasmus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Erasmus in Rotterdam. It was created by [[Hendrick de Keyser]] in 1622, replacing a stone statue of 1557.]]

In 1495, with Bishop Henry's consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the [[University of Paris]], in the [[Collège de Montaigu]], a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Jan Standonck]], of whose rigors he complained. The University was then the chief seat of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] learning, but already coming under the influence of [[Renaissance]] humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], poet and "professor of humanity" in Paris.

The chief centres of Erasmus's activity were [[Paris]], [[Leuven]] (in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Belgium]]), [[England]], and Basel; yet he never belonged firmly in any one of these places. In 1499 he was invited back to England by [[William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy]], who offered to accompany him on his trip back to England. Erasmus was "ever susceptible to the charms of attractive, well-connected, and rich young men".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Penn, ''The Winter King'', Penguin, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: [[John Colet]], [[Thomas More]], [[John Fisher]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]].  At the [[University of Cambridge]], he was the [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]] and had the option of spending the rest of his life as an English [[professor]]. He stayed at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] from 1510 to 1515.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ERSS465D|name=Erasmus, Desiderius}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rooms were in the "I" staircase of Old Court, and he famously hated English ale and English weather.

Erasmus suffered from poor health and complained that Queens' could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). Until the early 20th-century, Queens' College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be "Erasmus' corkscrew" which was a third of a metre long, though today the college still has what it calls "Erasmus' chair".&lt;ref&gt;John Twigg, A History of Queens' College, Cambridge 1448–1986 (Woodbridge, Suff.: Boydell Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Today Queens' College has an Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. His legacy is marked for someone who complained bitterly about the lack of comforts and luxuries to which he was accustomed. As Queens' was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, [[Queens' College Old Library]] still houses many first editions of Erasmus' publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus' New Testament translation which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer [[Jan Laski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Library Collections|website=Queens' College Cambridge.

His friendship with Fisher is the reason he chose to stay at Queens' while lecturing in Greek at the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Askin|first=Lindsey|title=Erasmus and Queens' College, Cambridge|date=12 July 2013|url=http://queenslib.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/erasmus-and-queens-college/|website=Queens' Old Library Books Blog|publisher=Queenslib.wordpress.com|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first visit to England in 1499, he taught at the [[University of Oxford]]. Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of [[John Colet]] who pursued a style more akin to the [[church fathers]] than the [[Scholastics]]. This prompted him, upon his return from England, to master the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level and to prepare a new edition of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate|Bible translation]]. On one occasion he wrote to Colet: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"I cannot tell you, dear Colet, how I hurry on, with all sails set, to holy literature. How I dislike everything that keeps me back, or retards me".&lt;ref name = "cmsmlw"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging his friends to send him books and money for teachers in his letters.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga, Dutch edition, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery in 1506 of [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s ''New Testament Notes'' encouraged Erasmus to continue the study of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Erasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his freedom of intellect and literary expression. Throughout his life, he was offered positions of honor and profit in academia but declined them all, preferring the uncertain but sufficient rewards of independent literary activity. From 1506 to 1509, he was in Italy: in 1506 he graduated as [[Doctor of Divinity]] at the [[Turin]] [[University of Turin|University]], and he spent part of the time as a proofreader at the publishing house of [[Aldine Press|Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]]. According to his letters, he was associated with the Venetian natural philosopher, [[Giulio Camillo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterdami'', Ed. H.M.Allen, (Oxford University Press, 1937), Ep. 3032: 219–22; 2682: 8–13.&lt;/ref&gt; but, apart from this, he had a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.

His residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the [[Old University of Leuven|University]], exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform and the loose norms of the Renaissance adherents to which he was devoting his life. In 1517, he supported the foundation at the University, by his friend [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]], of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of [[Hebrew]], Latin, and Greek—after the model of the College of the Three Languages at the [[Complutense University of Madrid#Early history|University of Alcalá]]. However, feeling that the lack of sympathy which prevailed at Leuven at that time was actually a form of mental persecution, he sought refuge in Basel, where under the shelter of Swiss hospitality he could express himself freely. Admirers from all quarters of Europe visited him there and he was surrounded by devoted friends, notably developing a lasting association with the great publisher [[Froben|Johann Froben]].

Only when he had mastered Latin did he begin to express himself on major contemporary themes in [[literature]] and [[religion]]. He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, but he was not satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of [[Christian monasticism]] and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of [[celibacy]] or monastical lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the [[magisterium]]. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine, and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly virtually everyone and everything. Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.

==Spanish Polyglot Bible and Erasmus's Greek New Testament==
===The First Translation===
In 1502, Spain, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros had put together a team of Spanish translators to create a [[Complutensian Polyglot|Compilation of a Bible in four languages]], Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin. Translators for Greek were commissioned from Greece itself and worked closely with prestigious Latinists and thalamic scholars.
[[Cardinal Cisneros]]'s team completed and printed the full new testament, including the Greek translation, in 1514. To do so they developed specific types to print Greek. 
Cisneros informed Erasmus of the works going on in Spain and may have sent a printed version of the New Testament to him. However, the Spanish team wanted the entire Bible to be released as one single work and withdrew from publication.

The information and the delay allowed Erasmus to request a "Publication Privilege" of four years for the Greek New Testament to ensure that his work would be published first. He obtained it in 1516 from both [[Pope Leo X]], to whom he'd dedicate his work, and [[Emperor Maximilian I]]. Erasmus's ' Greek New Testament to be published first, in 1516, forcing the Spanish team of Cisneros to wait until 1520 to publish their [[Complutensian Polyglot]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, J. Carlos Vizuete; Llamazares, Fernando; Sánchez, Julio Martín; Mancha, Universidad de Castilla-La (2002).

Univ de Castilla La Mancha&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to say if Erasmus's actions had an effect on delaying the publication of Complutensian Polyglot, causing the Spanish team to take more time, or if it made no difference in their perfectionism. The Spanish copy was approved for publication by the Pope in 1520, however, it wasn't released until 1522, due to the team's insistence on reviewing and editing. Only fifteen errors have been found in the entire six volumes and four languages of Cisneros's bible, an extraordinarily low number for the time. The fear of them publishing first, though, affected Erasmus's work, rushing him to printing and causing him to forego editing. The result was a large number of translation mistakes, transcription errors, and typos, that required further editions to be printed. (see "publication").&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Epistle 694" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Volume 5'', 167. The Latin is ''prœcipitatum fuit verius quam editum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Translation of Erasmus===
Erasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on this Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a [[critical edition]]. Then he polished the language. He declared, "It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin."&lt;ref&gt;"Epistle 695" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 5: Letters 594 to 841, 1517–1518'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text:
:"My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome’s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense."&lt;ref&gt;"Epistle 273" in Collected ''Works of Erasmus Vol. 2: Letters 142 to 297, 1501–1514'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated Wallace K. Ferguson; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

While his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended to produce a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, there is no evidence to support this. He wrote, "There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me."&lt;ref&gt;"Epistle 305" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus. Vol. 3: Letters 298 to 445, 1514–1516'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work:
:"But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator’s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep."&lt;ref&gt;"Epistle 337" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus'' Vol. 3, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
So he included the Greek text to permit qualified readers to verify the quality of his Latin version. But by first calling the final product ''Novum Instrumentum omne'' ("All of the New Teaching") and later ''Novum Testamentum omne'' ("All of the New Testament") he also indicated clearly that he considered a text in which the Greek and the Latin versions were consistently comparable to be the essential core of the church's New Testament tradition.

===Contribution===
In a way it is legitimate to say that Erasmus "synchronized" or "unified" the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing an updated version of either simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually presenting the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions "compatible". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]'' were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the Vulgate's text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the Vulgate’s reading to the Greek text.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. at Acts 9:6. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'', pp. 99–100; Kurt Aland – Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament. An Introduction to the Critical Editions and to the Theory and Practice of Modern Textual Criticism'', Translated by Erroll F. Rhodes. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1987. Second edition, revised and enlarged, 1989, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication and editions===
Erasmus said it was "rushed into print rather than edited",&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; resulting in a number of transcription errors. After comparing what writings he could find, Erasmus wrote corrections between the lines of the manuscripts he was using (among which was [[Minuscule 2]]) and sent them as proofs to Froben.&lt;ref name="SH"&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc02&amp;page=106&amp;view= "History of the Printed Text"], in: ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. II: Basilica – Chambers'', p. 106 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; His hurried effort was published by his friend [[Johann Froben]] of Basel in 1516 and thence became the first published Greek New Testament, the ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]], diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum''. Erasmus used several Greek manuscript sources because he did not have access to a single complete manuscript. Most of the manuscripts were, however, late Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine textual family and Erasmus used the oldest manuscript the least because "he was afraid of its supposedly erratic text."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; He also ignored much older and better manuscripts that were at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juhász, Guido Latré (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second (1519) edition, the more familiar term ''Testamentum'' was used instead of ''Instrumentum''. This edition was used by [[Martin Luther]] in his [[Luther Bible|German translation of the Bible]], written for people who could not understand Latin. Together, the first and second editions sold 3,300 copies. By comparison, only 600 copies of the Complutensian Polyglot were ever printed. The first and second edition texts did not include the passage (1 John 5:7–8) that has become known as the [[Comma Johanneum]]. Erasmus had been unable to find those verses in any Greek manuscript, but one was supplied to him during production of the third edition. That manuscript is now thought to be a 1520 creation from the [[Latin Vulgate]], which likely got the verses from a fifth-century marginal gloss in a Latin copy of I John. The Roman Catholic Church decreed that the ''Comma Johanneum'' was open to dispute (2 June 1927), and it is rarely included in modern scholarly translations.

The third edition of 1522 was probably used by [[Tyndale]] for the first English New Testament (Worms, 1526) and was the basis for the 1550 Robert Stephanus edition used by the translators of the [[Geneva Bible]] and [[King James Version]] of the English Bible. Erasmus published a fourth edition in 1527 containing parallel columns of Greek, Latin Vulgate and Erasmus's Latin texts. In this edition Erasmus also supplied the Greek text of the last six verses of [[Revelation]] (which he had translated from Latin back into Greek in his first edition) from [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez]]'s ''[[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Biblia Complutensis]]''. In 1535 Erasmus published the fifth (and final) edition which dropped the Latin Vulgate column but was otherwise similar to the fourth edition. Later versions of the Greek New Testament by others, but based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament, became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''.

Erasmus dedicated his work to [[Pope Leo X]] as a patron of learning and regarded this work as his chief service to the cause of Christianity. Immediately afterward, he began the publication of his ''[[Paraphrases of Erasmus|Paraphrases of the New Testament]]'', a popular presentation of the contents of the several books. These, like all of his writings, were published in Latin but were quickly translated into other languages, with his encouragement.

Erasmus, in his capacity as humanist editor, advised major printers such as Aldus Manutis on which manuscripts to publish. &lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings of Protestantism==

===Attempts at impartiality in dispute===
[[Protestant Reformation|Martin Luther's movement]] began in the year following the publication of the New Testament and tested Erasmus' character. The issues between growing religious movements, which would later become known as [[Protestantism]], and the [[Catholic Church]] had become so clear that few could escape the summons to join the debate. Erasmus, at the height of his literary fame, was inevitably called upon to take sides, but partisanship was foreign to his nature and his habits. In all his criticism of clerical follies and abuses, he had always protested that he was not attacking the Church itself or its doctrines, and had no enmity toward churchmen. The world had laughed at his [[satire]], but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work so far had commended itself to the best minds and also to the dominant powers in the religious world.

Erasmus did not build a large body of supporters with his letters. He chose to write in Greek and Latin, the languages of scholars. His critiques reached an elite but small audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=European History in Perspective: The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disagreement with Luther===
"Free will does not exist", according to Luther in his letter ''[[w:On the Bondage of the Will|De Servo Arbitrio]]'' to Erasmus translated into German by [[Justus Jonas]] (1526) in that sin makes human beings completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. Noting Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church, Erasmus described him as "a mighty trumpet of gospel truth" while agreeing, "It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344"&gt;Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. 131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference, 2000, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; He had great respect for Luther, and Luther spoke with admiration of Erasmus's superior learning. Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of his own. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing that to do so would endanger his position as a leader in the movement for pure scholarship which he regarded as his purpose in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus hesitated to support him, the straightforward Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to [[cowardice]] or a lack of purpose. However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To [[Philip Melanchthon]] in 1524 he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit – these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Letter of September 6, 1524| title= Collected Works of Erasmus| year= 1992 | publisher=University of Toronto Press| volume=10| isbn= 0-8020-5976-7 |page= 380 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=bYVEgXbiunkC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;dq=%22gospel,+the+word+of+God,+faith,+Christ,+and+Holy+Spirit%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gospel%2C%20the%20word%20of%20God%2C%20faith%2C%20Christ%2C%20and%20Holy%20Spirit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, in 1529, he writes “An epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals”&lt;ref&gt;Epistola contra quosdam qui se falso iactant evangelicos.&lt;/ref&gt; to Vulturius Neocomus ([[w:Gerard Geldenhouwer|Gerardus Geldenhouwer]]). Here Erasmus complains of the doctrines and morals of the Reformers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You declaim bitterly against the luxury of priests, the ambition of bishops, the tyranny of the Roman Pontiff, and the babbling of the sophists; against our prayers, fasts, and Masses; and you are not content to retrench the abuses that may be in these things, but must needs abolish them entirely...&lt;br&gt;Look around on this ‘Evangelical’ generation,&lt;ref&gt;"Circumspice populum istum Euangelicum…" Latin text in Erasmus, ''Opera Omnia'', (1706), vol. 10, 1578BC.

Apart from these perceived moral failings of the Reformers, Erasmus also dreaded any change in doctrine, citing the long history of the Church as a bulwark against innovation. In book I of his ''Hyperaspistes'' he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves – indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same ''Assertion''&lt;ref&gt;A reference to Luther's ''Assertio omnium articulorum per bullam Leonis X. novissimam damnatorum'' (Assertion of all the Articles condemned by the Bull of Leo X, 1520), [[Weimar edition of Martin Luther's works|WA]] VII.&lt;/ref&gt; you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what you said before.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Works of Erasmus, Controversies: De Libero Arbitrio / Hyperaspistes I'', Peter Macardle, Clarence H.

Continuing his chastisement of Luther—and undoubtedly put off by the notion of there being "no pure interpretation of Scripture anywhere but in Wittenberg"&lt;ref&gt;''Erasmus and the Middle Ages: The Historical Consciousness of a Christian Humanist'' (Brill's Studies in Intellectual History), 200, István Pieter Bejczy, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|90-04-12218-4}} {{ISBN|9789004122185}} p. 172 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MxLV1yVyT7sC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22no+pure+interpretation+of+Scripture+anywhere+but+in+Wittenberg%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XqTlTbaoLuPu0gGU3tH4Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22no%20pure%20interpretation%20of%20Scripture%20anywhere%20but%20in%20Wittenberg%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; – Erasmus touches upon another important point of the controversy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You stipulate that we should not ask for or accept anything but Holy Scripture, but you do it in such a way as to require that we permit you to be its sole interpreter, renouncing all others. Thus the victory will be yours if we allow you to be not the steward but the lord of Holy Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''Hyperaspistes'', Book I, ''Collected Works of Erasmus'', Vol. 76, pp. 204–05. Latin: "Stipulaberis a nobis, ne quid requiramus aut recipiamus praeter Litteras sacras, sed sic ut tibi concedamus, ut eas tu solus interpreteris, submotis omnibus. Sic victoria penes te fuerit, si patiamur te non dispensatorem, sed dominum fieri divinae Scripturae." ''Opera Omnia'' (1706), Vol. 10, 1294E–F [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIhDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=Stipulaberis+victoria+patiamur&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PmflTeS5B-nc0QHI7eCFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Stipulaberis%20victoria%20patiamur&amp;f=false] [http://www.martinluther.dk/hyp05.html Latin &amp; Danish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Though he sought to remain firmly neutral in doctrinal disputes, each side accused him of siding with the other, perhaps because of his neutrality. It was not for lack of fidelity with either side but a desire for fidelity with them both:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I detest dissension because it goes both against the teachings of Christ and against a secret inclination of nature. I doubt that either side in the dispute can be suppressed without grave loss."&lt;ref name="Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his [[catechism]] (entitled ''Explanation of the [[Apostles' Creed]]'') (1533), Erasmus took a stand against Luther's teaching by asserting the unwritten [[Sacred Tradition]] as just as valid a source of revelation as the [[Bible]], by enumerating the [[Deuterocanonical books]] in the [[Biblical canon|canon of the Bible]] and by acknowledging seven [[sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;''Opera omnia Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami'', vol. V/1, Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 278–90&lt;/ref&gt; He called "blasphemers" anyone who questioned the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]].&lt;ref name="Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami pp. 245"&gt;''Opera omnia Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami'', vol. V/1, Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 245, 279.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he supported lay access to the Bible.&lt;ref name="Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami pp. 245"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Nikolaus von Amsdorf]], Luther objected to Erasmus’ Catechism and called Erasmus a "viper," "liar,"
and "the very mouth and organ of Satan."&lt;ref&gt;''D. Martin Luther. Werke: Kritische Gesamtausgabe. Briefwechsel'', vol. 7, Weimar: Böhlau, pp. 27–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasmus was accused by the monks against the Reformation, that he had: &lt;blockquote&gt;"prepared the way and was responsible for Martin Luther. Erasmus, they said, had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it. Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had hatched a different bird entirely.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/reynoldserasmusresponsibleluther.pdf ''Concordia Theological Journal''] Was Erasmus Responsible for Luther?

===Free will===
Twice in the course of the great discussion, he allowed himself to enter the field of doctrinal controversy, a field foreign to both his nature and his previous practice. One of the topics he dealt with was free will, a crucial question. In his ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio]]'' (1524), he lampoons the Lutheran view on free will. He lays down both sides of the argument impartially. The "Diatribe" did not encourage any definite action; this was its merit to the Erasmians and its fault in the eyes of the Lutherans. In response, Luther wrote his ''De servo arbitrio'' ([[On the Bondage of the Will]]) (1525), which attacks the "Diatribe" and Erasmus himself, going so far as to claim that Erasmus was not a Christian. Erasmus responded with a lengthy, two-part ''Hyperaspistes'' (1526–27). In this controversy Erasmus lets it be seen that he would like to claim more for free will than St. Paul and St. Augustine seem to allow according to Luther's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Desiderius Erasmus ''Dutch humanist and scholar'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191015/Desiderius-Erasmus/59231/The-Protestant-challenge#ref=ref24610The Protestant challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; For Erasmus the essential point is that humans have the freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusions Erasmus reached drew upon a large array of notable authorities, including, from the Patristic period, Origen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, in addition to many leading Scholastic authors, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. The content of Erasmus' works also engaged with later thought on the state of the question, including the perspectives of the ''via moderna'' school and of Lorenzo Valla, whose ideas he rejected.

As the popular response to Luther gathered momentum, the social disorders, which Erasmus dreaded and Luther disassociated himself from, began to appear, including the [[German Peasants' War]], the [[Anabaptist]] disturbances in Germany and in the Low Countries, [[iconoclasm]] and the [[radicalization]] of peasants across Europe. If these were the outcomes of reform, he was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole "tragedy" (as the Catholics dubbed Protestantism).

When the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation in 1529, Erasmus gave up his residence there and settled in the imperial town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].

===Religious toleration===
Certain works of Erasmus laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]] and [[Ecumenism]]. For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors."&lt;ref&gt;Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996), p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Froude, James Anthony

===Sacraments===
[[File:4146 Print 13077kopie.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Erasmus by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter I Brueghel]], [[The Phoebus Foundation]] ]]
A test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s, and the crux of this question was the observance of the [[Eucharist]]. In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of [[Algerus]] against the heretic [[Berengar of Tours]] in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as [[transubstantiation]]. The [[sacramentarian]]s, headed by [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Œcolampadius]] of Basel, were, as Erasmus says, quoting him as holding views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and "erroneous" movement.

==Death==
When his strength began to fail, he decided to accept an invitation by [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]], to move from Freiburg to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. However, during preparations for the move in 1536, he suddenly died from an attack of [[dysentery]] during a visit to [[Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Desiderius Erasmus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had remained loyal to the papal authorities in Rome, but he did not have the opportunity to receive the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church; and whether he asked for a priest or not is nowhere mentioned in the reports of his death. According to Jan van Herwaarden, this is consistent with his view that outward signs were not important; what mattered is the believer's direct relationship with God, which he noted "as the [Catholic] church believes". However, Herwaarden observes that "he did not dismiss the rites and sacraments out of hand but asserted a dying person could achieve a state of salvation without the priestly rites, provided their faith and spirit were attuned to God."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Jan Van Herwaarden |title=Between Saint James and Erasmus: Studies in Late Medieval Religious Life |location=Leiden |publisher=BRILL |year=2003 |pages=529–530 |isbn=9789004129849}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried with great ceremony in [[Basel Minster]] (the former [[cathedral]]) there.&lt;ref name="Church 1924"/&gt;

His last words, as recorded by his friend [[Beatus Rhenanus]], were apparently "''Dear God''" ({{lang-nl|Lieve God}}).&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga, Dutch edition, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze statue of him was erected in the city of his birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.

==Writings==
Erasmus wrote both on [[ecclesiastic]] subjects and those of general human interest. By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. ''131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference,'' 2000, 343.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with coining the adage, "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."  With the collaboration of [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], he formed a [[Paremiography]] (collection) of Latin [[proverb]]s and adages, commonly titled ''[[Adagia]]''.  Erasmus is also generally credited with originating the phrase "[[Pandora's box]]", arising through an error in his translation of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Pandora]]'' in which he confused ''pithos'' (storage jar) with ''pyxis'' (box).

His more serious writings begin early with the ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]],'' the "Handbook of the Christian Soldier" (1503) (translated into English a few years later by the young [[William Tyndale]]).  (A more literal translation of ''enchiridion'' - 'dagger' - has been likened to "the spiritual equivalent of the modern [[Swiss Army knife]].")&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid.  Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years. New York: Viking, 2010, 599.&lt;/ref&gt; In this short work, Erasmus outlines the views of the normal Christian life, which he was to spend the rest of his days elaborating.  The chief evil of the day, he says, is formalism - going through the motions of tradition without understanding their basis in the teachings of Christ.  Forms can teach the soul how to worship God, or they may hide or quench the spirit.  In his examination of the dangers of formalism, Erasmus discusses monasticism, saint worship, war, the spirit of class and the foibles of "society."

The ''Enchiridion'' is more like a sermon than a satire.  With it Erasmus challenged common assumptions, painting the clergy as educators who should share the treasury of their knowledge with the laity.  He emphasized personal spiritual disciplines, and called for a reformation which he characterized as a collective return to the Fathers and Scripture.  Most importantly, he extolled the reading of scripture as vital because of its power to transform and motivate toward love.  Much like the Brethren of the Common Life, he wrote that the New Testament is the law of Christ people are called to obey and that Christ is the example they are called to imitate.

According to [[Ernest Barker]], "Besides his work on the New Testament, Erasmus laboured also, and even more arduously, on the [[Church Fathers|early Fathers]]. […] Among the Latin Fathers he edited the works of [[St Jerome]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary]], and [[St Augustine]]; among the Greeks he worked on [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]] and [[Chrysostom]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Barker]] (1948) ''Traditions of Civility'', chapter 4: The Connection between the Renaissance and the Reformation, pp. 93–94, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasmus also wrote of the legendary [[Frisians|Frisian]] freedom fighter and rebel [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] (Greate Pier), though more often in criticism than in praise of his exploits.  Erasmus saw him as a dim, brutal man who preferred physical strength to wisdom.&lt;ref name="erasmus"&gt;The Age of Erasmus, Lectures Delivered in the Universities of Oxford and London, by P. S. Allen, Clarendon Press 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HolbeinErasmusFollymarginalia.jpg|upright|thumb|Marginal drawing of Folly by Hans Holbein in the first edition of Erasmus's ''Praise of Folly'', 1515]]

One of Erasmus's best-known works, inspired by ''De triumpho stultitiae'' (written by Italian humanist [[Faustino Perisauli]]), is ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', published under the double title ''Moriae encomium'' (Greek, Latinised) and ''Laus stultitiae'' (Latin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm Early title page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112141116/http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm |date=12 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A satirical attack on superstitions and other traditions of European society in general and the western Church in particular, it was written in 1509, published in 1511, and dedicated to Sir Thomas More, whose name the title puns.

The ''[[Education of a Christian Prince|Institutio principis Christiani]]'' (''Education of a Christian Prince'') (Basel, 1516) was written as advice to the young king Charles of Spain (later [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]).  Erasmus applies the general principles of honor and sincerity to the special functions of the Prince, whom he represents throughout as the servant of the people.  ''Education'' was published in 1516, three years after&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|title=Western Civilization, Eighth Edition, Volume B: 1300–1815|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-1-111-34215-9|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]’s ''[[The Prince]]''; a comparison between the two is worth noting.  Machiavelli stated that, to maintain control by political force, it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved.  Erasmus preferred for the prince to be loved, and strongly suggested a well-rounded education in order to govern justly and benevolently and avoid becoming a source of oppression.

As a result of his reformatory activities, Erasmus found himself at odds with both the great parties.  His last years were embittered by controversies with men toward whom he was sympathetic.  Notable among these was [[Ulrich von Hutten]], a brilliant but erratic genius, who had thrown himself into the Lutheran cause and declared that Erasmus, if he had a spark of honesty, would do the same.  In his reply in 1523, ''Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni'', Erasmus displays his skill in [[semantics]].  He accuses Hutten of having misinterpreted his utterances about reform and reiterates his determination never to break with the Church.

The ''[[Ciceronianus]]'' came out in 1528, attacking the style of Latin that was based exclusively and fanatically on Cicero's writings.  Etienne Dolet wrote a riposte titled ''Erasmianus'' in 1535.

Erasmus's last major work, published the year of his death, is the ''[[Ecclesiastes of Erasmus|Ecclesiastes]]'' or "Gospel Preacher" (Basel, 1536), a massive manual for preachers of around a thousand pages. Though somewhat unwieldy because Erasmus was unable to edit it properly in his old age, it is in some ways the culmination of all of Erasmus' literary and theological learning, offering prospective preachers advice on nearly every conceivable aspect of their vocation with extraordinarily abundant reference to classical and biblical sources.

===''Sileni Alcibiadis'' (1515)===
Erasmus’s ''Sileni Alcibiadis'' is one of his most direct assessments of the need for Church reform.  Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the ''Adagia'' in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517.  This essay has been likened to John Colet’s ''Convocation Sermon'', though the styles differ.

''Sileni'' is the plural (Latin) form of ''Silenus'', a creature often related to the Roman wine god [[Bacchus]] and represented in pictorial art as inebriated, merry revellers, variously mounted on donkeys, singing, dancing, playing flutes etc. [[Alcibiades]] was a Greek politician in the 5th century BCE and a general in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; he figures here more as a character written into some of Plato's dialogues—a young, debauched playboy whom Socrates tries to convince to seek truth instead of pleasure, wisdom instead of pomp and splendor.

The term ''Sileni''—especially when juxtaposed with the character of Alcibiades—can therefore be understood as an evocation of the notion that something on the inside is more expressive of a person's character than what one sees on the outside.  For instance, something or someone ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside, which is one of the main points of Plato's dialogues featuring ''Alcibiades'' and the ''Symposion'', in which Alcibiades also appears.

In support of this, Erasmus states, "Anyone who looks closely at the inward nature and essence will find that nobody is further from true wisdom than those people with their grand titles, learned bonnets, splendid sashes and bejeweled rings, who profess to be wisdom’s peak".  Erasmus lists several Sileni and then questions whether Christ is the most noticeable Silenus of them all.  The [[Apostles]] were Sileni since they were ridiculed by others.  He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people —that despite contemporary references to clergy as the whole of the Church, they are merely its servants.  He criticizes those that spend the Church’s riches at the people’s expense.  The true point of the Church is to help people lead Christian lives.  Priests are supposed to be pure, yet when they stray away, no one condemns them.  He criticizes the riches of the popes, believing that it would be better for the Gospel to be most important.

==Legacy==
The popularity of his books is reflected in the number of editions and translations that have appeared since the sixteenth century. Ten columns of the catalogue of the British Library are taken up with the enumeration of the works and their subsequent reprints. The greatest names of the classical and patristic world are among those translated, edited, or annotated by Erasmus, including Saint [[Ambrose]], [[Aristotle]], Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], Saint [[John Chrysostom]], [[Cicero]] and Saint Jerome.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In his native Rotterdam, the [[Erasmus Universiteit|University]] and [[Gymnasium Erasmianum]] have been named in his honor. In 2003, a poll showing that most Rotterdammers believed Erasmus to be the designer of the local "Erasmus Bridge" instigated the founding of the Erasmus House (Rotterdam),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erasmushuisrotterdam.nl/ Erasmushuis]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Erasmus House (Jakarta)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2000/03/27/dutch-cultural-center-erasmus-huis-turns-30.html Dutch cultural center Erasmus Huis turns 30 ], the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'', 27 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  dedicated to celebrating Erasmus's legacy. Three moments in Erasmus's life are celebrated annually. On 1 April, the city celebrates the publication of his best-known book ''The Praise of Folly''. On 11 July, the ''Night of Erasmus'' celebrates the lasting influence of his work. His birthday is celebrated on 28 October.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Erasmus's reputation and the interpretations of his work have varied over time. Moderate Catholics recognized him as a leading figure in attempts to reform the Church, while Protestants recognized his initial support for Luther's ideas and the groundwork he laid for the future Reformation, especially in biblical scholarship. By the 1560s, however, there was a marked change in reception.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

According to [[Franz Anton Knittel]], Erasmus in his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]'' did not incorporate the ''[[Comma Johanneum|Comma]]'' from the [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known to [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken über den berühmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant views of Erasmus fluctuated depending on region and period, with continual support in his native Netherlands and in cities of the Upper Rhine area. However, following his death and in the late sixteenth century, many Reformation supporters saw Erasmus's critiques of Luther and lifelong support for the universal Catholic Church as damning, and second-generation Protestants were less vocal in their debts to the great humanist. Nevertheless, his reception is demonstrable among Swiss Protestants in the sixteenth-century: he had an indelible influence on the biblical commentaries of, for example, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and John Calvin, all of whom used both his annotations on the New Testament and his paraphrases of same in their own New Testament commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Erasmus and Calvin on the Foolishness of God: Reason and Emotion in the Christian Philosophy  |last=Essary |first=Kirk |year=2017 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781487501884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Erasmus designated his own legacy and his life works were turned over at his death to his friend the Protestant humanist turned remonstrator [[Sebastian Castellio]] for the repair of the breach and divide of Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sebastian Castellio, 1515-1563; Humanist and Defender of Religious Toleration in a Confessional Age; Translated and Edited by Bruce Gordon  |last=Guggisbert |first=Hans |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Hants England; Burlington, Vermont, USA |isbn=0754630196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], however, Erasmus increasingly again became a more widely respected cultural symbol and was hailed as an important figure by increasingly broad groups. In a letter to a friend, Erasmus once had written: "That you are patriotic will be praised by many and easily forgiven by everyone; but in my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all."&lt;ref&gt;Letter 480, to Budé (ed. Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the universalist ideals of Erasmus are sometimes claimed to be important for fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several schools, faculties and universities in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] are named after him, as is [[Erasmus Hall High School|Erasmus Hall]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York, USA. The European Union's [[Erasmus Programme]] scholarships enable students to spend up to a year of their university courses in a university in another European country.

Eramus is credited with saying "When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left, I buy food and clothes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781602397064|location=New York, NY|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HolbeinErasmusHands.jpg|thumb|upright|Holbein's studies of Erasmus's hands, in silverpoint and chalks, ca. 1523. ([[Louvre]])]]
* [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] painted him at least three times, and perhaps as many as seven; some only survive in versions by other artists. His three profile portraits of Erasmus, two (nearly identical) profile portraits and one three-quarters view portrait were all painted in the same year, 1523. Erasmus used the Holbein portraits as gifts for his friends in England, such as [[William Warham]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (as he writes in a letter to Warham regarding the gift portrait, Erasmus quips that "he might have something of Erasmus should God call him from this place.") Erasmus spoke favourably of Holbein as an artist and person, but later criticized Holbein whom he had accused of sponging off various patrons to whom Erasmus had recommended, for purposes more of monetary gain than artistic endeavor.
* [[Albrecht Dürer]] also produced portraits of Erasmus, whom he met three times, in the form of an [[engraving]] of 1526 and a preliminary charcoal sketch. Concerning the former Erasmus was unimpressed, declaring it an unfavourable likeness of him. Nevertheless, Erasmus and Dürer maintained a close friendship, with Dürer going so far as to solicit Erasmus's support for the Lutheran cause, which Erasmus politely declined. Erasmus wrote a glowing ''[[encomium]]'' about the artist, likening him to famous Greek painter of antiquity [[Apelles]]. Erasmus was deeply affected by his death in 1528.
* [[Quentin Matsys]] produced the earliest known portraits of Erasmus, including an oil painting in 1517 and a medallion in 1519.
* In 1622, [[Hendrick de Keyser]] cast a statue of Erasmus in bronze replacing an earlier stone version from 1557. This was set up in the public square in Rotterdam, and today may be found outside the church of St Lawrence.

'''Facundo Cabral''' (May 22, 1937 &amp;ndash; July 9, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/72549/singer-facundo-cabral-killed-in-guatemala Singer Facundo Cabral killed in Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and philosopher.

He was best known as the composer of ''"No soy de aquí ni soy de allá"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p33742/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Facundo Cabral|last=Harris |first=Craig|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("I'm not from here nor there"), which he improvised during one of his concerts. His songs have been covered by [[Spanish language]] interpreters such as [[Alberto Cortez]], who was also a friend of his, [[Juan Luis Guerra]] and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]].

After touring the world, Cabral enjoyed popularity in his home country during the early 1980s, when Argentine radio demanded local content after the [[Malvinas War]]. He became a very popular singer throughout [[Latin America]]. Facundo Cabral was named a [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador|UNESCO]] Messenger of Peace in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = |title = Facundo Cabral, Entertainer and Messenger of Peace, killed in Guatemala|publisher = Examiner|date = 2011-07-09|first = Doris|last = Irizarry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Facundo Cabral was born in the Argentine city of [[La Plata]], and could not talk until the age of nine. He was illiterate until the age of 14. His wife and daughter died when he was 40. He met his father at the age of 46. Facundo did not have an easy childhood; he left his home early and was dedicated to all kinds of tasks. From the most humble of beginnings, he came to inspire millions around the world through his songs, poems and 66 books. He walked 400&amp;nbsp;km at the age of nine to look for work to support his mother and seven siblings after his father abandoned them. When he left, his mother told him: "This is the second, and last gift I can give you. The first was to give you life, and the second one, the liberty to live it." He traveled to [[Mar del Plata]] and got a job in a hotel where the owner saw him with his guitar and gave him the opportunity to sing.  
He wrote music that inspired millions. He met [[Mother Teresa]]. He performed in over 165 countries in eight different languages. His earlier artistic name was ''El Indio Gasparino''. His wife and one-year-old daughter were killed in 1978 in the [[PSA Flight 182]] crash near [[San Diego]], [[California]]. He was nearly blind and crippled, and was a bone cancer survivor as well. When he was diagnosed in his twenties, his doctor told him he only had a couple of months to live but he survived much longer and was an inspiration to all. He loved travelling, it was a part of his life. He did not care about money, he just was happy to be alive. Facundo Cabral was killed in Guatemala after a concert. He gave his testimony of life to the world in songs, poems or just chatting, and was a great loss to the world. He always said, ''Siempre le pregunto a Dios, ¿por qué a mí tanto me diste? Me diste miseria, hambre, felicidad, lucha, luces... vi todo. Sé que hay cáncer, sífilis y primavera, y buñuelos de manzana'' (I always ask God, why did you give me so much? You gave me misery, hunger, happiness, struggle, lights... I saw everything. I know there is cancer, syphilis and spring, and apple fritters).

== Religious and political views ==
Facundo expressed that his spiritual views were influenced by a variety of figures, including [[Jesus]], [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou]], [[Rajneesh]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Mother Teresa]]. He preached [[quantum mysticism]] and the subjugation of the ego.

He had admiration for the writings of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (with whom he engaged in philosophical discussions) and of [[Walt Whitman]].

It is generally thought that Cabral never adhered to a specific political movement, although for years he advocated [[pacifism]] as a way of resolving conflicts. He used to describe himself as "violently pacifist", and as a "first-class homeless person". During his later years he partly identified himself with the ideas of [[philosophical anarchism]].

==Murder==
Cabral was shot and killed during a tour in [[Guatemala City]] while en route to [[La Aurora International Airport]]  on July 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/notas/592436-Asesinaron-al-cantante-Facundo-Cabral-en-un-atentado-en-Guatemala.html''Asesinaron al cantante Facundo Cabral en un atentado en Guatemala''] Infobae.com {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had left a hotel in the west of Guatemala City, after giving a concert the previous evening in [[Quetzaltenango]], and was headed to the airport when gunmen attacked his vehicle, a white [[Range Rover Sport]], hitting him with at least eight bullets. He died in the car. The incident occurred at around 05.20 (local time) and took place on Liberation Boulevard, a busy road that connects with the airport, but at the time of the attack was practically empty. Cabral initially planned to take a hotel shuttle to the airport, but accepted a ride from Nicaraguan concert promoter/night club owner Henry Fariñas.

Cabral was with his agent David Llanos and Henry Fariñas, who were wounded. He was accompanied by a second vehicle carrying bodyguards, but they couldn't protect the singer's vehicle from the bullets. Cabral was riding in an SUV that tried to flee the attackers by driving into a fire station. At least 20 bullet holes were seen in the Range Rover car he was in. The gunmen were in three late-model vehicles, one in front of Cabral's car and two to the right and left. One of the attackers' vehicles was later found abandoned on the road to [[El Salvador]]. It was a brown Hyundai Santa Fe with bullet holes and containing bullet-proof vests and an AK-47 magazine. Early investigations indicated that the trajectory of the bullets were from right to left, toward the driver's seat, indicating that the bullets were meant for the driver, Cabral's Nicaraguan promoter Henry Fariñas, possibly because of troubles with organized crime. Three suspects were arrested.

Cabral, at the time of his murder, had been married for seven months to Silvia Pousa, a Venezuelan psychologist who had been his partner for the last ten years. His body was flown to [[Argentina]] from [[Guatemala]] on July 12, 2011 on a Mexican Air Force jet. His widow, Silvia Pousa, and nephew joined foreign minister Hector Timerman and a small group of Guatemalan and Mexican diplomats on the tarmac in [[Buenos Aires]] to receive his remains. One official brought from the plane a guitar and a small bag. Cabral had said that was all he needed for his nearly constant singing tours.

His coffin was displayed for the public in the Ateneo theater, the same Buenos Aires theater where he last performed in his native Argentina. The widow and family of Cabral gave a statement to reporters at the Ateneo theater, which expressed "thanks to the huge amount of media around the world by the respectful coverage" of his death.
His body was taken to a cemetery {{convert|32|km|mi|sp=us}} north of Buenos Aires for cremation at an intimate private ceremony with just family and close friends in attendance.

On March 13, 2012, [[Colombia]]n authorities announced the arrest of Alejandro Jiménez (a.k.a. ''El Palidejo''), who is believed to have ordered Cabral's murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/capturado-Colombia-intelectual-Facundo-Cabral_0_662334003.html Fue capturado en Colombia al presunto autor intelectual del crimen de Facundo Cabral] March 13, 2012 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
President Colom decreed three days of national mourning. Hundreds of Guatemalans (most of them wearing black) sang songs written by the artist in the capital's Plaza de la Constitucion. Some of the signs carried by Guatemalans grieving the death of the beloved singer said "Argentina, we apologize," "We ask forgiveness of the world for the assassination of Facundo;" "We are here not only for the death of ''Maestro'' Cabral, but also for every boy, girl, old man and woman, who becomes, day after day, victim of violence. Not only for Facundo Cabral, but also for the future of our children".

Presidents, performers and other personalities from the Americas united in condemning the singer’s murder and demanding justice from the Guatemalan authorities. Guatemala's 1992 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, [[Rigoberta Menchú]], went to the scene of the killing and wept. "For me, Facundo Cabral is a master," she said. "He loved Guatemala greatly."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} She believes the ambush may have been related to Cabral’s beliefs.

Social networks were filled with expressions of outrage. "I feel an immeasurable shame, a profound anger for my country", said Ronalth Ochaeta, former director of a Catholic church human rights office Guatemala, on his Facebook account.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Rodolfo Ajquejay, President of the Association of Artists in Guatemala, said "this is mourning at a global level because [he] left only positive messages in his songs".

This incident "was regrettable" and was "one more manifestation of the violence in Guatemala," said Francisco Dall'Anese, the head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), an organization created in conjunction with the United Nations. Guatemala's human rights ombudsman, Sergio Morales, expressed his condolences to Argentina."I ask authorities of this country that this crime not be left unsolved, to investigate," he said.

Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]] said "Facundo Cabral will be immortalized with his songs."

Bolivian authorities expressed their dismay at the death of the Argentine troubadour. Bolivian Minister of Culture [[Elizabeth Salguero]] said Cabral's death saddened her because "you can not understand that there are people who want to do much damage to a man who gave so much as a singer, composer, and poet." "He was a philosopher, a fighter for social justice, and to die that way is very painful."

Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] followed suit: "We are weeping with Argentina."

The Mayor of Lima, Peru and former presidential candidate, [[Susana Villaran]], tweeted: "So ironic. A man who preached about peace and sang for life, dies in such a violent way" and shared one of his most famous quotes: "If you love the money at most you'll get to a bank, but if you love life, God will surely come."

The Colombian president, [[Juan Manuel Santos]], also mourned his death. "Many of you must be fans of Facundo Cabral, and throughout [[Latin America]] and us here in [[Colombia]]. I personally regret this vile murder," Santos said at the start of a public speech in [[Bogotá]].

The [[United Nations]] said in a statement: "The United Nations System in Guatemala strongly condemns the assassination of Argentine singer-songwriter Facundo Cabral and adds to the feeling of dismay and frustration of a Guatemalan society that looks beset by intolerable acts of violence. It is painfully ironic that the one who toured Latin America with a message of justice, peace and fraternity lost his life in the hands of a group of assassins. The UN expresses its solidarity with the families and loved ones of the troubadour, as well as the people of [[Argentina]] and Latin American that had Facundo as a reference for inspiration."

Eduardo Suger, the presidential candidate for the "Commitment, Renewal and Order" party, during his tour in [[San Manuel Chaparron]] and [[San Luis Jilotepeque]], [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]], described as "vile and shameful" for the country the attack to Cabral. "I felt so much pain, I felt sad for Guatemala, because we are a people capable and honest, but now we paint as a people of thugs, it's embarrassing," he explained.

The secretary general of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, condemned the murder as an "irrational crime."

[[René Pérez]], leader of the Puerto Rican hip-hop group [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]], wrote, "Latin America is in mourning," and other leading pop-music figures, among them [[Ricky Martin]], [[Alejandro Sanz]] and [[Ricardo Montaner]], also sent Twitter messages lamenting his loss.

Guatemalan artists paid tribute to Facundo Cabral on Sunday, July 10, 2011. The Guatemalan artist guild called on all citizens to go Constitution Square to pay tribute to him. Armando Pineda, Alvaro Aguilar Alux Nahual and Rony Hernandez, Alejandro Arriaza, Gaby Andrade, and Manuel Rony were some of the artists who participated in this concert. In a letter to the Guatemalan newspaper ''[[Prensa Libre]]'' the singer [[Ricardo Arjona]] wrote: "As a Guatemalan, I deeply regret the impact this news will generate among international opinion. As a friend and colleague, I will lament the absence of Facundo forever."

Vicente Serrano, host of a local Spanish-language radio show, brought Cabral to the Chicago area for that last performance. Serrano, who described Cabral as "irreverent," remembers how the singer fell in love with the Chicago skyline and the Art Institute of Chicago. "Facundo cried when we went to visit the Art Institute because he said he was moved by its beauty," Serrano said

Argentine singer and poet [[Alberto Cortez]], who lives in [[Madrid]], was devastated by the assassination of Cabral, who shared a "great friendship" with Cabral.
"I remember him as a good friend, who suddenly became a mystic. That mysticism transmitted to people, and people accepted it with much pleasure,"he said.

Argentine television stations interrupted their broadcasts with news of the 74-year-old singer's death. The National Government decreed three days of mourning for the death of Cabral. Recalling that "devoted his life to singing, with their letters transmitting the spirit of peace inspired by the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi and Mother Teresa of Calcutta."

'''George of Laodicea''' (c. 300 AD, probably [[Epiphania, Cilicia]] - 24 December 361) was a [[philosopher]] from [[Alexandria]], involved in the debate over the [[doctrine of the Trinity]]. From 356 to 361, he was [[archbishop]] of Alexandria.

==Life==
According to [[Ammianus]] (xxii. ii), George was a native of Epiphania. [[Gregory Nazianzen]] states that George's father was a [[fuller (metalworking)|fuller]], and that George became so notorious a [[Parasitism (social offense)|parasite]] that he would "sell himself for a cake." After many wanderings, in the course of which he seems to have amassed a considerable fortune- first as an army contractor and then as a [[tax collector|receiver of taxes]]- George ultimately reached [[Alexandria (Egypt)|Alexandria]].

It is not known how or when George obtained [[holy orders|ecclesiastical orders]]; however, after [[Athanasius]] had been [[exile|banished]] in 356, George was promoted by the influence of the then-prevalent [[Arianism|Arian]] faction to the vacant [[See (ecclesiastical)|see]]. His [[theology|theological]] attitude was that of a [[Semi-Arianism|semi-Arian]] or [[Homoiousian]], and his associates were [[Eustathius of Sebaste]] and [[Basil of Ancyra]]. At George's instigation, the second Sirmian formula (promulgated by the third [[Councils of Sirmium|council of Sirmium]], in 357), which was conciliatory towards strict Arianism, was opposed at the [[council of Ancyra]] in 358 (Harnack, Hist. of Dogma, iv. 76).&lt;ref name=eb1911 /&gt;

George's [[persecution]]s and [[oppression]]s of the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] ultimately raised a [[rebellion]] that compelled him to flee for his life; but his authority was restored, albeit with difficulty, by a military demonstration. Untaught by experience, George resumed his course of selfish [[tyranny]] over [[Christian]]s and [[Pagan|heathen]] alike. This raised the ire of the populace to such a pitch that, on the accession of [[Julian the apostate|Julian]], George's downfall was effected, and he was thrown in prison. The local citizenry subsequently dragged George from the jail and killed him, tossing his body into the sea.&lt;ref name=eb1911 /&gt;

Though George had a sordid and brutal character, he had a highly cultivated [[literature|literary]] taste, and in the course of his checkered career found the means to collect a splendid personal [[library]], which Julian ordered conveyed to [[Antioch]] for his own use. An [[anonymous work]] against the [[Manicheans]], discovered by Lagarde in 1859 in writings once owned by [[Titus of Bostra]], has also been attributed to George.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle = George of Laodicea|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guy Sircello was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]], and attended Lincoln High School. His parents were Pete and Teresa Sircello, and he had a younger sister, Teresa. Upon high school graduation, he was awarded the prestigious George Baker full four-year scholarship to [[Reed College]], in [[Portland, Oregon]], and graduated in 1958 with a double major in philosophy and history. In 1960, he married Sharon Chapin, a fellow Reed graduate, and shortly after, they left New York for Hamburg, where he had a Fulbright grant to further his studies of Ernst Cassirer, the subject of his doctoral dissertation at [[Columbia University]]. 

In Hamburg, the Sircello's first child, Maria Anne Sircello was born, and the family returned to New York with another daughter as well, an adopted daughter, Deborah Ruth Sircello. In New York, the family grew as the Sircellos also became foster parents to Deborah's brothers, Billie, Alexander, and Constantine (Stan). In 1963, another daughter, Pier Andrea, was born in New York City just prior to the family's move to Portland, so that Guy could join the Reed faculty. In Portland, in 1965, another daughter, Anne-Marie Sircello was born, not long after the death of Maria Anne, who had been born with multiple serious disabilities. In 1966, the entire family of eight moved to Irvine, and finally, in 1967, the final child of the Sircello family, Christopher Chapin Sircello, was born. Guy was an attentive and involved father, and enjoyed family camping outings to Yosemite, a three-month family camping trip to Europe, and visits to museums, concerts, and the ballet. He was a major influence, along with Sharon, in three of his children becoming professional dancers, two others becoming professional visual artists, and another an accomplished amateur pianist. 

The Sircellos separated, and later divorced after 15 years of marriage.

Sircello was a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California Irvine]] from 1966 until his death in 1992 at the age of 55.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Obituary from University of California Irvine&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his PhD from [[Columbia University]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He taught at [[Reed College]] before becoming a founding member of UC Irvine’s Philosophy department.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While at Irvine he served as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1973 to 1977,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1978 to 1983, Chair of the Committee on Educational Policy from 1988 to 1989,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and as the Philosophy Department's Director of Graduate Studies from 1990 until his death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sircello was active in the American Society for Aesthetics and served as the President of its Pacific Division from 1978 to 1979.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His emphasis was in [[analytic philosophy]] of aesthetics, and he was best known for what he called his New Theory of Beauty &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Sircello's book ''Love and Beauty'' (1989) provides a sketch of his theory, which encompasses such topics as arousal, expansion, sublimity, and indulgence.  He considers the implications of his theory for aesthetics and ethics. He also develops theories of pleasure, quality, beauty and love.

===Introduction===
According to Sircello, philosophers have usually failed to understand and theorize properly about certain fundamental human modalities.  Among these is the human relation to and feeling for beauty.  In particular, Sircello found it dismaying that among philosophers the ancient conception of love of beauty had been displaced by other human concerns.  His last book, ''Love and Beauty'', was intended to provide a theory to begin to fill the void left by this loss of interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989,chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pleasure===
Sircello distinguishes pleasure from enjoyment. He uses ''propositional pleasure'' as an example of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like.  Such pleasure is relatively passive.  We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light on the way to work, but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect.  Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject.  Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject.  For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful.  The subject’s resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles.  Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation.  As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello’s theory of love.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989,chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualities===
Central to Sircello’s philosophy is his theory of qualities.  He defines the precise sense in which he uses this term through the concept of Properties of Qualitative Difference (or PQDs).&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Cyril. "The NTB and its PQDs." Review of Guy Sircello's A New Theory of Beauty. TLS [Times Literary Supplement] (December 17, 1976), 3901:1594.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such properties are to be distinguished from quantitative properties.  According to his theory, it is the perception of qualities that lies at the center of the experience of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, James J. Review of Guy Sircello's A New Theory of Beauty. Review of Metaphysics (September 1976), 30(1):139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sircello qualities come in four main varieties.  These constitute four ways in which we experience our world.

:* ''Qualities that qualify our own actions:''  Qualities such as those we experience when we perceive or remember our own actions fall in this category.  Two examples used by Sircello are “my gentleness when I speak” and “my efficiency when I work”.&lt;ref name="Loveand"&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;  These qualities comprise a major part of our experience of ourselves in our everyday lives.
:* ''Qualities that we experience as qualifying the actions of others:''  We may experience the grace of another’s movements, or the stubbornness of their attitude.  Sircello also includes in this category qualities perceived as being expressed by others in photographs, movies, painting, sculptures and so on.  So, we may perceive another's stolidness or joviality in a photo or video as well in first hand encounters.&lt;ref name="Loveand" /&gt;
:* ''Qualities that are experienced as “tracks” of the actions of ourselves or of others:''  Sircello defines “tracks” as “objects” that we may experience as the result of actions of sentient beings, either ourself or others.  Tracks need not actually be the result of such actions but are objects that can be perceived as such, in the way that a landscape might be regarded as a trace of the hand of a creator.  Sircello provides many examples of tracks in his book.  For example, the mark left by the tracing of your hand in the sand or the streak of light left by the movement of a firework sparkler through the air.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Qualities experienced by a person as belonging to an “object” of any sort under the following two conditions:  a) the quality is experienced as either like the act, trace or representation of an act of a sentient being and b) the quality is experienced by that person as belonging to that act, trace or representation:''  Perhaps too briefly, the quality may be experienced as being an act of the “object” being considered.  Examples of this type of quality are:  “A calm sea might be seen as if it were resting calmly.  In the delicate rustling of the leaves of a tree we might see the tree as delicately moving its limbs."&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 9, p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beauty===
Common wisdom tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Sircello’s philosophy runs counter to this maxim.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, Monroe C. "The Refutation of Relativism." Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (Spring 1983), 41(3):269, 270n4&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way.&lt;ref&gt;Iseminger, Gary. Review of Guy Sircello's Love and Beauty. Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (Spring 1991), 49(2):167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;  His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made there is something about the object that is thought to be beautiful.  For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way.  Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree.  Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 7, p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Ronald. "Ugliness." In Michael Kelly, ed., Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, Vol. 4, p. 421. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love===
Sircello begins his account of love by setting it in relation to enjoyment.  To distance some of the standard associations with the term “love,” Sircello uses the capitalized form, Love, in a technical sense.  Fundamental to his theory is the notion of reproducing an experience of a quality.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Clifford. Review of Guy Sircello's Love and Beauty. International Philosophical Quarterly (December 1990), 30(4):501-502.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductions by S a subject may be regarded as recollections, repetitions or recreations of images, memories, thoughts, actions, feelings, or states that are parts of the experience.  Sircello presents his theory through the four principles paraphrased below:

# For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is Loving this experience, then there is some part or parts of the experience that S is reproducing such that what S produces are themselves parts of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 123)&lt;/ref&gt;
# For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, S is Loving this experience only if the S’s reproducing parts of the experience both arouses and satisfies S’s desire to so reproduce.&lt;ref name="Loveand_a"&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;
# For any subject S, any quality for S (Qs), and any experience of Qs by S, if S is reproducing part or parts of the experience such that what S so reproduces are part(s) of the experience, and if such reproducing both arouses and satisfies S’s desire to so reproduce, then S is Loving the experience.&lt;ref name="Loveand_a" /&gt;
# For any subject S and any “object” for S, if S is Loving the “object”, then there is (at least) some experience for S involved with the “object” that S is Loving.&lt;ref&gt;''Love and Beauty'', Princeton University Press, 1989, chapter 25, p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;

HOIC was developed during the conclusion of [[Operation Payback]] by the [[hacktivism|hacktivist]] collective [[Anonymous (Group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.radware.com/knowledge-center/DDoSPedia/hoic-high-orbit-ion-cannon/|title=Definition of HOIC |publisher=radware.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate= 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Operation Payback]] concluded there was massive pressure on the group from law enforcement agencies, which captured and prosecuted more than 13 individuals connected with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Curtis|first1=Sophie|title=Who are the most notorious hacking groups?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11371524/Who-are-the-most-notorious-hacking-groups.html |accessdate=18 April 2015 |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anonymous busted: 13 hacktivists indicted over Operation Payback |url=http://rt.com/usa/anonymous-operation-payback-indictment-704/|accessdate= 2015-04-18|date= 3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forced many members of the group to rethink their strategies and subsequently this part of the group launched [[Operation Leakspin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sean |last=Bonner |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2010/12/09/anonymous-stops-drop.html |title=Anonymous Stops Drop |work=[[Boing Boing]] |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a large part of Anonymous remained focused on launching opt-in DDoS attacks. However the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] was not powerful enough to launch attacks with such a limited number of users. Therefore, HOIC was designed to remedy this with the ability to cause [[HTTP Flood]] with a low number of user agents with as few as 50 users being required to successfully launch an attack, and co-ordination between multiple users leading to an exponential increase in the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5883146/what-is-hoic|title=What is HOIC |publisher=Sam Biddle |date=18 February 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/12/how-ddos-attacks-work-and-why-theyre-so-hard-to-stop/|title=How DDoS Attacks Work, And Why They're So Hard To Stop |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |first=Jason |last=Schreier |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HOIC was the first tool of its kind to have support for the so-called "booster files", configurable VBscript modules that randomize the [[HTTP headers]] of attacking computers, allowing thousands upon thousands of highly randomized combinations for user agents.&lt;ref name="prolex120216"/&gt; Apart from allowing user agents to implement some form of randomization countermeasures the booster files can and have been used to increase the magnitude of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/sec-w04_final.pdf |title=DDoS ATTACKS: MOTIVES, MECHANISMS AND MITIGATION |publisher=[[RSA Conference]] |first=Stephen |last=Gates |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
HOIC and its predecessor, the [[LOIC]], are named after an [[ion cannon]], a fictional [[directed-energy weapon]] described as firing beams of [[ion]]s from a space-based platform onto Earth-based targets. Although ion cannons appear in many movies, television shows, and video games that have a science fiction-based setting, the ones depicted in the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (series)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'' series of video games are considered to be the inspiration for the graphics on the software's GUI and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=AirDemon.net |title=Low Orbit Ion Cannon |via=[[Archive.org]] |url=http://www.airdemon.net/loic.html |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927082809/http://www.airdemon.net/loic.html |archivedate=September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Simply described, HOIC is a program for sending [[POST (HTTP)|HTTP POST]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|GET]] requests at a computer under attack, that uses a [[lulz]]-inspired [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface]].&lt;ref name="arstec120216"/&gt; HOIC primarily performs a [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DoS) attack]] and a [[Distributed denial-of-service attack|DDoS attack]] when co-ordinated by multiple individuals. The [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service (DoS) attack]] on the target URL is accomplished by sending excessive traffic in an attempt to overload the site and bring it down. This basic version of the attack can be customized by using the booster files which follow the [[Visual Basic|VB 6]] mixed with [[Visual Basic .NET|VB .NET]] syntax. In addition, HOIC can simultaneously attack up to 256 domains, making it one of the most versatile tools for hackers who are attempting to co-ordinate DDoS attacks as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/high-orbit-vs-low-orbit-ion-cannonglimps-some-hacking-techniques |title=Glimpse into some hacking techniques|publisher=Avkash K |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate= 2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimalist GUI of the tool makes it user friendly and easy to control. The basic routine of an attack is to input the URL of the website which is to be attacked, set the power option on low, medium or high. The power option sets the request velocity with low at two requests per second, medium at four and high at eight requests per second. Then a booster file is added which uses .hoic extension to define dynamic request attributes, launch attacks on multiple pages within the same website and help evade some defense filters. The attack is then launched by pressing the red button in the GUI labelled as "Fire Teh Lazer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Ryan C|title=Web Application Defender's Cookbook: Battling Hackers and Protecting Users|date=  4 January 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118417058|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flC9dFFLWIsC&amp;pg=PT346&amp;dq=%22High+Orbit+Ion+Cannon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wwUyVe3tB8vlaJCXgIAP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22High%20Orbit%20Ion%20Cannon%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:HOIC TARGET.png|thumb|High Orbit Ion Cannon's interface for targeting a website for stressing]]

== Limitations ==
The basic limitation of HOIC is that it requires a coordinated group of users to ensure that the attacks are successful. Even though it has allowed attacks to be launched by far fewer users than the older Low Orbit Ion Cannon, HOIC still requires a minimum of 50 users to launch an effective attack and more are required to sustain it if the target website has protection.&lt;ref name="prolex120216"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prolexic.com/kcresources/prolexic-threat-advisories/prolexic-threat-advisory-hoic-031212/Prolexic_Threat_Advisory_HOIC_A4_052612.pdf |title=Threat: High Orbit Ion Cannon v2.1.003 |publisher=[[Prolexic Technologies]] |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another limiting factor is the lack of anonymizing and randomizing capability. Even though HOIC should, in theory, offer anonymizing through the use of booster files, the actual protection provided is not enough. Furthermore, anonymizing networks such as TOR are not capable of handling the bandwidth of attacks generated by HOIC. Any attempt to launch an attack using the TOR network will actually harm the network itself.&lt;ref name="arstec120216"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Gallagher |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |title=High Orbits and Slowlorises: understanding the Anonymous attack tools |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/02/high-orbits-and-slowlorises-understanding-the-anonymous-attack-tools/2/ |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anonymous members routinely use proxy servers based in Sweden to launch their attacks. It has been speculated that this is due to the notion that Sweden may have stricter [[internet privacy]] laws than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="arstec120216"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=Law Library of Congress |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
Primarily, HOIC has been designed as a stress testing tool and can be lawfully used as such to stress test local networks and servers provided the person initiating the test has authorization to test and as long as no other networks, servers, clients, networking equipment or URLs are disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/401392,hackers-kit-bag-the-tools-that-terrorise-the-internet.aspx|title=Hackers' kit bag: the tools that terrorise the internet|publisher=James H. Hamlyn-Harris|date=2015-03-09 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HOIC can also be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks, which are illegal under various statutes. The [[Police and Justice Act 2006]] of [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] amended the [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]], and specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Espiner, Tom (November 10, 2006). [http://news.cnet.com/U.K.-outlaws-denial-of-service-attacks/2100-7348_3-6134472.html "U.K. outlaws denial-of-service attacks"]. CNET News&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] with penalties that include up to ten years of imprisonment. In 2013 [[Criminal law|criminal charges]] were brought against 13 members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] for participating in a DDoS attack against various websites of organizations including the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, the United States Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, Visa, MasterCard, and Bank of America. They were charged with one count of "conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer" for the events that occurred between  September 16, 2010 and January 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2052360/us-indicts-13-anonymous-members-for-ddos-attacks.html|title=US charges 13 Anonymous members for DDoS attacks |publisher=PCWorld|date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDoS attacks are federal offenses in the United States and are prosecuted by the [[US Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] under [[United States Code|USC]] Title 18, Section 1030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/html/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap47-sec1030.htm |title=United States Code: Title 18,1030. Fraud and related activity in connection with computers &amp;#124; Government Printing Office |publisher=www.gpo.gov |date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] has petitioned the Government of the United States by [[We the People (petitioning system)|posting a petition]] on the [[whitehouse.gov]] site, demanding that DDoS attacks be recognized as a form of virtual protest similar to [[Occupy movement|Occupy protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/12/anonymous-ddos-petition-white-house_n_2463009.html |title=Anonymous DDoS Petition: Group Calls On White House To Recognize Distributed Denial Of Service As Protest |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com |date=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==
[[DDoS mitigation]] usually works on the principle of distribution, which is basically intelligent routing of traffic to avoid congestion and prevent overload at a single URL. Other methods to counter DDoS include installation of [[intrusion prevention system|intrusion prevention system (IPS)]] and [[intrusion detection system|intrusion detection system (IDS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=28879|title=High Orbit Ion Cannon Distributed Denial of Service Tools |publisher=Cisco|date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First use in attacks ==
[[Anonymous (Group)|Anonymous]] were the first group to utilize High Orbit Ion Cannon publicly.{{when|date=September 2016}} After [[Megaupload]], a file-sharing website, was shut down after federal agents raided their premises, [[Anonymous (Group)|Anonymous]] launched an attack against the website of the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]]. As the DOJ website went offline Anonymous claimed success via twitter, saying "One thing is certain: EXPECT US! #Megaupload".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segall|first1=Laurie|title=Anonymous strikes back after feds shut down piracy hub Megaupload|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/19/technology/megaupload_shutdown/|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=CNN|date=January 20, 2012|authorlink=Laurie Segall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next few hours, several other websites were knocked offline and kept offline. These included websites belonging to the [[RIAA|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]], the [[MPAA|Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)]] and the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan-Nichols|first1=Steven J.|title=How Anonymous took down the DoJ, RIAA, MPAA and Universal Music Websites|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-anonymous-took-down-the-doj-riaa-mpaa-and-universal-music-websites/|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=zdnet.com|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, as the day drew to a close, the website belonging to the [[FBI]] was hit repeatedly before it ultimately succumbed to attacks and acquired a “Tango Down” status. Anonymous claimed that it was "the single largest Internet attack in its history", while it was reported that as many as 27,000 user agents were taking part in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anonymous Takes Down FBI, RIAA, DOJ and White House Following Megaupload Closure|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Anonymous-Takes-Down-FBI-RIAA-DOJ-and-White-House-Following-MegaUpload-Closure-247641.shtml|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Sofpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kovacs|first1=Eduard|title=27,000 Computers Participating in OpMegaupload DDoS Attack (Exclusive)|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/27-000-Computers-Participating-in-OpMegaupload-DDoS-Attack-Exclusive-247709.shtml|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Softpedia|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">'''Johann Friedrich Flatt''' (20 February 1759 – 24 November 1821) was a German Protestant [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] born in [[Tübingen]]. His brother, Karl Christian Flatt (1772–1813), was also a theologian.
[[File:Johann Friedrich Flatt - Theologe.jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Friedrich Flatt (1759–1821)]]
He studied philosophy and theology in Tübingen, afterwards continuing his education in [[Göttingen]]. In 1785 he became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Tübingen]], where in 1792 he was appointed as an associate professor of theology.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;[http://www.manchester.edu/kant/bio/bioUni.htm Index of Professors at German-Speaking Universities] biographical information&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 he succeeded [[Gottlob Christian Storr]] (1746–1805) as a full professor of theology at Tübingen.&lt;ref name=DE&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz16361.html Johann Friedrich Flatt] @ NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a disciple of [[Gottlob Christian Storr]], and like his mentor, a representative of the so-called ''Ältere Tübinger Schule'' (conservative Tübingen school of theologians) of Biblical [[Supranatural]]ism. He is remembered as a defender of [[Christian morality|Christian moral theology]], and for his critical lectures in regard to [[Kantian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=MA/&gt;&lt;ref name=DE/&gt;

Along with [[Friedrich Gottlieb Süskind]], he was an editor of the "''Magazin für christliche Dogmatik und Moral''" (Magazine of Christian [[Dogmatics]] and Morals).&lt;ref name=DE/&gt;

'''Julia Indichova''' is an American reproductive healthcare activist and author. She is best known for her book ''Inconceivable: A Woman’s Triumph Over Despair and Statistics'' (2001), which was hailed by [[Library Journal]] as  “an important consumer health resource…the first such book written from the patient’s point of view.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/579349/book-reviews-science-technology Library Journal Book Review of 'Inconceivable: Winning the Fertility Game,' by Julia Indichova]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Indichova founded FertileHeart.com, a global, patient driven community, focused on health enhancing approaches to [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronogram.com/hudsonvalley/being-fertile/Content?oid=2167382 Being Fertile] ''Chronogram.'' July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Indichova’s second book, ''The Fertile Female: How the Power of Longing for a Child Can Save Your Life and Change the World'' (2007), documents the evolution of ''The Fertile Heart™  Ovum Practice'',  an original mind body program that grew out of Indichova’s personal experience and her work with women and couples who sought her guidance after the publication of ''Inconceivable''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleafbookgroup.com/author/julia-indichova/232 GreenLeaf Book Group] ''Biography of Julia Indichova''&lt;/ref&gt; In the last two decades a growing number of studies and leading [[reproductive endocrinologist]]s have validated Indichova’s whole-person approach to overcoming [[infertility]].

==Biography==

Julia Indichova was born and raised in [[Košice]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]]. Her older brother, two grandmothers and an aunt were murdered by the Nazis and both of her parents were [[concentration camp]] survivors. Attempting to come to terms with this legacy of violence has been a driving force in her life from an early age.

Indichova started working as a professional actress at the age of ten, and went on to study acting at the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava]]. In June 1969, a year after the [[1968 Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia]], she immigrated to the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronogram.com/hudsonvalley/being-fertile/Content?oid=2167382 Being Fertile] ''Chronogram.'' July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Theater Arts and Russian from [[Montclair State College]].

For the next fifteen years Indichova worked in the post-production film department of the [[American Broadcasting Company]], and later as an actress, dancer, director and producer in [[New York City]] and the [[New York Metropolitan area]].

In 1985 Indichova received her MA in [[English as a second or foreign language|TESOL]] (teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) from [[Hunter College]] in New York.  In the following years, she taught English at [[Columbia University]]'s American Language Program, and at the International English Language Institute at [[Hunter College]]. She also taught Russian, German, French and Latin, in the New York City public school system.

==Overcoming infertility==
In 1992 Indichova was diagnosed with irreversible [[secondary infertility]] attributed to soaring [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels.  After a futile quest for a more hopeful prognosis, she embarked on a pilgrimage of research and rigorous self-examination. In 1994, at age 44 she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, conceived naturally, in direct contradiction of all that medical dogma of the day declared possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wamc.org/post/art-conception The art of conception] ''WAMC Northeast Public Radio: The Women's Perspective.'' March 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indichova’s desire to share what she learned with women who sought her help led her to create in 1997 ''The Fertile Heart™ Ovum Mind Body Program'', and launched her work as a reproductive health care educator and activist and established www.fertileheart.com, as one of the most trusted, independent consumer advocacy communities not sponsored by pharmaceutical companies or IVF clinics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronogram.com/hudsonvalley/being-fertile/Content?oid=2167382 Being Fertile] ''Chronogram.'' July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Indichova’s seminar, a seven-hour program of [[guided imagery]], movement, [[dreamwork]] and instruction on nutrition, aims to identify and resolve inner blocks to conception, be they physical, emotional or spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoparent.com/magazines/chicago-parent/2008-june/the-maze-of-medicine The Maze of Medicine] September 1, 2009. ''Chicago Parent Magazine.''&lt;/ref&gt; For many women, as with the women featured in the Fertile Heart Video,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V5TPCCaPuI Fertility Success Stories] Youtube.com. Retrieved December 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the process not only eliminates the need for technology and pharmaceuticals, but inspires a radical shift in lifestyle and self-care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstimes.com/default/article/Ridgefield-couple-s-growing-family-credited-to-481388.php#photo-168905 Ridgefield couple's growing family credited to holistic healing that sparked fertility] ''Newstimes.com.'' May 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Indichova’s second book, ''The Fertile Female:  How The Power Of Longing For A Child Can Save Your Life And Change The World'' (2007), documents her work with thousands of women and couples who sought her guidance after the publication of ''Inconceivable''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronogram.com/hudsonvalley/being-fertile/Content?oid=2167382 Being Fertile] ''Chronogram.'' July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional projects===
After [[9/11]], Julia Indichova initiated a series of peace projects, applying the ideas of her mind-body program to the peace effort.

==International recognition==
Although her approach was initially met with skepticism in the medical community, over the last ten years a growing body of scientific literature has come to support Indichova’s findings.
In March 1999, ''[[The Journal of Reproductive Medicine for the Obstetrician and Gynecologist]]'' (Vol. 44, No. 3) published a review of recent studies titled “The Impact Of Lifestyle Choices On Female Infertility,” calling for patient education in the areas of [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]], and weight management. That same year, another medical journal, Fertility and Sterility, suggested that gynecologists become more familiar with studies on [[nutrition]], and in this way help their patients avoid the burden of costly medical procedures.
A direct relationship between atmospheric contamination and [[human reproduction]] was identified in a study by the medical school at the [[University of Sao Paulo]], in Brazil.  In 2003, a study conducted by Dr. Sarah Berga, published in the journal ''[[Fertility and Sterility]]'', titled “The Effect Of Chronic Stress Related To Behaviour And Personality,” validated the emotional aspects of the ''Fertile Heart™ Ovum Program''.

Julia Indichova’s books and workshops have been endorsed by leading specialists in [[reproductive endocrinology and infertility|reproductive endocrinology]], and her story and program was featured on the [[Oprah Winfrey Show]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmC47HSwWpk Getting Pregnant with High FSH: Julia Indichova on The Oprah Winfrey Show] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Good Morning America]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpaDABAtdI4 Julia Indichova on Good Morning America] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Pure Oxygen Television series,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apvKkA9g1bo High FSH &amp; Pregnancy: Tips for Getting Pregnant (Julia Indichova interviewed on Pure Oxygen)] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Discovery Health Channel|Discovery Health]], Health magazine, [[USA Today]], [[San Francisco Chronicle]] and other outlets. Early in 2014, Indichova was mentioned in a [[New York Times]] parenting blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/for-treatments-some-unexpected-help-from-a-stranger/#more-49342 Fertility Diary: I.V.F. in Israel, With Unexpected Help from a Stranger] ''New&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Richard Marrs, Medical Director of the Center for Assisted Reproductive Medicine at Santa Monica-[[UCLA Medical Center]], asserts that Indichova's story and work are a brilliant example of the impact of the mind-body connection.&lt;ref&gt;Indichova, Julia. Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics. New York: Broadway, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Sami David,&lt;ref&gt;[http://samidavid.com/about-david/ Sami David Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; an internationally recognized fertility specialist, and Marc Goldstein, M.D., F.A.C.S., Professor of Reproductive Medicine at [[Cornell University]], [[Weill Medical College]], are among the many health care providers who have praised Indichova’s pioneering work.&lt;ref&gt;Indichova, Julia. Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics. ''Endorsements,'' New York: Broadway, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her forward to Inconceivable, [[New York Times]] best-selling author Dr. Christiane Northrup writes:  “Each of us is part of the culture in which we were born and raised and we are influenced in body, mind, and spirit by that culture throughout our lives. At the same time, cultures change, evolve and heal because of the courage of individuals. Julia Indichova is one of those individuals. Let her be an inspiration for you of how to trust yourself, heal yourself and reconnect with the wonder of your body and all of its possibilities.” &lt;ref&gt;Indichova, Julia. Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics. New York: Broadway, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Indichova was invited to keynote the first ''Mind Body Fertility Conference''&lt;ref&gt;[http://msfconference.ca Mind Body Fertility Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027142244/http://msfconference.ca/ |date=2014-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by Mount Sinai Centre for Fertility and Reproductive Health in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/life/2014/10/17/mindbody_fertility_conference_to_help_infertile_couples.html Mind-Body Fertility Conference to help infertile couples] ''The Star''.

'''Manichaeism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|n|ᵻ|ˈ|k|iː|ɪ|z|əm}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|manichaeism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in [[Modern Persian]] {{lang|fa|آیین مانی}} ''Āyin-e Māni''; {{zh|c={{linktext|摩|尼|教}}|p={{linktext|Mó|ní |Jiào}}}}) was a major religious movement that was founded by the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362129/Mani |title=Mani (Iranian prophet) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (in {{lang-fa|مانی}}, [[Syriac language|Syriac]]: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="ltr"&gt;[[wikt:ܡܐܢܝ|ܡܐܢܝ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/mɑni/}}, [[Latin]]: ''Manichaeus'' or ''Manes'' from {{lang-grc-koi|Μάνης}}; {{circa}} 216–276) in the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~sbriggs/Britannica/manichaeism.htm |title=Manichaeism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm |title=Manichaeism |publisher=New Advent Encyclopedia |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism taught an elaborate [[dualistic cosmology]] describing the [[conflict between good and evil|struggle]] between a [[goodness and value theory|good]], spiritual world of light, and an [[evil]], material world of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-iii|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY iii. In Manicheism|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|quote=[I]n Manicheism the world was a prison for demons...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Widengren, Geo ''Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion'', Lundequistska bokhandeln, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking regions.&lt;ref name="BeDuhnMirecki2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason BeDuhn|author2=Paul Allan Mirecki|title=Frontiers of Faith: The Christian Encounter With Manichaeism in the Acts of Archelaus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQd8b5s5QBUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16180-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as [[China]] and as far west as the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Welburn, ''Mani, the Angel and the Column of Glory: An Anthology of Manichaean Texts'' (Edinburgh: Floris Books, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly the main rival to [[Christianity]] before the spread of Islam in the competition to replace [[Hellenistic religion|classical paganism]]. Manichaeism survived longer in the east than in the west, and it appears to have finally faded away after the 14th century in [[south China]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason BeDuhn|Jason David BeDuhn]] ''The Manichaean Body: In Discipline and Ritual'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2000 republished 2002 p.IX&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary to the decline of the [[Church of the East]] in [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]]. While most of Manichaeism's original writings have been lost, numerous translations and fragmentary texts have survived.

An adherent of Manichaeism is called a ''Manichaean'' or ''Manichean'', or ''Manichee'', especially in older sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers First Series, ed. Philip Schaff, writing of Augustine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Manichaean Merriam-Webster ─ Manichaean]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life of Mani===

[[File:Painting of Mani’s Birth.jpg|thumb|[[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Chinese]] silk painting ''Mani's Birth''.]]
{{main|Mani (prophet)}}
Mani was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians: their religious beliefs and practices'', Routledge, 2001. p. 111: "He was Iranian, of noble Parthian blood..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Ball, ''Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire'', Routledge, 2001. p. 437: "Manichaeism was a syncretic religion, proclaimed by the Iranian Prophet Mani...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|According to the ''Fehrest'', Mani was of [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] stock on both his father's and his mother's sides, at least if the readings al-ḥaskāniya (Mani's father) and al-asʿāniya (Mani's mother) are corrected to al-aškāniya and al-ašḡāniya (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, ll. 2 and 3) respectively. The forefathers of Mani's father are said to have been from Hamadan and so perhaps of Iranian origin (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, 5–6). The ''Chinese Compendium'', which makes the father a local king, maintains that his mother was from the house Jinsajian, explained by Henning as the Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan (Henning, 1943, p. 52, n. 4 1977, II, p. 115). Is that fact, or fiction, or both? The historicity of this tradition is assumed by most, but the possibility that Mani's noble Arsacid background is legendary cannot be ruled out (cf. Scheftelowitz, 1933, pp. 403–4). In any case, it is characteristic that Mani took pride in his origin from time-honored [[Babylon|Babel]], but never claimed affiliation to the Iranian upper class.|{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in 216 in or near [[Seleucia]]-[[Ctesiphon]] (now [[al-Mada'in]]) in the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kevin Coyle|title=Manichaeism and Its Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnFz3tI0qOwC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=27 August 2012|date=15 September 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17574-7|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]'',&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"&gt;L. Koenen and C. Römer, eds., ''Der Kölner Mani-Kodex. Über das Werden seines Leibes. Kritische Edition'', (Abhandlung der Reinisch-Westfälischen Akademie der Wissenschaften: Papyrologica Coloniensia '''14''') (Opladen, Germany) 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Mani's parents were members of the [[Jewish Christian]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[sect]] known as the [[Elcesaites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mani composed seven works, six of which were written in the [[Syriac language]], a late variety of Aramaic. The seventh, the ''[[Shabuhragan]]'',&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"&gt;Middle Persian Sources: D. N. MacKenzie, ''Mani's Šābuhragān'', pt. 1 (text and translation), BSOAS 42/3, 1979, pp. 500–34, pt. 2 (glossary and plates), BSOAS 43/2, 1980, pp. 288–310.&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Mani in [[Middle Persian]] and presented by him to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]]. Although there is no proof Shapur I was a Manichaean, he tolerated the spread of Manichaeism and refrained from persecuting it within his empire's boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Welburn (1998), pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one tradition, it was Mani himself who invented the unique version of the Syriac script known as the [[Manichaean alphabet]]{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}, which was used in all of the Manichaean works written within the Sasanian Empire, whether they were in Syriac or [[Middle Persian]], and also for most of the works written within the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. The primary language of [[Babylon]] (and the administrative and cultural language of the Sassanid Empire) at that time was [[Middle Aramaic|Eastern Middle Aramaic]], which included three main dialects: [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] (the language of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]), [[Mandaic language|Mandaean]] (the language of [[Mandaeism]]), and Syriac, which was the language of Mani, as well as of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

While Manichaeism was spreading, existing religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]] were still popular and [[Christianity]] was gaining social and political influence. Although having fewer adherents, Manichaeism won the support of many high-ranking political figures. With the assistance of the Sasanian Empire, Mani began missionary expeditions. After failing to win the favour of the next generation of Persian royalty, and incurring the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani is reported to have died in prison awaiting execution by the Persian Emperor [[Bahram I]]. The date of his death is estimated at 276–277.&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt;

[[File:Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation. Cathayan Manichaean silk painting, 13th-century.jpg|thumb|''[[Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation]]'', 13th-century Chinese Manichaean silk painting.]]
Mani believed that the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], and [[Jesus]] were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the "Religion of Light".&lt;ref name="Coyle2009" /&gt; Manichaean writings indicate that Mani received revelations when he was 12 and again when he was 24, and over this time period he grew dissatisfied with the Elcesaite sect he was born into.&lt;ref name="Reeves1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Reeves|title=Heralds of That Good Realm: Syro-Mesopotamian Gnosis and Jewish Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewM1xTuRQaoC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10459-4|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mani began preaching at an early age and was possibly influenced by contemporary Babylonian-Aramaic movements such as Mandaeism, and Aramaic translations of [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalyptic writings]] similar to those found at [[Qumran]] (such as the [[book of Enoch]] literature), and by the Syriac dualist-gnostic writer [[Bardaisan]] (who lived a generation before Mani). With the discovery of the Mani-Codex, it also became clear that he was raised in a Jewish-Christian baptism sect, the [[Elcesaites]], and was influenced by their writings, as well. According to biographies preserved by [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and the Persian [[polymath]] [[al-Biruni]], he received a revelation as a youth from a spirit, whom he would later call his Twin ({{lang-arc|[[wikt:תאומא|תאומא]]}} {{ipa|tɑʔwmɑ}}, from which is also derived the name of the [[Thomas the Apostle]], the "twin"), his ''Syzygos'' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σύζυγος|σύζυγος]]}} "spouse, partner", in the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''), his Double, his Protective Angel or Divine Self. It taught him truths that he developed into a religion. His divine Twin or true Self brought Mani to [[self-realization]]. He claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]] of the Truth'', as promised by Jesus in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutkemeyer |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |title=THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE (Jn. 16:7-15) |jstor=43719890|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=220–229 |doi= |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism's views on Jesus are described by historians:
{{quote|Jesus in Manichaeism possessed three separate identities: (1) Jesus the Luminous, (2) Jesus the Messiah and (3) Jesus patibilis (the suffering Jesus). (1) As Jesus the Luminous... his primary role was as supreme revealer and guide and it was he who woke Adam from his slumber and revealed to him the divine origins of his soul and its painful captivity by the body and mixture with matter. Jesus the Messiah was a historical being who was the prophet of the Jews and the forerunner of Mani. However, the Manichaeans believed he was wholly divine. He never experienced human birth as notions of physical conception and birth filled the Manichaeans with horror and the Christian doctrine of virgin birth was regarded as equally obscene. Since he was the light of the world, where was this light, they asked, when he was in the womb of the Virgin? (2) Jesus the Messiah was truly born at his baptism as it was on that occasion that the Father openly acknowledged his sonship. The suffering, death and resurrection of this Jesus were in appearance only as they had no salvific value but were an exemplum of the suffering and eventual deliverance of the human soul and a prefiguration of Mani's own martyrdom. (3) The pain suffered by the imprisoned Light-Particles in the whole of the visible universe, on the other hand, was real and immanent. This was symbolized by the ''mystic placing of the Cross whereby the wounds of the passion of our souls are set forth''. On this mystical Cross of Light was suspended the Suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis) who was ''the life and salvation of Man''. This mystica cruxificio was present in every tree, herb, fruit, vegetable and even stones and the soil. This constant and universal suffering of the captive soul is exquisitely expressed in one of the Coptic Manichaean psalms.&lt;ref name="SNC Lieu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China |first=Samuel N.

Historians also note that Mani declared himself to be an "apostle of Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=57nFeeC3GKoC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=Mani+declared+he+was+an+apostle+of+Jesus#v=onepage&amp;q=Mani%20declared%20he%20was%20an%20apostle%20of%20Jesus&amp;f=false |title=The Manichean Debate, by Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo) |accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9781565482470|year=2006|last1=) |first1=Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, [[Krishna]], Zoroaster, and Jesus.&lt;ref name="Silkspice.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkspice.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=The movement of the Manichaean tradition along the Silk Road |publisher=Silkspice.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Other than incorporating the symbols and doctrine of dominant religious traditions, Manichaeism also incorporated the symbols and deities of indigenous traditions, in particular the [[Hindu]] deity [[Ganesha]] into its fold, demonstrated by the image available in the article, "Manichaean Art and Calligraphy" by Hans-Joachim Klimkeit. Mani was claiming to be the reincarnation of the Buddha, Lord Krishna, Zoroaster and Jesus depending on the context in which he was carrying out his preachings. Such strategic claims fostered a spirit of toleration among the Manichaeans and the other religious communities and this particular feature greatly assisted them in gaining the approval of authorities to practice in different regions along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="Silkspice.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkspice.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=The movement of the Manichaean tradition along the Silk Road |publisher=Silkspice.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics also note that since much of what is known about Manichaeism comes from later 10th- and 11th-century Muslim historians like [[Al-Biruni]] and especially [[ibn al-Nadim]] (and his ''Fihrist''), "Islamic authors ascribed to Mani the claim to be the Seal of the Prophets."&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|eschatology-ii|ESCHATOLOGY ii. Manichean Eschatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, for Mani the expression "seal of prophecy" refers to his disciples, who testify for the veracity of his message, as a seal does.&lt;ref&gt;C. Colpe, ''Das Siegel der Propheten: historische Beziehungen zwischen Judentum, Judenchristentum, Heidentum und frühem Islam'', Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Theologie und Zeitgeschichte, 3 (Berlin: Institut Kirche und judentum, 1990), 227-43; G.G. Stroumsa, ''The Making of the Abrahamic Religions in Late Antiquity'', Oxford Studies in the Abrahamic Religions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ManichaeanElectaeKocho10thCentury.jpg|thumb|10th century Manichaean Electae in [[Gaochang]] (Khocho), China.]]
Another source of Mani's scriptures was original Aramaic writings relating to the ''Book of Enoch'' literature (see the [[Book of Enoch]] and the [[Second Book of Enoch]]), as well as an otherwise unknown section of the Book of Enoch called ''[[The Book of Giants]]''. This book was quoted directly, and expanded on by Mani, becoming one of the original six Syriac writings of the Manichaean Church. Besides brief references by non-Manichaean authors through the centuries, no original sources of ''The Book of Giants'' (which is actually part six of the Book of Enoch) were available until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Scattered fragments of both the original Aramaic "Book of Giants" (which were analyzed and published by [[Józef Milik]] in 1976)&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Milik, ed. and trans., ''The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Manichaean version of the same name (analyzed and published by [[Walter Bruno Henning]] in 1943)&lt;ref name="Henning"&gt;In: Henning, W. B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52–74.&lt;/ref&gt; were found with the discovery in the twentieth century of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the Judaean Desert and the Manichaean writings of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] Manichaean kingdom in [[Turpan]]. Henning wrote in his analysis of them:

{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of [[Sām]], [[Nariman (Shahnameh)|Narīmān]], etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;}}

By comparing the cosmology in the Book of Enoch literature and the Book of Giants, alongside the description of the Manichaean myth, scholars have observed that the Manichaean cosmology can be described as being based, in part, on the description of the cosmology developed in detail in the Book of Enoch literature.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, John C. ''Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This literature describes the being that the prophets saw in their ascent to heaven, as a king who sits on a throne at the highest of the heavens. In the Manichaean description, this being, the "Great King of Honor", becomes a deity who guards the entrance to the world of light, placed at the seventh of ten heavens.&lt;ref&gt;See Henning, ''A Sogdian Fragment of the Manichaean Cosmogony'', BSOAS, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aramaic Book of Enoch, in the Qumran writings in general, and in the original Syriac section of Manichaean scriptures quoted by [[Theodore bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; he is called "malka raba de-ikara" (the Great King of Honor).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Mani was also influenced by writings of the Assyrian gnostic [[Bardaisan]] (154–222), who, like Mani, wrote in Syriac, and presented a dualistic interpretation of the world in terms of light and darkness, in combination with elements from Christianity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Akshobya in His Eastern Paradise with Cross of Light.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Akshobhya]] in the [[Abhirati]] with the Cross of Light, a symbol of Manichaeism.]]
Noting Mani's travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] (several religious paintings in [[Bamyan]] are attributed to him) at the beginning of his proselytizing career, [[Richard Foltz]] postulates Buddhist influences in Manichaeism:
{{quote|Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the "elect") and lay followers (the "hearers") who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist [[sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 71 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] began translating [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhist]] texts into Chinese in the century prior to Mani arriving there, and the Chinese texts of Manichaeism are full of uniquely Buddhist terms taken directly from these Chinese Pure Land scriptures, including the term "[[pure land]]" (淨土 Jìngtǔ) itself.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bryder, ''The Chinese Transformation of Manichaeism: A Study of Chinese Manichaean Terminology'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central object of veneration in Pure Land Buddhism, [[Amitābha]], the Buddha of Infinite Light, does not appear in [[Chinese Manichaeism]], and seems to have been replaced by another deity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Spread===
[[File:Spread of Manicheanism.png|alt=|thumb|310x310px|The spread of Manichaeism (300–500). ''World History Atlas'', Dorling Kindersly.]]
Manichaeism spread with extraordinary speed through both the East and West. It reached Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280, who was also in [[Egypt]] in 244 and 251. It was flourishing in the [[Faiyum]] in 290.

Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 during the time of [[Pope Miltiades]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 291, persecution arose in the Sasanian Empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by Emperor [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, [[Diocletian]] decreed against the Manichaeans: "We order that their organizers and leaders be subject to the final penalties and condemned to the fire with their abominable scriptures." This resulted in martyrdom for many in Egypt and [[North Africa]] (see [[Diocletianic Persecution#Manichean persecution|Diocletian Persecution]]). By 354, [[Hilary of Poitiers]] wrote that Manichaeism was a significant force in [[Roman Gaul]]. In 381, Christians requested [[Theodosius I]] to strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. Starting in 382, the emperor issued a series of edicts to suppress Manichaeism and punish its followers.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel (1992) ''Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China'' 2d edition, pp. 145-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo]] was once a Manichaean.]]
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) converted to Christianity from Manichaeism in the year 387. This was shortly after the Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391. Due to the heavy persecution, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt; According to his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', after nine or ten years of adhering to the Manichaean faith as a member of the group of "hearers", Augustine became a Christian and a potent adversary of Manichaeism (which he expressed in writing against his Manichaean opponent [[Faustus of Mileve]]), seeing their beliefs that knowledge was the key to salvation as too passive and not able to effect any change in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=418 |title=St. Augustine of Hippo |publisher=Catholic.org |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I still thought that it is not we who sin but some other nature that sins within us. It flattered my pride to think that I incurred no guilt and, when I did wrong, not to confess it... I preferred to excuse myself and blame this unknown thing which was in me but was not part of me. The truth, of course, was that it was all my own self, and my own impiety had divided me against myself. My sin was all the more incurable because I did not think myself a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions, Book V, Section 10''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some modern scholars have suggested that Manichaean ways of thinking influenced the development of some of Augustine's ideas, such as the nature of good and evil, the idea of hell, the separation of groups into elect, hearers, and sinners, and the hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and his dualistic theology.&lt;ref&gt;A. Adam, ''Das Fortwirken des Manichäismus bei Augustin''. In: ZKG (69) 1958, S. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; These influences of Manichaeism in Augustine's Christian thinking may well have been part of the conflict between Augustine and [[Pelagius]], a British monk whose theology, being less influenced by the [[Latin Church]], was non-dualistic, and one that saw the created order, and mankind in particular, as having a Divine core, rather than a 'darkness' at its core.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century manuscript from Augustine's book VII of ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' criticizing Manichaeism.]]
How Manichaeism might have influenced Christianity continues to be debated. Manichaeism could have influenced the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], and [[Catharism|Cathars]]. However, these groups left few records, and the link between them and Manichaeans is tenuous. Regardless of its accuracy, the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to make contemporary heresies conform to those combatted by the church fathers. Whether the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of the Paulicians, Bogomils, and Cathars and their belief that the world was created by a Satanic [[demiurge]] were due to influence from Manichaeism is impossible to determine. The Cathars apparently adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization. [[Priscillian]] and his followers may also have been influenced by Manichaeism. The Manichaeans preserved many [[apocrypha]]l Christian works, such as the [[Acts of Thomas]], that would otherwise have been lost.&lt;ref name="Runciman"&gt;Runciman, Steven, ''The Medieval Manichee: a study of the Christian dualist heresy''. Cambridge University Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in the west ([[Mesopotamia]], [[Africa]], [[Spain]], [[France]], North [[Italy]], the [[Balkans]]) for a thousand years, and flourished for a time in Persia and even further east in Northern [[India]], Western China, and [[Tibet]]. While it had long been thought that Manichaeism arrived in China only at the end of the 7th century, a recent archaeological discovery demonstrated that it was already known there in the second half of the 6th century.&lt;ref name="La Vaissiere"&gt;Étienne de la Vaissière, "Mani en Chine au VIe siècle", ''Journal asiatique'', 293–1 (2005): 357–378.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Song Dynasty, the Manichaeans were derogatorily referred by the Chinese as ''chicai simo'' (meaning that they "abstain from meat and worship demons"). An account in ''Fozu Tongji'', an important historiography of Buddhism in China compiled by Buddhist scholars during 1258-1269, says that the Manichaens worshipped the "white Buddha" and their leader wore a violet headgear, while the followers wore white costumes. Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song government and were eventually quelled.

Manichaeism claimed to present the complete version of teachings that were corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zoroaster, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contained stories of Jesus. When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian [[yazata]]s. Thus ''Abbā dəRabbūṯā'' ("The Father of Greatness", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in [[Middle Persian]] texts might either be translated literally as ''pīd ī wuzurgīh'', or substituted with the name of the deity ''[[Zurvan|Zurwān]]''. Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure ''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' "The Original Man" was rendered ''Ohrmazd Bay'', after the Zoroastrian god [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]]. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with [[Chinese Buddhism]], where, for example, the original Aramaic {{lang|arc|קריא}} ''qaryā'' (the "call" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with [[Guanyin]] ({{script|Hant|觀音}} or [[Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, literally, "watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]", the [[bodhisattva]] of Compassion).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Persecution and extinction===
Manichaeism was repressed by the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt; In 291, persecution arose in the Persian empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, the Roman emperor [[Diocletian]] decreed all the Manichaean leaders to be burnt alive along with the Manichaean scriptures and many Manichaeans in Europe and North Africa were killed. This policy of persecution was also followed by his successors. [[Theodosius I]] issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bI9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361|title= Faiths Across Time: 5000 years of Religious History|author= J. Gordon Melton|publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]]|year= 2014|page= 361|isbn= 9781610690263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion was vigorously attacked and persecuted by both the [[Catholic Church|Christian Church]] and the Roman state. [[Augustine of Hippo]], one of the early Doctors of the Catholic Church was a Manichaean until his conversion to Christianity in 386. He was never persecuted for this and he freely converted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Due to the heavy persecution upon its followers in the Roman Empire, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the sixth century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA689|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|author= [[Wendy Doniger]]|publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]]|year= 1999|pages= 689, 690|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 732, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] banned any Chinese from converting to the religion, saying it was a heretic religion that was confusing people by claiming to be Buddhism. However the foreigners who followed the religion were allowed to practice it without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cO7g4WBBK9YC&amp;pg=PA182|title= Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, AD 600-1200, Parts 600–1200|first= Xinru|last= Liu|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1997|page= 182|isbn= 9780195644524}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, which was the chief patron of Manichaeism (which was also the state religion of the Khaganate) in China, all Manichaean temples in China except in the two capitals and [[Taiyuan]] were closed down and never reopened since these temples were viewed as a symbol of foreign arrogance by the Chinese (see [[Cao'an]].) Even those that were allowed to remain open did not for long. The Manichaean temples were attacked by Chinese people who burned the images and idols of these temples. Manichaean priests were ordered to wear [[hanfu]] instead of their traditional clothing, which was viewed as un-Chinese. In 843, [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] gave the order to kill all Manichaean clerics as part of his [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], and over half died. They were made to look like Buddhists by the authorities, their heads were shaved, they were made to dress like [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and then killed.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt; Although the religion was mostly forbidden and its followers persecuted thereafter in China, it survived till the 14th century in the country. Under the [[Song dynasty]], its followers were derogatorily referred to with the [[chengyu]] {{lang|zh|吃菜祀魔}} ({{zh|p=chī cài sì mó}}) "vegetarian demon-worshippers".

Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song dynasty. They were quelled by Song China and were suppressed and persecuted by all successive governments before the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. In 1370, the religion was banned through an edict of the [[Ming dynasty]], whose [[Hongwu Emperor]] had a personal dislike for the religion.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xisha2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O_vnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261|title= Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China: A Historical Survey|author= Samuel N.C.

According to [[Wendy Doniger]], Manichaeism may have continued to exist in the modern-[[East Turkestan]] region until the [[Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai|Mongol conquest in the 13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA690|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|author= [[Wendy Doniger]]|publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]]|year= 1999|page= 690|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manicheans also suffered persecution for some time under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. In 780, the third Abbasid Caliph, [[al-Mahdi]], started a campaign of inquisition against those who were "dualist heretics" or "Manichaeans" called the ''zindīq''. He appointed a "master of the heretics" ({{lang-ar|الزنادقة صاحب}} ''ṣāhib al-zanādiqa''), an official whose task was to pursue and investigate suspected dualists, who were then examined by the Caliph. Those found guilty who refused to abjure their beliefs were executed. This persecution continued under his successor, Caliph [[al-Hadi]], and continued for some time during reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]], who finally abolished it and ended it.&lt;ref name="Christine"/&gt; During the reign of the 18th Abbassid Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]], many Manichaeans fled from [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from fear of persecution by him and about 500 of them assembled in [[Samarkand]]. The base of the religion was later shifted to this city, which became their new Patriarchate.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YdUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA658|title= Papers in Honor of Professor Mary Boyce|author= Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, Pierre Lecoq|publisher= [[Brill Publishers]]|year= 1985|page= 658|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later movements accused of "Neo-Manichaeism"===
During the Middle Ages, several movements emerged that were collectively described as "Manichaean" by the Catholic Church, and persecuted as Christian heresies through the establishment, in 1184, of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Stroumsa|Stroumsa, Gedaliahu G.]], ''Anti-Cathar Polemics and the Liber de duobus principiis'', in B. Lewis and F. Niewöhner, eds., Religionsgespräche im Mittelalter (Wolfenbütteler Mittelalter-Studien, 4; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1992), 169–183, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; They included the [[Cathar]] churches of Western Europe. Other groups sometimes referred to as "neo-Manichaean" were the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Paulicians |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Runciman"/&gt; An example of this usage can be found in the published edition of the Latin Cathar text, the ''Liber de duobus principiis'' (''Book of the Two Principles''), which was described as "Neo-Manichaean" by its publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no presence of Manichaean mythology or church terminology in the writings of these groups, there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Albigenses |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and beliefs==
===General===
Mani's teaching dealt with the origin of evil,&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt; by addressing a theoretical part of the [[problem of evil]] by denying the omnipotence of God and postulating two opposite powers. Manichaean theology taught a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] view of good and evil. A key belief in Manichaeism is that the powerful, though not omnipotent good power (God), was opposed by the semi-eternal evil power (Satan). Humanity, the world and the soul are seen as the byproduct of the battle between God's proxy, Primal Man, and Satan. The human person is seen as a battleground for these powers: the soul defines the person, but it is under the influence of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. This contention plays out over the world as well as the human body—neither the Earth nor the flesh were seen as intrinsically evil, but rather possessed portions of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. Natural phenomena (such as rain) were seen as the physical manifestation of this spiritual contention. Therefore, the Manichaean worldview explained the existence of evil by positing a flawed creation in the formation of which God took no part and which constituted rather the product of a rebellion by Satan against God.&lt;ref name="Bevan, A. A. 1930"&gt;Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''[[Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics]]'', Volume VIII Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism presented an elaborate description of the conflict between the spiritual world of light and the material world of darkness. The beings of both the world of darkness and the world of light have names. There are numerous sources for the details of the Manichaean belief. There are two portions of Manichaean scriptures that are probably the closest thing to the original Manichaean writings in their original languages that will ever be available. These are the Syriac-Aramaic quotation by the [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] [[Theodore bar Konai]], in his Syriac "Book of [[Scholia]]" (''Ketba de-Skolion''z, 8th century),&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; and the Middle Persian sections of Mani's [[Shabuhragan]] discovered at [[Turpan]] (a summary of Mani's teachings prepared for [[Shapur I]]&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt;). These two sections are probably the original Syriac and Middle Persian written by Mani.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

From these and other sources, it is possible to derive an almost complete description of the detailed Manichaean vision&lt;ref&gt;A completely sourced description (built around bar-Khoni's account, with additional sources), is found in: Jonas, Hans ''The Gnostic Religion'', 1958, Ch. 9: ''Creation, World History, Salvation According to Mani''.&lt;/ref&gt; (a complete list of Manichaean deities is outlined below). According to Mani, the unfolding of the universe takes place with three "creations":{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''The First Creation''': Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the ''World of Light'', ruled by the ''Father of Greatness'' together with his five ''Shekhinas'' (divine attributes of light), and the other the ''World of Darkness'', ruled by the ''King of Darkness''. At a certain point, the ''Kingdom of Darkness'' notices the ''World of Light'', becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The ''Father of Greatness'', in the first of three "creations" (or "calls"), calls to the ''Mother of Life'', who sends her son ''Original Man'' (''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the ''Demon of Greed''. The ''Original Man'' is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five ''Shekhinas''), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of "bait" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the ''Original Man'' comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.

'''The Second Creation''': Then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Second Creation'', calling to the ''Living Spirit'', who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the ''Original Man'' (''Call'' then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (''Answer'' becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the ''Original Man'' to the ''World of Light''. The ''Mother of Life'', the ''Living Spirit'', and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the ''World of Darkness'', together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the ''World of Darkness'' and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the ''World of Darkness''. The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the [[Milky Way]], and eventually back to the ''World of Light''.

[[File:Analysis of Doctrinal Iconography of Mani’s Cosmology.jpg|thumb|400px|An analysis on Mani's cosmology.]]
'''The Third Creation''': Great demons (called ''[[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]]'' in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Third Creation''. Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the ''Third Messenger'' and the ''Virgins of Light''. However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions – the source of [[fallen angel]]s in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The ''Father of Greatness'' then sends the ''Radiant Jesus'' to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the ''World of Light'' to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies.

===Outline of the beings and events in the Manichaean mythos===
[[File:Manichaean picture from cave 25 at Bezeklik Caves.jpg|thumb|Worshiping the Tree of Life in the Kingdom of Light.]]
Beginning with the time of its creation by Mani, the Manichaean religion had a detailed description of deities and events that took place within the Manichaean scheme of the universe. In every language and region that Manichaeism spread to, these same deities reappear, whether it is in the original Syriac quoted by Theodore bar Konai,&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; or the Latin terminology given by Saint Augustine from Mani's ''[[Fundamental Epistle|Epistola Fundamenti]]'', or the Persian and Chinese translations found as Manichaeism spread eastward. While the original Syriac retained the original description that Mani created, the transformation of the deities through other languages and cultures produced incarnations of the deities not implied in the original Syriac writings. This process began in Mani's lifetime, with "The Father of Greatness", for example, being translated into Middle Persian as [[Zurvanism|Zurvan]], a Zoroastrian supreme being.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== The Manichaean Church ==
=== Organization ===
The Manichaean Church was divided into the Elect, who had taken upon themselves the vows of Manicheaism, and the Hearers, those who had not, but still participated in the Church. The terms for these divisions were already common since the days of [[early Christianity]]. In Chinese writings, the Middle Persian and Parthian terms are transcribed phonetically (instead of being translated into Chinese).&lt;ref&gt;G. Haloun and W. B. Henning, ''The Compendium of the Doctrines and Styles of the Teaching of Mani, the Buddha of Light'', Asia Major, 1952, pp. 184–212, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; These were recorded by [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm|title=Manichæism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Leader''', (Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܟܗܢܐ|ܟܗܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/kɑhnɑ/}}; Parthian: ''yamag''; {{zh|c=閻默|p=yánmò}}) Mani's designated successor, seated as Patriarch at the head of the Church, originally in [[Ctesiphon]], from the ninth century in [[Samarkand]]. Two notable leaders were [[Mār Sīsin]] (or Sisinnios), the first successor of Mani, and [[Abū Hilāl al-Dayhūri]], an eighth-century leader.
* 12 '''[[Apostles]]''' (Latin: ''magistrī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܠܝܚܐ|ܫܠܝܚܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃ(ə)liħe/}}; Middle Persian: ''možag''; {{zh|c=慕闍|p=mùdū}}). Three of Mani's original apostles were Mār Pattī (Pattikios; Mani's father), [[Akouas]] and [[Mar Ammo]].
* 72 '''[[Bishop]]s''' (Latin: ''episcopī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ|ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʔappisqoppe/}}; Middle Persian: ''aspasag'', ''aftadan''; {{zh|c=薩波塞|p=sàbōsāi}} or {{zh|c=拂多誕|p=fúduōdàn}}; see also: [[seventy disciples]]). One of Mani's original disciples who was specifically referred to as a bishop was Mār Addā.
* 360 '''[[Presbyter]]s''' (Latin: ''presbyterī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܩܫܝܫܐ|ܩܫܝܫܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/qaʃʃiʃe/}}; Middle Persian: ''mahistan''; {{zh|c=默奚悉德|p=mòxīxīdé}})
* The general body of the '''Elect''' (Latin: ''ēlēctī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܡܫܡܫܢܐ|ܡܫܡܫܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/m(ə)ʃamməʃɑne/}}; Middle Persian: ''ardawan'' or ''dēnāwar''; {{zh|c=阿羅緩|p=āluóhuǎn}} or {{zh|c=電那勿|p=diànnàwù}})
* The '''Hearers''' (Latin: ''audītōrēs''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܡܘܥܐ|ܫܡܘܥܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃɑmoʿe/}}; Middle Persian: ''niyoshagan''; {{zh|c=耨沙喭|p=nòushāyàn}})

=== Religious practices ===
The most important religious observance of the Manichaeans was the Bema Fest, observed annually:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Bema#Christianity|Bema]] was originally, in the Syriac Christian churches, a seat placed in the middle of the nave on which the bishop would preside and from which the Gospel would be read. In the Manichaean places of worship, the throne was a five-stepped altar, covered by precious cloths, symbolizing the five classes of the hierarchy. The top of the Bema was always empty, as it was the seat of Mani. The Bema was celebrated at the [[vernal equinox]], was preceded by fasts, and symbolized the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] of Mani, thus it was strictly parallel to the Christian [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;Skjærvø, Prods Oktor, ''An Introduction to Manicheism'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While it is often presumed that the Bema seat was empty, there is some evidence from the Coptic Manichaean ''Bema Psalms'', that the Bema seat may have actually contained a copy of Mani's picture book, the [[Arzhang]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ort, L. J. R., ''Mani: a religio-historical description of his personality'', 1967, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary sources ==
[[File:Image of Buddha on a Manichaean Pictorial Roll.jpg|thumb|240px|Image of the [[Buddha]] as one of the primary prophets on a Manichaean pictorial roll fragment from [[Gaochang|Chotscho]], 10th century.]]
Mani wrote either seven or eight books, which contained the teachings of the religion. Only scattered fragments and translations of the originals remain.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] author [[Theodore Bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"&gt;Original Syriac in: Theodorus bar Konai, ''Liber Scholiorum, II'', ed. A. Scher, ''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium scrip. syri'', 1912, pp. 311–8, {{ISBN|978-90-429-0104-9}}; English translation in: A.V.W. Jackson, ''Researches in Manichaeism'', New York, 1932, pp. 222–54.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian ''[[Shabuhragan]]'', his book dedicated to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]].&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt; In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Angra Mainyu]], and Āz. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near [[Turpan]] in what is now [[Xinjiang]], China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Judaism]] and [[Mandaeism]], which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original, but now lost, six sacred books of Manichaeism were composed in [[Syriac language|Syriac Aramaic]], and translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], and ultimately [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Latin]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

GENERAL SURVEY}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered "the only extant Manichean temple in China"&lt;ref&gt;{{Iranica|chinese-turkestan-vii|CHINESE TURKESTAN: vii. Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Walter Bruno Henning|Henning]] describes how this translation process evolved and influenced the Manichaeans of Central Asia:
{{quote|Beyond doubt, [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] was the national language of the Majority of clerics and propagandists of the Manichaean faith in Central Asia. Middle Persian (Pārsīg), and to a lesser degree, Parthian (Pahlavānīg), occupied the position held by [[Medieval Latin|Latin in the medieval church]]. The founder of Manichaeism had employed Syriac (his own language) as his medium, but conveniently he had written at least one book in Middle Persian, and it is likely that he himself had arranged for the translation of some or all of his numerous writings from Syriac into Middle Persian. Thus the Eastern Manichaeans found themselves entitled to dispense with the study of Mani’s original writings, and to continue themselves to reading the Middle Persian edition; it presented small difficulty to them to acquire a good knowledge of the Middle Persian language, owing to its affinity with Sogdian.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Henning, ''Sogdica'', 1940, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Originally written in Syriac ===
* the ''[[Gospel of Mani]]'' (Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܐܘܢܓܠܝܘܢ|ܐܘܢܓܠܝܘܢ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{IPA|/ʔɛwwanɡallijon/}}; {{lang-grc-koi|εὐαγγέλιον}} "good news, gospel"). Quotations from the first chapter were brought in [[Arabic]] by [[ibn al-Nadim]], who lived in Baghdad at a time when there were still Manichaeans living there, in his 938 book, the ''Fihrist'', a catalog of all written books known to him.
* ''The Treasure of Life''
* ''The Treatise'' (Coptic: [[wikt:πραγματεία|πραγματεία]])
* ''Secrets''
* ''[[The Book of Giants]]'': Original fragments were discovered at [[Qumran]] (pre-Manichaean) and [[Turpan]].
* Epistles: Augustine brings quotations, in Latin, from Mani's ''[[Fundamental Epistle]]'' in some of his anti-Manichaean works.
* Psalms and prayers. A Coptic [[Manichaean Psalter]], discovered in Egypt in the early 1900s, was edited and published by [[Charles Allberry]] from Manichaean manuscripts in the [[Chester Beatty Papyri|Chester Beatty collection]] and in the Berlin Academy, 1938–9.

=== Originally written in Middle Persian ===
* The ''Shabuhragan'', dedicated to Shapur I: Original Middle Persian fragments were discovered at [[Turpan]], quotations were brought in Arabic by [[al-Biruni]].

=== Other books ===
* The [[Arzhang|Ardahang]], the "Picture Book". In Iranian tradition, this was one of Mani's holy books that became remembered in later Persian history, and was also called Aržang, a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word meaning "Worthy", and was beautified with paintings. Therefore, Iranians gave him the title of "The Painter".
* The [[Kephalaia of the Teacher]] (Κεφαλαια), "Discourses", found in Coptic translation.
* ''On the Origin of His Body'', the title of the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], a Greek translation of an Aramaic book that describes the early life of Mani.&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"/&gt;

===Non-Manichaean works preserved by the Manichaean Church===
* Portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] literature such as the [[Book of Giants]]
* Literature relating to the [[Thomas the Apostle|apostle Thomas]] (who by tradition went to India, and was also venerated in Syria), such as portions of the Syriac [[Acts of Thomas|The Acts of Thomas]], and the [[Psalms of Thomas]]. The [[Gospel of Thomas]] was also attributed to Manichaeans by Cyril of Jerusalem, a fourth-century Church Father.&lt;ref&gt;''"Let none read the gospel according to Thomas, for it is the work, not of one of the twelve apostles, but of one of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani's]] three wicked disciples."''—[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], ''Cathechesis'' V (4th century)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] passed from an Indian story about the Buddha, through a Manichaean version, before it transformed into the story of a Christian Saint in the west.

===Later works===
[[File:摩尼教文獻.jpg|thumb|摩尼教文獻 The Chinese Manichaean "Compendium"]]
In later centuries, as Manichaeism passed through [[Greater Iran|eastern Persian-speaking lands]] and arrived at the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (回鶻帝國), and eventually the Uyghur kingdom of [[Turpan]] (destroyed around 1335), Middle Persian and Parthian prayers (''āfrīwan'' or ''āfurišn'') and the Parthian hymn-cycles (the ''Huwīdagmān'' and ''Angad Rōšnan'' created by [[Mar Ammo]]) were added to the Manichaean writings.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Mary Boyce|Boyce, Mary]] ''The Manichaean hymn-cycles in Parthian'' (London Oriental Series, Vol. 3). London: Oxford University Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation of a collection of these produced the ''Manichaean Chinese Hymnscroll'' ({{zh|c=摩尼教下部讚|p=Móní-jiào Xiàbù Zàn}}, which Lieu translates as "Hymns for the Lower Section [i.e. the Hearers] of the Manichaean Religion"&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel N. C., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 1998, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition to containing hymns attributed to Mani, it contains prayers attributed to Mani's earliest disciples, including Mār Zaku, Mār Ammo and Mār Sīsin. Another Chinese work is a complete translation of the ''Sermon of the Light [[Nous]]'', presented as a discussion between Mani and his disciple Adda.&lt;ref&gt;"The Traité is, despite its title (Moni jiao cao jing, lit. "fragmentary [Mathews, no. 6689] Manichean scripture"), a long text in an excellent state of preservation, with only a few lines missing at the beginning. It was first fully published with a facsimile by [[Édouard Chavannes|Edouard Chavannes]] (q.v.) and [[Paul Pelliot]] in 1911 and is frequently known as Traité Pelliot. Their transcription (including typographical errors) was reproduced in the Chinese translation of the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka|Buddhist Tripiṭaka]] (Taishō, no. 2141 B, LIV, pp. 1281a16-1286a29); that text was in turn reproduced with critical notes by Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer (1987b, pp. T. 81–86). A more accurate transcription was published by Chen Yuan in 1923 (pp. 531–44), and a new collation based on a reexamination of the original photographs of the manuscript has now been published by Lin Wu-shu (1987, pp. 217–29), with the photographs", {{iranica|chinese-turkestan-vii|CHINESE TURKESTAN vii. Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and polemic sources===
Until discoveries in the 1900s of original sources, the only sources for Manichaeism were descriptions and quotations from non-Manichaean authors, either Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or Zoroastrian. While often criticizing Manichaeism, they also quoted directly from Manichaean scriptures. This enabled [[Isaac de Beausobre]], writing in the 18th century, to create a comprehensive work on Manichaeism, relying solely on anti-Manichaean sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac de Beausobre|de Beausobre, Isaac]], ''Histoire critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme'', 1734–1739, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus quotations and descriptions in Greek and Arabic have long been known to scholars, as have the long quotations in Latin by Saint Augustine, and the extremely important quotation in Syriac by [[Theodore Bar Konai]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

====Patristic depictions of Mani and Manichæeism====
[[Eusebius]] commented as follows:
{{quotation|''The error of the Manichees, which commenced at this time.''|In the mean time, also, that madman Manes, (Mani is of Persian or Semitic origin) as he was called, well agreeing with his name, for his demoniacal heresy, armed himself by the perversion of his reason, and at the instruction of Satan, to the destruction of many. He was a barbarian in his life, both in speech and conduct, but in his nature as one possessed and insane. Accordingly, he attempted to form himself into a Christ, and then also proclaimed himself to be the very paraclete and the Holy Spirit, and with all this was greatly puffed up with his madness. Then, as if he were Christ, he selected twelve disciples, the partners of his new religion, and after patching together false and ungodly doctrines, collected from a thousand heresies long since extinct, he swept them off like a deadly poison, from Persia, upon this part of the world. Hence the impious name of the Manichaeans spreading among many, even to the present day. Such then was the occasion of this knowledge, as it was falsely called, that sprouted up in these times.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. ''The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea'', Translated from the originals by Christian Frederick Cruse.1939. Ch. XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Acta Archelai====
An example of how inaccurate some of these accounts could be is seen in the account of the origins of Manichaeism contained in the ''Acta Archelai''. This was a Greek anti-manichaean work written before 348, most well known in its Latin version, which was regarded as an accurate account of Manichaeism until refuted by Isaac de Beausobre in the 18th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the time of the Apostles there lived a man named [[Scythianus]], who is described as coming "from Scythia", and also as being "a Saracen by race" ("ex genere Saracenorum"). He settled in Egypt, where he became acquainted with "the wisdom of the Egyptians", and invented the religious system that was afterwards known as Manichaeism. Finally he emigrated to Palestine, and, when he died, his writings passed into the hands of his sole disciple, a certain [[Terebinthus]]. The latter betook himself to Babylonia, assumed the name of Budda, and endeavoured to propagate his master's teaching. But he, like Scythianus, gained only one disciple, who was an old woman. After a while he died, in consequence of a fall from the roof of a house, and the books that he had inherited from Scythianus became the property of the old woman, who, on her death, bequeathed them to a young man named Corbicius, who had been her slave. Corbicius thereupon changed his name to Manes, studied the writings of Scythianus, and began to teach the doctrines that they contained, with many additions of his own. He gained three disciples, named Thomas, Addas, and Hermas. About this time the son of the Persian king fell ill, and Manes undertook to cure him; the prince, however, died, whereupon Manes was thrown into prison. He succeeded in escaping, but eventually fell into the hands of the king, by whose order he was flayed, and his corpse was hung up at the city gate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A. A. Bevan, who quoted this story, commented that it "has no claim to be considered historical".&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'', Volume VIII. Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====View of Judaism in the ''Acta Archelai''=====
According to [[Hegemonius]]' portrayal of Mani, the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|evil demiurge]] who created the world was the Jewish [[Jehovah]]. Hegemonius reports that Mani said,
{{quote|"It is the [[Prince of darkness (Manichaeism)|Prince of Darkness]] who spoke with [[Moses]], the [[Jews]] and their [[kohen|priests]]. Thus the [[Christian]]s, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God. For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them." He goes on to state: "Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the [[archon]]t of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans (ethnic) are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have (this in store for themselves, namely) to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them (only) according to their own aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classical Texts: Acta Archelai of Mani |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf |format=PDF |page=76 |publisher=Iranian Studies at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Central Asian and Iranian primary sources===
In the early 1900s, original Manichaean writings started to come to light when German scholars led by [[Albert Grünwedel]], and then by [[Albert von Le Coq]], began excavating at [[Gaochang]], the ancient site of the Manichaean Uyghur Kingdom near Turpan, in Chinese Turkestan (destroyed around AD 1300). While most of the writings they uncovered were in very poor condition, there were still hundreds of pages of Manichaean scriptures, written in three Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian) and old Uyghur. These writings were taken back to Germany, and were analyzed and published at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Berlin, by Le Coq and others, such as [[Friedrich W. K. Müller]] and [[Walter Bruno Henning]]. While the vast majority of these writings were written in a version of the Syriac script known as [[Manichaean script]], the German researchers, perhaps for lack of suitable fonts, published most of them using the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (which could easily be substituted for the 22 Syriac letters).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Perhaps the most comprehensive of these publications was ''Manichaeische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (''Manichaean Dogma from Chinese and Iranian texts''), by [[Ernst Waldschmidt]] and Wolfgang Lentz, published in Berlin in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Waldschmidt|Waldschmidt, E.]], and Lentz, W., ''Manichäische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (SPAW 1933, No. 13)&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other research work published before or since, this work printed, and then discussed, the original key Manichaean texts in the original scripts, and consists chiefly of sections from Chinese texts, and Middle Persian and Parthian texts transcribed with the Hebrew alphabet. After the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the Manichaean writings continued to be published during the 1930s, but the publishers no longer used Hebrew letters, instead transliterating the texts into Latin letters.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Coptic primary sources===
Additionally, in 1930, German researchers in Egypt found a large body of Manichaean works in Coptic. Though these were also damaged, hundreds of complete pages survived and, beginning in 1933, were analyzed and published in Berlin before World War II, by German scholars such as [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Jakob Polotsky]] and Karl Schmidt, ''Ein Mani-Fund in Ägypten, Original-Schriften des Mani und seiner Schüler''. Berlin: Akademie der Wissenschaften 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Coptic Manichaean writings were lost during the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Chinese primary sources===
After the success of the German researchers, French scholars visited China and discovered what is perhaps the most complete set of Manichaean writings, written in Chinese. These three Chinese writings, all found at the [[Mogao Caves]] among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], and all written before the 9th century, are today kept in London, Paris, and Beijing. Some of the scholars involved with their initial discovery and publication were [[Édouard Chavannes]], [[Paul Pelliot]], and [[Aurel Stein]]. The original studies and analyses of these writings, along with their translations, first appeared in French, English, and German, before and after World War II. The complete Chinese texts themselves were first published in Tokyo, Japan in 1927, in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]], volume 54. While in the last thirty years or so they have been republished in both Germany (with a complete translation into German, alongside the 1927 Japanese edition),&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Glintzer, Helwig, ''Chinesische Manichaeica'', Wiesbaden, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and China, the Japanese publication remains the standard reference for the Chinese texts.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Greek life of Mani, Cologne codex===
[[File:Kölner Mani-Kodex.jpg|thumb|right|Cologne Mani-Codex]]
In Egypt, a small [[codex]] was found and became known through antique dealers in [[Cairo]]. It was purchased by the [[University of Cologne]] in 1969. Two of its scientists, Henrichs and Koenen, produced the first edition known since as the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], which was published in four articles in the ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik''. The ancient [[papyrus]] manuscript contained a [[Greek language|Greek]] text describing the life of Mani. Thanks to this discovery, much more is known about the man who founded one of the most influential world religions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cologne-mani-codex-parchment |title= Cologne Mani Codex |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |date= |year= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Figurative use ==
The terms "Manichaean" and "Manichaeism" are sometimes used figuratively as a synonym of the more general term "[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]]" with respect to a philosophy, outlook or worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Manichaean|title=Manichaean - definition of Manichaean in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to suggest that the world view in question simplistically reduces the world to a struggle between good and evil. For example, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] used the phrase "Manichaean paranoia" in reference to [[POTUS|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s world view (in ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', March 14, 2007); Brzezinski elaborated that he meant "the notion that he [Bush] is leading the forces of good against the empire of evil". Philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] frequently invoked the concept of Manicheanism in his discussions of violence between colonizers and the colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fanon/|title=Frantz Fanon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] followed up on the theme in describing Bush in his book ''[[A Tragic Legacy]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/notes-on-an-important-book-glenn-greenwalds-a-tragic-legacy-how-a-good-vs-evil-mentality-destroyed-the-bush-presidency/|title=Wednesday’s Book Review: “A Tragic Legacy: How a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency”|date=2017-06-28|work=Roger Launius's Blog|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story "[[Memoirs of Hecate County|The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles]]" (published in ''Memoirs of Hecate County''), [[Edmund Wilson]]'s narrator refers to Asa Stryker's argument as "the Manichaean heresy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/wilson-hecate2.html|title=Home|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[My Secret History]]", author [[Paul Theroux]]'s protagonist defines the word Manichaean for the protagonist's son. Prior to explaning the word to his son, the protagonist mentions [[Joseph Conrad|Joseph Conrad's]] short story [[The Secret Sharer]] at least twice in the book, the plot of which also examines the idea of the duality of good and evil.

'''Margaret Anne Ganley Somerville''', {{Post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} {{Post-nominals|FRSC}} (born 13 April 1942) is Professor of Bioethics at [[University of Notre Dame Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu.au/news/media-releases/2016/091 | title=  Notre Dame welcomes Professor Margaret Somerville |publisher=University of Notre Dame Australia|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was previously Samuel Gale Professor of Law at [[McGill University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu.au/news/media-releases/2016/091 | title= Retirement of our colleagues Paul Dempsey and Margaret Somerville |publisher=University of Notre Dame Australia|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Somerville was born in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, and educated at [[Mercedes College (Adelaide)|Mercedes College]] ([[Springfield, South Australia|Springfield]], South Australia). She received a A.u.A. (pharm.) from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1963, a [[Bachelor of Law]] degree (Hons. I) and the University Medal from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1973, and a D.C.L. from McGill University in 1978.

In 1978, she was appointed assistant professor in the law faculty at McGill. She was appointed an associate professor in 1979 and an associate professor in the faculty of medicine in 1980. In 1984, she became a full professor in both faculties, and in 1989, she was appointed the Samuel Gale Professor of Law. From 1986 to 1996, she was the founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law and was appointed acting director in 1999.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archivalcollections.library.mcgill.ca/index.php/margaret-a-somerville-fonds|title=Margaret A. Somerville Fonds|website=McGill Library Archival Catalogue|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently teaches seminars on advanced torts and comparative medical law at McGill. Her archive is held at the McGill University Archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In November 2006, she gave the five annual [[Massey Lectures]] on [[CBC Radio]] in Canada. An expanded version of the lectures was published in Canada, Australia, and the United States in book form as ''The Ethical Imagination: Journeys of the Human Spirit''.

==Honours==
Among many honours and awards, in 1990, Somerville was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] "for service to the law and to bioethics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=882353&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, she was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]]. In 2004 she was chosen by an international jury as the first recipient of [[UNESCO]]'s Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=20029&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has received honorary degrees from [[University of Windsor]] (1992), [[Macquarie University]] (1993), [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (1996) and the [[University of Waterloo]] (2004). Her honorary degree awarded 19 June 2006, at [[Ryerson University]] in Toronto was controversial&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccrl.ca/index.php?id=331&lt;/ref&gt; because of her objections to [[same sex marriage]]. She has since received honorary degrees from [[Mount Saint Vincent University]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia (2009), [[St. Mark's College, Vancouver|St. Mark's College]], Vancouver (2010) and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], Ontario (2013).

In 2006, Somerville was nominated for membership in the [[Order of Canada]] by [[Carol Finlay]], a professor at the [[Toronto School of Theology]]. Finlay says Somerville was turned down for the honour because she was "too controversial."&lt;ref&gt;Aubin, Henry. (2006). ''[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=62cda378-0d93-4a8b-8d88-010af82ffe62 McGill ethicist refused OC because she was 'too controversial'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104155543/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/features/viewpoints/story.html?id=62cda378-0d93-4a8b-8d88-010af82ffe62 |date=4 November 2012 }}'', The Montreal Gazette, 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in same-sex marriage debate==
Somerville presented both a brief and an oral presentation to the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights]] opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Canada in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Margaret |last=Somerville |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/controversy/marriage/the-case-against-same-sex-marriage.html |title=The Case Against "Same-sex marriage" |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=CommitteeMeetingEvidence&amp;Acronym=just&amp;Mee=39&amp;Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=37&amp;Ses=2 37th PARLIAMENT, 2nd SESSION Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights] Parliament of Canada.

== Life and work ==

=== Biography ===

Michel Henry was born in [[Haiphong]], [[French Indochina]] (now [[Vietnam]]), and he lived in French Indochina until he was seven years old. Following the death of his father, who was an officer in the [[French Navy]], he and his mother settled in [[metropolitan France]]. While studying in [[Paris]], he discovered a true passion for philosophy, which he decided to make his profession—he enrolled at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], at the time part of the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michelhenry.org/biographie/ "''Biographie''"] at the official site of Michel Henry.&lt;/ref&gt; From June 1943 he was fully engaged with the [[French Resistance]], joining the maquis of the Haut [[Jura mountains|Jura]] under the code name of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].  He often had to come down from the mountains in order to accomplish missions in Nazi-occupied [[Lyon]], an experience of clandestinity that deeply marked his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, ''Michel Henry'', éd. l'Age d'Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 12–15)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war he took the final part of the philosophy examination at the university, following which he wrote in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Eventually published in 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[doctoral thesis]] from the [[University of Paris]], titled ''L'essence de la manifestation'' (''The Essence of Manifestation''), under the direction of [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[Jean Wahl]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Ferdinand Alquié]], and [[Henri Gouhier]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, on the ''Philosophy and Phenomenology of the Body'', was completed in 1950. His first significant published work was on ''The Essence of Manifestation'', to which he devoted long years of necessary research in order to surmount the main deficiency of all intellectualist philosophy, the ignorance of life ''as experienced''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, ''Michel Henry'', éd. l'Age d'Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 21–26)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960, Michel Henry was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Montpellier]], where he patiently perfected his work, keeping himself away from philosophical fashions and far from dominant ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, ''Michel Henry'', éd. l’Age d’Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 27–50)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Audi, ''Michel Henry'', Les belles lettres, 2006, p. 22 : « Michel Henry fait partie de ces très rares philosophes qui, dans la seconde moitié du siècle dernier, se sont frayé leurs voies propres à l'écart des modes contemporaines. »&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Albi]], France, at the age of eighty.

The sole subject of his philosophy is living [[subjectivity]], which is to say the real life of living individuals. This subject is found in all his work and ensures its deep unity in spite of the diversity of themes he tackled.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Brohm et Jean Leclercq, ''Michel Henry'', éd. l’Age d’Homme, Les dossiers H, 2009 (pp. 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he proposed the most profound theory of subjectivity in the Twentieth Century.

=== A phenomenology of life ===

The work of Michel Henry is based on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], which is the study of the [[phenomenon]]. The English/German/Latinate word "phenomenon" comes from the Greek "phainomenon" which means "that which shows itself by coming into the light".&lt;ref&gt;''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'' (§ 1, p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The everyday understanding of phenomenon as appearance is only possible as a negative derivation of this authentic sense of Greek self-showing. The object of phenomenology is not however something that appears, such as a particular thing or phenomena, but the act of appearing itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair'' (§ 1, p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's thought led him to a reversal of [[Husserl#The elaboration of phenomenology|Husserlian phenomenology]], which acknowledges as phenomenon only that which appears in the world, or [[exteriority]]. Henry counterposed this conception of phenomenality with a radical phenomenology of life.&lt;ref&gt;''Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair'' (§ 1–15, pp. 35–132)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry defines life from a phenomenological [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] as what possesses the faculty and the power "to feel and to experience oneself in each point of its [[being]]".&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''La barbarie'' (§ 1, p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; For Henry, life is essentially [[force]] and [[Affect (philosophy)|affect]]; it is essentially invisible; it consists in a pure experience of itself which perpetually oscillates between [[suffering]] and [[joy]]; it is an always begun again passage from suffering to joy.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''The Essence of Manifestation'' (§ 52–70)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thought]] is for him only a mode of  life, because it is not thought which gives access to life, but life that allows thought to reach itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair'' (§ 15, p. 129)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henry, life can never be seen from the exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and experiences itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them.&lt;ref&gt;''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'' (§ 3, pp. 33–47)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, it is impossible to see another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it at the end of a scalpel.

Henry's philosophy goes on to aver that we undergo life in a radical passivity, we are reduced to bear it permanently as what we have not wanted, and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation and the cause of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essence of Manifestation'' (§ 53)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La barbarie'' (§ 4, pp. 126–128)&lt;/ref&gt; No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time, the simple fact of living, of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of not existing is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life, they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its "pathetic" self-revelation (from the French word ''pathétique'' which means capable of feeling something like suffering or joy).&lt;ref&gt;''The Essence of Manifestation'' (§ 70)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Henry, life is not a universal, blind, impersonal and abstract substance, it is necessarily the personal and concrete life of a living individual, it carries in it a consubstantial Ipseity which refers to the fact of being itself, to the fact of being a Self.&lt;ref&gt;''Incarnation. Une philosophie de la chair'' (Introduction, p. 29)&lt;/ref&gt; This life is the personal and finite life of men, or the personal and infinite life of God.

=== Two modes of manifestation ===

Two modes of manifestation of phenomena exist, according to Henry, which are two ways of appearing: "exteriority", which is the mode of manifestation of the visible world, and phenomenological "interiority", which is the mode of manifestation of invisible life.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the conclusion of ''L'Essence de la manifestation'', PUF, 1963 (§ 70, p. 860)&lt;/ref&gt; Our [[Human body|bodies]], for instance, are in life given to us from the inside, which allows us, for example, to move our hands, and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object that we can see in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l’invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988 (pp. 14–18)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "invisible", here, does not correspond to that which is too small to be seen with the naked eye, or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive, but rather to life, which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world.  No-one has ever seen a force, a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, p. 27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his assertions seem [[paradoxical]] and difficult to understand at first glance, not only because they are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (p. 16, pp. 218–222 and p. 301)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of Western philosophy ===
[[Western philosophy]] as a whole since its Greek origins recognizes only the visible world and exteriority as the sole form of manifestation. It is trapped into what in ''The Essence of Manifestation'' Michel Henry calls "ontological monism"; it completely ignores the invisible interiority of life, its radical immanence and its original mode of revelation which is irreducible to any form of transcendence or to any exteriority.&lt;ref&gt;See Michel Henry, ''L'essence de la manifestation'', PUF, 1963 (§ 11, p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt; When subjectivity or life are in question, they are never grasped in their purity;  they are systematically reduced to biological life, to their external relation with the world, or as in [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] to an [[intentionality]], i.e. an orientation of consciousness towards an object outside it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 3, pp. 46–70)&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry rejects [[materialism]], which admits only matter as reality, because the manifestation of matter in the transcendence of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to be able to see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.&lt;ref&gt;See Michel Henry, ''L'essence de la manifestation'', PUF, 1963 (§ 70, p. 858)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deep originality of  Michel Henry's thought and its radical novelty in relation to all preceding philosophy explains its fairly limited reception. It is however a philosophy that is admired for its "rigor" and its "depth".&lt;ref&gt;See for example the article from Xavier Tillette in ''Manifestation et révélation'', éd. Beauchesne, 1976, pp. 207–236 : « Accueilli dès sa parution comme un grand livre, admiré de ses juges, l'ouvrage de Michel Henry, ''L'Essence de la Manifestation'' reste, dix ans après, le chef-d’œuvre inconnu. On ne s'explique que trop bien, hélas, cette désaffection. Sa rigueur et son abstraction, comme un rempart protecteur, écartent le lecteur insuffisamment armé, décourageant le simple curieux ou l'amateur pressé. En outre il est indifférent au succès et aux modes, il ne se rattache à aucune école patentée, il n'appartient à aucun mouvement en vogue. » (p. 207) and « Si toutefois l'impression de solitude persiste et le tourmente, surtout la solitude qui provient de l'indifférence environnante, puisse-t-il se consoler avec sa fière maxime retournée : "Plus une pensée est ''profonde'' et ''rétablit'' l'ordre vrai des choses, plus ''étroite'' l'audience dont elle est assurée" ! » (p. 236).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Gire, review ''Esprit et Vie'' n°138, 2005, article entitled "L'excès de la vie sur sa représentation scientifique : la perspective philosophique de Michel Henry. Pour une philosophie du sujet vivant" : "[Michel Henry] est mort le 3 juillet 2002 à Albi, laissant une œuvre d'une grande profondeur intellectuelle, très originale, d'un accès difficile, mais dont l'influence sur les générations suivantes n'est pas près de se tarir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Audi, ''Michel Henry'', Les belles lettres (2006) : "Comprendre le "Moi" et les phénomènes du monde à partir du "vivre" et de son auto-affection, tel est le vrai ressort de cette œuvre dense et rigoureuse." (cover page)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska, ''Michel Henry. Passion et magnificence de la vie'', Beauchesne (2003) : "L'élucidation de ces différentes régions phénoménologiques n'a d'autre but, en effet, que l'approfondissement de la sphère originaire et invisible de la Vie qui les détermine toutes, déterminant aussi la téléologie générale d'une pensée qui se distingue, parmi toutes les philosophies de la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, par sa radicalité et par la profondeur de sa visée métaphysique." (p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; But his thought is both "difficult" and "demanding", despite the simplicity and immediacy of its central and unique theme of phenomenological life, the experience of which it tries to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Auto-donation. Entretiens et conférences'', éd. Beauchesne, 2004, article de Magali Uhl et Jean-Marie Brohm, pp. 269–281 : « Conscients de la chance qui nous était offerte d’être en proximité avec cette pensée exigeante qui refusait toute concession aux modes, aux coteries, aux crédulités obligatoires, nous avons surtout mesuré à quel point Michel Henry possédait ce souffle spirituel qui est la grâce du don. Parce qu’à chacun d’entre nous, il a apporté quelque chose d’inestimable : la liberté de l’esprit, l’émerveillement continu devant les plus hautes valeurs de la culture, le refus du nihilisme. » (p. 269) and « La pensée de Michel Henry, exigeante, radicalement libre, tout entière irradiée par sa passion de la vie, est de celles qui permettent de comprendre la barbarie en ses fondements et de la combattre. » (p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the immediacy and absolute transparency of life which explains the difficulty of grasping it as a thought: it is much easier to speak of what we see than of this invisible life, which fundamentally avoids being seen from the outside&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''L’Essence de la manifestation'', PUF, 1963 (§ 53, p. 590)&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps'', PUF, 1965, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception of Henry's philosophy ===

His thesis on ''The Essence of Manifestation'' was warmly welcomed by the members of the jury, who recognized the intellectual value and the seriousness of its author, although this thesis did not have any influence on their later works.&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; His book on ''Marx'' was rejected by Marxists, who were harshly criticized, as well as by those who refused to see in Marx a philosopher and who reduced him to an ideologue responsible from Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, pp. 361–362)&lt;/ref&gt; His book on ''Barbarism'' was considered by some as a rather simplistic and overly trenchant anti-scientific discourse. Nevertheless, it seems that science and technology too often pursue their blind and unrestrained development in defiance of life.&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 362)&lt;/ref&gt;

His works on Christianity seem rather to have disappointed certain professional theologians and Catholic exegetes, who contented themselves with picking out and correcting what they considered as "dogmatic errors".&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, pp. 362–363)&lt;/ref&gt; His phenomenology of life was the subject of a pamphlet on ''Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française'' (''The Theological Turn in French Phenomenology'') by [[Dominique Janicaud]], who sees in the immanence of life only the affirmation of a tautological interiority.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Janicaud, ''Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française'', Editions de l’éclat, 1991, pp. 57–70.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Antoine Vidalin published a book entitled ''La parole de la Vie'' (''The Word of Life'') in which he shows that Michel Henry's phenomenology allows for a renewed approach to every area of theology.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Vidalin, ''La Parole de la Vie'', éd. [[Parole et silence]], 2006 (pp. 11–12)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Alain David says in an article published in the French journal ''[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger]]'' (number 3, July – September 2001),&lt;ref&gt;Article available online at http://www.cairn.info/revue-philosophique-2001-3-page-359.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the thought of Michel Henry seems so radical, it affects our habitual ways of thinking so deeply, that it has had a difficult reception, even if all his readers declare themselves impressed by its "power", by the "staggering effect" of a thought which "sweeps everything clean on its way through", which "prompts admiration", but nevertheless "doesn’t really convince", as we don’t know whether we are confronted by "the violence of a prophetic voice or by pure madness".&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 363)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same journal, Rolf Kühn also asserts, in order to explain the difficult reception of Michel Henry’s work, that "if we do not side with any power in this world, we inevitably submit to silence and to criticism from every possible power, ''because we remind each institution that its visible or apparent power is, in fact, only powerlessness'', because nobody gives himself over to absolute phenomenological life".&lt;ref&gt;''Revue philosophique de la France et de l’Etranger'' (numéro 3 de juillet - septembre 2001, p. 303)&lt;/ref&gt;

His books have been translated into many languages, notably English, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. A substantial amount of work has been dedicated to him, mainly in French, but also in German, Spanish and Italian. A number of international seminars have also been dedicated to the thought of Michel Henry in Beirut, Cerisy, Namur, Prague, Montpellier, Paris and Louvain-la-Neuve in 2010. Michel Henry is considered by the specialists who know his work and recognize its value as one of the most important contemporary philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska : ''Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie'' (cover)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jad Hatem : ''Michel Henry, la parole de Vie'' (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collectif (Colloque international de Montpellier 2003) : ''Michel Henry. Pensée de la vie et culture contemporaine'' (p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; and his phenomenology of life has started to gain a following. A ''Michel Henry Study Center'' has been established at St Joseph's University in Beirut (Lebanon) under the direction of Professor Jad Hatem.

Since 2006, the archives of the philosopher have been deposited by his wife at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), where they form the Michel Henry archives Fund, placed under the direction of Jean Leclercq. An annual review, called ''Revue internationale Michel Henry'', is also edited by this Fund in collaboration with the Presses universitaires de Louvain since 2010.

A newsletter on Michel Henry in French, called ''La gazette d'Aliahova'' (in reference to the town of Aliahova described in the Michel Henry novel ''L'Amour les yeux fermés''), is published every month by Roland Vaschalde since 2010. The goal of this publication is to keep informed of the articles, books, courses, seminars and meetings on the thought of Michel Henry.

== Consequences of Henry's philosophy ==

=== On the problems of society ===

==== Marx ====
Michel Henry wrote an important work on [[Karl Marx]], whom he considers, paradoxically, as one of the leading [[Christian]] thinkers and one of the most important western [[philosophers]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Marx II. Une philosophie de l'économie'', éd. Gallimard, 1976, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; due to the weight he gives in his thought to living work and to the living individual (''praxis'') in which he sees the foundation of [[economic]] reality.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité'', éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 193 et 207 par exemple&lt;/ref&gt; One reason why Marx's genuine thought has been so misunderstood is the complete ignorance of his fundamental philosophical writings during the development of the official doctrine of Marxism, due to their very late publication — for example, ''The German Ideology'' only appeared in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité'', éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 9–33&lt;/ref&gt; But the real reason for ignorance of Marx's philosophical texts is Marxism's negation, from its earliest days, of subjectivity, because Marxism is nothing other than a repetition of Hegelianism, which is a philosophy of objectivity which reduces the individual to the effective becoming of the Absolute and its manifestation in the light of ek-static exteriority.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité'', éd. Gallimard, 1976, pp. 333–337&lt;/ref&gt; This work on Marx was published in two volumes entitled respectively ''Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité'' and ''Marx II. Une philosophie de l’économie'', translated in English as ''Marx: A Philosophy of Human Reality''.

==== Barbarism ====
In his essay ''Barbarism'', Michel Henry examines science, which is founded on the idea of a universal and as such objective truth, and which therefore leads to the elimination of the sensible qualities of the world, sensibility and life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 49 et 111&lt;/ref&gt; There is nothing wrong with science in itself as long as it is restricted to the study of nature, but it tends to exclude all traditional forms of culture, such as art, ethics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Science left to its own devices leads to technology, whose blind processes develop themselves independently in a monstrous fashion with no reference to life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is a form of culture in which life denies itself and refuses itself any value. It is a practical negation of life,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; which develops into a theoretical negation in the form of ideologies that reduces all possible knowledge to that of science, such as the human sciences whose very objectivity deprives them of their object: what value do statistics have faced with suicide, what do they say about the anguish and the despair that produce it?&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 131–164&lt;/ref&gt; These ideologies have invaded the university, and are precipitating it to its destruction by eliminating life from research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 201–239&lt;/ref&gt;  Television is the truth of technology; it is the practice ''par excellence'' of barbarism: it reduces every event to current affairs, to incoherent and insignificant facts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 190–199&lt;/ref&gt;

This negation of life results, according to Michel Henry, from the "disease of life", from its secret dissatisfaction with the self which leads it to deny itself, to flee itself in order to escape its anguish and its own suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern world, we are almost all condemned from childhood to flee our anguish and our proper life in the mediocrity of the media universe — an escape from self and a dissatisfaction which lead to violence — rather than resorting to the most highly developed traditional forms of culture which enable the overcoming of this suffering and its transformation into joy.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pP. 174–183&lt;/ref&gt; Culture subsists, despite everything, but in a kind of incognito; in our materialist society, which is sinking into barbarism, it must necessarily operate in a clandestine way.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 241–247&lt;/ref&gt;

==== From Communism to Capitalism ====
Communism and Capitalism are for Michel Henry two faces of the one death, which consists in the negation of life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Communism eliminates individual life in favour of universal abstractions like society, people, history or social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The dogmatism of Marxism is a form of fascism, i.e. a doctrine which originates in the degradation of the individual whose elimination is considered as legitimate,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; whereas capitalism substitutes economic entities such as money, profit or interest for the real needs of life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, pp. 142 et 148&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalism however recognizes life as a source of value, wages being the objective representation of real subjective and living work.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; But capitalism progressively gives way to the exclusion of subjectivity by modern technology, which replaces living work by automated technological processes, eliminating at one stroke the power of creating value and ultimately value itself: possessions are produced in abundance, but unemployment increases and there is a continual shortage of money to buy them.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Du communisme au capitalisme'', éd. Odile Jacob, 1990, p. 161 et 174&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are developed in ''Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d’une catastrophe'' (''From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe'').

==== The Book of the Dead ====
Henry's planned last book was entitled ''Le Livre des Morts'' (''The Book of the Dead'') and would have dealt with what he called "clandestine subjectivity": a theme which evokes the condition of life in the modern world and which also alludes to his commitment to the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] and his personal experience of clandestinity.&lt;ref&gt;See the 'Biographie' page of the official site of Michel Henry and ''Auto-donation. Entretiens et conférences'', p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On art and painting ===
Michel Henry was a student of ancient painting and of the great [[classicism|classical]] painting which preceded the [[Scientism|scientistic]] figuration of the 18th and 19th Centuries, and also of abstract creations such as those of the painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Auto-donation. Entretiens et conférences'', éd. Beauschene, 2004, pp. 263–265.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry dedicated a book entitled ''Voir l’invisible (Seeing the Invisible)'' to Kandinsky, in which he describes his work in laudatory terms.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l'invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988, par exemple pp. 240–244.&lt;/ref&gt; He analyses Kandinsky's theoretical writings on art and painting in their spiritual and cultural dimensions as a means of self-growth and refinement of one's [[sensibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l'invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 10–11, pp. 26–43.&lt;/ref&gt; He explores painting's means of form and colour, and studies their effects on the inner life of one who looks at them filled with wonder, following the rigorous and almost phenomenological analysis proposed by Kandinsky.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l'invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 81–99 for point and line, and pp. 122–139 for colors.&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that every form of painting capable of moving us is in reality abstract, i.e. it is not content to reproduce the world but seeks to express the invisible power and invisible life that we are.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l'invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 216–227.&lt;/ref&gt; He evokes also the great thought of Kandinsky, the synthesis of arts, their unity in the monumental art as well as the cosmic dimension of art.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Voir l'invisible'', éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 176–190 on monumental art, and pp. 228–244 on art and the Cosmos.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On Christianity ===

==== I am the Truth ====
In ''C’est moi la Vérité, pour une philosophie du christianisme'' (''I am the Truth: Towards a Philosophy of Christianity''), Michel Henry confronts his phenomenology of life with the foundational texts of Christianity. Life loves itself with an infinite love and never ceases to engender itself; it never ceases to engender each one of us as its beloved Son or Daughter in the eternal present of life. Life is nothing but this absolute love that religion calls [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 2, p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; That is why Life is sacred, and it is for this reason that no-one has the right to assault another or attack another's life.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 10) and ''La barbarie'', éd. Grasset, 1987 (chapitre 7, p. 221)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of [[evil]] is that of [[death]]; that is, of degeneration from the original condition of Son of God, when life turns against itself in hatred or resentment. Because as [[John the Evangelist|John]] says in his [[First Epistle of John|first epistle]], anyone who does not love remains in death, whereas everyone who loves has been born of God.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 9, p. 203 et § 10, p. 236), quotations of 1 John 3, 14 and 1 John 4, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The commandment of love is not an ethical law, but Life itself.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 10, p. 235)&lt;/ref&gt;

This work also proposes a phenomenology of Christ, who is understood as the First Living Being. A living being is simply that which succeeds in the pure revelation of self or self-revelation that is Life. It is in the form of an effective and singular Ipseity that Life never ceases to engender itself. It never ceases to occur in the form of a singular Self that embraces itself, experiences itself and finds joy in itself, and that Michel Henry calls the First Living Being. Or again the Arch-Son, as he himself inhabits the Origin and the Beginning, and is engendered in the very process whereby the Father engenders himself.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 4, pp. 73–77)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michel Henry tells us in this book that the purpose of the coming of Christ into the world is to make the true Father manifest to people, and thus to save them from the forgetting of Life in which they stand.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 8, pp. 166–191)&lt;/ref&gt; A forgetting which leads them falsely to believe themselves as being the source of their own powers, their own pleasures and their own feelings, and to live in the terrifying lack of that which however gives each ego to itself. The plenitude of life and the feeling of satisfaction it brings must yield to the great Rift, to the Desire that no object can fulfill, to the Hunger that nothing can satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 11, pp. 255–260)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Words of Christ ====
As Henry says in his last book ''Paroles du Christ'' (''Words of Christ''), it is in the heart that life speaks, in its immediate pathetic self-revelation; but the heart is blind to the Truth, it is deaf to the word of Life, it is hard and selfish, and it is from this that evil comes.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Paroles du Christ'', éd. du Seuil, 2002 (pp. 122, 134)&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the violence of its silent and implacable self-revelation, which bears witness against this degenerate life and against the evil that comes from it, that Judgement stands — Judgement which is identical to the advent of each Self to itself and from which none can escape.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Paroles du Christ'', éd. du Seuil, 2002 (pp. 123–124)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Incarnation ====
In ''Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair'' (''Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh''), Henry starts by opposing the sensible and living flesh as we experience it perpetually from the inside to the inert and [[Embodied cognition|material body]] as we can see it from the outside, like other objects we find in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, pp. 8–9)&lt;/ref&gt; The flesh does not correspond at all, in his terminology, to the soft part of our material and objective body as opposed for example to the bones, but to what he called in his earlier books our ''subjective body''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Philosophie et phénoménologie du corps'', PUF, 1987 (pp. 71–105)&lt;/ref&gt; For Henry, an object possesses no interiority, it is not living, it does not feel itself and does not feel that it is touched, it does not subjectively experience being touched.

Having put the difficult problem of the incarnation in a historical perspective by going back to the thought of the Church Fathers, he undertakes a critical re-reading of the phenomenological tradition that leads to a reversal of phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 35–132&lt;/ref&gt; He then proposes to elaborate a phenomenology of the flesh which leads to the notion of an originary flesh which is not constituted but is given in the arch-revelation of Life, as well as a phenomenology of Incarnation.

Although the flesh is traditionally understood as the seat of sin, in Christianity it is also the place of salvation, which consists in the deification of man, i.e. in the fact of becoming the Son of God, of returning to the eternal and absolute Life we had forgotten in losing ourselves in the world, in caring only about things and ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (Introduction, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''C'est moi la Vérité'', éd. du Seuil, 1996 (§ 9, pp. 207)&lt;/ref&gt; In sin, we have the tragic experience of our powerlessness to do the good we would like to do and of our inability to avoid evil.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 34, p. 254)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, faced with the magical body of the other, it is the anguished desire to rejoin the life in it that leads to error.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 39, p. 291)&lt;/ref&gt; In the night of lovers, the sexual act couples two impulsive movements, but erotic desire fails to attain the pleasure of the other just there where it is experienced, in a complete loving fusion.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 41, pp. 301–302)&lt;/ref&gt; The erotic relation is however doubled by a pure affective relation, foreign to the carnal coupling, a relation made of mutual gratitude or love.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 41, p. 304)&lt;/ref&gt; It is this affective dimension that is denied in the form of violence that is pornography, which wrenches the erotic relation from the pathos of life in order to deliver it to the world, and which constitutes a genuine profanation of life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Incarnation'', éd. du Seuil, 2000 (§ 43, p. 315)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On psychoanalysis ===
Michel Henry undertook a study of the historical and philosophical genesis of [[psychoanalysis]] in the light of phenomenology of life in ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse, le commencement perdu'' (''Genealogy of Psychoanalysis, the Lost Beginning''), in which he shows that the Freudian notion of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] results from the inability of [[Freud]], its founder, to think the essence of life in its purity as affectivity and auto-affection.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse'', PUF, 1985 (pp. 5–15 et 386)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Psychological repression|repressed]] [[Mental representation|representation]] does not come from the unconscious, it is simply unformed:&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse'', PUF, 1985 (p. 234)&lt;/ref&gt; the unconscious is only an empty representation, it does not exist—or rather, the real unconscious is life itself in its pathetic reality.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse'', PUF, 1985 (pp. 348 et 384)&lt;/ref&gt; And it is not repression that provokes [[anguish]], whose existence depends on the mere fact of power, but unused psychic energy or [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse'', PUF, 1985 (p. 380)&lt;/ref&gt; As for the notion of consciousness, it simply means the power of seeing, it is nothing but a consciousness of the object which leads to an empty [[subjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Généalogie de la psychanalyse'', PUF, 1985 (pp. 125–158)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Some quotations from Michel Henry ==

=== On affectivity ===
* "That which is felt without the intermediary of any sense whatsoever is in its essence affectivity." (''The Essence of Manifestation'', § 52)
* "Affectivity has always accomplished its work when the world rises." (''The Essence of Manifestation'', § 54)
* "Suffering constitutes the tissue of existence, it is the place where life becomes living, the reality and the phenomenological effectivity of this gradual change." (''The Essence of Manifestation'', § 70)
* "The power of feeling is the gathering which edifies; being, seized by the self, its blazing up, its fulguration, is the becoming of being, the triumphant sudden appearance of revelation. What occurs in the triumph of this sudden appearance, in the fulguration of presence, in the Parousia and, ultimately, when there is something instead of nothing, is joy." (''The Essence of Manifestation'', § 70)
* "But joy is not something about which one may be joyful. For joy, coming after the advent of being and marvelling before it, is consubstantial with being, joy founds it and forms it." (''The Essence of Manifestation'', § 70)
* "Community is a subterranean affective water table and each one drinks the same water at this source and at this well that he is." (''Material Phenomenology'')

=== On the problems of society ===
* "Marxism is the totality of the misinterpretations of Marx." (''Marx, a Philosophy of Human Being'')
* "Culture is the totality of the enterprises and practices in which the abundance of life expresses itself, they all have as motivation the « load », the « over » which disposes inwardly the living subjectivity as a force ready to give unstintingly itself and constraint, under the load, to do it." (''Barbarism'')
* "Barbarism is unused energy." (''Barbarism'')
* "So it is not self-realisation that media existence proposes for life, but escape, the opportunity for all those whose laziness, repressing their energy, makes them forever so dissatisfied with themselves as to forget this dissatisfaction." (''Barbarism'')
* "No abstraction, no ideality has ever been in a position to produce a real action or, as a result, what only represents it." (''From Communism to Capitalism'')
* "When that which feels nothing, not even itself, and has no desire and no love, is made the principle of organisation of the world, the time of madness has arrived, because madness has lost everything except reason." (''From Communism to Capitalism'')

=== On art and painting ===
* "The sight of beauty which embodies itself in a living being is infinitely more touching than that of more grandiose work." (''Love with Closed Eyes'')
* "He who wishes to represent this force will represent a column, the heavy blocks of stone of the pediment and of the roof – ''he will represent the temple, represent the world''. Briesen draws the force of the music, the original force of Suffering and of Life : he draws ''nothing''." (Article « Drawing music, theory for the art of Briesen », in ''Phénoménologie de la vie'', tome III)
* "''Painting does not use language''. Abstract painting teaches us this, and this is what gives it its power of expression. If colour does not relate to the feelings of our soul through an external relation but finds its true being in them – as a pure sensation and a pure experience – then it does not even need to translate, through a means, the abstract content of our invisible life. It coincides with our invisible life and is its pathos: its suffering, its boredom, its neglect or its joy." (''Seeing the invisible, on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;72)
* "If communication takes place between the artwork and the public, it is on the level of sensibility, through the emotions and their immanent modifications. It does not have anything to do with words, with collective, ideological or scientific representations, or with their critical, intellectual or literary formulations, in short, anything that is called culture. It is totally independent from that type of culture. This is why it is addressed to the group of people who ‘lack culture’. It is popular in the sense that it leads to what is most essential in each human being: one’s capacity to feel, to suffer and to love." (''Seeing the invisible, on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'', p. 73)
* "We gaze petrified at the hieroglyphs of the invisible, as they too stand motionless or only slowly change against the background of a nocturnal sky. We watch forces that slumbered within us, waiting stubbornly and patiently for millennia, even from the beginning of time. These forces explode into the violence and gleam of colours; they open spaces and engender the forms of the worlds. The forces of the cosmos are awakened within us. They lead us outside of time to join in their celebration dance and they do not let go of us. They do not stop – because not even they believed that it was possible to attain 'such happiness'. Art is the resurrection of eternal life." (''Seeing the invisible, on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;142)

=== On Christianity ===
* "I hear for ever the noise of my birth." (''I Am the Truth. Toward a philosophy of Christianity'')
* "To be born is not to come into the world. To be born is to come into life." (''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'')
* "But then, when and why is this emotional upheaval produced, which opens a person to his own essence ? Nobody knows. The emotional opening of the person to his own essence can only be born of the will of life itself, as a rebirth that lets him suddenly experience his eternal birth. The Spirit blows where it wills." (''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'')
* "No object has ever had the experience of being touched." (''Incarnation. A Philosophy of the Flesh'')
* "So my flesh is not only the principle of the constitution of my objective body, it hides in it its invisible substance. Such is the strange condition of this object that we call a body : it doesn’t consist at all in the visible appearance to which we have always reduced it ; precisely in its reality it is invisible. Nobody has ever seen a man, but nobody has ever seen his body either, if by « body » we understand his real body." (''Incarnation. A Philosophy of the Flesh'')
* "Our flesh carries in it the principle of its manifestation, and this manifestation is not the appearing of the world. In its pathetic self-impressionality, in its very flesh, given to itself in the Arch-passibility of absolute Life, it reveals the one which reveals itself to itself, it is in its pathos the Arch-revelation of Life, the Parousia of the absolute. In the depths of its Night, our flesh is God." (''Incarnation. A Philosophy of the Flesh'')
* "Life is uncreated. Foreign to creation, foreign to the world, every process conferring Life is a process of generation." (''Words of Christ'')

== Descriptions of selected works ==

=== On the problems of society ===
* ''La barbarie (Barbarism)'': Culture, which is the self-development of life, is threatened in our society by the barbarism of the monstrous objectivity of technoscience, whose ideologies reject all form of subjectivity, while life is condemned to escape its anguish in the media universe.
* ''Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d'une catastrophe (From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe)'': The collapse of the eastern communist systems corresponds to the bankruptcy of a system that claimed to deny the reality of life in favour of falsely universal abstractions. But death is also at the meeting-point in the empire of capitalism and of modern technology.

=== On art and painting ===
* ''Voir l'invisible, sur Kandinsky (Seeing the Invisible, about Kandinsky)'': Art can save man, abandoned by our technological civilization, from his confusion. This is this spiritual quest that led Kandinsky to the creation of abstract painting. It is no longer a matter of representing the world but our inner life, by means of lines and colors that correspond to inner forces and sonorities.

=== On Christianity ===
* ''{{lang|fr|C'est moi la Vérité, pour une philosophie du christianisme}} (I am the Truth: Toward a Philosophy of Christianity)'': This book explains the kind of truth that Christianity tries to transmit to Man. Christianity opposes to the truth of the world the [[Truth of Life]], according to which man is the Son of God. The self-revelation of Life which experiences itself in its invisible interiority is the essence of God in which each individual is grounded. In the world, Jesus has the appearance of a man, but it is in the Truth of Life that he is the Christ, the First Living Being.
* ''Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)'': The living flesh is radically opposed to the material body, because it is the flesh which, experiencing itself, enjoying itself in accordance with ever-renewed impressions, is able to feel the body which is exterior to it, to touch it and to be touched by it. It is the flesh which allows us to know the body. The fundamental teaching of the prologue to the Gospel according to St. John, who says that the Word became flesh, asserts the improbable thesis that God incarnated himself in a mortal flesh like ours — it asserts the unity of the Word and the flesh in Christ. What is it for flesh to be the place of God’s revelation, and in what does this revelation consist?
* ''Paroles du Christ (Words of Christ)'': Can man understand in his own language the word of God, a word that speaks in another language? The words of the Christ seem to many to be an immoderate claim because they claim not only to transmit the truth or a divine revelation, but to ''be'' this Revelation and this Truth, the Word of God himself, of this God that Christ himself claims to be.

=== Literary works ===
* ''Le jeune officier (The Young Officer)'': This first novel evokes the struggle of a young officer against evil, embodied by rats on a ship.
* ''L'amour les yeux fermés (Love With Closed Eyes)'': This novel, which won the [[Renaudot Prize]], is the account of the destruction of a city which has reached the peak of its development and refinement and which is suffering from an insidious evil.
* ''Le fils du roi (The Son of the King)'': A story of life locked up in a psychiatric hospital and confronted by the rationality of psychiatrists.
* ''Le cadavre indiscret (The Indiscreet Corpse)'': In this novel, Henry tells us of the anxiety of the assassins of the secret and too honest treasurer of a political party, who finance an investigation to discover what is really known about them and to reassure themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">'''Noogony''' is a general term for any [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] that attempts to explain the origin of [[concept]]s in the [[mind|human mind]] by considering sense or ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' data as solely relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti, Roberto. ''Observation'', The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Vol. 37, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 1-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The word was used, famously, by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' to refer to what he understood to be [[John Locke|Locke's]] account of the origin of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A271/B327 (p. 372 in Guyer/Wood)&lt;/ref&gt; While Kant himself maintained that some concepts, e.g. [[causality|cause and effect]], did not ''arise'' from experience,&lt;ref&gt;"But although [all human] cognition commences '''with''' experience, yet it does not on that account all arise '''from''' experience." Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason'', B1 (p. 136 in Guyer/Wood)&lt;/ref&gt; he took Locke to be suggesting that ''all'' concepts came from experience.

Historically, Kant presents a caricature of Locke's position, not a completely accurate account of Locke's epistemology. Locke's actual theory of knowledge was more subtle than Kant seems to render it in his ''Critique''. As Guyer/Wood note &lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason'', note 105, (p. 734 in Guyer/Wood)&lt;/ref&gt; in their edition of the ''Critique'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Presumably Kant here has in mind Locke's claim that sensation and reflection are the two sources of all our ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'', bk. II, ch. i, §§ 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; and is understanding Locke's reflection to be reflection on sensation only. This would be a misunderstanding of Locke, since Locke says that we get simple ideas from reflection on the "operations of our own Mind," a doctrine which is actually a precursor to Kant's view that the laws of our own intuition and thinking furnish the forms of knowledge to be added to the empirical contents furnished by sensation, although of course Locke did not go very far in developing this doctrine; in particular, he did not see that mathematics and logic could be used as sources of information about the operations of the mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Organization for Bat Conservation (OBC)''' was a national environmental education nonprofit based in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]] established to educate and inspire people to save bats. In February 2018, it was announced that the Organization was ceasing operations due to unexpected financial problems and personnel changes.

==History==
Founded in 1992, OBC was a leading environmental educator focused on bats. Its home base was at the Cranbrook Institute of Science in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where OBC operated the Bat Zone, a live animal center with approximately 200 animals including bats from around the world and other nocturnal animals. Each year, thousands of visitors came to the Bat Zone to attend tours and participate in live animal educational programs. OBC educators traveled throughout the country to present education programs to children and adults at schools, festivals, museums, science and nature centers each year. 

OBC also organized and participated in several special events. The Annual Great Lakes Bat Festival, started in 2002, was created to celebrate the role of bats in the Great Lakes ecosystem as insect eaters, while dispelling misconceptions that generate fears and threaten bats and their habitats around the world. The goal of the festival is to help people understand the impact to natural ecosystems and human economies should bat populations continue to decline.

OBC also shares its mission through print and television appearances including The Tonight Show, The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Today Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Fox &amp; Friends, The Doctors, National Geographic TV, and Martha Stewart Living. 

Rob Mies was removed from his position as Executive Director of OBC in February 2018. 
Shortly after his dismissal, OBC announced that it would cease operation due to unexpected financial struggles.
Mies disagrees with the decision to dissolve OBC, and has called for the resignation of its board members to save the organization.&lt;ref name="Detroit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2018/02/20/bat-zone-closing-pontiac-sexual-harassment/352944002/ |title=Popular Bat Zone faces shutdown after co-founder terminated |last=Abdel-Baqui |first=Omar |date=20 February 2018 |work=Detroit Free Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Conservation Campaign===
In September 2014, OBC launched a new public action campaign called Save the Bats. Save the Bats is aimed at preventing the decline of bat populations. Save the Bats encourages people to take local action to conserve bats, including installing bat houses, planting wildlife gardens, and teaching others about the importance of bats. The campaign has many celebrity, government agency and corporate supporters.

In addition, OBC and Warner Brothers Entertainment worked together on the set of Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice to re-purpose parts of the movie set into bat houses. Director Zack Snyder contacted OBC when he heard about bats dying off from White-nose Syndrome and enlisted Rob Mies, OBC Executive Director, to assist in the bat house design and construction. More than 150 bat houses were made on the movie set in Pontiac, some of which were painted and signed by Zack, Amy Adams, and Ben Affleck. The bat houses will be auctioned off to support the Save the Bats campaign. Warner Brothers released a short PSA documenting the bat house build featuring Ben Affleck encouraging people to join the campaign. To date, more than 1,000,000 people have viewed the video.

===Property acquisition===
In August 2017, Organization for Bat Conservation purchased the mineral rights for Magazine Mine, a [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] mine in southern [[Illinois]]. Magazine Mine is one of the largest [[Indiana bat]] [[hibernaculum (zoology)#Bats|hibernacula]] in the world.&lt;ref name="magazine 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://batconservation.org/magazine-mine-acquired/ |title=The Organization for Bat Conservation Acquires the Magazine Mine |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=30 August 2017 |website=batconservation.org |publisher=Organization for Bat Conservation |access-date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Virilio''' ({{IPA-fr|viʁiljo|lang}}; 4 January 1932 – 10 September 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/09/18/mort-de-paul-virilio-penseur-de-l-acceleration-du-monde_1679527 Mort de Paul Virilio, penseur de l'accélération du monde] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]], [[Urban planning|urbanist]], and [[aesthetic]] philosopher. He is best known for his writings about [[technology]] as it has developed in relation to speed and power, with diverse references to architecture, the arts, the city and the military.

According to two geographers, Virilio was a "historian of warfare, technology and photography, a philosopher of architecture, military strategy and cinema, and a politically engaged provocative commentator on history, terrorism, mass media and human-machine relations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Luke]] &amp; [[Gearóid Ó Tuathail]] (2000) "Thinking Geopolitical Space: The spatiality of war, speed and vision in the work of Paul Virilio", in ''Thinking Space'', [[Mike Crang]] &amp; [[Nigel Thrift]] editors, Routledge, page 361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paul Virilio was born in [[Paris]] in 1932 to an Italian communist father and a Catholic [[Bretons|Breton]] mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berthou|first1=Benoît|last2=Chautard|first2=Sophie|last3=Guislain|first3=Gilbert|title=100 hommes qui ont fait la France du XXe siècle|date=2003|publisher=Studyrama|page=193|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=NqCdJX6KuPAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the northern coastal French region of Brittany. The Second World War made a big impression on him as the city of [[Nantes]] fell victim to the German [[Blitzkrieg]], became a port for the German navy and was bombarded by British and American planes. The "war was his university". After training at the [[École des métiers d'art]], Virilio specialised in stained-glass artwork, and worked alongside [[Henri Matisse]] in churches in Paris. In 1950, he converted to [[Christianity]]. After being conscripted into the army during the [[Algerian war of independence]], Virilio attended lectures in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=school&gt;[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/paul-virilio Paul Virilio]. Faculty page at [[European Graduate School]]. Accessed: March 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Virilio conducted a [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenological]] inquiry into military space and the organization of territory, particularly concerning the [[Atlantic Wall]]—the 15,000 Nazi bunkers built during [[World War II]] along the coastline of France and designed to repel any Allied assault. In 1963 he began collaborating with the architect [[Claude Parent]] and formed the [[Architecture Principe]] group (Among the small group of interns were the architects Francois Seigneur and [[Jean Nouvel]]). After participating in the [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968 uprising in Paris]], Virilio was nominated Professor by the students at the [[École Spéciale d'Architecture]]. In 1973 he became Director of Studies. In the same year, Virilio became director of the magazine ''[[L'Espace Critique]]''. In 1975 he co-organized the [[Bunker Archéologie]] exhibition at the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Decorative Arts Museum]] in Paris, a collection of texts and images relating to the Atlantic Wall. Since then he has been widely published, translated and anthologised.

Since 1998, Virilio was teaching intensive seminars at [[European Graduate School]].&lt;ref name=school/&gt; His last projects involved working with homeless groups in Paris and building the first Museum of the Accident.&lt;ref name=school/&gt;

==Theoretical arguments==

===The war model===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
Virilio developed what he called the "war model" of the modern city and of human society in general and is the inventor of the term 'dromology', meaning the logic of speed that is the foundation of technological society. His major works include ''[[War and Cinema]]'', ''Speed and Politics'' and ''The Information Bomb'' in which he argues, among many other things, that military projects and technologies drive history.  Like some other cultural theorists, he rejects labels - including 'cultural theorist' - yet he has been linked by others with post-structuralism and postmodernism. Some people describe Virilio's work as being positioned in the realm of the 'hypermodern'.  He has repeatedly affirmed his links with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], for example, and offers humanist critiques of [[modernist art movements]] such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]. Throughout his books the political and theological themes of [[anarchism]], [[pacifism]] and [[Catholicism]] reappear as central influences to his self-proclaimed 'marginal' approach to the question of technology.  His work has been compared to that of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Ellul]],  and others. Virilio was also an [[urbanist]]. After having been a longtime resident of the city of Paris, he moved to [[La Rochelle]].

Virilio's predictions about 'logistics of perception' - the use of images and information in war - (in ''[[War and Cinema]]'', 1984) were so accurate that during the [[Gulf War]] he was invited to discuss his ideas with French military officers. Virilio argued that it was a 'world war in miniature'.

===The integral accident===

Virilio believed that [[technology]] cannot exist without the potential for accidents. For example, Virilio argued that the invention of the locomotive also contained the invention of [[derailment]].&lt;ref name="shipwreck" /&gt; He saw the Accident as a rather negative growth of [[social positivism]] and [[scientific progress]]. He believed the growth of technology, namely [[television]], separates us directly from the events of real space and real time. In it he suggested we lose wisdom and sight of our immediate horizon and resort to the indirect horizon of our dissimulated environment. From this angle, the Accident can be mentally pictured as a sort of "fractal meteorite" whose impact is prepared in the propitious darkness, a landscape of events concealing future collisions. [[Aristotle]] claimed that "there is no science of the accident", but Virilio disagreed, pointing to the growing credibility of [[simulator]]s designed to escape the accident— which he argued is an industry that is born from the unholy marriage of post-WW2 science and the [[military-industrial complex]].
:The first deterrence, nuclear deterrence, is presently being superseded by the second deterrence: a type of deterrence based on what I call 'the information bomb' associated with the new weaponry of information and communications technologies. Thus, in the very near future, and I stress this important point, it will no longer be war that is the continuation of politics by other means, it will be what I have dubbed 'the integral accident' that is the continuation of politics by other means.&lt;ref name=kosovo&gt;John Armitage (October 18, 2000) [http://www.ctheory.net/text_file.asp?pick=132 The Kosovo War Took Place In Orbital Space: Paul Virilio in Conversation], ''Ctheory''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dromology===

''[[wikt:δρόμος|Dromos]]'' is an Ancient Greek noun for race or racetrack, which Virilio applied the activity of racing (Virilio 1977:47). It is with this meaning in mind that he coined the term 'dromology', which he defined as the "science (or logic) of speed“. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He noted that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower.  'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.' &lt;ref name=kosovo/&gt;

===Logistics of perception===

In contemporary warfare, logistics does not just imply the movement of personnel, tanks, fuel and so on, but also the movement of images both to and from the battlefield. Virilio talked a lot about the creation of [[CNN]] and the concept of the newshound. The newshound will capture images which will then be sent to CNN, which may then be broadcast to the public. This movement of images can start a conflict (Virilio uses the example of the events following the broadcasting of the [[Rodney King]] footage).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Virilio (1995) ''The Art of the Motor'', Julie Rose translator, page 20, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logistics of perception relates also to the televising of military maneuvers and the images of conflict that are watched not only by people at home, but also by the military personnel involved in the conflict. The 'field of battle' also exists as a 'field of perception'.

===War of movement===

For Virilio, the [[transition from feudalism to capitalism]] was driven not primarily by the politics of wealth and production techniques but by the mechanics of war. Virilio argued that the traditional feudal fortified city disappeared because of the increasing sophistication of weapons and possibilities for warfare. For Virilio, the concept of siege warfare became rather a war of movement. In ''[[Speed and Politics]]'', he argues that 'history progresses at the speed of its weapons systems'.

==Reception==
Virilio was one of the many cultural theorists (and other [[postmodernists]]) criticized by physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] in 1997 for what they characterize as misunderstanding and misuse of science and mathematics.&lt;ref name=SoBr&gt;[[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] (1998) ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science]]'', first published in French as ''Impostures Intellectuelles'' in 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan (2008) ''[[Beyond the Hoax|Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Virilio's works are the subject of chapter 10 of [[Fashionable Nonsense]]. Their criticism consists of a series of quotes (often long) from Virilio's works, and then explanations of how Vilirio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology, to the point of absurdity. In the authors' words:

:The writings of Paul Virilio revolve principally around the themes of technology, communication, and speed. They contain a plethora of references to physics, particularly the theory of relativity. Though Virilio’s sentences are slightly more meaningful than those of Deleuze-Guattari, what is presented as "science" is a mixture of monumental confusions and wild fantasies. Furthermore, his analogies between physics and social questions are the most arbitrary imaginable, when he does not simply become intoxicated with his own words. We confess our sympathy with many of Virilio’s political and social views; but the cause is not, alas, helped by his pseudo-physics.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|169}}

A criticism of a passage often reads something like this:
:Here Virilio mixes up [[velocity]] (vitesse) and [[acceleration]], the two basic concepts of [[kinematics]] (the description of motion), which are introduced and carefully distinguished at the beginning of every introductory physics course.[221] Perhaps this confusion isn’t worth stressing; but for a purported specialist in the philosophy of speed, it is nonetheless a bit surprising.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|170}}

They end their chapter with a long quote followed by this comment:
:This paragraph — which in the French original is a single 193-word sentence, whose "poetry" is unfortunately not fully captured by the translation — is the most perfect example of diarrhea of the pen that we have ever encountered. And as far as we can see, it means precisely nothing.&lt;ref name=SoBr/&gt;{{rp|175}}

A book-length cricism of Virilio’s work to 2004 was written by [[Steve Redhead]].&lt;ref name=SR&gt;[[Steve Redhead]] (2004) ''Paul Virilio: Theorist for an Accelerated Culture'', [[Edinburgh University Press]] {{ISBN|0-7486-1927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed:
:His scattergun writing style is not always easy to follow, often provoking disorientation and dislocation at the very least. Insights, personal memories, detailed histories, major theoretical leaps and banalities sit side by side.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|137}}
He also notes that Virilio does not pass the grade in [[academic studies]]:
:Reading Virilio thoroughly does leave the reader with the feeling of many dislocated, undeveloped ideas swirling around often at the level of great generality. The content is often not particularly logical if viewed from a conventional academic perspective in the human or social sciences.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|138}}
However, for Law and Popular Culture, Redhead concedes Virilio as a factor:
:Paul Virilio’s writing have long had a major role in the theoretical socio-legal studies subdiscipline of law and popular culture which has operated at the intersection of [[critical legal studies]] and [[cultural studies]] for over two decades.&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|149}}

In 2014 an analyst of security, technology and global politics noted:
:Virilio is unlikely to be read in the 'mainstream' of academia (although one might find his works on the reading lists of a [[military academy]]).&lt;ref name=Lacy&gt;Mark Lacy (2014) ''Security, Technology and Global Politics, thinking with Virilio'', [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|978-0-415-57604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}
He credits Virilio with balancing the propaganda of progress against the management of fear at some cost:
:Virilio draws on and develops points that are made by many critical thinkers from (predominantly) the twentieth century (most notably [[Walter Benjamin]]), assembling ideas in new contexts, creating a vision of the world through concepts and language that is often unsettling, a (re)description that makes the world feel strange and unfamiliar. Virilio’s often alien-sounding concepts attempt to enable us to see the world anew, to view a world that is presented to us in terms of fear and progress as something alien (and alienating), to give a form to feelings and suspicions that remain vague, unclear, uncertain, out of place.&lt;ref name=Lacy/&gt;{{rp|17}}

==Quotes==
: 'War was my university. Everything has proceeded from there.'&lt;ref&gt;James Der Derian. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030504135718/http://www.watsoninstitute.org/infopeace/vy2k/futurewar.cfm Future War. A discussion with Paul Virilio] In: virtually2k. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 'The invention of the ship was also the invention of the shipwreck.'&lt;ref name=shipwreck&gt;There are a least two different instances of this quote: 1) "When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution...Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress." (''Politics of the Very Worst'', New York: Semiotext(e), 1999, p. 89); 2) “To invent the sailing ship or the steamer is to invent the shipwreck. To invent the train is to invent the rail accident of derailment.  To invent the family automobile is to produce the pile-up on the highway.” (''The Original Accident'', Cambridge: Polity, 2007, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[speed of light]] and [[globalization]] figure in Virilio's writing. At one point he wrote:
: 'The speed of light does not merely transform the world. It becomes the world. Globalization is the speed of light.'&lt;ref name=kosovo/&gt;
Virilio is also quoted as saying,
:'There is no such thing as globalization, there is only virtualization. What is being effectively globalized by instantaneity is time.'&lt;ref name=SR/&gt;{{rp|149}}

'''Peter Vaudreuil Lamarque''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɑr|k}}; born 21 May 1948) is a [[philosopher]] of [[art]], working in the [[analytic tradition]]. Since 2000&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Lamarque  Professor|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/peter-lamarque/|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  he has been a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of York]]. He is known primarily for his work in [[philosophy of literature]] and on the role of [[emotions]] in [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Lamarque, studies of|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/peter-lamarque/#research|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and work==
Lamarque was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[English literature|English]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of East Anglia]]. He then completed a [[BPhil]] in Philosophy at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1972, where he worked under the supervision of [[L. Jonathan Cohen]].

From 1972 to 1995 Lamarque taught in the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Stirling]], and from 1995 to 2000 he held the [[Ferens Chair in Philosophy]] at the [[University of Hull]]. In 2000, he moved to the University of York to take up his current position. He has held visiting positions in several universities around the world, including [[Cornell University]] (USA) and the [[Australian National University]] (Australia).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lamarque has published extensively on various philosophical topics, mostly in the area of analytic [[philosophy of art]]. He put forward the first systematic articulation of an approach to the [[paradox of fiction]] usually referred to as 'thought theory'.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Lamarque (1981), "How Can We Fear and Pity Fictions?", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'' '''21''', pp. 291-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of the ''[[British Journal of Aesthetics]]'' from 1995 to 2008. In 2009 he was chosen to give the first ever BSA/ASA Wollheim Memorial Lecture at the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] Annual Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://british-aesthetics.org/richard-wollheim-lectures-bsa-annual-meeting/|title=Richard Wollheim Lectures: BSA Annual Meeting – The British Society of Aesthetics|website=british-aesthetics.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401231938/http://www.aesthetics-online.org/events/index.php?events_id=193|title=ASA Annual Meeting|date=2014-04-01|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 he was awarded the "Premio Internazionale d'Estetica" by the Italian Society of Aesthetics (SIE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fattoadarte.corriere.it/2018/05/03/a-peter-lamarque-il-premio-estetica-2018/|title=A Peter Lamarque il Premio Estetica 2018|access-date=2018-05-08|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A U.S. Coast Guard recruit, assigned to Company Oscar 188, performs a plank during incentive training at Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in Cape May, N.J., July 31, 2013 130731-G-WA946-943.jpg|thumb|Recruit performing a plank at a US Coast Guard training]]
The '''plank''' (also called a '''front hold''', '''hover''', or '''abdominal bridge''') is an [[isometric exercise|isometric]] [[core (anatomy)|core]] strength exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a [[push-up]] for the maximum possible time.

== Form ==

The most common plank is the forearm plank which is held in a push-up-like position, with the body's weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes.  Many variations exist such as the side plank and the reverse plank.&lt;ref name=Garcia57/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neporent263/&gt; The plank is commonly practiced in [[pilates]] and [[yoga]], and by those training for [[boxing]] and other sports.&lt;ref name=Chabut/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patsis176/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lurie260/&gt;

The "Extended Plank" adds substantial difficulty to the standard plank exercise. To perform the extended plank, a person begins in the push-up position and reaches their arms/hands as far forward as possible.&lt;ref name=PToBE/&gt;

== Effect ==

The plank strengthens the abdominals, back, and shoulders. Muscles involved in the front plank include:
* Primary muscles: [[erector spinae muscles|erector spinae]], [[rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] (abs), and [[transversus abdominis muscle|transverse abdominis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Secondary muscles ([[synergist]]s/[[segmental stabilizers]]): [[trapezius muscle|trapezius]] (traps), [[rhomboid muscles|rhomboids]], [[rotator cuff]], the anterior, medial, and posterior [[deltoid muscle]]s (delts), [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]] (pecs), [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (glutes), [[quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps]] (quads), and [[gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Muscles involved in the side plank include:
* Primary: [[transversus abdominis muscle]], [[gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]] muscles (abductors), the [[adductor muscles of the hip]], and the [[abdominal external oblique muscle|external]], and [[abdominal internal oblique muscle|internal obliques]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
* Secondary: gluteus maximus (glutes), quadriceps (quads), and [[hamstring]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== World record ==

The world record for a front plank, resting on elbows, was set by Chinese policeman Mao Weidong, who formerly held the record and regained it by planking for 8 hours, 1 minute and 1 second in May 2016.

But George Hood in the plank position at the Indian Boundary YMCA in Downers Grove set two world records during event at the facility on June 28, 2018. (George Hood).

Hood, 60, who currently lives in Naperville, broke the world record for longest plank at 10 hours, 10 minutes and 10 seconds at the Indian Boundary YMCA in Downers Grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-george-hood-sets-world-records-st-0701-story.html|title=A fitness instructor from Aurora has set 2 world records for planking|first=Jessie|last=Spangler|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous record was set by former Marine officer and retired Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent George Hood with a time of 5 hours, 15 minutes and 15 seconds in April 2016.&lt;ref name=Record2016/&gt;

[[File:Singapore MRT Fines.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Sign displaying prohibited activities on a public transport system. The term "[[durian]]s" refers to the very offensive smelling fruit of a plant]]
On most [[public transport]] systems, there are at least some activities passengers are prohibited to engage in. Activities like these, which can be restricted in vehicles, stations, and other property of the agency, are prohibited for a variety of reasons. These include keeping other passengers safe and comfortable, protecting the operator, or protecting the vehicles and stations.

Penalties for violations can vary. They can include [[fine (penalty)|fines]], [[arrest]], [[prosecution]], or removal from the service.

==Eating and drinking==
Many local public transport services, such as [[municipal bus]] or [[rapid transit]] systems (one notable exception being the [[New York City Subway]]), prohibit passengers from consuming food or beverages or carrying open food or beverage containers while on board a vehicle or in a station.

Generally, services providing longer forms of transportation, such as [[regional rail]] or [[intercity bus]]es, will allow at least some eating and drinking. But some services, like [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], prohibit eating and drinking.

In emergency cases these prohibitions may be waived. The [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] has a strict ban on consumption of food or drink in the paid area of train stations, on trains or buses, or on elevators or escalators used to enter or exit stations, in order to reduce attractiveness to insects and vermin. Fines of $100 can be imposed, except the Authority has lifted the ban with respect to consumption of water during heat emergencies.

A survey of [[SEPTA]] riders found that 48% of riders eat while on board their services either regularly or some of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.septa.org/cs/survey/results/013.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
[[Smoking]] is one of the most common prohibitions on board a public transport vehicle. Since [[second-hand smoke]] can be hazardous to one's health, smoking is prohibited in most public places worldwide, including public transport.

Note that as of 2016, the prohibition on smoking only applies to cigarettes which burn something that generates smoke (e.g. tobacco or marijuana), although some localities want to ban public smoking of [[electronic cigarette]]s.

In 1975, a [[federal law]] was passed in the [[United States]] banning smoking in all public transport vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Smoking and the workplace By Roger Blanpain, Gordon Anderson, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[intercity bus]] services will stop to offer smoke breaks to riders.

==Audio devices==
Most systems prohibit the use of audio-producing devices, such as [[radio]]s, [[CD player]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, or other similar gadgets without an earphone through which only the listener can hear.

==Mobile phones==
Some public transport systems prohibit or limit the use of mobile phones while on board.

Some rail systems have "quiet cars" where passengers are not permitted to engage in conversations and where cell phones cannot be used.

==Photography==
In some places, it is unlawful to photograph or film a public transport vehicle or station or the operation of a public transportation service.

Anti-photography laws (or rules) are in place for various reasons, including the privacy of passengers and crew and concerns over [[terrorism]]. However, these measures have caused problems for enthusiasts whose hobby is to ride and photograph transport. In some cities, the rules have been abandoned or modified. In other places, the authorities regard enthusiasts as their supporters and encourage their activities so long as they are carried out in a lawful manner from places open to the general public.

In the United States, it is generally legal to take photographs in public, and absent special and extraordinary conditions, a law prohibiting photography in public areas of a transit vehicle or area operated by a transit authority, or a transit authority prohibition on photography under such conditions likely would not withstand judicial scrutiny, and the courts probably would not uphold such bans.

==Solicitation==
Many systems have anti-solicitation laws or guidelines. These include prohibitions against:
*Selling, advertising the sale of, or purchasing goods or services
*Campaigning or handing out literature for a political candidate, cause, or religion
*Soliciting signatures, sometimes including those opposing cutbacks or changes in service
*[[Begging]] (panhandling)

==Space considerations==
Some services have guidelines regarding the amount of space a passenger can take up whether with one's body or belongings.

In some transit systems, including the [[New York City Subway]], it is unlawful to place one's belongings on another seat, even when vacant; however, in the New York City Subway, this rule is flouted all the time.

Privately run intercity bus services usually have limits for carry-on and checked luggage, similar to the [[baggage allowance]] system on airplanes.

Some transit systems have a seating precedence rule for passengers who pay adult fare against discounted passengers, i.e. discounted and free-pass holders may not sit unless all adults paying full-fare sit.

==Criminal acts==
While any crime committed on a public transport system would generally be treated like one committed elsewhere, there are some acts for which the prohibitions are emphasized in guidelines on posted signs.

===Disorderly conduct===
*Use of [[roller skate]]s, [[roller blade]]s, [[skateboard]]s, [[Kick scooter|scooters]], or similar vehicles on transit property (many operators have bicycle racks on the front of buses, and will permit bicycles which are walked to be used on vehicles not having separate facilities such as subway trains.)
*Drunken or other similar behavior
*Use of [[profanity]]. In the United States, this is controversial due to [[First Amendment (U.S. Constitution)|First Amendment]] protections. However a private operator has the right to establish rules on their property as they see fit.

===Vagrancy===
*Sleeping. This refers not to accidental dozing, but to the intentional use of the system as a place to sleep.
*[[Loitering]] at a bus stop or rail station longer than is necessary to catch the bus or train, or spending time there at all if not using the service.
*Riding a bus or train through multiple runs of the service, even with an [[bus pass|unlimited travel pass]] for the period of time for which the act is occurring.

===Other===
*[[Vandalism]] (including [[graffiti]] or [[destruction of property]])
*[[Littering]]
*[[Expectoration]] (spitting)

==Prohibited items==

===Firearms===
Generally, firearms, in countries where they are otherwise allowed to be carried by civilians, are not permitted on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions can be made for [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[military]] personnel or others with a carrying permit.

===Explosives and flammables===
Many systems prohibit explosives and flammable liquids that pose threat to the safety of others.

===Animals===
Many places prohibit live animals from being brought on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions are sometimes made for animals kept within a container from which they cannot escape or [[service animal]]s for those with disabilities.

===Bicycles===
On most rail systems, bicycles are allowed, but may be restricted. On buses, there are more such limitations.

Many buses now have external bike racks where riders can attach their bikes.

Sometimes, bikes are only allowed on buses if there is enough free space.

'''Ralph Wilbur Hood''' (born 1942) is a professor of [[psychology]] at [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga]].

==Biography==
Hood was born on 18 July 1942 in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=108,110}}

==Academic career==
Hood received his BS at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], an MS at [[California State University|California State College]] at Los Angeles (1966), and a PhD at [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (1968).&lt;ref name=hoodfacpage&gt;[http://www.utc.edu/Academic/PsychologyAdvisement/ralph_hood_phd.htm Faculty page for Ralph Hood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603021505/http://www.utc.edu/Academic/PsychologyAdvisement/ralph_hood_phd.htm |date=June 3, 2010 }} (accessed June 17, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hood is a former editor of the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' (1995–1999), and has been coeditor of ''[[The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]'' (1992–1995) and ''Archiv für Religionpsychologie'' (2005–).

==Research topics==
Hood's "Mysticism scale," based on [[Walter Terence Stace|Walter Stace]]'s distinction between "introverted" and "extroverted" [[mysticism]], was developed in the 1970s, and is a well-known research instrument for [[mystical experiences]].

Hood is also well known for researching [[snake handling]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Criticism==
{{See also|Walter Terence Stace#Criticism|l1=Criticisms of Walter Stace}}

Stace's work in mystical experience has received strong criticisms, for its lack of methodological rigueur and its perennialist pre-assumptions.{{sfn|Moore|1973|p=148-150}}{{sfn|Masson|Masson|1976}}{{sfn|Katz|1978|p=22-32}}{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=97}}&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Jerome Gellman, ''Mysticism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Major criticism came from [[Steven T. Katz]] in his influential series of publications on mysticism and philosophy,{{refn|group=note|* Mysticism and Philosophical Analysis (Oxford University Press, 1978)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Religious Traditions (Oxford University Press, 1983)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Language (Oxford University Press, 1992)&lt;br&gt;* Mysticism and Sacred Scripture (Oxford University Press, 2000)}} and from [[Wayne Proudfoot]] in his ''Religious experience'' (1985).{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=32}}

In defense of Stace, Hood (2001) cites [[Robert K. C. Forman|Forman]], who argues that introverted mysticism is correctly conceptualized as a common core, since it lacks all content, and is the correct basis for a perennial philosophy.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=32-33}}{{refn|group=note|According to critics, Forman over-emphasizes the centrality of what he calls "pure conscious events" in mystical traditions, and also misunderstands its meaning in those traditions.&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford" /&gt;}} Hood notes that Stace's work is a conceptual approach, based on textual studies.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=32}} He posits his own work as a parallel approach, based on an empirical approach, thereby placing the conceptual claims in an empirical framework,{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=33}} assuming that Stace is correct in his approach.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p=33-34}}

Jacob van Belzen criticized Hood, noting that Hood validated the existence of a common core in mystical experiences, but based on a conceptual framework which presupposes the existence of such a common core: 
{{quote|[T]he instrument used to verify Stace's conceptualization of Stace is  not independent of Stace, but based on him."{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=97}}}}

Belzen also notes that religion does not stand on its own, but is embedded in a cultural context, which should be taken into account.{{sfn|Belzen|2010|p=50}} To this criticism Hood et al. answer that universalistic tendencies in religious research "are rooted first in inductive generalizations from cross-cultural consideration of either faith or mysticism,"{{sfn|Hood|2015|p=467}} stating that Stace sought out texts which he recognized as an expression of mystical expression, from which he created his universal core. Hood therefor concludes that Belzen "is incorrect when he claims that items were presupposed."{{sfn|Hood|2015|p=467}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf has criticised the idea that religious texts describe individual religious experience. According to Sharf, their authors go to great lengths to ''avoid'' personal experience, which would be seen as invalidating the presumed authority of the historical tradition.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}}

==Publications==

===Articles===
Hood has published numerous articles on the [[psychology of religion|psychology of religion and spirituality]] in professional journals.&lt;ref name=hoodfacpage/&gt;

* {{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Religious Fundamentalism|last = Hood|first = Ralph|publisher = the Guilford Press|year = 2005|isbn = 1593851502|location = New York, NY|pages = }}, coauthored with Peter C. Hill and W. Paul Williamson. The book covers fundamentalism in different Christian sects, varying from [[Amish]] to [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and also investigates [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islam]]. The authors seek to provide an experientially-based but empirically-minded psychological viewpoint on the concept of religious fundamentalism.
* {{Citation | last =Hood | first =Ralph | year =2005 | title = Handling Serpents | publisher =Mercer University Press}}. Jimmy Morrow, a church leader and serpent handler for more than 25 years, explores his lifetime of experiences from this unique form of Christian worship and reveals its history, previously unknown outside of the small communities where these rites are practiced. Hood shares insights into the social power of these practices and explains them from within a social psychological framework.
* {{Cite book|title = Them That Believe|last = Hood|first = Ralph|publisher = university of california|year = 2008|isbn = 9780520231474|location = london england|pages = }}. Hood has spent 15 years, along with W. Paul Williams, with snake handlers in [[Appalachia]], learning about their belief systems, and has used this research to help build a psychological viewpoint on the phenomena of [[fundamentalism]] in religion.

Father '''Reiner Schürmann''', [[Ordo Praedicatorum|O.P.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (February 4, 1941 &amp;ndash; August 20, 1993) was Professor of Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]].

== Biography ==
Born in Amsterdam in 1941 of German parents, Reiner Schürmann wrote all his major published work in [[French language|French]]. Professor in the department of philosophy of the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York at the time of his death, he was the author of three notable philosophical works: ''Maître Eckhart et la joie errante'' ("Master Eckhart and the Wandering Joy", 1972; translated into English as ''[[Meister Eckhart]]: Mystic and philosopher'' {{ISBN|0-253-35183-9}}, 1978), ''Le Principe d'anarchie, Heidegger et la question de l'agir'' (''From Principles to Anarchy: Heidegger on Being and Acting'', 1982), and lastly, the monumental work ''Des Hégémonies brisées'' (''Broken Hegemonies'' {{ISBN|0-253-21547-1}}, 2003), published posthumously in 1996.

[[Professor]] Schürmann studied philosophy and [[theology]] with the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] of [[Saulchoir|Le Centre d'études du Saulchoir]] near Paris, between 1962 and 1969, and received a [[Doctorate]] in Philosophy from the [[University of Sorbonne]] in Paris in 1981. It was as a Dominican [[Priest#Catholic and Orthodox|priest]] that he first came to the United States in 1971, teaching first at [[The Catholic University of America]] in Washington DC, then at [[Duquesne University]] in Pittsburgh. In his only literary work, ''Les Origines'', which was awarded the [[Prix Broquette-Gonin]] by the [[Académie Française]] in 1977, he provides an autobiographical account of a pilgrimage of errancy, a search for redemption from the inauthentic [[thrownness]] of a past filled with memories of guilt and despair, of being born German during World War II, "too late to see the war, too early to forget it." In 1976, he left the priesthood and began teaching philosophy at the New School as a protégé of [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Hans Jonas]].

One of Schürmann's best-known works is ''Heidegger on Being and Acting: From Principles to Anarchy'' (1990 reprint {{ISBN|0-253-20602-2}}). Schürmann points out the difference between the findings of Heidegger the thinker and the beliefs of Heidegger the man, and incidentally shows Heidegger's intellectual honesty in following these thoughts in spite of his personal upbringing and beliefs.

Reiner Schürmann died of complications caused by AIDS on August 20, 1993 in New York City.

'''Richard Bentley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}}; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English [[Classics|classical scholar]], critic, and theologian. He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the "founder of historical [[philology]]", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]
Bentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}

==Academic work==
He never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

In 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

The Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or "John the Rhetor". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

Bentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-François Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
In 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures ("A Confutation of Atheism"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

After being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

That same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}

===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===
Bentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), "to the joy," says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], "of Olearius and of no one else." He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti''. For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

He wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836–1838''&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Master of Trinity College===
In 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

After ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

The Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

===Later studies===
During his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679–1732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of "Phileleutherus Lipsiensis."  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

Although he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his version quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}

In 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].&lt;!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea--&gt;{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as "the oldest and best in the world".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

His ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

His ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him "the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: "...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}

Bentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Relationships and personal life==
According to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:
*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708–1782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}

His daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Later life==
In old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

==Legacy and honours==
*Bentley left about £5,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly £500,000 in 2010{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from [[Mount Athos]], to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*He bequeathed his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}
*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

According to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].
{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob Mähly (1828–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| Mähly|1868}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley "was the founder of historical philology." [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', "corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704–1766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}

Bentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate, who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them. They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority, including coercion, to achieve it.&lt;ref name="Stenner 2009 142–159"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stenner|first=Karen|title=Three Kinds of "Conservatism|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2009|pages=142–159|doi=10.1080/10478400903028615|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512090055/http://ussc.edu.au/s/media/docs/publications/1006_Inequality_Stenner.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2012|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept of right-wing authoritarianism was introduced in 1981 by Canadian-American psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, Bob (1981). ''Right-wing Authoritarianism''. University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as a refinement of the [[authoritarian personality]] theory originally pioneered by [[University of California, Berkeley]] researchers [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Daniel Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D. J., Sanford, R. N. (1950). ''The Authoritarian Personality''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis, Altemeyer found that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression and conventionalism. Researchers have traditionally assumed that there was just one kind of authoritarian personality, who could be either a follower or a leader. The discovery that followers and leaders are usually different types of authoritarians is based on research done by Sam McFarland.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1998 pp. 47"&gt;Altemeyer, Bob (1998). "The other 'authoritarian personality'". In M. Zanna (Ed.) ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology''. 30 (pp. 47–92). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==
Right-wing authoritarianism is measured by the RWA scale, which uses a [[Likert scale]] response. The first scored item on the scale states: "Our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us". People who strongly agree with this are showing a tendency toward authoritarian submission ("Our country desperately needs a mighty leader"), authoritarian aggression ("who will do what has to be done to destroy") and conventionalism ("the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us").&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, Bob (2007). ''The Authoritarians''. University of Manitoba. p. 15. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Fascism sidebar}}[[Psychometrics|Psychometrically]], the RWA scale was a significant improvement over the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was the original measure of the authoritarian personality. The F-scale was worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response, thus leaving it susceptible to the [[Acquiescence bias|acquiescence response bias]]. The RWA scale is balanced to have an equal number of pro and anti authoritarian statements. The RWA scale also has excellent internal reliability, with [[Cronbach's alpha|coefficient alpha]] typically measuring between 0.85 and 0.94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fodor|first=Eugene M.|author2=Wick, David P.|author3=Hartsen, Kim M.|author4=Preve, Rebecca M.|title=Right-Wing Authoritarianism in Relation to Proposed Judicial Action, Electromyographic Response, and Affective Attitudes Toward a Schizophrenic Mother|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=20 December 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=215–233|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00303.x|quote=Internal consistency of scale items for the RWA Scale (Altemeyer, 1996), as measured by alpha coefficients, consistently has been high, ranging from .85 to .94.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RWA scale has been modified over the years, as many of the items lost their social significance as society changed and the current version is 22 items long.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer (2007). ''The Authoritarians''. University of Manitoba. pp. 11–12 in Chapter 1 "Who Are the Authoritarian Followers?" http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Altemeyer has continually updated the scale, researchers in different domains have tended to lock-in on particular versions. For example, in the social psychology of religion the 1992 version of the scale is still commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LaBouff|first1=J. P.|last2=Rowatt|first2=W. C.|last3=Johnson|first3=M. K.|last4=Thedford|first4=M.|last5=Tsang|first5=J. A.|year=2010|title=Development and initial validation of an implicit measure of religiousness-spirituality|url=|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=49|issue=3|pages=439–455|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2010.01521.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the length of the earlier versions (30 items) led many researchers to develop shorter versions of the scale. Some of those are published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=See|last2=Smith|first2=Allison|last3=Winter|first3=David G.|year=2002|title=Right-wing authoritarianism, party identification, and attitudes toward feminism in student evaluations of the Clinton-Lewinsky story|url=|journal=Political Psychology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=355–383|doi=10.1111/0162-895x.00285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manganelli Rattazzi|first1=A. M.|last2=Bobbio|first2=A.|last3=Canova|first3=L.|year=2007|title=A short version of the Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) Scale|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=43|issue=5|pages=1223–1234|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many researchers simply select a subset of items to use in their research, a practice that Altemeyer strongly criticizes.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, Bob (2007). ''The Authoritarians''. University of Manitoba. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/&lt;/ref&gt;

The uni-dimensionality of the scale has also been challenged recently. For example, Funke&lt;ref name="Funke, F. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funke|first1=F|year=2005|title=The Dimensionality of Right-Wing Authoritarianism: Lessons from the Dilemma between Theory and Measurement|url=|journal=Political Psychology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=195–218|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that it is possible to extract the three underlying dimensions of RWA if the double- and triple-barreled nature of the items is removed. Given the possibility of underlying dimensions emerging from the scale, it is then the case that the scale is no longer balanced, since all the items primarily capturing authoritarian aggression are pro-trait worded (higher scores mean more authoritarianism) and all the items primarily measuring conventionalism are con-trait worded (higher scores mean less authoritarianism).&lt;ref name="Funke, F. 2005" /&gt; Work by Mavor, Louis and Sibley&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mavor|first1=K. I.|last2=Louis|first2=W. R.|last3=Sibley|first3=C. G.|year=2010|title=A bias-corrected exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of right-wing authoritarianism: Support for a three-factor structure|url=|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=48|issue=1|pages=28–33|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently demonstrated that the existence of 2 or 3 factors in the RWA scale reflects real differences in these dimensions rather than acquiescence response bias.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Attitudes ==
Right-wing authoritarians want society and social interactions structured in ways that increase uniformity and minimize diversity. In order to achieve that, they tend to be in favour of social control, coercion and the use of group authority to place constraints on the behaviours of people such as political dissidents and ethnic minorities. These constraints might include restrictions on immigration, limits on free speech and association and laws regulating moral behaviour. It is the willingness to support or take action that leads to increased social uniformity that makes right-wing authoritarianism more than just a personal distaste for difference. Right-wing authoritarianism is characterized by obedience to authority, moral absolutism, racial and ethnic prejudice and intolerance and punitiveness towards dissidents and deviants. In parenting, right-wing authoritarians value children's obedience, neatness and good manners.&lt;ref name="Stenner 2009 142–159"/&gt;

Duckitt &amp; Bizumic (2013) write that RWA measures the support "for the subordination of [[individual freedom]] and autonomy to the [[collective]] and its authority". Their studies show that it can be split into three distinct [[Factor analysis|factor]]s:&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;
* [[Authoritarianism]]: tough attitude towards violations of social rules, norms and laws;&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;
* [[Conservatism]]: favoring obedient and respectful support for societal authorities;&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;
* [[Traditionalist conservatism|Traditionalism]]: favoring traditional, religious social norms and values.&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259555113_Multidimensionality_of_Right-Wing_Authoritarian_Attitudes_Authoritarianism-Conservatism-Traditionalism|title=Multidimensionality of Right‐Wing Authoritarian Attitudes: Authoritarianism‐Conservatism‐Traditionalism|vauthors=Duckitt J, Bizumic, B|date=2013|doi=10.1111/pops.12022|volume=34|issue=6|pages=841-862|journal=Political Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of these three components of RWA resemble their standard use but actually correspond, instead, to the three statistical factors.

Right-wing authoritarianism was previously split differently into three [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudinal]] and [[behavior]]al clusters which [[Correlation and dependence|correlate]] together:&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1988). ''Enemies of freedom''. Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1996"&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1996). ''The authoritarian specter''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Authoritarian submission — a high degree of submissiveness to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives.
# Authoritarian aggression — a general aggressiveness directed against deviants, outgroups and other people that are perceived to be targets according to established authorities.
# Conventionalism — a high degree of adherence to the traditions and social norms that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities and a belief that others in one's society should also be required to adhere to these norms.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, Bob (2006). ''The Authoritarians'', p. 27. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology of "authoritarianism", "right-wing authoritarianism" and "authoritarian personality" tend to be used interchangeably by psychologists, though inclusion of the term "personality" may indicate a psychodynamic interpretation consistent with the original formulation of the theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Right and left ==
The phrase "right-wing" in right-wing authoritarianism does not necessarily refer to someone's politics, but to psychological preferences and personality. It means that the person tends to follow the established conventions and authorities in society. In theory, the authorities could have either [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altemeyer|first=Bob|title=The Authoritarians|year=2006|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Rokeach]]'s dogmatism scale was an early attempt to measure pure authoritarianism, whether left or right. The scale was carefully designed to measure [[Open-mindedness|closed-mindedness]] without regard to ideology. Nevertheless, researchers found that it correlated with [[Conservatism|British political conservativism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smithers|first1=A. G.|last2=Lobley|first2=D. M.|year=1978|title=Dogmatism, social attitudes and personality|url=|journal=British Journal of Social &amp; Clinical Psychology|volume=17|issue=|pages=135–142|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8260.1978.tb00255.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar line of research, Philip Tetlock found that right wing beliefs are associated with less [[integrative complexity]] than left wing beliefs. People with moderate liberal attitudes had the highest integrative complexity in their cognitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetlock|first1=P. E.|year=1984|title=Cognitive style and political belief systems in the British House of Commons|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=46|issue=|pages=365–375|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.2.365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of other attempts to identify "left-wing authoritarians" in the United States and Canada. These would be people who submit to leftist authorities, are highly conventional to liberal viewpoints and are aggressive to people who oppose left-wing ideology. These attempts have failed because measures of authoritarianism always correlate at least slightly with the right. However, left-wing authoritarians were found in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;de Regt, S, Mortelmans, D, Smits, T (2011). Left-wing authoritarianism is not a myth, but worrisome reality. Evidence from 13 Eastern European countries. In ''Communist and Post-Communist Studies''.
Volume 44. Issue 4. December 2011. pp. 299–308.&lt;/ref&gt; There are certainly extremists across the political spectrum, but most psychologists now believe that authoritarianism is a predominantly right-wing phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, W. F., &amp; Smith, L. D. (1993). Authoritarianism: Left and right. In W. F. Stone, G. Lederer, &amp; R. Christie (Eds.). ''Strengths and weaknesses: The authoritarian personality today''. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although authoritarians in North America generally support conservative political parties, this finding must be considered in a historical and cultural context. For example, during the [[Cold War]] authoritarians in the United States were usually anti-communist, whereas in the Soviet Union authoritarians generally supported the Communist Party and were opposed to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, S., Ageyev, V., &amp; Abalakina, M. (1993). The authoritarian personality in the United States and the former Soviet Union: Comparative studies. In W. F. Stone, G. Lederer, &amp; R. Christie (Eds.). ''Strengths and weaknesses: The authoritarian personality today''. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarians thus generally favor the established ways and oppose social and political change, hence even politics usually labeled as right or left-wing is not descriptive. While communism in the Soviet Union is seen as leftist, it still inspired the same responses. Furthermore, recent research indicates that political progressives can exhibit the qualities of authoritarianism when they are asked about conservative Christians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Dehumanizing-Christians-978-1-4128-5267-8.html?srchprod=1&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves questions over what makes various ideologies left or right open to interpretation.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} A 2017 study found evidence that was suggestive of the existence of left-wing authoritarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Lucian|last2=Houck|first2=Shannon|last3=Gornick|first3=Laura|last4=Repke|first4=Meredith|date=December 2017|title=Finding the Loch Ness Monster: Left-Wing Authoritarianism in the United States|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322031834_Finding_the_Loch_Ness_Monster_Left-Wing_Authoritarianism_in_the_United_States|journal=Political Psychology|doi=10.1111/pops.12470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Karen Stenner]], an Australian professor who specializes in authoritarianism, says it is different from conservatism because authoritarianism reflects aversion to difference across space (i.e. diversity of people and beliefs at any given moment), while conservatism reflects aversion to difference over time (i.e. change). Stenner argues that conservatives will embrace racial diversity, civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized authoritatively-supported traditions and are therefore supportive of social stability. Conservatives tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions, but in general they value stability and certainty over increased uniformity. However, Stenner says that authoritarians also want difference restricted even when so doing would require significant social change and instability.&lt;ref name="Stenner 2009 142–159"/&gt;

== Research ==
According to research by Altemeyer, right-wing authoritarians tend to exhibit cognitive errors and symptoms of faulty reasoning. Specifically, they are more likely to make incorrect inferences from evidence and to hold [[doublethink|contradictory ideas]] that result from compartmentalized thinking. They are also more likely to uncritically accept insufficient evidence that supports their beliefs and they are less likely to acknowledge their own limitations.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1996"/&gt; Whether right-wing authoritarians are less intelligent than average is disputed, with Stenner arguing that variables such as high verbal ability (indicative of high cognitive capacity) have a very substantial ameliorative effect in diminishing authoritarian tendencies.&lt;ref name="Stenner 2009 142–159"/&gt; Measured against other factors of personality, authoritarians generally score lower on [[openness to experience]] and slightly higher on [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref name="psr.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sibley|first1=Chris|last2=Duckitt|first2=John|title=Personality and Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Review|journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev|date=2008|doi=10.1177/1088868308319226|url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/248.abstract|pmid=18641385|volume=12|pages=248–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmer|first1=Carl|title=The Prejudiced Personality?

Altemeyer suggested that authoritarian politicians are more likely to be in the Conservative or Reform party in Canada, or the Republican Party in the United States. They generally have a conservative economic philosophy, are highly nationalistic, oppose abortion, support capital punishment, oppose gun control legislation and do not value social equality.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1996"/&gt; The RWA scale reliably correlates with political party affiliation, reactions to Watergate, pro-capitalist attitudes, religious orthodoxy and acceptance of covert governmental activities such as illegal wiretaps.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1996"/&gt; Although authoritarianism is correlated with conservative political ideology, not all authoritarians are conservative and not all conservatives are authoritarian. It is also worth noting that many authoritarians have no interest in politics.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Authoritarians are generally more favorable to punishment and control than personal freedom and diversity. For example, they are more willing to suspend constitutional guarantees of liberty such as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. They are more likely to advocate strict, punitive sentences for criminals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narby|first1=D. J.|last2=Cutler|first2=B.

They tend to be [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] and prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duckitt|first1=J.|last2=Farre|first2=B.|year=1994|title=Right-wing authoritarianism and political intolerance among Whites in the future majority-rule South Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=134|issue=|pages=735–741|doi=10.1080/00224545.1994.9923008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=M.

In roleplaying situations, authoritarians tend to seek dominance over others by being competitive and destructive instead of cooperative. In a study by Altemeyer, 68 authoritarians played a three-hour simulation of the Earth's future entitled the [[Global Change Game]]. Unlike a comparison game played by individuals with low RWA scores, which resulted in [[world peace]] and widespread international cooperation, the simulation by authoritarians became highly militarized and eventually entered the stage of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. By the end of the high RWA game, the entire population of the earth was declared dead.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1996"/&gt;

The vast majority of research on right-wing authoritarianism has been done in the United States and Canada. However, a 2003 cross-cultural study examined the relation between authoritarianism and individualism-collectivism in samples (1,080) from Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Poland and the United States. Both at the individual level and the societal level, authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism (or dominance seeking) and vertical or hierarchical collectivism, which is the tendency to submit to the demands of one's ingroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemmelmeier|first1=M.|last2=Burnstein|first2=E.|last3=Krumov|first3=K.|last4=Genkova|first4=P.|last5=Kanagawa|first5=C.|last6=Hirshberg|first6=M.

Right-wing authoritarianism has been found to correlate only slightly with [[Social dominance orientation|Social Dominance Orientation]] (SDO). The two measures can be thought of as two sides of the same coin: RWA provides submissive followers and SDO provides power-seeking leaders.&lt;ref name="Altemeyer, B. 1998 pp. 47"/&gt;

=== Relationship to personality traits ===
Research comparing RWA with the [[Big Five personality traits]] has found that RWA is positively correlated with [[conscientiousness]] (r = 0.15) and negatively correlated with [[openness to experience]] (r = −0.36). SDO has a somewhat different pattern of correlations with the Big Five, as it is also associated with low openness to experience (r = −0.16), but is not significantly correlated with conscientiousness (r = −0.05) and instead has a negative correlation with [[agreeableness]] (r = −0.29). Low openness to experience and high conscientiousness have been found to be predictive of social conformity. People low in openness to experience tend to prefer clear, unambiguous moral rules and are more likely to support the existing social order insofar as it provides clear guidance about social norms for behavior and how the world should be. People low in openness to experience are also more sensitive to threats (both real and symbolic) to the social order and hence tend to view outgroups who deviate from traditional social norms and values as a threat to ingroup norms and values. Conscientiousness is associated with a preference for order, structure and security, hence this might explain the connection with RWA.&lt;ref name="psr.sagepub.com"/&gt;

== Criticism and development ==
A recent refinement to this body of research was presented in [[Karen Stenner]]'s 2005 book, ''The Authoritarian Dynamic''.&lt;ref&gt;Stenner, K. (2005). ''The Authoritarian Dynamic''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenner argues that RWA is best understood as expressing a dynamic response to external threat, not a static disposition based only on the traits of submission, aggression and conventionalism. Stenner is critical of Altemeyer's social learning interpretation and argues that it cannot account for how levels of authoritarianism fluctuate with social conditions. She argues that the RWA Scale can be viewed as a measure of expressed authoritarianism, but that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions which interact with threatening circumstances to produce the authoritarian response.

Recent criticism has also come as a result of treating RWA as uni-dimensional even in contexts where it makes no sense to do so. For example, RWA has been used in regression analyses with fundamentalism as another predictor and attitudes to homosexuality and racism as the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laythe|first1=Brian|last2=Finkel|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Lee A.|year=2001|title=Predicting prejudice from religious fundamentalism and right-wing authoritarianism: A multiple regression approach|url=|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=40|issue=|pages=1–10|doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this research seemed to show that fundamentalism would be associated with reduced racism once the authoritarian component was removed and this was summarized in a recent review of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=D. L.|last2=Matz|first2=D. C.|last3=Wood|first3=W.|year=2010|title=Why don't we practice what we preach? A meta-analytic review of religious racism|url=|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=126–139|doi=10.1177/1088868309352179|pmid=20018983}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the RWA Scale has items that also measure fundamentalist religiosity and attitudes to homosexuality, this undermines the interpretation of such analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=See Mavor|first1=K. I.|last2=Macleod|first2=C. J.|last3=Boal|first3=M. J.|last4=Louis|first4=W.

Mavor and colleagues have argued that this artifact eliminates or even reverses any apparent tendency for fundamentalism to reduce racism once RWA is controlled. The implication is that in some domains such as the social psychology of religion it is not only preferable to think of RWA as consisting of at least two components, but essential in order to avoid statistical errors and incorrect conclusions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Several options currently exist for scales that acknowledge at least the two main underlying components in the scale (aggression/submission and conventionalism).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Funke, F. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duckitt|first1=J.|last2=Fisher|first2=K.|year=2003|title=The impact of social threat on worldview and ideological attitudes|url=|journal=Political Psychology|volume=24|issue=|pages=199–222|doi=10.1111/0162-895x.00322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duckitt|first1=J.|last2=Bizumic|first2=B.|last3=Krauss|first3=S.

Altemeyer's research on authoritarianism has been challenged by psychologist John J. Ray, who questions the sampling methods used and the ability of the RWA Scale to predict authoritarian behavior and provides evidence that the RWA Scale measures conservatism rather than "directiveness", a construct that John J. Ray invented and that he relates to authoritarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=J.J.|year=1985|title=Defective validity in the Altemeyer authoritarianism scale|url=|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=125|issue=|pages=271–272|doi=10.1080/00224545.1985.9922883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=J.J.|year=1987|title=Special review of "Right-wing authoritarianism" by R.A.

F., Lederer, G., &amp; Christie, R. (1993). ''Strength and Weakness: The Authoritarian Personality Today''. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; and other psychologists have found that both the RWA Scale and the original F-Scale are good predictors of both attitudes and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meloen|first1=J.

In 2012, the American ''Journal of Political Science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhulst|first1=B.|last2=Eaves|first2=L. J.|last3=Hatemi|first3=P.

In 2015, they released an erratum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhulst|first1=B.|last2=Eaves|first2=L. J.|last3=Hatemi|first3=P. K.|year=2015|title=Erratum to "Correlation not causation: the relationship between personality traits and political ideologies."|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12216/full|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=60|issue=1|pages=E3-E4|doi=10.1111/ajps.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that psychoticism is actually more associated with liberalism, whereas [[neuroticism]] is more associated with conservatism.

In 2017, the new regality theory suggested a reinterpretation of RWA in the light of [[evolutionary psychology]]. Regality theory agrees that authoritarianism is a dynamic response to external threat, and more specifically to collective danger. But rather than seeing authoritarianism as a psychological aberration, regality theory sees it as an evolved response to perceived collective danger. The tendency to support a strong leader in times of collective danger has contributed to [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in human prehistory because it helped solve the [[collective action problem]] in [[war]] and suppress [[free riders]]. It is argued that regality theory adds a deeper level of analysis to our understanding of authoritarianism and avoids the political [[bias]] that the research in the [[authoritarian personality]] and RWA is often criticized for.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alves was born on September 15, 1933, in [[Boa Esperança, Minas Gerais]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt; He obtained his [[Bachelor of Theology]] (BTh) degree at the &lt;!--Seminário Teológico Presbiteriano do Sul = Southern --&gt; Presbyterian [[Seminary]] in [[Campinas]], Brazil, in 1957.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt; He went on to obtain a &lt;!--masters in sacred theology&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt;--&gt;[[Master of Theology]] (ThM) from the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]], United States, in 1964. After completing this degree, Alves returned to Brazil amidst a US-sponsored&lt;ref name=1964coup&gt;{{cite web |author=Kingstone, Steve |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3588339.stm|title=Brazil remembers 1964 coup d'etat|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-05-08 | date=2004-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Role in 1964 Brazilian Military Coup Revealed |url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/international_news/2004/04/06/us_role_in.html |publisher=Dominion |accessdate=2013-06-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hm62hYMD?url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/international_news/2004/04/06/us_role_in.html |archivedate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|military coup against the democratically elected Brazilian government]]. At the time, the new military regime was attempting to purge Brazil of [[communist]] sympathizers. The [[Presbyterian Church of Brazil]] provided the new government with the names of six intellectuals to serve as [[scapegoats]] and to avert persecution themselves. Immediately upon his return to Brazil, Alves went into hiding.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Keefe-Perry | first=Callid | title=A Song for Rubem Alves | website=Homebrewed Christianity | date=20 July 2014 | url=https://homebrewedchristianity.com/2014/07/20/a-song-for-rubem-alves/ | accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than forty accusations were made against Alves and others, including claims that they taught that [[Jesus]] was sexually involved with a prostitute, celebrated when their children denounced Americans, and were funded by the [[Soviet Union]]. Alves reports that these accusations were ineffective, saying, "the positive side of the document was that it was so [[wikt:virulent|virulent]], that not even the most [[wikt:obtuse|obtuse]] could believe that we were guilty of so many crimes." Alves continued to elude government authorities. Within two months of his arrival in Brazil, he returned to the United States covertly with assistance from Brazilian [[Freemasons]] and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]], which secured an invitation from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] for him to commence doctoral studies there.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt;

Alves did not enjoy his studies at Princeton. He sorely missed his homeland, and felt constrained by the requirements of the doctoral program. Although he ultimately wrote his dissertation according to the requirements of his professors, Alves was not pleased with it, saying, "I wrote uglily, without smiles or poetry, for there was no other alternative: a Brazilian student, [[underdeveloped]], in a foreign institution, must indeed submit himself, if he wants to pass." He completed his [[doctoral dissertation]], ''Toward a Theology of Liberation'', in 1968, and received "the lowest possible grade" needed to receive his doctorate (PhD) at Princeton in 1968.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt;

Alves later critiqued the direction some writers took [[liberation theology]], saying "it has little to say about the personal dimension of life. If a father or mother comes with their dead child, it's no consolation to say, 'In the future just society there will be no more deaths of this kind.' This brings no comfort!" However, he also described liberation theology as "absolutely essential", describing his own version of liberation theology with these words: "The origin of my liberation theology is an erotic exuberance for life. We need to struggle to restore its erotic exuberance, to share this with the whole world."&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt;

==Academic career==
# Trained as a [[psychoanalyst]] through the [[Brazilian Association of Psychoanalysis]] of São Paulo.
# Assistant Professor of Social Philosophy, [[Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of Rio Claro]] (1969).
# Assistant Professor of Philosophy, [[State University of Campinas]] (UNICAMP) (1974). He was promoted to professor (1979) and associate professor (1980), both at the Faculty of Education, UNICAMP.

==Career as writer==
Besides his activities as a university professor and researcher, Alves was a prolific writer of books and articles in journals and newspapers on education, psychology and life in general. From 1986 he was a regular columnist in ''[[Correio Popular]]'', the main newspaper in his hometown, [[Campinas]], in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]]. He published more than 40 books, several of which have been translated into German, French, English, Italian, Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. 

During his career he collaborated with notable personalities, including [[Peter Maurin]], [[Dorothy Day]], and [[Paulo Freire]].&lt;ref name="CTC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Rubem Alves&amp;nbsp;– Liberation Theology Pioneer | publisher=Critical Therapy Center |location=New York, NY |date=19 July 2014 | url=http://criticaltherapy.org/rubem-alves-liberation-theology-pioneer/ | accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book, ''The Poet, The Warrior, The Prophet'', is an important text in the field of [[theopoetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |chapter=The Theopoetics of Rubem Alves for Pastoral Theology |title=Nevertheless I Am Continually With You: A Cosmopolitan and Theopoetic Reframing of Pastoral Theology |url= |author= |last=Linhares Junior |first=Bruno Mattos |year=2008 |publisher=Princeton Theological Seminary |accessdate= |docket= |oclc= |pages=100-166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last years of his life, Alves wrote several children's books.&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt; Alves died on July 19, 2014, in Campinas, Brazil.&lt;ref name="CTC"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Alves has been described as an "unsung hero",&lt;ref name="Keefe-Perry 2014"/&gt; and is often omitted from brief descriptions of liberation theology.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Sadguru Shri Hambir Baba''' ({{lang-mr|सदगुरू हंबीर बाबा}}) (born '''Ganpat Nanaji Hambir''', 1879, [[Patethan]] village, [[Daund]] taluk, [[Pune]] district - died 14 October 1970, Patethan) was an Indian spiritual guide. He was a proponent of the [[Vedanta]] scriptures. He taught that the teachings of the [[saints]] can be practiced in one's personal life, in one's social life and for self-realization and social harmony.

== Spiritual heritage ==
Baba spoke from the teachings of Richas, [[Shlokas]], [[Ovee]]s and [[Abhang]]as and was a follower of [[Shri Ram|Lord Ram]], [[Shri Krishna]], other gods, their incarnations and other saints. 

== Early life and education ==
Baba was born in 1879 in Patethan village. In his spiritual education, he walked through India (for 12 years), practiced [[Yoga|yoga-sadhana]] and acknowledged his vocation through callings from a religious man, "You will realize God in your own house" and from [[Shri Tukaram|Saint Tukaram]] in one of his [[Abhang]]as, "God appears in your body which is His abode." Baba's teacher was Sadguru Shri Dhondinath Baba. Given Baba's origin in the village, Patetahan is known as a ''[[Dnyaneshwari]]'', a holy centre for ''[[Sādhaka|Sadhakas]]'' and an informal school for ''swadharma''.

== Teaching and practise of ''swadharma'' ==
Baba's life long spiritual mission (''avatar-karya''), was to teach ''swadharma''. He used the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Bhagavata Purana]] texts in his uplifting sermons and discussions and in 1958, the Vishwavyapi Manavdharma ashram was founded.&lt;ref name="Speaking Tree"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218061751/http://www.speakingtree.in/9w5nijuuh2y9wxw73ycow5ug4/blog "Vishwavyapi Manavdharma."] Speaking Tree blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
Baba spoke at the [[World Religions Conference]]s in [[New Delhi]] in 1958, 1965 and 1967 about ''swadharma'' and peace.   

== ''Jeevankalechee sadhana'' ==
Baba wrote a book in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] entitled ''Jeevankalechee sadhana''.&lt;ref name="Speaking Tree"/&gt; It has eight editions, has sold 20,000 copies and has been translated into [[Hindi]] and English as ''Swadharma: the art of life''. 

== ''Sanmarga darshana'' ==
Baba taught about ''siddhi'' (spiritual power) and ''riddhi'' (prosperity).

== ''Namamrit'' ==
Some report healings by Baba through the ''elixer of the name of the god'' (Nectar of Nam) from diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], [[diabetes]] and [[leprosy]]. Baba indicated the [[Abhang]]a couplet,
:"Happy shall I make the whole life of mine, The three worlds, with bliss, shall I fill in."

== Legacy ==
Baba expressed his wish to be close to his god: "I yearn to go to my home!".
He died in Patethan on a full moon day called ''kojagiri pournima''. 

=== Successor ===
Baba's successor was his son, Parampujya Sadguru Samartha Shri Sumantrao Hambir, (''Hambirbapu'') who became principal of the school in Patethan.&lt;ref name="Speaking Tree"/&gt; The ashram has a [[meditation]] hall, a meeting hall and a shrine to Baba. Hambirbapu teaches twenty to twenty-five days of the month in other locations in [[Maharashtra]] state.

'''Salomon Maimon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|m|ɒ|n}}; {{IPA-de|ˈmaɪmoːn|lang}}; {{lang-he|שלמה מימון}}&amp;lrm;; 1753 – 22 November 1800) was a German-speaking philosopher, born of Jewish parentage in present-day [[Belarus]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Salomon Maimon was born '''Shlomo ben Joshua'''&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; in the town of [[Zhukov Borok]] near [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (present-day [[Belarus]]), where his grandfather leased an estate from a Prince [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł]]. He was taught [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]], first by his father, and later by instructors in Mir. He was recognized as a prodigy in Talmudic studies, which he later described as "endless disputation without end or aim". His parents fell on hard times, and betrothed him to two separate girls in order to take advantage of their dowries, leading to a bitter rivalry. At the age of eleven he was married to one of the two prospects, a girl from [[Nesvizh]]. At the age 14 he was already a father and was making money by teaching Talmud. Later he learned some German from books and walked all the way to [[Slutsk]], where he met a rabbi who had studied in Germany. He borrowed German books on physics, optics and medicine from him. After that he became determined to study further.

===Interest in Kabbalah===
Maimon describes how he took an interest in [[Kabbalah]], and made a pilgrimage to the court of the [[Maggid of Mezritch]] around 1770.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thielke|first=Peter|title=Salomon Maimon|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimon/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ridiculed the Maggid's adherents for their enthusiasm, and charged the Maggid with manipulating his followers.&lt;ref name="socher"&gt;{{cite book|last = Socher|first = Abraham P.|title = The Radical Enlightenment of Solomon Maimon: Judaism, Heresy, and Philosophy|year = 2006|publisher = Stanford University Press|isbn = 0804751366}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} He also wrote that the Maggid's ideas are "closer to correct ideas of religion and morals" than those he was taught in [[cheder]].&lt;ref name="socher" /&gt;{{rp|30}}"

===In Germany===
In his mid-twenties Maimon left his home area in the direction of the German-speaking lands. His first attempt to take up residence in [[Berlin]] in 1778 failed. He was expelled for possession of the ''[[Guide of the Perplexed|Moreh Nebukhim]]'' of [[Maimonides]]. A later attempt to convert to Christianity in Hamburg failed due to admitted lack of belief in Christian dogma.&lt;ref&gt;''Solomon Maimon: An Autobiography'', trans. J. Clark Murray, University of Illinois Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His second attempt to settle in Berlin in 1780 succeeded; he established a close connection with [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and entered the circles of the ''[[Haskalah]]'' (the Jewish Enlightenment movement) in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Mendelssohn introduced him to some wealthy Jews in Berlin, upon whom Maimon relied for [[patronage]] while he pursued his studies. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy along the lines of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and Mendelssohn.

In 1783, Mendelssohn asked Maimon to leave Berlin due to Maimon's open [[Spinozism]]. After a journey to [[Hamburg]], [[Amsterdam]] and then back to Hamburg, he started attending the [[Gymnasium Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]. During his stay there he improved his knowledge of the natural sciences and his command of German. In 1785, Maimon left for Berlin (where he met Mendelssohn for the last time), then moved to [[Dessau]], and then settled in [[Breslau]], where he attempted to study medicine but eventually took up the position of a tutor.

After many years of separation, Maimon's wife, Sarah, accompanied by their eldest son, David, managed to locate him in Breslau. She demanded that he either return to their home in Lithuania or give her a divorce. Maimon eventually agreed to the divorce.

It was not until 1787 in Berlin that Maimon became acquainted with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian philosophy, and in 1790 he published the ''Essay on Transcendental Philosophy'' (''Versuch über die Transcendentalphilosophie''), in which he formulated his objections to Kant's system. Kant seems to have considered Maimon one of his most astute critics.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Maimon published a commentary on the ''Moreh Nebuchim'' of Maimonides in 1791 (''Gibeath Hamore'', ''The Hill of the Guide''). In 1792/3 he published his ''Autobiography'' (''Lebensgeschichte'').

===In Silesia===
in 1795, Maimon found a peaceful residence in the house of a young Silesian nobleman, Count Heinrich Wilhelm Adolf Kalkreuth, and moved to the latter's estate in [[Nieder-Siegersdorf|Siegersdorf]] near [[Freystadt in Schlesien]]. Maimon died there at the age of 48 from apparent alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos. ''The pity of it all. A portrait of the German-Jewish Epoch, 1743–1933''. Picador, A metropolitan book. NY, Henry Holt and Company, 2002, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maimon, Solomon. ''Solomon Maimon: An autobiography'', Introduction by Michael Shapiro, Translated by J. Clark Murray, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

===Thing-in-itself===
He seizes upon the fundamental incompatibility of a [[consciousness]] which can apprehend, and yet is separated from, the [[thing-in-itself]]. That which is object of thought cannot be outside consciousness; just as in [[mathematics]] "–1" is an unreal quantity, so things-in-themselves are ''ex hypothesi'' outside consciousness, i.e. are unthinkable. The Kantian [[paradox]] he explains as the result of an attempt to explain the origin of the given in consciousness. The [[substantial form|form]] of things is admittedly [[Subjectivity|subjective]]; the [[mind]] endeavours to explain the material of the given in the same terms, an attempt which is not only impossible but involves a denial of the elementary laws of thought. Knowledge of the given is, therefore, essentially incomplete. Complete or perfect [[knowledge]] is confined to the domain of pure thought, to [[logic]] and [[mathematics]]. Thus the problem of the thing-in-itself is dismissed from the inquiry, and philosophy is limited to the sphere of pure thought.

===Application of the categories===
The Kantian categories are demonstrable and [[Truth|true]], but their application to the given is meaningless and unthinkable. By this critical [[sceptic]]ism Maimon takes up a position intermediate between Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]. Hume's attitude to the [[empirical]] is entirely supported by Maimon. The causal [[concept]], as given by experience, expresses not a necessary objective order of things, but an ordered scheme of [[perception]]; it is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and cannot be postulated as a concrete law apart from [[consciousness]].

===Doctrine of differentials===
Whereas Kant posed a dualism between understanding and sensibility, or between concepts and the given, Maimon refers both these faculties back to a single source of cognition. Sensibility, in Maimon's view, is therefore not completely without conceptual content, but is generated according to rules that Maimon calls [[Differential (mathematics)|differentials]]. In calling them this, Maimon is referring to the differentials from the calculus, which are entities that despite being neither qualitative nor quantitative, can nevertheless give rise to a determinate quantity and quality when related to other differentials. The operations of the faculty of sensibility are for Maimon therefore not principally different from those of mathematical intuition: seeing the color red is the same procedure as drawing a geometrical figure such as a line in a circle in thought. The reason that qualities are nevertheless 'given' is that it is only an infinite understanding that can grasp the rules for the generation of qualities in the way that a human understanding can grasp the rules for drawing a circle.

===Kant's comments===
Kant had received the first chapter of Maimon's book in manuscript from [[Markus Herz]]. In a letter to Herz from May 26, 1789, Kant writes the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I had half decided to send the manuscript back in its immediately .... But one glance at the work made me realize its excellence and that not only had none of my critics understood me and the main questions as well as Herr Maimon does but also very few men possess so much acumen for such deep investigations as he..."&lt;ref&gt;* Kant, Immanuel. '' Correspondence''. Translated and edited by A. Zweig. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 311-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, Kant does not agree with Maimon's assessment. For Kant, the question of the relationship of the faculties is adequately answered by the Transcendental Deduction, in which Kant argues that the categories make experience possible. Furthermore, as an explanation of the harmony of the faculties, Kant offers the Leibnizian account of a [[pre-established harmony]].

{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiosis''' (from the {{lang-el|σημείωσις}}, ''sēmeíōsis'', a derivation of the verb {{lang|grc|σημειῶ}}, ''sēmeiô'', "to mark") is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], including the production of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. Briefly – semiosis is sign process. The term was introduced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of [[sign relation]]s, or [[semiotics]]. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

==Introduction to theory==

Peirce was interested primarily in [[logic]], while Saussure was interested primarily in [[linguistics]], which examines the functions and structures of [[language]]. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone.  With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other [[sign systems]] both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect.  One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many [[code (semiotics)|codes]] for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=February 2018}}.  Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an [[audience]].

==Discussion==
Semiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many ''things'' unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word "sign" is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. 

As an insect or animal, human or otherwise, moves through its environment (sometimes termed the [[umwelt]]), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only [[Salience (semiotics)|salient]] data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background ''noise''. When this happens, the sign then triggers [[cognitive]] activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the [[semiosphere]], the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle:
*The plant, insect, or animal with the need to communicate (e.g., to recognise an object of food) will ''know'' what needs to be ''said'' and assess the best means of ''saying'' it (e.g., starting a searching behaviour);
*This information will then be [[encode (Semiotics)|encoded]] and relevant muscle groups will effect transmission — although to some extent intentional in the human, the actual movements of the body are autonomic, i.e. the individual is not aware of moving individual muscles, but achieves the desired result by an act of will (see [[H. L. A. Hart]] on the nature of an [[Philosophy of action|action]]);
*The audience filters ambient data and perceives the uttered code as a grouping of signs;
*The audience then interprets the signs (sometimes termed [[decode (Semiotics)|decoding]]) to attribute meaning. This involves matching the signs received against existing patterns and their meanings held in memory (i.e. it is learned and understood within the [[community]]). In plants, insects and animals, the results of a successful interpretation will be an observable response to the stimuli perceived.
In [[biology]], scout bees and ants will return home to ''tell'' the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed [[biosemiotics]], and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that [[endosymbiosis]], self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, [[autopoiesis]], and others are the general properties of all living systems. [[Thomas Sebeok]]  suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether ''something'' is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok's Thesis.

For humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and [[value (Semiotics)|values]] are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Sherrilyn Roush''' is Professor of Philosophy at [[King's College London]] specializing in the [[Philosophy of Science]] and [[Epistemology]]. She joined King's in 2014 after accepting the inaugural Peter Sowerby Chair in Philosophy and Medicine. Previously, Roush was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Philosophy at [[Rice University]] (1999-2006). She was then an Associate Professor and then a full professor of Philosophy at [[U. C. Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/people/staff/academic/ROUSH-CV.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting winter quarter 2018, she will be joining the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]] as a new professor and faculty member.

Her book ''Tracking Truth'' presents a unified treatment of knowledge, evidence, and epistemological realism and anti-realism about science, based on the idea that knowing is responsiveness to the way the world is, and that this is an ability to follow the truth through time and changing circumstances. Responsiveness is defined for empirical knowledge by a reformulation of [[Robert Nozick]]’s tracking conditions—for example: if p were false, then S wouldn’t believe p—using conditional probability instead of counterfactuals. Roush argues that the new tracking view is superior to other externalist views of knowledge, including process reliabilism. Of particular interest are the new view’s fallibilist account of knowledge of [[logical truth]], its treatment of reflective knowledge and lottery propositions, its solutions to the value problem and the generality problem, its implications about skepticism, and its explanation of why knowledge is power in the Baconian sense.

In the second half of the book it is argued that the tracking theory of evidence is best formulated and defended as a confirmation theory based on the Likelihood Ratio. The tracking theories of knowledge and evidence thereby fit together to provide a deep explanation of why having better evidence makes you more likely to know. Finally, the book argues that confirmation theory is relevant to debates about scientific realism, and defends a position intermediate between realism and anti-realism on the basis of a view about what having evidence requires.&lt;ref name="bush"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blakeslee"/&gt;

'''Tamil nationalism ''' is the ideology which asserts that the [[Tamils | Tamil people]] constitute a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Tamil people. Tamil nationalism is primarily a [[secular]] nationalism, that focus on language and homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Religious Nationalism: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook, Atalia Omer, Jason A. Springs (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It expresses itself in the form of [[linguistic purism]] ("[[Pure Tamil]]"), [[nationalism]] and [[irredentism]] ("[[Tamil Eelam]]"), [[Social equality]] ("[[Self-Respect Movement]]") and [[Tamil Renaissance]].

Tamils are one of the oldest civilisations in the world with a rich culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;In Search Of The First Civilizations (2013), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Tamil people ruled in [[Tamilakam]] and parts of [[Sri Lanka]]. During the [[British Raj|colonial period]], the Tamil areas came under the rule of [[British India]] and [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]]. This saw the end of the [[sovereignty]] of Tamils and reduced them to minority status under a political model implemented during the British Raj. Since the independence of [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], Tamil separatist movements have been actively suppressed in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;India, Sri Lanka and the Tamil crisis, 1976-1994: an international perspective (1995), Alan J. Bullion, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism}}
Since the adoption of the [[Vaddukoddai Resolution]] in 1976 under the leadership of [[S.J.V. Chelvanayakam]], Tamil nationalists in Sri Lanka have repeatedly attempted to create an independent state ([[Tamil Eelam]])&lt;ref name=Hin&gt;{{cite web|title= TULF leader passes away |author=DBS Jeyaraj|url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/06/06/stories/2002060603761100.htm|publisher=Hindu News |accessdate=2008-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; amid the increasing political and physical violence against ordinary Tamils by the Sri Lankan government which was dominated by [[Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism]].

Shortly after the island's independence from [[British Ceylon|Britain]], the Sri Lankan government passed the [[Ceylon Citizenship Act|Citizenship Act of 1948]], which made more than a million [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamils of Indian origin]] stateless. The government also passed a [[Sinhala Only Act]], which severely threatened the status of Tamil as a minority language, as well as hindering the social mobility of Tamil speakers.[https://www.scribd.com/doc/12755079/Genocide-of-Tamils-in-Sri-Lanka-The-Unspeakable-Truth-BTF-Publication]. In addition, the government also initiated the [[Sri Lankan state-sponsored colonisation schemes|Sinhalese colonisation scheme]], with the aim of lessening the numerical presence of minorities as well as monopolising traditionally shared economic activities such as agriculture and fisheries, which have been part of the livelihood of [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] since time immemorial.&lt;ref&gt;''Scarred Communities: Psychosocial Impact of Man-made and Natural Disasters on Sri Lankan Society'' by Daya Somasundaram, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After anti-Tamil [[pogrom]]s in [[1956 Ceylonese riots|1956]], [[1958 anti-Tamil pogrom|1958]] and [[1977 anti-Tamil pogrom|1977]] and [[police brutality]] against Tamils protesting against these acts, guerilla groups like [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) were created to safeguard the interest and rights of Tamils in their own land. The [[burning of Jaffna library]] in 1981 and [[Black July]] in 1983 finally led to over 25 years of war between the [[Sri Lankan army]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Tamil Tigers]]. Persistent use of violence, including assassinations, led the LTTE to be declared as a [[terrorist organization]] by India, Malaysia, the European Union, Canada, and the USA. The civil war came to an end in 2009 with the military defeat of LTTE and the death of its leader, [[Prabhakaran]]. The [[Sri Lankan civil war]] led to death of over 100,000 people according to the [[UN|United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-05-20/up-to-100000-killed-in-sri-lankas-civil-war-un/1689524| title = Up to 100,000 killed in Sri Lanka's civil war: UN| website = ABC News| language = en-AU| access-date = 2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan Government are alleged to have committed [[war crimes]] against the civilian Sri Lankan Tamil people during the final months of the [[Eelam War IV]] phase in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/20/sri-lanka-new-evidence-wartime-abuses|title=Sri Lanka: New Evidence of Wartime Abuses|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal|PPT]] verdict declared it as a [[genocide]] committed against ethnic Tamils by the Sri Lanka, government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.ptsrilanka.org/en/verdict| title = Permanent Peoples' Tribunal verdict on Tamil Genocide| website = PT Srilanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of the Civil War, the [[Tamil National Alliance]] (TNA) dropped their demand for an independent Tamil Eelam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/14/sri-lanka-tamils-self-rule| title =Sri Lankan Tamil alliance drops independence demand| website = .The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[decentralization | regional autonomy]] in a remerged [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|North Eastern Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tna-reiterates-self-determination-northeast-remerger/article7464674.ece| title = TNA reiterates self determination, North-East re-merger| website = The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of [[Federalism in Sri Lanka]] is opposed by the Sri Lankan Government, which prefers a [[unitary state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://indianexpress.com/article/world/sri-lanka-tna-threatens-to-quit-constitution-process-if-terms-not-met-4475365/| title = Sri Lanka: TNA threatens to quit constitution process if terms not met| website = Indian express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam]] (TGTE) was founded by [[Visvanathan Rudrakumaran]] who aim to create an independent Tamil Eelam in peaceful democratic means.

The Indian Tamil Nationalism is the smaller section of the [[Dravidian Nationalism]] which consisted of all the four major [[Dravidian language]] in the [[South India]]. The Dravidian Nationalism was popularised by a series of small movements and organisations that contended that the South Indians, and a cultural entity that was different from the [[Indo-Aryans]] of North India. A new morphed ideology of the Dravidian nationalism gained momentum within the Tamil speakers during the 1930 and 1950. The Dravidian nationalism failed outside Tamil Nadu to find supporters. During 1950s and 1960s, the Nationalist ideologies lead to the argument by Tamil leaders that, at minimal, that Tamils must have self-determination or, at maximum, secession from India.&lt;ref name=Kohli2004&gt;{{cite journal

Since the 1969 election victory of [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) under [[C N Annadurai]], Tamil nationalism has been a permanent feature of the government of Tamil Nadu. The DMK came to power on the plank of opposing Hindi monopoly/imposition. Prior to coming to power, they also openly declared to fight for Tamil independence from India. But since the Indian government had added a new legislation that outlawed anyone wanting independence from India, under the sedition act, and that made political parties to lose their right to stand in election, the DMK dropped this demand. With this, the drive for secession became weaker with most mainstream political parties, except a few, who instead committed to development of Tamil Nadu within a united India. Most major Tamil Nadu regional parties such as DMK, [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), [[Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi]] (VCK), [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] (PMK) and [[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (MDMK) frequently participate as coalition partners of other pan-Indian parties in the [[Government of India|Union Government of India]] at [[New Delhi]].

In 1958, [[S. P. Adithanar]] founded the "We Tamils" party who wanted the creation of a homogeneous [[Greater Tamil Nadu]] incorporating Tamil speaking areas of India and Sri Lanka. In 1960, the party organized a statewide protest who demanded the establishment of sovereign [[Tamil Nadu]]. During the protest were maps of [[Republic of India]] (with [[Tamil Nadu]] left out) burnt. We Tamils party lost the elections in 1962 and was merged 1967 with the DMK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphabet-xyz.club/blog/2015/09/15/we-tamils-party-s-p-adithanar/|title=We Tamils party S.

In India emerged small Tamil militant groups such as [[Tamil Nadu Liberation Army]] led by Thamizharasan, who aspired an independent [[Tamil Nadu]]. After his death, the group is believed to have splintered into factions. TNLA was [[List of organisations banned by the Government of India|banned by the Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/TNLA.htm|title=Tamil Nadu Liberation Army (TNLA)|publisher=ww.satp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another banned Tamil secessionist group in India was the [[Tamil National Retrieval Troops]] (TNRT) founded by P. Ravichandran in the late-1980s. TNRT,a terrorist organization, fought for an independent Tamil homeland and followed the goal to unite [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Tamil Eelam]] to a [[Greater Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/TNRT.htm|title=Tamil National Retrieval Troops (TNRT)|publisher=ww.satp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, amid build up in shelling into the Tamil civilian areas by the Sri Lankan military, with the army moving in on the LTTE and the navy battling the latter's sea patrol, Indian Tamil MP's, including those supporting the Singh government in the DMK and PMK, threatened to resign en masse if the Indian government did not pressure the Lankan government to cease firing on civilians. In response, the Indian government reported it had upped the ante on the Lankan government to ease tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/India_asks_Lanka_to_protect_civilians/articleshow/3610295.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=India asks Lanka to protect civilians | date=18 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, the DMK, apart from the 2G corruption scandals, has seen a steady decline in popularity in Tamil Nadu. Many Tamils felt disenfranchised with the DMK, that it did not act to do much to stop the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/why-tamil-nadu-is-right-to-call-sri-lankas-war-a-genocide-668309.html|title=Why Tamil Nadu is right to call Sri Lanka's 'war' a genocide|publisher= Firstpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Muthukumar]] a Tamil journalist and activist in Tamil Nadu committed suicide, because the government failed to save [[Sri Lankan Tamils]]. His death instantly triggered [[Protests against the Sri Lankan Civil War|widespread strikes, demonstrations and public unrest]] in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/february082012/tamil-immolation-tk.php|title=Indian journalist's self-immolation was an attempt to prevent Sri Lanka's Tamil Genocide |publisher=salem-news.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also deep resentment against India among some Tamils, that it aided the Sri Lankan state in the 2009 genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indian-forces-took-part-in-Lankan-war-Plea/articleshow/33758131.cms|title=Indian forces took part in Lankan war: Plea|publisher=Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Sri+Lanka:+A+call+for+arms/1/1439.html|title=Sri Lanka: A call for arms|publisher=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=1502|title=Russia and India to sell arms to Sri Lanka |publisher=Tamil Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to minor incidents like Tamil nationalists turning out in support of the Eelam rebels when Chennai-based ''[[The Hindu]]'' was alleged to have been supporting the Government of Sri Lanka.

The Tamil nationalist party [[Naam Tamilar Katchi]] arose 18 May 2010 as a result of the bloody end of the Sri Lankan civil war. Main agenda of this party is the liberation of [[Tamil Eelam]], only Tamils should rule in Tamil Nadu and to spread the importance of Tamil language and unity of Tamils, irrespective of religion and caste.&lt;ref name="tvb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article193786.ece | title=Seeman calls for vote bank to protect Tamils | publisher=The New Indian Express | accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 it came to series of [[2013 Anti-Sri Lanka protests|Anti-Sri Lanka protests]] initiated by the [[Students Federation for Freedom of Tamil Eelam]].

===History===
{{further|Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu}}
The anti-Hindi agitation was a form of resistance to the imposition of the Hindi language throughout India. C Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), who wanted to reinstate the “Varna system” in India, tried to impose Hindi as the national language, with Hindi taught in all Indian schools. This move was opposed by Periyar, who started an agitation that lasted for about three years. The agitation involved fasts, conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. Several Tamil leaders supported the continuation of the usage of English as the official language of India. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation.

Four states - [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&amp;page=brief&amp;id=805&amp;gn=0|title=Bar &amp; Bench|work=Bar &amp; Bench}}&lt;/ref&gt;- have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar power - [[Tamil Nadu]], which sought the right to conduct proceedings in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in its [[Madras High Court|High Court]] - had its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Special Correspondent |title=Karunanidhi stands firm on Tamil in High Court | newspaper = The Hindu |pages=1 |date=12 March 2007 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/12/stories/2007031205180100.htm |location=Chennai, India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state's desire to conduct [[Madras High Court]] proceedings in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/03/stories/2006120306220800.htm|title=No objection to Tamil as court language: A.P.

===Basis in pre-modern literature===

Although [[nationalism]] itself is a modern phenomenon, the expression of linguistic identity found in the modern [[Pure Tamil]] movement has pre-modern antecedents, in a  "loyalty to Tamil" (as opposed to Sanskrit) visible in ancient [[Sangam literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steever|1987|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The poems of Sangam literature imply a consciousness of independence or separateness from neighbouring regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abraham|2003|pp=211, 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Silappatikaram|Silappadhikaaram]], a post-Sangam epic, posits a cultural integrity for the entire Tamil region&lt;ref name=Sub1981p23-24&gt;{{Harvnb|Subrahmanian|1981|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been interpreted by Parthasarathy as presenting "an expansive vision of the Tamil imperium" which "speaks for all Tamils."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parthasarathy|1993|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subrahmanian sees in the epic the first expression of Tamil nationalism,&lt;ref name=Sub1981p23-24 /&gt; while Parthasarathy says that the epic shows "the beginnings of Tamil separatism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parthasarathy|1993|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Tamil texts also demonstrate features of modern Tamil linguistic purism, most notably the claim of parity of status with Sanskrit which was traditionally seen in the rest of the Indian subcontinent as being a prestigious, trans-local language.  Texts on [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]] and [[poetics]] such as the 10th century Yaapparungalakkaarihai and the 11th century Veerasoazhiyam, for example, treat Tamil as the equal of [[Sanskrit]] in terms of literary prestige, and use the rhetorical device of describing Tamil as a beautiful young lady and as a pure, divine language&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monius|2000|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are also central in modern Tamil nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramaswamy|1993|pp=690–698}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Narayanan|1994|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shaivism|Shaivite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peterson|1982|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; commentators took the claim of divinity one step further, claiming for Tamil a liturgical status, and seeking to endow Tamil texts with the status of a "[[fifth Veda]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|1991|p=770}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Vaishnavite commentators such as Nanjiyar went one step further, declaring that people who were not Tamil lamented the fact that they were not born in a place where such a wonderful language was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clooney|1992|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This trend was not universal, and there were also authors who sought to argue and work against Tamil distinctiveness through, amongst other things, [[Sanskritisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pandian|1994|p=87}}; {{Harvnb|Kailasapathy|1979|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Règne de la Quantité et les Signes des Temps}}) is a 1945 book by [[René Guénon]], in which the author purports to give a comprehensive explanation, based on tradition, of the cyclical conditions that led to the modern world in general and to the Second World War in particular. The book was published with the support of Jean Paulhan from Gallimard, who created a collection exclusively dedicated to "Tradition" in order to publish Guénon. The book corresponded to the mood of the public in the immediate post-war period. It was such a success that it was sold out within two months of publication and subsequently had to be quickly reissued twice. 

== History according to Guénon ==

For Guénon, history is only the reflection of a vast cosmic process taking its source in a metaphysical dimension (according to his metaphysical doctrine).
From the traditionalist perspective, the temporal, phenomenal world is an outflow and manifestation of an unseen metaphysical reality that forms the origin and basis of the material, historical reality human beings perceive with their five senses. It has been pointed out by several authors&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Laurant]], Le sens caché dans l'œuvre de René Guénon, Lausanne, Suisse, L'âge d'Homme, 1975, ({{ISBN|2-8251-3102-4}}), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Vallin, La Perspective metaphysique, Paris, Dervy, 1990, ({{ISBN|978-2850763953}}), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bisson, René Guénon, une politique de l'esprit, Paris, Pierre-Guillaume de Roux, 2013,(ISBN 9-782363-710581), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; that such a conception of History is radically different from that of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] who on the contrary locks his in the sphere of time.
More precisely, as Georges Vallin explains, in Hegel's thought, the timeless mystery of non-duality, of the "coincidence of opposites" found in Guénon, is replaced by "a time-based dialectic of thesis and antithesis." For Vallin, this notion of confinement in time of the human condition, in opposition to the "metaphysical perspective" of Guénon, continued with the conception exposed by [[Martin Heidegger]] in ''[[Being and Time]]''. For Guénon, such a confinement of History in Time, cut off from any transcendent reality, takes on a satanic dimension that explains the fall of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=7pQBrgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Gu%C3%A9non,The+Reign+of+Quantity+and+the+Signs+of+the+Times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrhOSY3_rZAhVGb1AKHZ-mAWg4FBDoAQhWMAg  ''The Order of the Ages: The Hidden Laws of World History'' by Robert Bolton, Angelico Press, 2015 - Philosophy - 294 pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Smoley]] : ''Waiting for the End of the World: René Guénon and the Kali Yuga''[http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/waiting-for-the-end-of-the-world-rene-guenon-and-the-kali-yuga]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Charles Upton (poet)]] writes that: {{Block quote| in the ''Reign of Quantity'', Guénon sees history in terms of the Hindu concept of the [[manvantara]], the cycle of manifestation composed of Golden, Silver, Bronze and Iron ages; [...] This cycle is an inevitable descent from the pole of Essence (or forma) toward the pole of Substance (or materia). [...] Essence is qualitative while substance is quantitative; As the cycle progresses or descends, the very nature of time and space changes.[...] In earlier stages, time is relatively eternal, as the cycle moves on, however, time begins to take over and accelerate, but this constant acceleration of time can't go on forever. Time, the "devourer" ends by devouring itself. At the end of time, Time will be changed into space again. [...] This ultimate timeless point is simultaneously the end of the cycle of manifestation and the beginning of the next.[...] Before this ultimate transformation, in the latter days of the present cycle certain final developments must take place. Since quantity has particularly to do with matter, the ''Reign of quantity'' must also be the reign of materialism. The age of miracles ceases, the world becomes less permeable to the influences of the higher planes of reality.&lt;ref name= "Upton"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=CwUo8zcsinoC&amp;pg=PA8 ''The System of Antichrist: Truth and Falsehood in Postmodernism and the New Age'', Chapter: ''The Prophecy of René Guénon'', By Charles Upton, Sophia Perennis, 2005 - 88 pages, Pages 8 to 10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Griffin also writes that:  {{block quote|Guénon claims that essence is qualitative while the substance of our specific world (''materia secunda'') is quantitative (''materia signata quantitate'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=OFny6OhOAioC&amp;pg=PA164  ''On the Origin of Beauty: Ecophilosophy in the Light of Traditional Wisdom''], by John Griffin, World Wisdom, Inc, 2011 - 283 pages, pp. 164-166.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And Lee Penn that:  {{Block quote|Guénon then reaches an ultimate Eschatological conclusion and warns against the omni present materialism and artificial egalitarianism of the west, seen as  symptoms of terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=MXvBs2PqkUcC&amp;pg=PA436 ''False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One World Religion'']], Chapter: "The Warnings of a Sufi Metaphysician, René Guénon", Sophia Perennis, 2004 - 490 pages, by Lee Penn, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Reception ==

After the publication of the book two new movements, communism and existentialism, started to dominate and inform the minds of the intellectual elite in France.

More recently; [[Jacob Needleman]], in ''The Sword of Gnosis'' writes:

"Many of Guénon's books, notably ''The Reign of Quantity'', are such potent and detailed metaphysical attacks on the downward drift of Western civilization as to make all other contemporary critiques seem half-hearted by comparison."

[[Harry Oldmeadow]], author of ''Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy'':

"''The Reign of Quantity'' is a brilliantly sustained and excoriating attack on modern civilization [...] The book is a controlled and dispassionate but devastating razing of the assumptions and values of modern science. At the same time it is an affirmation of the metaphysical and cosmological principles given expression in traditional culture and religions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sophiaperennis.com/books/eschatology/the-reign-of-quantity-and-the-signs-of-the-times/ Sophia Perennis, books, The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feofan/Theophan Prokopovich''' (18 June 1681, [[Kiev]], [[Cossack Hetmanate]], protectorate of [[Tsardom of Russia]] — 19 September 1736, [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]]) was a Ukrainian-born [[Russian Empire|Russian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Feofan-Prokopovich Feofan Prokopovich. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; theologian, writer, poet, mathematician, philosopher, rector of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogila Academy]], and Archbishop of [[Novgorod]]. He elaborated upon and implemented [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s reform of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and was one of the founding fathers of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Prokopovich wrote many religious verses and some of the most enduring [[sermon]]s in the [[Russian language]].

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and Education ===
Feofan (born Eleazar) Prokopovich was born in [[Kiev]]. His father, Tsereysky, was a shopkeeper from [[Smolensk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.johnlearn.com/p/theophan-prokopovich-was-born-in-the-family-of-a-shopkeeper-tsereysky-in-kiev|title=Theophan Prokopovich was born in the family of a shopkeeper Tsereysky in Kiev|last=S.|first=John|work=John Learn|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his parents, Eleazar was adopted by his maternal uncle, Feofan Prokopovich. Feofan Prokopovich was the [[governor]] of the [[Brotherhood Monastery|Kiev Brotherhood Epiphany Monastery]], professor, and rector of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogila Academy]].

Prokopovich's uncle sent him to the monastery for primary school. After graduation, he became a student of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogila Academy]].

In 1698, after graduating from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogila Academy]], Eleazar continued his education at the [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate]] Collegium. He lived in the [[Basilian monks|Basilian]] monastery and was [[Tonsure|tonsured]] as a monk under the name of Elisha. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate]] [[Bishop]] of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], Zalensky, noticed the extraordinary abilities of the young monk and contributed to his transfer to the Catholic Academy of [[St. Athanasius]] in [[Rome]], which was created by [[Theology|theologians]] to spread [[Catholicism]] among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] adherents.

In Rome, he enjoyed access to the [[Vatican Library]]. In addition to theology, Prokopovich also studied the works of ancient Latin and Greek philosophers, historians, attractions of old and new [[Rome]], and the principles of the Catholic faith and of the [[Pope]]. Throughout his studies, he became acquainted with the works of [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Giordano Bruno]], and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].

In October 28, 1701, Prokopovich left Rome without completing his full course at the academy. He passed through [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Germany]], before studying in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. There he became acquainted with the ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

=== Return to Russia ===
He returned to Ukraine (then part of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]) in 1704, first to [[Pochayiv Lavra]], then to [[Kiev]], where he renounced the Catholic faith as well as his [[penance]] and [[tonsure]] with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[monk]]s, taking the name Feofan in memory of his uncle.

Beginning in 1705, Prokopovich taught rhetoric, poetics, and philosophy at the Kiev-Mogila Collegium. He also wrote the tragicomedy "Vladimir," dedicating it to [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Mazepa]]. At the same time, he wrote the theological and philosophical sermons which were seen by the [[Kiev]] [[governor-general]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Dmitry Golitsyn]] and [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]].

In 1707, he became Prefect of the Kiev-Mogila Academy.

In 1711, Prokopovich gave a sermon on the occasion of the anniversary of the [[Battle of Poltava]]. The [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], was struck by the eloquence of this sermon, and upon his return to Kiev, Feofan Prokopovich was appointed rector of the Kiev-Mogila Academy and a professor of theology. At the same time, he also became abbot of the [[Brotherhood Monastery|Kiev Brotherhood Epiphany Monastery]]. He entirely reformed the teaching of [[theology]] there, substituting the historical method of the German theologians for the Orthodox scholastic system.

In 1716, he went to [[St Petersburg]]. From that point, Prokopovich spent his time explaining the new scholastic system and justifying its most controversial innovations from the pulpit. Despite the opposition of the Russian clergy, who regarded the "Light of Kiev" as an interloper and semi-heretic, he became invaluable to the civil power. He was promoted to [[bishop]] of [[Pskov]] in 1718, and [[archbishop]] of [[Novgorod]] in 1725.  
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

As the author of the spiritual regulation for the reform of the Russian Orthodox Church, Feofan is regarded as the creator of the spiritual department superseding the patriarchate, better known by its later name of the [[Holy Governing Synod]], of which he was made vice-president. A pitiless enemy of superstitions of any kind, Prokopovich continued to be a reformer even after the death of [[Peter the Great]].

==Footnotes==
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; He had served as vicar to the previous Archbishop of Novgorod since the early 18th century. See Pavel Tikhomirov, ''Kafedra Novgorodskikh Sviatitelei'' (Novgorod, 1895–1899).

'''Theories on the [[causes of poverty]]''' are the foundation upon which [[poverty reduction]] strategies are based.

While in [[developed nations]] [[poverty]] is often seen as either a personal or a structural defect, in [[developing nations]] the issue of poverty is more profound due to the lack of governmental funds. Some theories on poverty in the developing world focus on [[cultural]] characteristics as a retardant of further development. Other theories focus on social and political aspects that perpetuate poverty; perceptions of the poor have a significant impact on the design and execution of programs to alleviate poverty.

== Causes of poverty in the United States==

===Poverty as a personal failing===
When it comes to [[poverty in the United States]], there are two main lines of thought. The most common line of thought within the U.S. is that a person is poor because of personal traits.&lt;ref name="rank_full"&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;3–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These traits in turn have caused the person to fail. Supposed traits range from personality characteristics, such as laziness, to educational levels. Despite this range, it is always viewed as the individual's personal failure not to climb out of poverty. This thought pattern stems from the idea of [[meritocracy]] and its entrenchment within U.S. thought. Meritocracy, according to Katherine S. Newman is “the view that those who are worthy are rewarded and those who fail to reap rewards must also lack self-worth.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1999|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all followers of meritocracy believe that a person in poverty deserves their low standard of living. Rather the underlying ideas of personal failure show in the resistance to social and economic programs such as welfare; a poor individual's lack of prosperity shows a personal failing and should not be compensated (or justified) by the state.

===Poverty as a structural failing===
[[#CITEREFRankYoonHershl2003|Rank, Yoon, and Hirschl (2003)]] present a contrary argument to the idea that personal failings are the cause of poverty. The argument presented is that United States poverty is result of “failings at the structural level.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key social and economic structural failings which contribute heavily to poverty within the U.S. are identified in the article. The first is a failure of the job market to provide a proper amount of jobs which pay enough to keep families out of poverty. Even if unemployment is low, the labor market may be saturated with low-paying, part-time work that lacks benefits (thus limiting the amount of full-time, good paying jobs). Rank, Yoon and Hirschl examined the [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP), a longitudinal study on employment and income. Using the 1999 official poverty line of $17,029 for a family of four, it was found that 9.4% of persons working full-time and 14.9% of persons working at least part-time did not earn enough annually to keep them above the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that 29% of families in The United States could go six months or longer during a hardship with no income. Over 50% of respondents said around two months with no income and another 20% said they could not go longer than two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S.|last2=Rehm|first2=Philipp|last3=Schlesinger|first3=Mark|date=2013-03-01|title=The Insecure American: Economic Experiences, Financial Worries, and Policy Attitudes|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1537592712003647|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=11|issue=01|pages=23–49|doi=10.1017/S1537592712003647|issn=1541-0986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low minimum wage, combined with part-time jobs which offer no benefits, have contributed to the labor market's inability to produce enough jobs which can keep a family out of poverty is an example of an economic structural failure.&lt;ref name="rank_full" /&gt;

Rank, Yoon and Hirschl point to the minimal amount of [[social safety net]]s found within the U.S. as a social structural failure and a major contributor to poverty in the U.S. Other industrialized nations devote more resources to assisting the poor than the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this difference poverty is reduced in nations which devote more to poverty reduction measure and programs. Rank et al. use a table to drive this point home. The table shows that in 1994, the actual rate of poverty (what the rate would be without government interventions) in the U.S. was 29%. When compared to actual rates in Canada (29%), Finland (33%), France (39%), Germany (29%), [[the Netherlands]] (30%), [[Norway]] (27%), [[Sweden]] (36%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (38%), the United States rate is low. But when government measures and programs are included, the rate of reduction in poverty in the United States is low (38%). [[Canada]] and the United Kingdom had the lowest reduction rates outside of the U.S. at 66%, while Sweden, Finland and Norway had reduction rates greater than 80% (All percentages taken from {{harvnb|Rank|Yoon|Hirschl|2003|p=17}}).

===Poverty as cultural characteristics===
Development plays a central role to poverty reduction in [[third world]] countries. Some authors feel that the national mindset itself plays a role in the ability for a country to develop and to thus reduce poverty. [[#CITEREFGrondona2000|Mariano Grondona (2000)]] outlines twenty “cultural factors” which, depending on the culture's view of each, can be indicators as to whether the cultural environment is favorable or resistant to development. In turn [[#CITEREFHarrison2000|Lawrence E. Harrison (2000)]] identifies ten “values” which, like Grondona's factors, can be indicative of the nation's developmental environment. Finally, [[#CITEREFLindsay2000|Stace Lindsay (2000)]] claims the differences between development-prone and development-resistant nations is attributed to mental models (which, like values, influence the decisions humans make). Mental models are also cultural creations. Grondona, Harrison and Lindsay all feel that without development orientated values and mindsets, nations will find it difficult if not impossible to develop efficiently, and that some sort of cultural change will be needed in these nations in order to reduce poverty.

In “A Cultural Typology of Economic Development”, from the book Culture Matters, Mariano Grondona claims development is a matter of decisions. These decisions, whether they are favorable to economic development or not, are made within the context of culture. All cultural values considered together create “value systems”. These systems heavily influence the way decisions are made as well as the reactions and outcomes of said decisions. In the same book, Stace Lindsay's chapter claims the decisions individuals make are a result of mental models. These mental models influence all aspects of human action. Like Grondona's value systems, these mental models which dictate a nations stance toward development and hence its ability to deal with poverty.

Grondona presents two ideal [[value system]]s (mental models), one of which has values only favoring development, the other only with value which resist development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grondona|2000|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Real value systems fluctuate and fall somewhere between the two poles, but developed countries tend to bunch near one end, while [[undeveloped countries]] bunch near the other. Grondona goes on to identify twenty cultural factors on which the two value systems stand in opposition. These factors include such things as the dominant religion; the role of the individual in society; the value placed on work; concepts of wealth, competition, justice and time; and the role of education. In “Promoting Progressive Cultural Change”, also from Culture Matters, Lawrence E. Harrison identifies values, like Grondona's factors, which differ between “progressive” cultures and “static” cultures. Religion, value of work, overall justice and time orientation are included in his list, but Harrison also adds [[frugality]] and community as important factors. Like Grondona and Harrison, Lindsay also presents “patterns of thought” which differ between nations that stand at opposite poles of the developmental scale. Lindsay focuses more on economic aspects such as the form of capital focused upon and market characteristics. Key themes which emerge from these lists as characteristic of developmental cultures are: trust in the individual with a fostering of individual strengths; the ability for free thinking in an open, safe environment; importance of questioning/innovation; law is supreme and holds the power; future orientated time frame with an emphasis on achievable, practical goals; meritocracy; an autonomous mindset within the larger world; strong work ethic is highly valued and rewarded; a microeconomic focus; and a value that is non-economic, but not anti-economic, which is always wanting. Characteristics of the ideal non-developmental value system are: suppression of the individual through control of information and censorship; present/past time orientation with emphasis on grandiose, often unachievable, goals; [[macroeconomic]] focus; access to leaders allowing for easier and greater corruption; unstable distribution of law and justice (family and its connections matter most); and a passive mindset within the larger world.

Grondona, Harrison, and Lindsay all feel that at least some aspects of development-resistant cultures need to change in order to allow under-developed nations (and cultural minorities within developed nations) to develop effectively. According to their argument, poverty is fueled by cultural characteristics within under-developed nations, and in order for poverty to be brought under control, said nations must move down the development path.

===Poverty as a label===
Various theorists believe the way poverty is approached, defined, and thus thought about, plays a role in its perpetuation. [[#CITEREFGreen2006|Maia Green (2006)]] explains that modern development literature tends to view poverty as agency filled. When poverty is prescribed agency, poverty becomes something that happens to people. Poverty absorbs people into itself and the people, in turn, become a part of poverty, devoid of their human characteristics. In the same way, poverty, according to Green, is viewed as an object in which all social relations (and persons involved) are obscured. Issues such as structural failings (see earlier section), institutionalized inequalities, or corruption may lie at the heart of a region's poverty, but these are obscured by broad statements about poverty. [[Arjun Appadurai]] writes of the “terms of recognition” (drawn from Charles Taylor's ‘points of recognition), which are given the poor are what allows poverty to take on this generalized autonomous form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are “given” to the poor because the poor lack social and economic capital, and thus have little to no influence on how they are represented and/or perceived in the larger community. Furthermore, the term “poverty”, is often used in a generalized matter. This further removes the poor from defining their situation as the broadness of the term covers differences in histories and causes of local inequalities. Solutions or plans for reduction of poverty often fail precisely because the context of a region's poverty is removed and local conditions are not considered.

The specific ways in which the poor and poverty are recognized frame them in a negative light. In development literature, poverty becomes something to be eradicated, or, attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;1108–1129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is always portrayed as a singular problem to be fixed. When a negative view of poverty (as an animate object) is fostered, it can often lead to an extension of negativity to those who are experiencing it. This in turn can lead to justification of inequalities through the idea of the deserving poor. Even if thought patterns do not go as far as justification, the negative light poverty is viewed in, according to Appadurai, does much to ensure little change in the policies of redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty as restriction of opportunities===
The environment of poverty is one marked with unstable conditions and a lack of capital (both social and economical) which together create the vulnerability characteristic of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006||pp=&lt;!--full --&gt;363–376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a person's daily life is lived within the person's environment, a person's environment determines daily decisions and actions based on what is present and what is not. Dipkanar Chakravarti argues that the poor's daily practice of navigating the world of poverty generates a fluency in the poverty environment but a near illiteracy in the environment of the larger society. Thus, when a poor person enters into transactions and interactions with the social norm, that person's understanding of it is limited, and thus decisions revert to decisions most effective in the poverty environment. Through this a sort of cycle is born in which the “dimensions of poverty are not merely additive, but are interacting and reinforcing in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chakravarti|2006|p=365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[#CITEREFAppadurai2004|Arjun Appadurai (2004)]], the key to the environment of poverty, which causes the poor to enter into this cycle, is the poor's lack of capacities. Appardurai's idea of capacity relates to Albert Hirschman's ideas of “voice” and “exit” which are ways in which people can decline aspects of their environment; to voice displeasure and aim for change or to leave said aspect of environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a person in poverty lacks adequate voice and exit (capacities) with which they can change their position. Appadurai specifically deals with the capacity to aspire and its role in the continuation of poverty and its environment. Aspirations are formed through social life and its interactions. Thus, it can be said, that one's aspirations are influenced by one's environment. Appadurai claims that the better off one is, the more chances one has to not only reach aspirations but to also see the pathways which lead to the fulfillment of aspirations. By actively practicing the use of their capacity of aspiration the elite not only expand their aspiration horizon but also solidify their ability to reach aspirations by learning the easiest and most efficient paths through said practice. On the other hand, the poor's horizon of aspiration is much closer and less steady than that of the elite.

Thus, the capacity to aspire requires practice, and, as Chakravarti argues, when a capacity (or decision making process) is not refined through practice it falters and often fails. The unstable life of poverty often limits the poor's aspiration levels to those of necessity (such as having food to feed ones family) and in turn reinforces the lowered aspiration levels (someone who is busy studying, instead of looking for ways to get enough food, will not survive long in the poverty environment). Because the capacity to aspire (or lack thereof) reinforces and perpetuates the cycle of poverty, Appadurai claims that expanding the poor's aspiration horizon will help the poor to find both voice and exit. Ways of doing this include changing the terms of recognition (see previous section) and/or creating programs which provide the poor with an arena in which to practice capacities. An example of one such arena may be a housing development built for the poor, by the poor. Through this, the poor are able to not only show their abilities but to also gain practice dealing with governmental agencies and society at large. Through collaborative projects, the poor are able to expand their aspiration level above and beyond tomorrow's meal to the cultivation of skills and the entrance into the larger market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Appadurai|2004|pp=&lt;!-- full --&gt;59–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Kelly Cheyne''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (18 September 1841{{snd}}1915) was an [[England|English]] [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|divine]] and [[Biblical criticism|Biblical critic]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[London]] and educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School, London]], and [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Subsequently, he studied German theological methods at [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. He was ordained in 1864 and held a fellowship at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], 1868–1882. During the earlier part of this period he stood alone in the university as a teacher of the main conclusions of [[Old Testament]] criticism at that time. In 1881 he was presented to the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectory]] of Tendring, in [[Essex, England|Essex]], and in 1884 he was made a member of the Old Testament revision company. He resigned the living of Tendring in 1885 on his appointment to be [[Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture]], which carried with it a canonry at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. In 1889 he delivered the [[Bampton lectures]] at Oxford. In 1908 he resigned his professorship.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Cheyne, Thomas Kelly |volume=6 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1901, he received an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity|doctorate of Divinity]] from the [[University of Glasgow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow University jubilee |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36481| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 1902 he was awarded the degree [[Doctor of Letters]] (D.Litt.) from the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=15 March 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36716| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He consistently urged in his writings the necessity of a broad and comprehensive study of the Scriptures in the light of literary, historical and scientific considerations. His publications include commentaries on the ''Prophets and Hagiographa'', as well as lectures and addresses on theological subjects. He was a joint editor of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'' (London, 1899&amp;ndash;1903), a work embodying the more advanced conclusions of English biblical criticism. In the introduction to his ''Origin of the Psalter'' (London, 1891) he gave an account of his development as a critical scholar.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His publications include translations, commentaries, and supplemental research.

He became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] by 1912.&lt;ref name="Sohrab1913"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Merrick |year=2011 |page=31 Dec 1912 |title=Abdu'l-Baha in the UK, 1913 (Sohrab's Diary) |url=http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/misc/sohrab-diary-uk-1913.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Nicholson b1753.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;William Nicholson, circa 1811&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''William Nicholson''' (13 December 1753{{spaced ndash}}21 May 1815) was a renowned English [[chemist]] and writer on "[[natural philosophy]]" and chemistry, as well as a translator, journalist, publisher, scientist,  inventor, patent agent and civil engineer.

==Early life==
Nicholson was educated in Yorkshire, and after leaving school, he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the [[British East India Company]].  His first ship was reportedly called The Boston and the second voyage was on board The Gatton.

Subsequently, having become acquainted with [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in 1775, he moved to [[Amsterdam]], where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood's agent.

&lt;!--[[File:Nicholson-araeometer.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Nicholson's araeometer]]--&gt;
On his return to England he was persuaded by [[Thomas Holcroft]] to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals, while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to the preparation of ''An Introduction to Natural Philosophy'', which was published in 1781 and was at once successful. A translation of [[Voltaire]]'s ''Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy'' soon followed, and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism.

In 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood (the current Chairman) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of [[Naval Architecture]], established in 1791. He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for [[comb]]-cutting, [[file (tool)|file]]-making, [[cylinder printing]] and other uses—he also invented an [[areometer]].

==Scientific work==
On 12 December 1783, Nicholson was elected to the "Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society". He was proposed by [[Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan]] and seconded by horologist [[John Whitehurst]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Harvey Levere, Gerard L'Estrange Turner, Jan Golinski, Larry R. Stewart (2002) "Discussing Chemistry and Steam – The minutes of a coffee house philosophical society 1780–1787", Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0198515308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson communicated to the [[Royal Society]] in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects. In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over [[Richard Kirwan]]'s essay on [[phlogiston]], and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians (Lavoisier, Monge, Berthollet, and [[Guyton de Morveau]]) as ‘An Essay on Phlogiston, to which are added Notes.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nicholson, William (1753-1815)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797 he founded, published, and wrote part of the ''[[Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts]]'', generally known as ''Nicholson's Journal'', the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain. The journal published the first known [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] analysis of [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[heavier-than-air]] [[fixed-wing]] [[flying machines]] designs, by [[George Cayley]] in 1809-1810.&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;Cayley, George.

(Via [[NASA]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The publication continued until 1814.

In 1799 he established a school in London's [[Soho Square]], where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry, with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from [[Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford|Thomas Pitt]].

In May 1800 he with [[Anthony Carlisle]] discovered [[electrolysis]], the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by [[Voltaic pile|voltaic current]].

Chemistry World, August 2003, Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides considerable contributions to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', Nicholson wrote translations of [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|Fourcroy]]'s ''Chemistry'' (1787) and [[Jean-Antoine Chaptal|Chaptal]]'s ''Chemistry'' (1788), ''First Principles of Chemistry'' (1788) and a ''Chemical Dictionary'' (1795); he also edited the ''[[British Encyclopaedia]]'', or ''Dictionary of Arts and Sciences'' (6 vols., London, 1809).

==Later life==
During the later years of his life, Nicholson's attention was chiefly directed to [[water supply]] engineering at [[Portsmouth]], at [[Gosport]] and in [[Hammersmith]]. William Nicholson died in [[Bloomsbury]] at the age of 61 on 21 May 1815, attended by Sir Anthony Carlisle.

'''William Wollaston''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|ə|s|t|ən}}; 26 March 1659 – 29 October 1724) was a school teacher, [[Church of England]] priest, scholar of Latin, Greek and Hebrew, theologian, and a major [[Age of enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] English philosopher. He is remembered today for one book, which he completed two years before his death: ''[[The Religion of Nature Delineated]]''. He led a cloistered life and published no other work, but in terms of eighteenth-century philosophy and the concept of [[natural religion]], he is ranked with British Enlightenment philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. 

Wollaston's work contributed to the development of two important intellectual schools: British Deism, and "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness|the pursuit of happiness]]" moral philosophy of American Practical Idealism, which appears notably in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

==Life==
Wollaston was born at [[Coton Clanford]] in Staffordshire, on 26 March 1659. He was born to a family long-established in Staffordshire, and was distantly related to Sir John Wollaston, the Alderman and [[Lord Mayor of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clarke (dean of Salisbury)|John Clarke]], [http://fair-use.org/william-wollaston/the-religion-of-nature-delineated/preface A Preface ''containing'' A General Account of the Life, Character, and Writings of the ''Author''], ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'', 1750 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his family was not wealthy. At the age of ten, he began school at a Latin school newly opened in [[Shenstone, Staffordshire]], and continued in country free schools until he was admitted to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], at the age of 15, in June 1674.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLSN674W|name=Wollaston, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his writings it is clear that he was an excellent scholar, "extremely well versed" in languages and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, Alexander, "William Wollaston (1659–1724): English Deist and Rabbinic Scholar", ''Transactions (Jewish Historical Society of England)'', Vol. 16, (1945–1951), pp. 185–211&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last year at Cambridge, Wollaston published anonymously a small book, ''On the Design of the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], or the Unreasonableness of Men's Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an English Poem'' (London, 1691). Apparently embarrassed by his own work, Wollaston almost immediately suppressed it.

[[File:Shenton Hall - geograph.org.uk - 53175.jpg|thumb|Shenton Hall, Leicestershire]]
After leaving Cambridge in September 1681, he became an assistant master at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and took holy orders. At this time, he became [[Perpetual curate]] of [[St Mary's Church, Moseley]] from 1684 – 1686. 

In 1688 a cousin left him a fortune and the family estates, including Finborough manor and [[Shenton Hall]], Leicestershire, and in November of the same year he settled in London. There Wollaston devoted himself to private study of learning and philosophy, seldom leaving the city and declining to accept any public employment. In retirement, he published ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'' (1722) in a private edition. He wrote extensively on language, philosophy, religion, and history, but in the last few years of his life, he committed most of his manuscripts to the flames, as his health worsened and he began to feel that he would never be able to complete them to his satisfaction.

Wollaston suffered from fragile health throughout his life. Just after completing ''The Religion of Nature Delineated'', he broke his arm in an accident, and his strength declined and illnesses increased until his death on 29 October 1724. His body was carried to [[Great Finborough]] in Suffolk, where he was buried beside his wife.

==''The Religion of Nature Delineated''==
{{main|The Religion of Nature Delineated}}

===Argument===

The ''Religion of Nature Delineated'' was an attempt to create a system of ethics without recourse to revealed religion. He claimed originality for his theory that the moral evil is the practical denial of a true proposition and moral good the affirmation of it, writing that this attempt to use mathematics to create a [[rationalist]] ethics was "something never met with anywhere".  Wollaston "held that religious truths were plain as Euclid, clear to all who contemplated Creation."&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Porter, Roy, The Creation of the Modern World: The Untold Story of the British Enlightenment, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton had induced natural laws from a mathematical model of the physical world; similarly, Wollaston was attempting to induce moral laws by a mathematical model of the moral world.

===Influence===

More than 10,000 copies were sold in the just first few years alone&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Roy, The Creation of the Modern World: The Untold Story of the British Enlightenment, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; with 22 imprints prior to 1800. There was Wollaston's private edition in 1722; after his death there was one public edition in 1724, five in 1725, five in 1726, two in 1731, one in 1737, four in 1738, one in 1746, one 1750, and one in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;English Short Title Catalog, http://estc.bl.uk/ search on "Wollaston, William", retrieved 28 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollaston's idea of a [[Natural religion]] without revelation briefly inspired and revived the movement known as [[Deism]] in England. Some today consider him a "[[Christian Deist]]",&lt;ref&gt;Porter, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; while others note that there is no "significant evidence that William Wollaston was not a more or less orthodox Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, S. J., ''The Enlightenment and Religion: The Myths of Modernity'', Manchester University Press, 2003, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wollaston's ideas could be argued to have anticipated both [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]&lt;ref&gt;His view that science and math could define a morality based on nature predated the scientific morality of Scottish Common Sense Realism&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utilitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Wollaston also held that a person is happy when the sum total of pleasure exceeds pains&lt;/ref&gt; proponents of later schools of philosophy criticised and sometimes even ridiculed Wollaston. These included [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Richard Price]], and [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;see Becker Lawrence, and Becker, Charlotte, Encyclopedia of Ethics, Charlotte B. Becker, Volume 3, {{ISBN|0415936721}}, 9780415936729, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;1818&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1759 no further editions of his work was published in the rest of the century.

[[Ben Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]], worked as a compositor on one of the 1726 editions of the book and wrote the short pamphlet ''[[A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain]]'' although he found it "so shallow and unconvincing as to be embarrassing",&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter, ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life'', Simon and Schuster, 2004 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and burned as many copies as he could find.  Although rejecting Deism&lt;ref&gt;Issacson, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; he retained a fondness for the "pursuit of happiness" believing that God was best served by doing good works and helping other people.

It was a major influence on the American educator [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson]]'s college philosophy textbooks.  Its focus on practice as well as speculation attracted a more mature Franklin, who commissioned and published Johnson's textbook ''Elementa Philosophica'' in 1752, then promoted it in the College of Philadelphia (now [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Herbert and Carol, ''Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume I, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
On 26 November 1689, Wollaston married Catharine Charlton (died 21 July 1720). They had eleven children together, four of whom died within his lifetime. They included:

The Yoga school's systematic studies to better oneself physically, mentally and spiritually has influenced all other schools of Indian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 20-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royper&gt;Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, pages 149-158&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' is a key text of the Yoga school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt;

The Yoga school of Hinduism differs from the closely related non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school by incorporating the concept of a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god" (Ishvara).&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, page 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovoor T.

== History ==
[[File:Bronze figure of Kashmiri in Meditation by Malvina Hoffman Wellcome M0005215.jpg|thumb|A statue of a man in yoga posture (Kashmir, [[India]])]]
The origins of the Yoga is said to be started by [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. Some of its earliest discussions are found in 1st millennium BCE Indian texts such as the [[Katha Upanishad]], the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] and the [[Maitri Upanishad]].&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt;

The root of "Yoga" is found in hymn 5.81.1 of the [[Rig Veda]], a dedication to rising Sun-god in the morning (Savitri), interpreted as "yoke" or "yogically control".&lt;ref name="burley" /&gt;

|Rigveda 5.81.1}}

Rigveda, however, does not describe Yoga philosophy with the same meaning or context as in medieval or modern times. Early references to practices that later became part of Yoga school of Hinduism, are made in [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], the oldest Upanishad. Gavin Flood translates it as, "...having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (''atman''), within oneself." The practice of [[pranayama]] (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. ~ 900 BCE), and the practice of [[pratyahara]] (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (c. ~ 800-700 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14203-6}}, pages 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], The Upanishads, The [[Sacred Books of the East]] – Part 1, Oxford University Press, Quote: (He who engages in) self study, concentrates all his senses on the Self, never giving pain to any creature, except at the tîrthas, he who behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of [[Brahman]], and does not return, yea, he does not return".&lt;br /&gt;

The Katha Upanishad, dated to be from about the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, in verses 2.6.6 through 2.6.13 recommends a path to Self-knowledge, and calls this path ''Yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]] (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads – Part II, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-486-20993-7}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga school of Hinduism is mentioned in foundational texts of other orthodox schools such as the Vaisesikha Sutras, Nyaya Sutras and Brahma Sutras, which suggests that the Yoga philosophy was in vogue in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=ianwhicher320 /&gt; It influenced and was influenced by other schools and Indian philosophies. There are, for example, numerous parallels in the concepts in the [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism, Yoga and the [[Abhidharma]] schools of thought, particularly from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century AD, notes Larson.&lt;ref name=l4345&gt;Larson, pp. 43-45&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's Yoga Sutras may be a synthesis of these three traditions. From the Samkhya school of Hinduism, the Yoga Sutras adopt the "reflective discernment" (''adhyavasaya'') of ''prakrti'' and ''purusa'' (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three [[epistemology|epistemic]] methods to gaining reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of ''nirodhasamadhi'', suggests Larson, the Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of an altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhism, which believes that there is neither self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt; The third concept that the Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient [[Sannyasa|ascetic]] traditions of isolation, meditation and introspection.&lt;ref name=l4345 /&gt;

The systematic collection of ideas of the Yoga school of Hinduism is found in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. After its circulation in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, many Indian scholars reviewed it, then published their ''Bhāṣya'' (notes and commentary) on it, which together form a canon of texts called the ''Pātañjalayogaśāstra'' ("The Treatise on Yoga of Patañjali").{{sfn|Maas|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;Larson, p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six darsanas ===
The Yoga school of Hinduism has been included as one of the six orthodox schools in medieval era Indian texts.&lt;ref&gt;David Lawrence (2014), in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, pages 137-150&lt;/ref&gt; The other schools are [[Samkhya]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name=frazier25&gt;Jessica Frazier (2014), in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1-4725-1151-5}}, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The Yoga school of Hindu philosophy is most closely related to the Samkhya school. In both, the foundational concepts include two realities: ''Purusha'' and ''Prakriti''.&lt;ref name=frazier25 /&gt; The ''Purusha'' is defined as that reality which is pure consciousness and is devoid of thoughts or qualities. The ''Prakriti'' is the empirical, phenomenal reality which includes matter and also mind, sensory organs and the sense of identity (self, soul).&lt;ref name=frazier25 /&gt; A living being is held in both schools to be the union of matter and mind. The Yoga school differs from the Samkhya school in its views on the ontology of ''Purusha'', on axiology and on soteriology.&lt;ref name=royperrett151 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mikeburley31 /&gt;

=== Epistemology ===
[[File:3 Pramana Epistemology Samkhya Yoga Hindu schools.svg|thumb|The Yoga school considers perception, inference and reliable testimony as three reliable means to knowledge.&lt;ref name="Lpage9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag /&gt;]]
Yoga school, like Samkhya school, considers ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' (direct sense perception), ''Anumāna'' (inference), and  ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or ''[[Pramana]]''.&lt;ref name="Lpage9"/&gt; Unlike few other schools of Hinduism such as [[Advaita Vedanta]], Yoga did not adopt the following three ''[[Pramana]]s'': ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or ''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).&lt;ref name=eliottjag /&gt;
* '''''Pratyak'''' (प्रत्यक्षाय) means perception. It is of two types in Hindu texts: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), "The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy", ''Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies'', 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), ''Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-823976-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat /&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), ''Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'', Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), ''Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'', Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pranama'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), ''Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'', Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Anumāṇa''''' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal /&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' – the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), ''Indian Wisdom – Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus'', Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Śabda''''' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=eliottjag2&gt;* Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3611-2}}, pages 245-248;

The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), ''The Essentials of Indian Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must cooperate with others to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir /&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir /&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper ''pramana''. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics ===
The metaphysics of Yoga school, again like Samkhya school, is a form of [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]]. It considers consciousness and matter, self/soul and body as two different realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haney|2002|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaac|Dangwal|1997|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samkhya-Yoga system espouses [[Consciousness–matter dualism|dualism between consciousness and matter]] by postulating two "irreducible, innate and independent realities: [[Purusha]] and [[Prakriti]]. While the ''Prakriti'' is a single entity, the Samkhya-Yoga schools admit a plurality of the ''Puruṣa''s in this world. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible and eternal Prakriti is alone the final source of the world of objects. The ''Puruṣa'' is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer (''bhokta'') and the ''Prakriti'' is the enjoyed (''bhogya''). Samkhya-Yoga believes that the ''Puruṣa'' cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world. This metaphysics is a pluralistic spiritualism, a form of realism built on the foundation of dualism.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1997|pages=149–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga school of Hinduism adopts the theory of [[Guṇa]] from Samkhya.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; Guṇas theory states that three ''gunas'' (innate tendency, attributes) are present in different proportions in all beings, and these three are ''[[sattva]]'' guna (goodness, constructive, harmonious), ''[[rajas]]'' guna (passion, active, confused), and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'' guna (darkness, destructive, chaotic).&lt;ref name=aw&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, ''International Journal of Ethics'', Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jamesg&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M'', Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; These three are present in every being but in different proportions, and the fundamental nature and psychological dispositions of beings is a consequence of the relative proportion of these three ''gunas''.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; When ''sattva'' guna predominates an individual, the qualities of lucidity, wisdom, constructiveness, harmonious, and peacefulness manifest themselves; when rajas is predominant, attachment, craving, passion-driven activity and restlessness manifest; and when tamas predominates in an individual, ignorance, delusion, destructive behavior, lethargy, and suffering manifests. The guṇas theory underpins the philosophy of mind in Yoga school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt;

The early scholars of Yoga philosophy, posits that the ''Puruṣa'' (consciousness) by its nature is sattva (constructive), while ''Prakriti'' (matter) by its nature is tamas (chaotic).&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; It further posits that individuals at birth have ''buddhi'' (intelligence, sattvic). As life progresses and churns this ''buddhi'', it creates ''ahamkara'' (ego, rajasic). When ego in turn is churned by life, ''manas'' (temper, mood, tamasic) is produced. Together, ''buddhi'', ''ahamkara'' and ''manas'' interact and constitute ''citta'' (mind) in Yoga school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; Unrestrained modification of ''citta'' causes suffering. A way of life that empowers one to become ever more aware of one's consciousness and spirituality innate in ''buddhi'', is the path to one's highest potential and a more serene, content, liberated life. Patanjali's Yoga sutra begins, in verse 2 of Book 1, by defining Yoga as "restraining the ''Citta'' from ''Vrittis''."&lt;ref name="Vivekanada, p. 115"&gt;Vivekanada, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axiology ===
{{Main|Yamas|Niyamas}}
Axiology in the texts of Yoga school of Hindu philosophy include both a theory of values through the observances of positive values and avoidance of negative, as well as an aesthetic theory on bliss from intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hartman (2002), The Knowledge of Good: Critique of Axiological Reason, Rodopi, {{ISBN|978-9042012202}}, pages 224-225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Coward (2002), Yoga and Psychology: Language, Memory, and Mysticism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5500-5}}, pages 42-46, 88-89, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; The values to be observed are called [[Niyamas]], while those to be avoided are called [[Yamas]] in Yoga philosophy.

Over sixty different ancient and medieval era texts of Yoga philosophy discuss ''Yamas'' and ''Niyamas''.&lt;ref name=svbharti&gt;SV Bharti (2001), ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'': With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 672-691&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Varenne and Coltman Derek (1977), Yoga and the Hindu Tradition, University Of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0-226-85116-7}}, pages 197-202&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theory and list of values varies between the texts, however, ''Ahimsa'', ''Satya'', ''Asteya'', ''Svādhyāya'', ''Kșhamā'', and ''Dayā'' are among the predominantly discussed ethical concepts by majority of these texts.&lt;ref name=svbharti /&gt;

The five yamas listed by [[Patañjali]] in ''Yogasūtra'' 2.30 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K.

Patanjali, in Book 2, explains how and why each of the above self restraints help in the personal growth of an individual. For example, in verse II.35, Patanjali states that the virtue of nonviolence and non-injury to others ([[Ahimsa]]) leads to the abandonment of enmity, a state that leads the yogi to the perfection of inner and outer amity with everyone, everything.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogaphilosophyb00tatygoog#page/n130/mode/2up The Yoga Philosophy] TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.

As with ''Yamas'', Patanjali explains how and why each of the above ''Niyamas'' help in the personal growth of an individual. For example, in verse II.42, Patanjali states that the virtue of contentment and acceptance of others as they are ([[Santosha|Santoṣa]]) leads to the state where inner sources of joy matter most, and the craving for external sources of pleasant ceases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogaphilosophyb00tatygoog#page/n134/mode/2up The Yoga Philosophy] TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts of the Yoga school expanded the list of values under ''Niyamas'', to include behaviors such as [[Āstika and nāstika|Āstika]] (आस्तिक, belief in personal God, faith in Self, conviction that there is knowledge in Vedas/Upanishads), [[Dāna]] (दान , charity, sharing with others),&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30299-3}}, pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hrī'' (ह्री, remorse and acceptance of one's past/mistakes/ignorance, modesty)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1300/mw__1340.html Hri] Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mati'' (मति, think and reflect, reconcile conflicting ideas)&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, {{Google books|uqlRAAAAcAAJ|A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and philologically arranged|page=740}}, Mati, मति, pages 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Vrata'' (व्रत, resolutions and vows, fast, pious observances).&lt;ref&gt;SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 680-691&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikel Burley (2000), Haṭha-Yoga: Its Context, Theory, and Practice, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120817067}}, pages 190-191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Scharfe, Handbook of Oriental Studies – Education in Ancient India, Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004125568}}, pages 217-222&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soteriology ===
[[File:Lotus position.svg|thumb|The fusion of ''Dharana'', ''Dhyana'' and ''Samadhi'' is ''Sanyama'' – the path to [[Moksha|Kaivalya]] in Yoga school.]]
Yoga school of Hinduism holds that ignorance is the cause of suffering and [[samsara|saṁsāra]].&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The ''Yoga Sūtras'' is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt; ''Samādhi'' is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is [[moksha]], the soteriological goal in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=edbryant /&gt;

Book 3 of Patanjali's ''Yogasutra'' is dedicated to soteriological aspects of yoga philosophy. Patanjali begins by stating that all limbs of yoga are necessary foundation to reaching the state of self-awareness, freedom and liberation. He refers to the three last limbs of yoga as ''sanyama'', in verses III.4 to III.5, and calls it the technology for "discerning principle" and mastery of ''citta'' and self-knowledge.&lt;ref name=yogadarsanabook3&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogadaranasutra00patagoog#page/n112/mode/2up ''The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa – Book 3''] GN Jha (Translator); Harvard University Archives, pages 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Maehle (2007), ''Ashtanga Yoga: Practice &amp; Philosophy'', {{ISBN|978-1-57731-606-0}}, pages 237-238&lt;/ref&gt; In verse III.12, the Yogasutras state that this discerning principle then empowers one to perfect ''sant'' (tranquility) and ''udita'' (reason) in one's mind and spirit, through intentness. This leads to one's ability to discern the difference between ''sabda'' (word), ''artha'' (meaning) and ''pratyaya'' (understanding), and this ability empowers one to compassionately comprehend the cry/speech of all living beings.&lt;ref name=ydbook3&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogadaranasutra00patagoog#page/n126/mode/2up ''The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa – Book 3''] GN Jha (Translator); Harvard University Archives, pages 108-126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogaphilosophyb00tatygoog#page/n158/mode/2up ''The Yoga Philosophy''] TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, pages 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; Once a yogi reaches this state of ''sanyama'', it leads to unusual powers, intuition, self-knowledge, freedoms and [[moksha|kaivalya]], the soteriological goal of the yogi.&lt;ref name=ydbook3 /&gt;

The benefits of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism is then summarized in verses III.46 to III.55 of Yogasutras, stating that the first 5 limbs leads to bodily perfections such as beauty, loveliness, strength and toughness; while the last 3 limbs through ''sanyama'' leads to mind and psychological perfections of perceptiveness, one's nature, mastery over egoism, discriminative knowledge of purity, self and soul.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogadaranasutra00patagoog#page/n144/mode/2up ''The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa – Book 3''] GN Jha (Translator); Harvard University Archives, pages 127-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogaphilosophyb00tatygoog#page/n182/mode/2up ''The Yoga Philosophy''] TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, pages 132-139&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge once reached is irreversible, states Yogasutra's Book IV.

=== God in Yoga school of Hinduism ===
Yoga philosophy allows the concept of God, unlike the closely related [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism which is atheistic/non-theistic.&lt;ref name=royperrett151&gt;Roy Perrett (2007), Samkhya-Yoga Ethics, Indian Ethics: Classical Traditions and Contemporary Challenges (Editors: Purusottama Bilimoria et al), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars such as the 8th century [[Adi Sankara]], as well many modern academic scholars describe the Yoga school as "Samkya school with God."&lt;ref name=maxmuller /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpfl /&gt;&lt;ref name=mikeburley31&gt;Mike Burley (2012), ''Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 31-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali'' use the term ''Isvara'' in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutras' release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is ''Isvara''. These commentaries range from defining ''Isvara'' as a "personal god" to a "special self" to "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual".&lt;ref name=lpfl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93;
* Hariharānanda Āraṇya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of ''Isvara'' in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), ''The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3815-2}}, page 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali defines ''Isvara'' (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as "a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, ''puruṣa-viśeṣa'')",&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;* Sanskrit Original with '''Translation 1''': [https://archive.org/stream/yogaphilosophyb00tatygoog#page/n6/mode/2up The Yoga Philosophy] TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives;

– Yoga Sutras I.24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of ''Isvara'' as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, ''aparamrsta'') by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, ''klesha''), one's circumstances created by the past or by one's current actions (कर्म, ''karma''), one's life fruits (विपाक, ''vipâka''), and one's psychological dispositions or intentions (आशय, ashaya).&lt;ref name=se5&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=aparAmRSTa&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes aparAmRSTa], [http://spokensanskrit.de/ kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya]; ''Sanskrit English Dictionary'', Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Pflueger (2008), ''Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga'' (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleasure and pain results from contact of soul, sense, mind and object. Non-origination of that follows when the mind becomes steady in the soul. After it, there is non-existence of pain in the embodied soul. '''This is that Yoga'''.

We are instructed to practice meditation in such places as a forest, a cave or a sand-bank. Such possibilities [the opponent claims] may occur even in release. It is, we reply, not so, because knowledge must spring up only in a body already in the state of formation. And there is absence of a body in our release. For that purpose, there should be a purifying of our soul by abstinence from evil, and observance of certain virtues, as well as by following the '''spiritual injunctions gleaned from Yoga'''. To secure release [moksha], it is necessary to study and follow this treatise on knowledge [Yoga], as well as to hold discussions with those learned in that treatise.

If it is said that there will result the defect of not allowing room for certain Smritis, we say not so, because there will result the defect of not allowing room for some other smritis [further knowledge], and on account of the non-perception of others.

{{Quote|
'''Yoga is the utter transcendence of the mind and is of two types.''' Self-knowledge is one type, another is the restraint of the life-force of self limitations and psychological conditioning. Yoga has come to mean only the latter, yet both the methods lead to the same result. To some, Self-knowledge through inquiry is difficult, to others Yoga is difficult. But my conviction is that the path of inquiry is easy for all, because Self-knowledge is the ever-present truth. I shall now describe to you the method of Yoga.

'''''Yoga Vasistha''''' ({{lang-sa|योग-वासिष्ठ}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{transl|sa|Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha}}'') is a philosophical text attributed to [[Valmiki]], but the real author is unknown.&lt;ref name=chappleix/&gt; The complete text contains over 29,000 verses.&lt;ref name=chappleix&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short version of the text is called ''Laghu Yogavasistha'' and contains 6,000 verses.&lt;ref name="Leslie2003-105"/&gt; The exact century of its completion is unknown, but has been estimated to be somewhere between 6th-century to as late as 14th-century, but it is likely that a version of the text existed in the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is named after sage Vasistha who is mentioned and revered in the seventh book of the [[Rigveda]], and who was called as the first sage of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hindu philosophy by [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is structured as a discourse of sage [[Vasistha]] to Prince [[Rama]]. The text consists of six books.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt; The first book presents Rama's frustration with the nature of life, human suffering and disdain for the world.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt; The second describes, through the character of Rama, the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt; The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life, one that requires self-effort, and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt; These two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521047791}}, pages 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual, while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt;

The date or century of the text's composition or compilation is unknown, and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature, other schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name=chappleix/&gt; Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era, but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second. Estimates range, states Chapple, from "as early as the sixth or seventh century, to as late as the fourteenth century".&lt;ref name=chappleix/&gt;&lt;ref name=thomi107/&gt;

The surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name, suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established, or about 5th-century.&lt;ref name=chappleixf&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-x with footnote 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of a version of the text in 14th- to 15th-century into Persian, has been the basis of the other limit, among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt;

Atreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara]], because it does not use their terminology, but does mention many Buddhist terms.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt; Dasgupta, a contemporary of Atreya, states that the text includes verses of earlier text, such as its III.16.50 is identical to one found in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava, thus the text must be placed after the 5th-century.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt; Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in [[Advaita Vedanta]] of Adi Shankara, but neither mention the other, which probably means that the author(s) of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara, placing the text in about 7th- to early 8th-century.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt; The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda, who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th- or 10th-century.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt;

===Evolving text theory===
Mainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time. The first work, states Mainkar, was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an [[Upanishad]] with Brahamanical ideas, a work that is lost.&lt;ref name=chapplex/&gt; This text was, suggests Mainkar, was expanded into ''[[Moksopaya]]'' in or after 6th-century, which is now commonly known as ''Laghu-Yogavasistha''.&lt;ref name=chapplex&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|p=x-xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Laghu'' (shorter) version was then expanded into the full editions, over time, in the centuries that followed the completion of ''Laghu-Yogavasistha''.&lt;ref name=chapplex/&gt; The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the ''Laghu-Yogavasistha'' edition, states Mainkar, while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism, particularly the Trika school, were added to the growing version by the 12th-century.&lt;ref name=chapplex/&gt; Similar serial expansion, revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature. Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkar's theory on Yoga Vasistha's chronology.&lt;ref name=thomi107&gt;Peter Thomi (1983), The Yogavasistha in its longer and shorter version, Journal of Indian philosophy, volume 11, number 1, pages 107-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Moksopaya]]'' (or ''Moksopaya Shastra'') has been dated to have been composed in [[Srinagar]] in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Slaje, Walter. (2005).

==Author==
The text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki, the author of [[Ramayana]]. Scholars seriously doubt the larger version of the text was authored by Valmiki, and consider the attribution as a mark of modest respect and reverence for him in the Hindu tradition by the actual unknown author(s) or compiler(s).&lt;ref name=chappleix/&gt;

The author of the shorter version, the ''Laghu-Yogavasistha'', is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir.&lt;ref name=chappleixf/&gt;

==Structure==
{{Hindu scriptures}}
The text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses, but similar message. The full editions contain over 29,000,&lt;ref name=chappleix/&gt; to a few with 32,000 verses,&lt;ref name="Leslie2003-105"/&gt; and in some editions about 36,000 verses.&lt;ref name=aiyer8&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, page 8 with footnote&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir (son of [[Jayanta Bhatta]]) is ''Laghu'' ("Little") ''Yogavasistha'' and contains 6,000 verses.&lt;ref name="Leslie2003-105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|2003|pp=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature, called ''Grantha''.&lt;ref name=aiyer8/&gt; In this genre, each Shloka (verse) in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables, while conveying its message.&lt;ref name=aiyer8/&gt; A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter, set to specific [[Raga]] music. This genre is found in [[Bhakti movement]] literature, and Yoga Vasistha's Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism, whose primary scripture is called ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Opinder jit Kaur Takhar (2005), Sikh Identity: An Exploration of Groups Among Sikhs, Ashgate, {{ISBN|9780754652021}}, page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|
The Yoga-vasistha is throughout a philosophical work, in the form of popular lectures, and the same idea is often repeated again and again in various kinds of expressions and poetical imagery. But the writer seems to have been endowed with extraordinary poetical gifts. Almost every verse is full of finest poetical imagery; the choice of words is exceedingly pleasing to the ear.

The ''Yoga Vasistha'' is a [[syncretism|syncretic]] work, containing elements of [[Vedanta]], [[Yoga]], [[Samkhya]], [[Saiva Siddhanta]], [[Jainism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], thus making it, according to Chapple, "a Hindu text ''par excellence'', including, as does Hinduism, a mosaic-style amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions".&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and an important text of [[Yoga]]. It consists of [[Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasistha|numerous short stories and anecdotes]] used to help illustrate its ideas and message. The text shows the influence of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Trika|Saivite Trika]] school.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-x-xi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[Hindu mythology]], the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the ''[[Ramayana]]''.

The traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation. The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great, enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation.{{sfn|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-xv}} The text discusses consciousness, cosmology, nature of the universe and consciousness, the ultimate dissolution of body, the [[liberty|liberation]] of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|soul]] and the non-dual nature of existence.{{sfn|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-xv}}

===On who is ready for spiritual knowledge===

#Has ''Mumukshatawa'', that is longing for meaning in life and liberation

===On the process of spiritual knowledge===
''Yoga Vasistha'' teachings are divided into six parts: dispassion, qualifications of the seeker, creation, existence, dissolution and liberation. It sums up the spiritual process in the seven ''Bhoomikas'':{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
# ''Śubhecchā'' (longing for the Truth): The yogi (or ''sādhaka'') rightly distinguishes between permanent and impermanent; cultivates dislike for worldly pleasures; acquires mastery over his physical and mental faculties; and feels a deep yearning to be free from ''Saṃsāra''.
# ''Vicāraṇa'' (right inquiry): The yogi has pondered over what he or she has read and heard, and has realized it in his or her life.
# ''Tanumānasa'' (attenuation – or thinning out – of mental activities): The mind abandons the many, and remains fixed on the One.
# ''Sattvāpatti'' (attainment of ''[[sattva]]'', "reality"): The Yogi, at this stage, is called ''Brahmavid'' ("knower of Brahman"). In the previous four stages, the yogi is subject to ''sañcita'', ''Prārabdha'' and ''Āgamī'' forms of karma. He or she has been practicing ''Samprajñāta Samādhi'' (contemplation), in which the consciousness of duality still exists.
# ''Asaṃsakti'' (unaffected by anything): The yogi (now called ''Brahmavidvara'') performs his or her necessary duties, without a sense of involvement.
# ''Padārtha abhāvana'' (sees Brahman everywhere): External things do not appear to exist to the yogi (now called ''Brahmavidvarīyas''); in essence there is a non-cognition of 'objects' as the separation between subject and a distinct object is dissolved; and tasks get performed without any sense of agency (doership). ''Sañcita'' and ''Āgamī'' karma are now destroyed; only a small amount of ''Prārabdha'' karma remains.
# ''Turīya'' (perpetual ''samādhi''): The yogi is known as ''Brahmavidvariṣṭha'' and does not perform activities, either by his will or the promptings of others.

===On liberation===
In Chapter 2 of Book VI, titled as ''The story of Iksvaku'', the text explains the state of [[moksha|nirvana]] (liberation) as follows, "Liberation is peace. Liberation is extinction of all conditioning. Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical, psychological and psychic distress. This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light. To one who has attained self-knowledge, this world does not appear as [[samsara]], but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Swami Venkatesananda (1993), Vasistha's Yoga, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791413647}}, page 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Jivanmukta===
The Yoga Vasistha describes the ''Jivanmukta'', or liberated person, as follows (abridged from the 1896 translation by KN Aiyer):
* He associates with the wise. He has reached the state of mind, which sees happiness everywhere. To him, neither sacrificial fires, nor Tapas, nor bounteous gifts nor holy waters have any meaning. He is replete with wisdom and friendly to all.&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, pages 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;
* He is desireless and in his eyes there is nothing supernatural. His state is indescribable and yet he will move in the world like anybody else. His mind will not be bound by any longings after [[Karma]]s. He will be indifferent to joy or pains arising from good or bad results. He will preserve a pleasant position in the happy enjoyment of whatever he obtains.&lt;ref name=aiyer110&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, pages 110-111, 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;
* He is never affected by anything, whether he is in a state of Jiva consciousness or state of Shiva devoid of the Jiva consciousness.&lt;ref name=aiyer110/&gt;
* He is same whether he moves in a family or is a solitary recluse.&lt;ref name=aiyer110/&gt;
* He feels unbound by the delusions of Srutis and Smritis.&lt;ref name=aiyer110/&gt;
* Nothing matters to him, he is unaffected by griefs or pleasures. He is distant, he is close, he in the one Reality of Atman.&lt;ref name=aiyer110/&gt; He is neither clingy nor arrogant.&lt;ref name=aiyer349/&gt;
* He has no fear of anyone, no anger against anyone.&lt;ref name=aiyer349&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, pages 349-350, 701-703&lt;/ref&gt;
* When the attraction towards external objects ceases, then there yet remains the internal craving which is called Trishna (thirst). The Jivanmukta is beyond Trishna. He is, not becoming. He does not even long for salvation. He is content.&lt;ref name=aiyer349/&gt;
* A Jivanmukta will always transact his present duties, but neither longs for things in the future, nor ruminates upon things of the past.&lt;ref name=aiyer466/&gt;
* He is a child amongst children; as old men amongst the old; as the puissant amongst the puissant; as a youth amongst the young, compassionate and understanding with the grieved.&lt;ref name=aiyer466&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, pages 466-467&lt;/ref&gt;
* In him is found nobleness, benevolence, love, clearness of intellect.&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyer (1975), Laghu Yoga Vasishta, Theosophical Publishing House, Original Author: Abhinanda, {{ISBN|978-0835674973}}, pages 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;

The propositions were so logical, the verse is so beautiful, and the exposition is so thorough and penetrating that the soul loses itself in raptures over it. Such a fine combination of philosophy and poetry is a gift reserved only for Sanskrit poets"
:*"When I used to be lost in the reading of the Yoga Vashistha, the coil of rope I was weaving dropped automatically from my hands; and, for hours on end I lost the sense of possessing the body and the senses associated with that body. My foot would not move and my hand was at a stand still. I felt the deeper yearning to surrender it all. All propaganda, all work seemed such a worthless task, a sheer waste of life. At last the mind and the matter asserted their sway over the body and swung it back to work again"

The practice of ''atma-vichara'', "self-enquiry," described in the ''Yoga Vasistha'', has been popularised due to the influence of Ramana Maharshi, who was strongly influenced by this text.{{sfn|friesen|2006|p=95-100}}
