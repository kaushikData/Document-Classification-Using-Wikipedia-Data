      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2277">'''ALOPEX''' (an acronym from "'''''AL'''gorithms '''O'''f '''P'''attern '''EX'''traction''") is a correlation based machine learning algorithm first proposed by [[Evangelia Micheli-Tzanakou|Tzanakou]] and Harth in 1974.

==Principle==
In [[machine learning]], the goal is to train a system to minimize a cost function or (referring to ALOPEX) a response function.  Many training algorithms, such as [[backpropagation]], have an inherent susceptibility to getting "stuck" in local minima or maxima of the response function.  ALOPEX uses a cross-correlation of differences and a stochastic process to overcome this in an attempt to reach the absolute minimum (or maximum) of the response function.

==Method==
ALOPEX, in its simplest form is defined by an updating equation:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ W_{ij}(n) = \gamma\ \Delta\ W_{ij}(n-1) \Delta\ R(n) + r_i(n) &lt;/math&gt; 

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; is the iteration or time-step.
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ W_{ij}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the current and previous value of system variable &lt;math&gt;\ W_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; at iteration &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ R(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the current and previous value of the response function &lt;math&gt;\ R,&lt;/math&gt; at iteration &lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the learning rate parameter &lt;math&gt;(\gamma\ &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;R, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\ &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; maximizes &lt;math&gt;R \ )&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;r_i(n) \sim\ N(0,\sigma\ ^2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Discussion==
Essentially, ALOPEX changes each system variable &lt;math&gt;W_{ij}(n)&lt;/math&gt; based on a product of: the previous change in the variable &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;W_{ij}(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;, the resulting change in the cost function &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;R(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and the learning rate parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Further, to find the absolute minimum (or maximum), the stochastic process &lt;math&gt;r_{ij}(n)&lt;/math&gt; (Gaussian or other) is added to stochastically "push" the algorithm out of any local minima.

'''Sheikh Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah''' (1895 – 24 November 1965) ({{lang-ar|عبد الله الثالث السالم الصباح}}الشيخ  الشيخ)  was the 11th ruler of kuwait, the first [[Emir of Kuwait|Emir]] of the [[State of Kuwait]], and [[Commander-in-chief]] of [[Kuwait Military Forces]] from 29 January 1950 until his death. He was the eldest son of [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]]. As the eleventh ruler of the [[al-Sabah|Al Sabah]] dynasty in Kuwait, he took power after the death of his cousin Sheikh [[Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]]. He also ruled as regent upon the death of his father until the election of Sheikh Ahmad. The anniversary of his coronation, 25 February, serves as Kuwait's [[national day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/national-and-liberation-days/ |title=National and liberation days |date=2015-02-26 |work=Kuwait Times |access-date=2018-02-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his predecessors, he was more pro-Arab than pro-British. He effectively ended the British "[[protectorate]]" status of Kuwait by signing a treaty with the [[United Kingdom|British]] on 19 June 1961. He is regarded as the founder of modern Kuwait. He introduced the [[Constitution of Kuwait]] in 1962, followed by the [[National Assembly of Kuwait|Parliament]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Kuwait/kuwait15.htm The Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim died two years later after suffering from a heart attack and was succeeded by his half-brother, Sheikh [[Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah]]. He was also the father of Sheikh [[Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah|Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah]], who ruled briefly in January 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Kuwait/kuwait15.htm The Royal Ark, ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:ar:خالد العبد الله السالم الصباح|Sheikh Khalid Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah]], and [[:ar:علي العبد الله السالم الصباح|Sheikh Ali Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah]], who is a governor.

'''Abundius of Umbria''' (died 303) was a [[deacon]] and [[martyr]] during the [[Diocletian persecution]].

==Biography==
He was the grandson of [[Anastasius of Antioch (martyr)|Anastasius]]&lt;!--presumably the one martyred with [[Julian and Basilissa]] rather than [[Anastasius the Fuller]]?? --&gt;, and accompanied him and others from [[Syria]] to [[Umbria]], where he was martyred.

No specific [[feast day]] in his name is known.

As noted above, Thicke lent his name and star power to supporting the Alan Thicke Center for diabetes research. Also, for several years in the mid-1980s, Thicke and Gloria Loring were co-hosts of [[Telemiracle]], an annual 20-hour [[telethon]] that alternated between [[Saskatoon]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] to support programs run by the [[Kinsmen Club]].

==Personal life==
Thicke was married three times: His first marriage, to ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' actress [[Gloria Loring]], lasted from 1970 until around 1984; they had two sons, Brennan and [[Robin Thicke|Robin]].&lt;ref name="filmref"/&gt; He started dating actress [[Kristy Swanson]] when she was 17 years old in 1986 and got engaged to her two years later when he was 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/people/alan-thicke/|title=Alan Thicke|work=[[TV.com]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|location=San Francisco|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married his second wife, [[Miss World 1990]] [[Gina Tolleson]], on August 13, 1994, and had a son, Carter William Thicke, before their divorce was finalized on September 29, 1999.&lt;ref name="filmref"/&gt; In 1999, he met [[Tanya Callau]] in Miami, where he was a celebrity host and she was a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/22102-how-did-unusually-thicke-couple-alan-and-tanya-thicke-meet-the-storys-not-so-sweet|title=How Did 'Unusually Thicke' Couple Alan and Tanya Thicke Meet?

==Death==
On December 13, 2016, Thicke collapsed while playing ice-hockey with his son Carter at Pickwick Gardens in [[Burbank, California]]. The manager of the rink said he was talking and even joked to his son to take a photo as he was being wheeled out on a stretcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-alan-thicke-dies-hockey-burbank-20161214-story.html| title= Alan Thicke collapsed playing ice hockey in Burbank, joked with son before his death | work= Los Angeles Times| date= December 14, 2016| first= Veronica| last= Rocha| access-date= December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thicke died of type-A [[aortic dissection]] at the [[Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center]] in Burbank, at the age of 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dugan|first=Christina|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-alanthicke-idUSKBN14306R|title=Alan Thicke's Cause of Death Has Been Confirmed|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=December 22, 2016|date=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cites cause. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Skinner| first= Curtis| title=Actor Alan Thicke, dad on ''Growing Pains'', dead at 69|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-alanthicke-idUSKBN14306R |publisher=[[Reuters]]|location=San Francisco|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cites location. --&gt; On December 19, 2016, the cast of ''Growing Pains'' including [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] reunited at Thicke's funeral; an eulogy was given by his friend [[Bob Saget]], and his son Robin offered a humorous remembrance.

'''Anne Christine of Sulzbach, Princess of Piedmont''' (Anne ''Christine'' Louise; 5 February 1704 &amp;ndash; 12 March 1723), also called '''Christine of the Palatinate''', was a princess of the [[Bavarian Circle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and first wife of [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont]], heir to the throne of the kingdom of Sardinia. She died during childbirth at the age of 19.

==Biography==
Anne Christine Louise was born a [[Count Palatine|Countess Palatine]] of [[Sulzbach-Rosenberg|Sulzbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00022589&amp;tree=LEO|title=Pfalzgräfin Anna Christiane Luise von Sulzbach|accessdate=1 December 2009|last=Pas|first=Leo van de|work=Genealogics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of [[Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach|Theodore Eustace, Prince Palatine of Sulzbach]] (1659–1732), the head of a Roman Catholic [[cadet branch]] of Bavaria's [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty, and [[Eleonore Maria Amalie of Hesse-Rheinfels|Princess Eleonore of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg]] (1675-1720), daughter of [[William, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg]].&lt;ref name="huberty"&gt;{{cite book | title=’’L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome IV – Wittelsbach’’ | publisher=Laballery |author1=Huberty, Michel |author2=Giraud, Alain |author3=Magdelaine, F. and B. | year=1985 | location=France | pages=82, 141, 166, 202, 273, 310–311| isbn=2-901138-04-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had married in 1692, Anne Christine being their eighth child.&lt;ref name="huberty"/&gt;

Christine's older brother [[John Christian, Count Palatine of Sulzbach|John Christian]] (1700-1733) succeeded their father as Prince Palatine, also becoming [[Margrave]] ''[[jure uxoris]]'' of [[Bergen op Zoom|Berg-op-Zoom]]: His son, [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]], was the last of the senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach.&lt;ref name="huberty"/&gt; Her older sister [[Countess Palatine Francisca Christina of Sulzbach|Francisca Christina]] became [[Prince-Abbot|Princes-Abbess]] of [[Thorn Abbey|Thorn]] and, later, of the more important [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] convent of [[Essen Abbey|Essen]].&lt;ref name="huberty"/&gt; Christine was a first cousin of her husband's subsequent wife [[Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg|Polyxena of Hesse, Queen consort of Sardinia]], of [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Caroline of Hesse, Princess de Condé]], and of [[Landgravine Christine Henriette of Hesse-Rotenburg|Christine of Hesse, Princess di Carignano]].&lt;ref name="huberty"/&gt;

On 15 March 1722 at [[Vercelli]], she married Charles Emmanuel of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Prince of Piedmont]] and later [[King of Sardinia]] as [[Charles Emmanuel III]]. He was the second son of [[Victor Amadeus II]], Duke of Savoy, King of Sardinia and [[Anne Marie d'Orléans]] and had been heir apparent to the Savoyard throne since 1715 at the death of [[Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont]]. The following year, she gave birth to a son who was created the [[Duke of Aosta]]. She died a few days later on 12 March 1723 at the age of nineteen in Turin. Her only child died in 1725 in his second year, thus she left no direct descendants.

'''Anne of Austria''' (16 August 1573 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1598) was [[queen consort]] of [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]] by marriage to King [[Sigismund III Vasa]].

==Biography==
Anne was a daughter of [[Charles II of Austria]] and [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (Archduchess of Austria)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]]. Her paternal grandparents were [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anne of Bohemia and Hungary|Anne of Bohemia]] (1503&amp;ndash;1547), daughter of King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] and his wife [[Anne of Foix-Candale]]. 

Anne became the first wife of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund of Poland]] on 31 May 1592. This marriage was opposed by many nobles ([[szlachta]]) of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], who were opposed to the alliance with the Austrian Habsburgs that Sigismund pursued.

When Sigismund sent a [[diplomatic mission]], led by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Radziwill]], to [[Prague]] for his bride, the anti-Habsburg party with [[chancellor]] [[Jan Zamoyski]] guarded the borders to prevent the Archduchess from entering the country. Anne evaded the guards, arrived in [[Kraków]] and was [[coronation|crowned]] in May 1592 by [[Primas]] [[Stanislaw Karnkowski|Karnkowski]] as the Queen of Poland. Later, during her lifetime, the capital of the Commonwealth was moved from Kraków to [[Warsaw]].

In 1594, she followed her spouse to Sweden, where she was crowned as the Queen of Sweden in [[Uppsala]] the 19 February. The Poles demanded that she leave her daughter behind her as security in Poland during their stay in Sweden, and she was afraid that the Swedes would demand the same when she returned to Poland, if she gave birth during her stay in Sweden. 19 April 1594, she gave birth to a daughter, whose baptism was elaborately celebrated at the Swedish court, but the child died soon after. During her stay in Sweden, she became involved in a conflict with Dowager Queen [[Gunilla Bielke]], partially for religious reasons. She accused Gunilla for having stolen valuables from the Royal Palace. She was regarded as quite polite but distant and depressive during her stay. She did not speak Swedish, and she regarded the Swedish people as [[Heresy|heretic]]s and rebels and only showed herself in public when she was forced to. At her departure from Sweden in July 1594, she was granted [[Linköping]], [[Söderköping]] and [[Stegeborg]] on the condition that she respect the Protestant belief within these feifs.      

Anne died on 10 February 1598 in Warsaw as a result of haemorrhage during the birth of her last child, who also died then. Sigismund III then married her sister [[Constance of Austria|Constance Renate of Habsburg]].

==Issue==
Anna had five children, but only Władysław lived to become an adult:
#Anna Maria (23 May 1593 &amp;ndash; 9 February 1600)
#Catherine (19 April 1594 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1594)
#[[Wladislaus IV of Poland|Władysław]] (9 June 1595 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1648), (reigned 1632-1648 as Władysław IV of Poland)
#Catherine (27 September 1596 &amp;ndash; 2 June 1597)
#Christopher (10 February 1598 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1598)

'''Ape Action Africa''' is a [[non-profit]] [[NGO]] founded in 1996 dedicated to the conservation of [[Endangered species|endangered]] [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, threatened by the [[Bushmeat|bushmeat trade]] in Central and West Africa. Ape Action Africa manages the rescue and rehabilitation of [[Hominidae|Great apes]] across much of [[Cameroon]], with a large [[sanctuary]] in the [[Mefou forest]]. With more than 300 [[primates]] in its care, Ape Action Africa is now one of the largest [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] projects of its kind in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=CWAF and Ape Action Africa | url=http://www.apeactionafrica.org/about-us | publisher=Ape Action Africa | date= | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the animals arrive at the sanctuary as orphans, mainly due to the illegal bushmeat trade, which has grown in recent years as a result of [[deforestation]] of the Cameroonian jungle.

At the frontline of the organisation is [[Rachel Hogan]], originally from [[Birmingham]], who now lives full-time in the jungle.

Ape Action Africa is featured in the 2006 TV series ''[[Going Ape]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Going Ape | url=http://www.yourdiscovery.com/web/animalplanet/going-ape/?page=2 | publisher=Animal Planet | date= | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2010, one of the founding directors of Ape Action Africa, Avi Sivan, died in a helicopter crash while travelling between the cities of Douala and Yaoundé in Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Stuart Carter | title=Letter from Chair of Trustees | url=http://www.apeactionafrica.org/avi | publisher=Ape Action Africa | date= | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Ex-IDF officer killed in Cameroon crash | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3988506,00.html | work=Ynet News| date=23 November 2010  | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Ex-IDF top officer, Avi Sivan, killed in Cameroon helicopter: | url=http://news.cameroon-today.com/cameroon-helicopter-crash-ex-israel-defense-forces-idf-top-officer-killed/1975/ | work=Cameroon Today | date=22 November 2010 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 2010, the board of trustees of the charity announced Rachel Hogan as the new Director and Bibila Tafon (Babs) as the new Manager of the [[Mefou National Park]].

On 24 April 2014, the Dublin premiere of the film [[Tarzan (2013 film)|Tarzan]] was in aid of Ape Action Africa, supported by the lead, [[Kellan Lutz]], who is himself interested in conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=TARZAN - Interview with lead actor Kellan Lutz |url=http://www.movies.ie/interviews/1197854/tarzan__interview_with_lead_actor_kellan_lutz |work=Movies.ie |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503104852/http://www.movies.ie/Interviews/1197854/TARZAN__Interview_with_lead_actor_Kellan_Lutz |archivedate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Ape Action Africa was established in 1996 as a UK charity called CWAF, or Cameroon Wildlife Aid Fund, and its primary objective was to improve living conditions for primates housed at [[Mvog-Betsi Zoo]] in [[Yaoundé]], Cameroon. During 12 years of operation, CWAF expanded its mission significantly to provide sanctuary for wild orphans of the illegal bushmeat and pet trades in Cameroon.

The [[Charitable organization|charity]] has long been associated with [[Bristol Zoo]], sharing some trustees with the Clifton charity. It is also supported by local businesses and several celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mendipmedia.co.uk/news/new-video-shows-butchery-of-bushmeat-trade Mendip Media - Bushmeat video]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirandak.co.uk Miranda Krestovnikoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWAF rebranded as Ape Action Africa in 2008 and now uses email campaigns and Facebook to communicate with supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.causes.com/causes/147677 Causes - Ape Action Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ape Action is a member of the [[Pan African Sanctuary Alliance]] (PASA).

==Rachel Hogan, Director==
Rachel Hogan arrived at the charity in 2001 on a three-month volunteer placement. She was about to leave for home when a two-week-old gorilla arrived and Rachel stayed to hand rear him. She has been in Cameroon ever since. Her role in the project developed and when Avi and Talila Sivan were appointed directors in 2003, she was appointed manager of Mefou National Park.

During her tenure as manager, Rachel has been a key part of the team that has transformed Mefou into one of the largest, best known primate conservation charities in Africa. The Sivans have overseen vast improvements in the enclosures, veterinary care, transport, security and infrastructure at Mefou. Rachel has worked closely with Talila on a daily basis, resulting in her development from a volunteer with a single-minded animal focus to a confident manager, driven by her passion for primates.

==Bibila Tafon (Babs), Manager - Mefou National Park==
Babila Tafon has worked for Ape Action Africa since its inception 14 years ago as CWAF and became manager of our team working with the primates in Mvog Betsi Zoo in Yaoundé in 2003. He has developed the veterinary team over the years and he now has two veterinary technicians to assist him in providing excellent veterinary care to hundreds of primates. Tafon regularly attends the PASA (Pan African Sanctuaries Alliance) vet workshops and he has travelled to the US and the UK for vet conferences and training.

==Volunteer programme==

Ape Action Africa offers a limited number of self-funded volunteer placements for one- to three-months in the Mefou National Park in Cameroon to people aged over 21 with a passion for primate conservation and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apeactionafrica.org/get-involved/volunteer Ape Action Africa - volunteer programme]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Ape Action Africa volunteer programme | url=http://www.pasaprimates.org/ape-action-africa/ | publisher=Pan African Sanctuary Alliance | year=2011 | accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Araucaria araucana''''' (commonly called the '''monkey puzzle tree''', '''monkey tail tree''', piñonero, or '''Chilean pine''') is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] growing to 1–1.5 m (3–5&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter and 30–40&amp;nbsp;m (100–130&amp;nbsp;ft) in height. It is native to central and southern [[Chile]],  western [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Araucaria-araucana.htm Native areas], Kew Royal Botanic Gardens. Retrieved: 2012-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Araucaria araucana'' is the hardiest species in the [[Pinophyta|conifer]] genus ''[[Araucaria]]''. Because of the longevity of this species, it is described as a [[living fossil]]. It is also the [[list of national trees|national tree]] of Chile. Its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the IUCN in 2013 due to the dwindling population caused by logging, forest fires, and grazing.&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Premoli, A. |author2=Quiroga, P. |author3=Gardner, M. | title = ''Araucaria araucana'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2013 | page = e.T31355A2805113 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2013 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/31355/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T31355A2805113.en | access-date = 9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Zweig der Andentannne.JPG|thumb|left|The leaves of the ''Araucaria araucana'']]
[[File:A young Araucaria araucana.jpg|thumb|A young Araucaria araucana specimen ]]
The [[leaf|leaves]] are thick, tough, and scale-like, triangular, {{convert|3|–|4|cm|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|–|3|cm|abbr=on}} broad at the base, and with sharp edges and tips, rather similar to the leaves of the unrelated [[succulent]] plant, [[Crassula muscosa]]. According to Lusk, The leaves have an ''average'' lifespan of 24 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lusk|first1=Christopher H.|title=Leaf life spans of some conifers of the temperate forests of South America|journal=Revista Chilena de Historia Natural|date=2001|volume=74|issue=3|pages=711–718|url=http://rchn.biologiachile.cl/pdfs/2001/3/Lusk_2001.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so cover most of the tree except for the older branches.

It is usually [[dioecious]], with the male and female [[Conifer cone|cones]] on separate trees, though occasional individuals bear cones of both sexes. The male (pollen) cones are oblong and cucumber-shaped, {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on}} long at first, expanding to {{convert|8|–|12|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|5|–|6|cm|abbr=on}} broad at pollen release. It is wind pollinated. The female (seed) cones, which mature in autumn about 18 months after pollination, are globose, large, {{convert|12|–|20|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and hold about 200 seeds. The cones disintegrate at maturity to release the {{convert|3|–|4|cm|abbr=on}} long [[nut (fruit)|nut]]-like seeds.

The thick bark of ''Araucaria araucana'' may be an adaptation to [[wildfire]].&lt;ref name=SanmayDonoso95&gt;{{cite book |last=Veblen |first=Thomas T.|last2=Kitzberger |first2=Thomas|last3=Burns |first3=Bruce R.|last4=Rebertus |first4=Alan J.|author-link1=Thomas T.

== Habitat ==
[[File:Araucana ubicacion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Distribution map of ''A. araucana'' in central Chile]]
Its native habitat is the lower slopes of the Chilean and Argentinian south-central [[Andes]], typically above {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. Juvenile trees exhibit a broadly pyramidal or conical habit which naturally develops into the distinctive umbrella form of mature specimens as the tree ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/syllabi/308/Old/Lists/second%20ed/Araucariaaraucana.pdf | title=Landscape Plants For Texas And Environs 3rd | chapter=Araucaria Araucana | publisher=[[Aggie Horticulture]] | author=Michael A. Arnold | year=2004 | isbn=1588747468}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic, volcanic [[soil]], but will tolerate almost any soil type provided it drains well.

== Seed dispersal ==
''Araucaria araucana'' is a [[Mast (botany)|masting]] species, and rodents are important consumers and dispersers of its seeds. The long-haired grass mouse, ''[[Abrothrix longipilis]]'', is the most important animal responsible for dispersing the seeds of ''A.{{nbsp}}araucana''. This rodent buries seeds whole in locations favorable for seed germination, unlike other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, J.D. &amp; R.S. Ditgen, 2013. Rodent handling of ''Araucaria araucana'' seeds. ''[[Austral Ecology]]'', 38: 23–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
Logging, long a major threat, was finally banned in 1990.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globaltrees.org/threatened-trees/trees/monkey-puzzle/|title=Monkey Puzzle|work=Global Trees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large fires burned thousands of acres of Araucaria forest in 2001–2002,&lt;ref name=global /&gt; and areas of national parks have also burned, destroying trees over 1300 years old.&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt; Overgrazing and [[invasive species|invasive trees]] are also threats.&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt;&lt;ref name=global /&gt; Extensive human harvesting of piñones (Araucaria seeds) can prevent new trees from growing.&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt; A [[Global Trees Campaign]] project that planted 2000 trees found a 90{{nbsp}}percent 10-year survival rate.&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

== Cultivation and uses{{anchor|Cultivation}}{{anchor|Uses}} ==
''Araucaria araucana'' is a popular garden tree, planted for the unusual effect of its thick, "reptilian" branches with very symmetrical appearance. It prefers temperate climates with abundant rainfall, tolerating temperatures down to about {{convert|-20|C}}. It is far and away the hardiest member of its genus, and can grow well in western [[Europe]] (north to the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Smøla (island)|Smøla]]&lt;ref name="Palms in Scandinavia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scanpalm.no/araucaria_english.html |title=Araucaria araucana in Ålesund, Norway |publisher=Scanpalm |accessdate=27 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009232055/http://www.scanpalm.no/araucaria_english.html |archivedate=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in western [[Norway]]), the west coast of [[North America]] (north to the islands of [[Haida Gwaii]] in [[Canada]]), and locally on the east coast, as well as [[Long Island]], and in [[New Zealand]] and southeastern [[Australia]]. It is tolerant of coastal [[salt spray]], but does not tolerate exposure to [[pollution]].

[[File:Piñones de araucaria cocinados.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The piñones are similar to [[pine nuts]], but larger; these roasted seeds are 3&amp;nbsp;cm and 5&amp;nbsp;cm long, from two different [[cultivars]]. ]]
Its piñones, or seeds,&lt;ref name=global /&gt; are edible, similar to large [[pine nut]]s, and are harvested by indigenous peoples in Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, L., F. Izquierdo, L.J. Sanguinetti, A. Pinna, G. Siffredi, J. Ayesa, C. Lopez, A. Pelliza, N. Strizler, M. Gonzales Peñalba, L. Maresca and L. Chauchard. 2004. ''Araucaria araucana'' forest genetic resources in Argentina. Pages 105-132 in Barbara Vinceti, Weber Amaral and Brien Meilleur (eds). Challenges in managing forest genetic resources for livelihoods: examples from Argentina and Brazil. [[International Plant Genetic Resources Institute]]. 271 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The tree has some potential to be a food crop in other areas in the future, thriving in climates with cool oceanic summers, e.g., western [[Scotland]], where other nut crops do not grow well. A group of six female trees with one male for pollination could yield several thousand seeds per year. Since the cones drop, harvesting is easy. The tree, however, does not yield seeds until it is around 30 to 40 years old, which discourages investment in planting orchards (although yields at maturity can be immense); once established, it can live possibly as long as 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;(Gymnosperm Database).&lt;/ref&gt;

Once valued because of its long, straight trunk, its current rarity and vulnerable status mean its [[wood]] is now rarely used; it is also sacred to some members of the [[Mapuche]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Anna Lewington| author2= Edward Parker| last-author-amp= yes | title=Ancient Trees| publisher=[[Collins &amp; Brown]] | year=1999|pages= | isbn=1-85585-974-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tree became protected by law in 1971, lumber mills in [[Araucanía Region]] specialized in Chilean pine.  This species is listed in the [[CITES Appendix I]] as an [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |title=Appendices I, II and III |author= |date= |work=[[CITES]] |publisher=[[UNEP]] |accessdate=8 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317013927/http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |archivedate=17 March 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossils called [[Whitby]] [[Jet (lignite)]] used in jewelry, are derived from fossilized Monkey Puzzle trees.

== Discovery and naming ==
[[File:Noche_estrellada_sobre_una_araucaria.jpg|thumb|The silhouette of the araucaria is very recognizable and has become a symbol for the southern regions of Argentina and Chile. For example, araucarias appear on the coats of arms of [[Neuquén Province]] and [[Araucanía Region]].]]
First identified by Europeans in Chile in the 1780s,&lt;ref&gt;The tree was first mentioned in 1780 by the Spaniard Francisco Dendariarena. See:

The name ''araucana'' is derived from the native [[Mapuche|Araucanians]] who used the nuts (seeds) of the tree in Chile. A group of Araucanians living in the Andes, the [[Pehuenche]]s, owe their name to their diet based on harvesting of the ''A. araucaria'' seeds. ''Pehuen'' means ''Araucaria'' and ''che'' means people in [[Mapudungun]].

The origin of the popular English language name "monkey puzzle" derives from its early cultivation in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in about 1850, when the species was still very rare in gardens and not widely known. [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]], the proud owner of a young specimen at [[Pencarrow (mansion)|Pencarrow]] garden near [[Bodmin]] in [[Cornwall]], was showing it to a group of friends, one of them – the noted barrister and [[Benthamist]] [[Charles Austin (lawyer)|Charles Austin]] –  remarked, "It would puzzle a monkey to climb that".&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2298f8dc-dfbf-11e2-9de6-00144feab7de.html#axzz3TPtSgOgB | title=Riddle of how the monkey puzzle tree came to be a UK favourite | work=[[Financial Times]]| authorlink = Matthew Wilson (gardener)| date=July 5, 2013 | accessdate=May 14, 2016 | author=Wilson, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the species had no existing popular name, first "monkey puzzler", then "monkey puzzle" stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author= Alan Mitchell| author-link= Alan Mitchell| title=Alan Mitchell's Trees of Britain| publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]] | year=1996|pages= | isbn=0-00-219972-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relatives ==
The nearest relative found is ''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'', a South American ''Araucaria'' from Brazil which differs in the width of the leaves. Also related to the Araucaria genus in the Pacific Islands and Australia, including Araucaria cunninghamii, Hoop Pine, Araucaria heterophylla the [[Norfolk Island pine]] and Araucaria bidwillii, Bunya Pine, in Australia.  The recently found 'Wollemi pine', ''[[Wollemia]]'', discovered in south-east Australia, is classed in the plant family Araucariaceae. Their common ancestry dates to a time when Australia, [[Antarctica]], and South America were linked by land — all three continents were once part of the [[supercontinent]] known as [[Gondwana]].

[[Yellow fever]], alongside [[malaria]], was a major obstacle in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].

==Classification==
In the past, arboviruses were organized into one of four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A denoted members of the genus ''Alphavirus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dalrymple | first1 = J.

==Signs and symptoms==
The incubation period - the time between when infection occurs and when symptoms appear - varies from virus to virus, but is usually limited between 2 and 15 days for arboviruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mostashari | first1 = F. | last2 = Bunning | first2 = M.

These symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, rash and fatigue. Rarely, vomiting and hemorrhagic fever may occur. The central nervous system can also be affected by infection, as encephalitis and meningitis are sometimes observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = L.

The very young, elderly, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies are more likely to develop severe symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
Preliminary diagnosis of arbovirus infection is usually based on clinical presentations of symptoms, places and dates of travel, activities, and epidemiological history of the location where infection occurred.&lt;ref name=cdcdiagnose &gt;{{cite web|title=Arboviral Diagnostic Testing|url=https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/diagnosis.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitive [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is typically made in a [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] by employing some combination of [[blood test]]s, particularly [[immunology|immunologic]], [[serology|serologic]] and/or [[virology|virologic]] techniques such as [[ELISA]],&lt;ref name=cdcdiagnose /&gt;&lt;ref name=arboantibody &gt;{{cite web|title=Arbovirus Antibodies Test|url=http://www.medicalhealthtests.com/pathology-test/arbovirus-antibodies-test-serum.html|date=March 27, 2012|publisher=Medical Health Tests|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Complement fixation test|complement fixation]],&lt;ref name="arboantibody" /&gt; [[polymerase chain reaction]],&lt;ref name="arboantibody" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = B. | last3 = Campbell | first3 = W. | last4 = Howard | first4 = J. | last5 = White | first5 = D. | year = 2001 | title = Detection of arboviral RNA directly from mosquito homogenates by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 94 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 121–128 | pmid = 11337046 | doi=10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plaque reduction neutralization test|neutralization test]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seawright|first1=G.

==Prevention==
[[Vector control]] measures, especially [[mosquito control]], are essential to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining [[swamp]]s and removal of other pools of [[Water stagnation|stagnant water]] (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. [[Insecticide]]s can be applied in [[Rural area|rural]] and [[Urban area|urban]] areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use of some of these chemicals is controversial, and some [[organophosphate]]s and [[organochloride]]s (such as [[DDT]]) have been banned in many countries. [[Infertility|Infertile]] male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas in order to reduce the breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. [[Larvicide]]s are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. [[Temefos]] is a common mosquito larvicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0160-7995(80)90034-9|pmid=7403901 |year=1980 |author1=Walsh |first1=J. A |title=Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part C: Medical Economics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=145–63 |last2=Warren |first2=K. S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mosquito net.jpg|thumb|Tent made of mosquito netting]]
People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under [[mosquito net]]s, wearing [[Personal protective equipment|protective clothing]], applying [[insect repellent]]s such as [[permethrin]] and [[DEET]] to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.&lt;ref name="ncarbo" &gt;{{cite web|title=Preventing Mosquito Bites|url=http://epi.publichealth.nc.gov/cd/arbo/prevent.html|publisher=North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccination===
Vaccines are available for the following arboviral diseases:
*Japanese encephalitis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, What You Need to Know|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-je-ixiaro.pdf|date=December 7, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Because the arboviral encephalitides are viral diseases, antibiotics are not an effective form of treatment and no effective antiviral drugs have yet been discovered. Treatment is supportive, attempting to deal with problems such as swelling of the brain, loss of the automatic breathing activity of the brain and other treatable complications like bacterial pneumonia.&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt;

Aspirin and ibuprofen should not be taken in cases of dengue fever as it could increase the risk of bleeding and cause [[Dengue]] Shock Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/human/en/ | title=WHO &amp;#124; the human}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Most arboviruses are located in tropical areas, however as a group they have a global distribution. The warm climate conditions found in tropical areas allows for year-round transmission by the arthropod vectors. Other important factors determining geographic distribution of arthropod vectors include rainfall, humidity, and vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0188-4409(02)00378-8 |pmid=12234522 |title=The Global Emergence/Resurgence of Arboviral Diseases As Public Health Problems |journal=Archives of Medical Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=330–42 |year=2002 |last1=Gubler |first1=Duane J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapping methods such as [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] have allowed for spatial and temporal analyses of arboviruses. Tagging cases or breeding sites geographically has allowed for deeper examination of vector transmission.&lt;ref name=pmid19951309&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1423-0410.2009.01286.x |pmid=19951309 |title=Transfusion-transmitted arboviruses |journal=Vox Sanguinis |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=495–503 |year=2010 |last1=Petersen |first1=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">'''Author profiling''' is a method of analyzing a given number of texts to try to uncover various characteristics of the [[author]] (e.g. age and gender) based on stylistic- and content-based features.

== Overview ==
&lt;p&gt;
Automatic Authorship Identification (AAI) has existed for almost 120 years. [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] was the first to examine works of [[Francis Bacon]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]] aiming to detect quantitative stylistic differences using word length.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Thomas Corwin. "The characteristic curves of composition." Science (1887): 237-249. &lt;/ref&gt; Since then, things have changed rapidly due to the development of technology.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
There are three major fields in AAI: authorship attribution, author identification, and author profiling. In the first two, the goal is to recognize the author from a set of authors, while in author profiling, the goal is to find specific characteristics of the author, based on stylistic- or content-based features.&lt;ref&gt;Mikros, George K., and Kostas Perifanos. "Authorship Attribution in Greek Tweets Using Author's Multilevel N-Gram Profiles." 2013 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stamatatos, Efstathios. "A survey of modern authorship attribution methods." Journal of the American Society for information Science and Technology 60.3 (2009): 538-556. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
The author profiling task is a yet unsolved problem, due to its difficulty. It has been studied by many researchers and, while some show great progress and good results, it still has many unexplored areas and room for improvement. Through the organizational efforts of PAN,{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2017}} many teams around the globe try every year to find the characteristics of authors.&lt;ref name="PAN2015"&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 3rd Author Profiling Task at PAN 2015." CLEF. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 2nd author profiling task at pan 2014." CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Vol. 1180. CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the author profiling task at pan 2013." CLEF Conference on Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access Evaluation. CELCT, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Characteristics vary between approaches, but age and gender are usually among them.&lt;ref name="argamon"&gt;Argamon, Shlomo, et al.

'''BabyX''' is a project of [[Auckland]]'s Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/animate-technologies.html|title=Laboratory for Animate Technologies|publisher=Abi.auckland.ac.nz|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the creation of a virtual animated baby that learns and reacts like a human baby. It uses the computer's cameras for "[[Visual perception|seeing]]" and microphones to "[[Listening behaviour types|listen]]" as the inputs. The computer uses [[Artificial intelligence]] algorithms for BabyX's "learning" and interpretation of the inputs (voice and image) to understand the situation. The result is a virtual toddler that can learn to read, [[Pattern recognition|recognize objects]] and "understand." The output is the baby's face that can "speak" and express its mood by facial expressions (such as smile and show embarrassment).

'''Beatrice of Luxembourg''' (1305 – 11 November 1319), was by birth member of the [[House of Luxembourg]] and by marriage Queen of Hungary. 

She was the youngest child of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife, [[Margaret of Brabant]]. Her two siblings were [[John of Luxembourg]] and [[Marie of Luxembourg, Queen of France]].

==Life==
At the time of his death (1313), Emperor Henry VII initiated the negotiations for a marriage between Beatrice and [[Charles, Duke of Calabria]], son and heir of King [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]], and also planned to marry again (his wife was already died in 1311) with [[Catherine of Austria, Duchess of Calabria|Catherine of Habsburg]]. Beatrice was called by her father to Italy, where she arrived with her paternal grandmother, [[Beatrice d'Avesnes]]. The marriage plans with the Duke of Calabria failed, and the Emperor began negotiations for a marriage with [[Peter II of Sicily|Prince Peter of Sicily]], eldest son and heir of King [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick III]]; however, the current political conflicts between the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily soon ended this planned betrothal too.

When King [[Charles I of Hungary]] (whose first wife [[Maria of Bytom]], had died in 1317) decided to marry again, he sent to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] two representants, [[Thomas Szécsényi]] and [[Simon Kacsics, Count of the Székelys|Simon Kacsics]], in addition to an interpreter, a bourgeois from Szoprońskim called [[Stephen Sáfár|Stephen]], in order to find a bride. King John called his two sisters to his court; at that moment, Marie resided in [[St. Marienthal Abbey]] and Beatrice remained in Italy. Both princesses arrived to [[Prague]] on 20 June 1318, and three days later, the Hungarian envoys met both girls at the monastery of [[Zbraslav]], where the Bohemian king gave them the opportunity to choose between them their future queen. After a calculated assessment of both personal and physical attitudes, they chose Beatrice. Soon after, the formal engagement took place, and the young bride parted with the Hungarian entourage to her new home. On the border of the Kingdom of Hungary she was officially welcomed by Charles I's messengers. Beatrice and Charles I married at the ''Octave of Saint Martin'' (between 12 and 17 November) and she was crowned Queen of Hungary in the ceremony.

Beatrice became pregnant in 1319. In November, she went into labour but died while giving birth. The child was stillborn. She was buried at [[Nagyvárad]] Cathedral.

Refusing to "'''bite the cartridge'''" was a turn of phrase used by the British in India of native Indian soldiers ([[sepoy]]s) who had mutinied in 1857.

It derives from the act of biting open a [[paper cartridge]] containing [[gunpowder]] and musket ball in order to load contemporary [[rifle]]s, especially the new [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] [[rifled musket]]. The phrase is thought by some to have later spawned the more familiar idiom "[[bite the bullet]]".

One of the alleged causes of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] were rumours that the grease on these cartridges designed to keep them dry was, variously, pork or beef fat (pork being abhorrent to the [[Muslim]]s, cows being sacred to the [[Hindu]]s), thus their refusal to bite them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urdu/asbab/bijnor/app05_letter1869.html 1869 letter] by Sir [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] on the origins of the Mutiny of 1857&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonebreaker''' is a fictional [[super villain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #229 (May 1988) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Marc Silvestri]].

==Fictional character biography==
Bonebreaker was the leader of the original [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], a gang of cyborgs living in a ghost town in Australia, who perpetrated robberies across the globe. Bonebreaker, as well as Pretty Boy and Skullbuster, avoided being sent through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] along with the other Reavers after being defeated by the [[X-Men]].&lt;ref name="Uncanny229"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]] | Story = Down Under  | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 229 | Date = May 1988 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their defeat, Bonebreaker sought out [[Donald Pierce]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] to aid in rebuilding the Reavers and defeating the X-Men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} At this point, Pierce took over Bonebreaker's role as the Reavers leader. The Reavers never ended up battling the X-Men but encountered Wolverine, beat him half to death, and crucified him.&lt;ref name="Uncanny251"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]] | Story = Fever Dream  | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 251 | Date = November 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Wolverine escaped, the Reavers attacked [[Muir Island]] where they battled the Muir Island X-Men and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], killing Sunder, Stonewall, and Destiny before being defeated.&lt;ref name="Uncanny255"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]] | Story = Crash and Burn  | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 255 | Date = December 1989| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Muir island massacre, Bonebreaker and the other Reavers continued to attack various heroes and mutants such as Wolverine, [[Emma Frost]]'s factories, Rogue, and the [[Punisher]]. When Pierce was creating [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] and [[Elsie-Dee]] as a trap for Wolverine, Bonebreaker accidentally gave Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence instead of that of a 5 year old. As a result, Elsie-Dee and Albert decided that Wolverine was a noble person and foiled Pierce's plans.

As part of the Upstarts' competition, [[Trevor Fitzroy]] sent his Sentinel to attack Pierce and the Reavers. The Sentinels arrived in Australia and quickly dispatched the Reavers.&lt;ref name="Uncanny281"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Jim Lee]], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], and [[While Portacio]] | Penciller = [[While Portacio]] | Inker = [[Art Thibert]] | Story = Fresh Upstart| Title = Uncanny X-Men | Issue = 281 | Date = October 1991| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonebreaker was among the other Reavers reassembled by Pierce and the [[Shadow King]], who attacked the X-treme X-Men. After being defeated again, the Reavers were handed over to the police.&lt;ref name="X-Treme X-Men Annual 2001"&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[Salvador Larroca]] | Inker = [[Sandu Horca]] | Story = Queen of Shadows | Title = X-Treme X-Men Annual 2001 | Issue = 1 | Date = February 2002| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonebreaker leads an attack on what he thinks is Wolverine, but is in actuality [[Old Man Logan|an alternate universe aged version of Logan]]. This attack kills several new-found friends of Logan. In response, Logan tears apart Bonebreaker and stabs him through the neck.&lt;ref&gt;''Old Man Logan'' #6 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Like the other members of the Reavers, Bonebreaker is a cyborg and has bionic implants that augment strength, stamina, and reflexes beyond the levels of a normal human.

Bonebreaker's legs have been replaced with a motorized chassis that drives on tank treads. It is outfitted with anti-aircraft weapons, missile launchers, and machine guns. Bonebreaker's upper torso can be removed from the chassis.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
A version of Bonebreaker appeared in [[Ultimate Marvel]] as one of the cyborg-hunting mutants on [[Krakoa]]. He has a cybernetic snake-like body. He is one of the only Reavers to actually be named after his 616-counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #91&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
Bonebreaker and several other Reavers make an appearance in the 27th episode of the 1990s ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' TV series.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Sri Lanka]]'''. 

However, there have been no executions since 23 June 1976, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions. These were automatically commuted to life in prison. The government decided to reinstate [[capital punishment]] in 2004 for cases of [[rape]], [[drug trafficking]] and [[murder]] after the assassination of High Court judge [[Sarath Ambepitiya]]. [[Perjury]] that results in execution of an innocent person, [[treason]], [[armed robbery]], some military offences and certain crimes committed with the use of a gun (such as [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[human trafficking]], [[assault]] on a public servant) can also result in the death penalty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Sri+Lanka |title=The Death Penalty in Sri Lanka |publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, due to significant opposition to the move no executions have been carried out.

==History==
The death penalty has a long history in Sri Lanka. The British restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815 to the crimes of murder and "waging war against the King."

After independence, then Prime Minister [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] abolished capital punishment in 1956. However, it was quickly reintroduced after his assassination in 1959. Opposition to the death penalty started to become increasingly widespread and the United National Party government modified the use of it in its 1978 rewrite of the constitution. Under the new arrangement, death sentences could only be carried out if authorized by the trial judge, the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice. If there was no agreement, the sentence was to be commuted to life imprisonment. The sentence was also to be ratified by the President. This clause effectively ended executions. The last execution in Sri Lanka took place in 1976.

Over the last decade, however, president [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] made several attempts to re-introduce the death penalty. In March 1999, after spurts of violence near the end of her first term in office, she stated that the government would be reintroducing the death penalty. However, she was forced to back down in the face of overwhelming public protest. The issue hung in the balance, with all death sentences from then on being neither commuted to life nor carried out.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite web|title=With no one to execute, Sri Lanka’s new hangmen to do light administrative work for now|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/1867476/no-one-execute-sri-lankas-new-hangmen-do-light|publisher=South China Morning Post|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions were held regarding the matter, the motion that commuted all death sentences to life in prison was revoked in January 2001.

On November 19, 2004, High Court Judge [[Sarath Ambepitiya]] was gunned down as he arrived home from work. He had a reputation for handing out tough sentences. The assassination immediately prompted [[Chandrika Kumaratunga|Kumaratunga]] to effectively reinstate capital punishment.

With the end of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] the country saw a sharp rise in child abuse, rape, murder and drug trafficking, prompting some lawyers and politicians to call for the reinstatement of the death penalty. Newly elected President [[Maithripala Sirisena]], in 2015, said he supports a dialogue on the introduction of the death penalty should it be approved by Parliament. The statement coming after a series of high profile incidents of rape, killing and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka hires new hangmen for 'light administrative duty'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34528084|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty, if put into action, would be carried out by hanging in the gallows situated in [[Colombo]]. As of 2015 there are 1,116 convicts on death row.&lt;ref name=SCMP /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In 2018, it was reported that Sri Lanka is going to reinstate capital punishment for drug dealers. President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] told the government, which earlier had unanimously backed the reinstatement of capital punishment, that he “was ready to sign the death warrants”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/432823-sri-lanka-death-penalty-drugs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
*[[Maru Sira]], criminal who gained fame through many daring prison escapes, executed by hanging on August 7 1975. Originally he was sentenced to death ''in absentia'' for killing of a man in March 1974. The night before his execution, prison guards gave him Largactil in strong dosage in an attempt to prevent him escaping, but this caused him to collapse and his hanging was botched because the short fall caused by his slumped position, caused him to strangle to death instead of breaking his neck and killing him instantly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ranasinghe |first1=Anne |title=A case against the noose |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224426/http://www.dailymirror.lk/2003/02/27/opinion/1.html |accessdate=3 June 2018 |date=3 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homer Lusk Collyer''' (November 6, 1881 &amp;ndash; March 21, 1947) and '''Langley Wakeman Collyer''' (October 3, 1885 &amp;ndash; [[circa|c.]] March 9, 1947), known as the '''Collyer brothers''',&lt;ref name="Lidz"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lidz |first=Franz |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2D91231F935A15753C1A9659C8B63 |title=The Paper Chase |location=New York City |publisher=New York Times |date=October 26, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; were two American brothers who became infamous for their bizarre natures and [[compulsive hoarding]]. For decades, the two lived in seclusion in their [[Harlem]] [[brownstone]] at 2078 [[Fifth Avenue]] (at the corner of [[128th Street (Manhattan)|128th Street]]) where they obsessively collected books, furniture, musical instruments, and myriad other items, with [[booby trap]]s set up in corridors and doorways to crush intruders. In March 1947, both were found dead in their home surrounded by over 140 tons of collected items that they had amassed over several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/on-the-town/collyer-brothers/12165/ |title=The Collyer Brothers |publisher=[[New York Sun]] |author=William Bryk|date=April 13, 2005 |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, the site of the former Collyer house has been a [[pocket park]], named for the brothers.&lt;ref name=ocker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=7845|title=Collyer Brothers Park|publisher=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and education==
The Collyer brothers were sons of Herman Livingston Collyer (1857&amp;ndash;1923), a Manhattan [[gynecologist]] who worked at [[Bellevue Hospital]], and his [[Cousin marriage|first cousin]],&lt;ref name=Jarvis&gt;Jarvis, Robert M. (2007), "The Curious Legal Career Of Homer L. Collyer". ''Journal of Maritime Law &amp; Commerce''. '''38''' (4):571–582&lt;/ref&gt; Susie Gage Frost (1856&amp;ndash;1929), a former opera singer. The brothers claimed that their ancestors had traveled to America from England on the ''[[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|Fortune]]'', the ship that arrived in [[Massachusetts]] a year after the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in 1621.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=Langley Kept Faith with Brother to the end, Died Under Junk Near Him in Their 'Castle'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19470409&amp;id=plMbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=10wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4740,2938272|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|page=1|date=April 10, 1947|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Collyers' mother was descended from the [[Livingston family|Livingstons]], a New York family with roots going back to the 18th century. [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] was the first of the Livingston family to immigrate to America in 1672 – 52 years after the ''Mayflower''.&lt;ref name=steketee5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steketee|first1=Gail|last2=Frost|first2=Randy|title=Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeKvAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=March 19, 2014|date=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-547-48725-8|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Herman and Susie had their first child, a daughter they named Susan. She died at four months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NorthSide Woman Claims Collyer Brothers; Fortune|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19470613&amp;id=gyEbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4UwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6434,4387587|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|page=2|date=June 13, 1947|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, on November 6, the couple's first son, Homer Lusk, was born. In 1885 their second son, Langley Wakeman, was born.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt; At the time of Langley's birth, the couple were living in a tenement while Herman Collyer interned at Bellevue. As a child, Homer attended PS (Public School) 69. At the age of 14, he was accepted to the [[New York University|College of the City of New York]] as a "sub-freshman", earning his bachelor's degree six years later.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;

Both Homer and Langley attended [[Columbia University]], which had just relocated to its present-day [[Morningside Heights]] campus. Homer obtained a degree in [[admiralty law]], while Langley studied [[engineering]] and chemistry.&lt;ref name=steketee5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=The World's Worst: A Guide to the Most Disgusting, Hideous, Inept, and Dangerous People, Places, and Things on Earth|date=2011|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=1-452-10557-X|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langley was also an accomplished concert pianist; he played professionally for a time and performed at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref name=steketee6&gt;Steketee 2010 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Langley was also a [[Layperson|layman]] of the [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] where the family had been [[parishioner]]s since 1697.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Earl|title=Langley Collyer Found, Victim Of Own Trap|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&amp;dat=19470409&amp;id=Rsw8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Oi4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4455,1243865|newspaper=The News and Courier|page=1|date=April 9, 1947|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Dr. Herman Collyer moved the family into a four-story brownstone in Harlem at 2078 Fifth Avenue. Dr. Collyer was known to be eccentric and was said to frequently paddle down the [[East River]] in a canoe to the City Hospital on [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]], where he occasionally worked, and then to carry the canoe back to his home in Harlem after he came ashore on Manhattan Island.&lt;ref name=steketee6/&gt; Around 1919, Herman Collyer and Susie Collyer separated. Dr. Collyer moved to a new home at 153 West 77th Street while Susie Collyer stayed in the Harlem brownstone. Homer and Langley, who had never married or lived on their own, chose to remain with their mother. Dr. Collyer died in 1923 leaving his sons all of his possessions, including items from his medical practice, which they brought to their home in Harlem. Susie Collyer died in 1929, leaving the brothers all her possessions and the Harlem brownstone.&lt;ref name=gray&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=Streetscapes/128th St. and Fifth Ave., Former Site of the Harlem House Where the Collyer Brothers Kept All That Stuff; Wondering Whether a Park Should Keep Its Name|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/23/realestate/streetscapes-128th-st-fifth-ave-former-site-harlem-house-where-collyer-brothers.html|accessdate=March 20, 2014|website=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seclusion and hoarding==
After their mother's death, the Collyer brothers continued to live together in the Harlem brownstone they inherited. For the next four years, the brothers socialized with others and left their home on a regular basis. Homer continued to practice law while Langley worked as a piano dealer.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Story of Harlem's 'Mystery Mansion' Is Disclosed by One of the Hermitlike Brothers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19420807&amp;id=jzMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7CIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3589,2129693|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|page=1|date=April 7, 1942|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both also taught Sunday school at the Trinity Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidz|first=Franz|title=Ghosty Men: The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers, New York's Greatest Hoarders, An Urban Historical|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |publication-date=2008|isbn=1-596-91846-2|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Homer lost his eyesight due to [[hemorrhages]] in the back of his eyes. Langley quit his job to care for his brother and the two began to withdraw from society.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt; As time progressed, the brothers became fearful due to changes in the neighborhood; the largely upper-class area changed dramatically due to the economic effects of the [[Great Depression]]. The brothers were also uncomfortable with the shift in racial demographics, as more [[African American]]s moved into the once empty apartment houses that were built near a projected subway route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Steve|title=Einstein's Refrigerator: And Other Stories from the Flip Side of History|date=2001|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=0-740-71419-8|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashton|first1=Jean |last2=Nazionale|first2=Nina|title=When Did the Statue of Liberty Turn Green?: And 101 Other Questions about New York City|publisher=Columbia University Press|publication-date=2010|isbn=0-231-14743-0|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; When later asked why the two chose to shut themselves off from the world, Langley Collyer replied, "We don't want to be bothered."&lt;ref name=maeder&gt;{{cite book|title=Big Town, Big Time: A New York Epic : 1898–1998|date=1998|editor1-last=Maeder|editor1-first=Jay|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-582-61028-2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As rumors about the brothers' unconventional lifestyle spread throughout Harlem, crowds began to congregate outside their home. The attention caused the brothers' fears to increase along with their eccentricities. After teenagers threw rocks at their windows, they boarded them up and wired the doors shut.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=musel&gt;{{cite news|last=Musel|first=Bob|title=Scion of Old Family Is Dressed as Scarecrow When He Prowls at Night|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19410820&amp;id=Me8ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6CIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2316,2007897|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|page=1|date=August 20, 1941|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After unfounded rumors spread throughout the neighborhood that the brothers' home contained valuables and large sums of money, several people attempted to burgle the home. In an attempt to exclude burglars, Langley used his engineering skills to construct booby traps and tunnels among the collection of items and trash that filled the house.&lt;ref name="Jarvis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pittsburgh3&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Await Hermit's Return Following Death of Brother|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19470322&amp;id=d3YbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=20wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5495,2320065|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|page=3|date=March 22, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house soon became a maze of boxes, complicated tunnel systems consisting of junk and trash rigged with trip wires. Homer and Langley Collyer lived in "nests" created amongst the debris that was piled to the ceiling.&lt;ref name=maeder/&gt;

Langley spent the majority of his time tinkering with various inventions, such as a device to vacuum the inside of pianos and a [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]] adapted to generate electricity. He also cared for his brother Homer. Langley later told a reporter that he fed and bathed his brother, read him classic literature as he could no longer see and played [[piano sonata]]s for him.&lt;ref name=maeder/&gt; He also tended to Homer's health and was determined to cure his brother's physical ailments through "diet and rest".&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt; Langley concocted a diet for his brother consisting of one hundred oranges a week, [[Rye bread|black bread]], and peanut butter, claiming that this regimen was curing Homer's blindness.&lt;ref name=gethard&gt;{{cite book|last=Gethard|first=Chris|title=Weird New York: Your Travel Guide to New York's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|publication-date=2005|isbn=1-402-73383-6|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ashton&gt;Ashton and Nazionale 2010 p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; After Homer became paralyzed due to inflammatory [[rheumatism]], he refused to seek professional medical treatment because both brothers distrusted doctors. The brothers feared that if Homer sought medical attention, doctors would cut his [[optic nerve]], leaving him permanently blind, and give him drugs that would hasten his death. Langley Collyer later told a reporter, "You must remember that we are the sons of a doctor. We have a medical library of 15,000 books in the house. We decided we would not call in any doctors. You see, we knew too much about medicine."&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;

Langley began venturing out of the house only after midnight and would walk miles all over the city to get food, sometimes going as far as [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] to buy as little as a loaf of bread. He would also pick food out of the garbage and collect food that was going to be thrown out by grocers and butchers to bring back to his brother Homer.&lt;ref name=montreal2&gt;{{cite news|title=Langley Collyer Dead for Weeks; Police Find Body in Homer's Room|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19470409&amp;id=dnotAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pJgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3235,1355408|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|page=2|date=April 9, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected countless pieces of abandoned items and trash that aroused his interest.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

By the early 1930s, the Collyer brothers' brownstone had fallen into disrepair. Their telephone was disconnected in 1937 and was never reconnected as the brothers said they had no one to talk to. Because the brothers failed to pay their bills, the electricity, water, and gas were turned off in 1938.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt; They took to warming the large house using only a small [[kerosene]] heater. For a time, Langley attempted to generate electricity by means of a car engine. Langley would fetch their water from a pump in nearby parks.&lt;ref name=ashton/&gt; Their only link to the outside world was via a [[crystal radio]] that Langley made.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=pittsburgh3/&gt;

Neighbors and shopkeepers in the area described Langley Collyer as a generally polite and rational man but added that he was "crazy".&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 7, 1947|title=Strange Case Of the Collyer Brothers|journal=Life|publisher=Time Inc.|page=49|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g00EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=collyer+brothers+taxes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SCspU6iFOY-qqAGJnYCgCA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=collyer%20brothers%20taxes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter who interviewed Langley in 1942 described him as a "soft-spoken old gentleman with a liking for privacy" who spoke in a "low, polite and cultivated voice".&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt; His appearance was disheveled; he sported a droopy mustache, wore a 1910 boating cap and his tattered clothes were held together by pins.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; While Langley Collyer ventured out of the home and occasionally interacted with other people, Homer had not been seen or heard from since he went blind and retreated from the world in 1933. Langley was fiercely protective of Homer and would not allow anyone to see or speak to him. When he caught neighbors attempting to peek into their windows from a neighboring home, Langley bought the property for $7,500 cash. When a small fire broke out in the home in 1941, Langley refused to let firemen who extinguished the fire see or speak to his brother.&lt;ref name=musel/&gt;

==Public scrutiny==
In 1932, shortly before Homer Collyer went blind, he purchased the property across the street from their house at 2077 Fifth Avenue, with the intent of developing it by putting up an apartment building. But after the onset of his blindness, any plans of profit from the real estate venture ended.&lt;ref&gt;Lidz 2008 p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Collyer brothers never paid any of their bills and stopped paying income taxes in 1931, the property was repossessed by the City of New York in 1943 to pay the $1,900 in back income taxes that the Collyers owed the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Troubles Vex Collyer Brothers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19430118&amp;id=xlwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=epgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1511,3972715|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=Reading Eagle|page=18|date=January 18, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langley protested the repossession of their property, saying that since they had no income, they should not have to pay income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Strand|publisher=[[George Newnes|George Newnes Ltd]]|volume=116|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rumors and legends abounded in Harlem about the brothers,&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Town Shows It Has Heart In Halting Eviction|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19420808&amp;id=ILouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=stQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4155,1371957|accessdate=March 20, 2014|newspaper=The Miami News|page=11|date=August 8, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; they came to wider attention when, in 1938, a story about their refusal to sell their home to a real estate agent for $125,000 appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=musel/&gt; The ''Times'' repeated information about the brothers' hoarding and also repeated neighborhood rumors that the brothers lived in some sort of  "[[Orientalism|Orientalist]] splendor" and were sitting on vast piles of cash, afraid to deposit it in a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Snowden |editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Halliday|editor2-first=Graeme|editor3-last=Banerjee|editor3-first=Sube|title=Severe Domestic Squalor|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1-107-01272-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither rumor was true; the brothers were certainly not insolvent, although eventually they would have been, since neither of them had worked for decades.

After ''The New York Times'' story ran, Helen Worden, a reporter from ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'', became interested in the brothers and interviewed Langley Collyer (Worden would release a book about the brothers in 1954). Langley told Worden that he stopped playing piano professionally after performing at Carnegie Hall because "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] followed me. He got better notices than I. What was the use of going on?". Langley explained that he dressed in shabby clothing because "[T]hey would rob me if I didn't".&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

The Collyer brothers made the news again when, in 1939, workers from [[Consolidated Edison]] forced their way into the house to remove two gas meters that had been shut off in 1928.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt; The incident reportedly drew a crowd of a thousand curious onlookers.&lt;ref name=gray/&gt; The brothers drew media attention again in August 1942 when the [[Bowery Savings Bank]] threatened to evict the Collyers for failing to pay their mortgage for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19420807&amp;id=yKQlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5775,5117998|title=Harlem House Mystery Ends; Tale of Love|date=August 7, 1942|work=The Gettysburg Times|page=2|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' interviewed Langley. In response to a query about the bundles of newspapers that were kept in the brothers' home, Langley replied, "I am saving newspapers for Homer, so that when he regains his sight he can catch up on the news."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weird Tales|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19420807&amp;id=jLwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qpwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5252,1679167|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=Reading Eagle|page=6|date=August 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1942, the Bowery Savings Bank began eviction procedures and sent a cleanup crew to the home. Langley began yelling at the workers prompting the neighbors to summon the police. When the police attempted to force their way into the home by smashing down the front door, they were stymied by a sheer wall of junk piled from floor to ceiling. They found Langley Collyer in a clearing he had made in the middle of the debris.&lt;ref name=maeder/&gt; Without comment, Langley made out a check for $6,700 ({{Inflation-year|US}} equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6700|1942|r=0}}}}){{Inflation-fn|US}}, paying off the mortgage in full in a single payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aged Hermits Pair May Now Enjoy Undisturbed Seclusion|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19421119&amp;id=leRLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=54oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1038,2100210|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|page=11|date=November 19, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then ordered everyone off the premises, and withdrew from outside scrutiny once more, emerging only at night when he wanted to file criminal complaints against intruders, get food or collect items that piqued his interest.&lt;ref name=maeder/&gt;

==Homer Collyer's death==
[[File:Collyer1a.jpg|thumb|left|View of interior]]
On March 21, 1947, an anonymous tipster who identified himself only as "Charles Smith" phoned the 122nd Police Precinct and insisted there was a dead body in the house.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804078-1,00.html |title=The Shy Men|publisher=Time.com |date=April 7, 1947|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caller claimed that the smell of decomposition was emanating from the house.&lt;ref name=ashton/&gt; As the police were used to calls from neighbors about the Collyer brothers' home, a patrol officer was dispatched. The responding officer initially had a difficult time getting into the house. There was no doorbell or telephone and the doors were locked; and though the basement windows were broken, they were protected by iron [[grillwork]].&lt;ref name=gethard/&gt; An emergency squad of seven men eventually had no choice but to begin pulling out all of the junk that was blocking their way and throwing it out onto the street below. The brownstone's foyer was packed solid by a wall of old newspapers, folding beds and chairs, half a sewing machine, boxes, parts of a wine press, and numerous other pieces of junk. A patrolman finally broke in through a window into a second-story bedroom. Behind this window lay, among other things, more packages and newspaper bundles, empty cardboard boxes lashed together with rope, the frame of a baby carriage, a rake, and old umbrellas tied together. After five hours of digging, Homer Collyer's body was found in an alcove surrounded by filled boxes and newspapers that were piled to the ceiling.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh3/&gt; Homer was wearing a tattered blue-and-white bathrobe, his matted, grey hair reached his shoulders, and his head was resting on his knees.&lt;ref name=silverman&gt;Silverman 2001 p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical examiner confirmed Homer's identity and said that the elder brother had been dead for approximately ten hours.&lt;ref name=silverman/&gt; According to the medical examiner, Homer died from [[starvation]] and [[heart disease]].&lt;ref name=miamiblind&gt;{{cite news|title=Blind Homer, Last To Die, Tried To Rescue Langley|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19470410&amp;id=ClEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZtUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6273,3732495|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=The Miami News|page=11-A|date=April 10, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police initially suspected that Langley Collyer was the man who phoned in the anonymous tip regarding his brother's death and theorized that he fled the house before police arrived (it was later discovered that a neighbor called police based on a rumor he heard).&lt;ref name=montreal2/&gt; A police officer was posted outside the home to wait for Langley but he never arrived.&lt;ref name=pittsburgh3/&gt; Police began to suspect that Langley was dead when he failed to attend Homer's funeral held on April 1.&lt;ref name=montreal2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Langley Collyer Not Found As Brother Homer Is Buried|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&amp;dat=19470308&amp;id=uYEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hYsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6105,2660637|accessdate=March 20, 2014|newspaper=Palm Beach Daily News|page=1|date=April 2, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Langley Collyer's discovery==
After the discovery of Homer Collyer's body, rumors began circulating that Langley had been seen aboard a bus heading for [[Atlantic City]]. A manhunt along the [[New Jersey]] shore turned up nothing. Reports of Langley sightings led police to a total of nine states.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, Arthur W. (January 10, 1948), "The Thundering Herd of Wall Street". ''Saturday Evening Post''. '''220''' (28):20&lt;/ref&gt;  The police continued searching the house, removing 3,000 books, several outdated phone books, a horse's jawbone, a [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] piano, an early [[X-ray machine]], and more bundles of newspapers.&lt;ref name=milwaukee&gt;{{cite news|title=Hermit's Body Buried Under Pile of Debris in Fifth Av.

The police continued to clear away the brothers' stockpile for another week, removing another eighty-four tons of rubbish from the house. Although a good deal of the junk came from their father's medical practice, a considerable portion was discarded items collected by Langley over the years. Approximately 2,000 people stood outside the home to watch the clean-up effort.&lt;ref name=gray/&gt;

On April 8, 1947, a workman found the body of Langley Collyer ten feet from where Homer had died.&lt;ref name=montreal&gt;{{cite news|title=Langley Collyer Dead for Weeks; Police Find Body in Homer's Room|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19470409&amp;id=dnotAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pJgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3235,1355408|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|page=1|date=April 9, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langley was found in a two-foot (60&amp;nbsp;cm) wide tunnel lined with rusty bed springs and a chest of drawers.

==House contents==
Police and workmen removed approximately 120 tons of debris and junk from the Collyer brownstone.&lt;ref name=montreal/&gt; Items were removed from the house such as baby carriages, a doll carriage, rusted bicycles, old food, potato peelers, a collection of guns, glass chandeliers, bowling balls, camera equipment, the folding top of a horse-drawn carriage, a [[sawhorse]], three body forms, painted portraits, photos of [[Pin-up model|pin-up girls]] from the early 1900s, plaster busts, Mrs. Collyer's [[hope chest]]s, rusty bed springs, the kerosene stove, a child's chair (the brothers were lifelong bachelors and childless), more than 25,000 books (including thousands about medicine and engineering and more than 2,500 on [[law]]), human organs pickled in jars,&lt;ref name=ashton/&gt; eight live cats, the chassis of the old Model T with which Langley had been tinkering, tapestries, hundreds of yards of unused silks and other fabrics, clocks, fourteen pianos (both [[Piano#Grand|grand]] and [[Piano#Upright/vertical|upright]]),&lt;ref name=montreal/&gt; a [[clavichord]], two organs, banjos, violins, bugles, accordions, a gramophone and records, and countless bundles of newspapers and magazines, some of them decades old, and thousands of bottles and tin cans and a great deal of garbage.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Choron|first1=Harry |last2=Choron|first2=Sandy|title=Money: Everything You Never Knew About Your Favorite Thing to Find, Save, Spend &amp; Covet|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2011|isbn=1-452-10559-6|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the spot where Homer had died, police also found 34 bank account [[passbook]]s, with a total of $3,007 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3007|1946}}}}  as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref&gt;Silverman 2001 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more unusual items found in the home were exhibited at Hubert's [[dime museum|Dime Museum]], where they were featured alongside Human Marvels and sideshow performers. The centerpiece of this display was the chair in which Homer Collyer had died. The Collyer chair passed into the hands of private collectors upon being removed from public exhibit in 1956.

The house itself, having long gone without maintenance, was decaying: the roof leaked and some walls had caved in, showering bricks and mortar on the rooms below. The house was deemed "unsafe and [a] fire hazard" in July 1947 and was razed later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Collyer Mansion Will Be Razed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19470701&amp;id=gflOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=304DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2114,210164|accessdate=March 20, 2014|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|page=2|date=July 1, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steketee8/&gt;

Most of the items found in the Collyer brothers' house were deemed worthless and were disposed of. The salvageable items fetched less than $2,000 at auction;&lt;ref name=steketee8&gt;Steketee 2010 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the cumulative estate of the Collyer brothers was valued at $91,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|91000|1946|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}), of which $20,000 worth was personal property (jewelry, cash, securities, and the like).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologistworld.com/issue/collyerbrothers.php |title=The Collyer Brothers |publisher=Psychologist World |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-six people, mostly first and second cousins, made claims for the estate.

==In popular culture==
A Collyer's Mansion (also Collyer Mansion or just Collyer) is a modern firefighting term for a dwelling of hoarders that is so filled with trash and debris it becomes a serious danger to the occupants and emergency responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Andy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/nyregion/05hoard.html |title='Collyers' Mansion' Is Code for Firefighters' Nightmare|location=New York City |publisher=New York Times |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]] story "Hangly Hollyer Mansion" (#369, published 27 June 1947) is loosely based on the Collyer story.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- IIRC there is a comment (probably by Eisner himself) in the "Shop Talk" section of the Kitchen Sink reprint series which could be used as reliable source. --&gt;

The Collyer brothers' story was first directly fictionalized by [[Marcia Davenport]] in her novel ''[[My Brother's Keeper (Davenport novel)|My Brother's Keeper]]'' (Scribners, 1954), reprinted as a [[Popular Library]] paperback.&lt;ref name=methuen&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methuen Drama Guide to Contemporary American Playwrights|date=December 19, 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1-408-13480-2|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1955–56 "Classic 39" season of ''The Honeymooners'', affable neighbor [[Ed Norton (The Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]], chiding [[Ralph Kramden]] for his thriftiness, quips, "Congratulations on that 93 cent gas bill, Ralph . . . You broke the all-time low gas bill record, set by the Collyer Brothers in 1931!"

A 1973 episode of the TV show ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' entitled "The House on Hyde Street" was inspired by the Collyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0711582/trivia?item=tr1329378|title=&amp;quot;The Streets of San Francisco&amp;quot; The House on Hyde Street (TV Episode 1973) - Trivia - IMDb|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 movie ''[[Unstrung Heroes]]'' features two uncles whose lifestyle and apartment are a direct homage to the Collyer brothers. The film was based on a 1991 memoir by [[Franz Lidz]], who in 2003 published ''Ghosty Men: The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers, New York's Greatest Hoarders''. ''Ghosty Men'' also chronicles the parallel life of Arthur Lidz, the hermit uncle of ''Unstrung Heroes'', who grew up near the Collyer mansion and was inspired by the brothers.&lt;ref name="Lidz"/&gt;

In the episode "Dinner Party" (Season 6, Episode 17) of the sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', Martin likened the cloistered togetherness of Frasier and Niles to that of the Collyer brothers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In September 2009, Random House published [[E. L. Doctorow]]'s ''[[Homer &amp; Langley]]'', a work of [[historical fiction]] that speculates on the brothers' inner lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|title=How Did They End Up That Way?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/books/01kakutani.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 20, 2014|website=The New York Times|date=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking considerable historical liberties, the novel extends their lifespans into the late 1970s and switches the brothers' birth order.&lt;ref name=Dirda&gt;{{cite news |title=The Brothers Grim|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers are also the inspiration behind [[Richard Greenberg]]'s play ''The Dazzle'' which played in London to excellent reviews in the winter of 2015–16. [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] and [[David Dawson (actor)|David Dawson]] played Langley and Homer respectively, in the production by Emily Dobbs, which was staged at the former site of the [[Central Saint Martins]] School of Art on [[Charing Cross Road]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/27/the-dazzle-andrew-scott-found111-observer-review Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, episode "Trapped" of the series ''[[9-1-1 (TV series)|9-1-1]]'' features two brothers living as hoarders. Chimney, being the smallest firefighter, is able to tunnel in and save both of them after disabling a booby-trapped cuckoo clock.

[[File:Ackley.gif|thumb|Differential Evolution optimizing the 2D Ackley function.]]

In [[evolutionary computation]], '''differential evolution''' ('''DE''') is a method that [[optimization (mathematics)|optimizes]] a problem by [[iterative method|iteratively]] trying to improve a [[candidate solution]] with regard to a given measure of quality. Such methods are commonly known as [[metaheuristic]]s as they make few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.

DE is used for multidimensional real-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] but does not use the [[gradient]] of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require the optimization problem to be [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], as is required by classic optimization methods such as [[gradient descent]] and [[quasi-newton methods]]. DE can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even [[:wikt:continuous|continuous]], are noisy, change over time, etc.&lt;ref name=elediadereview/&gt;

DE optimizes a problem by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and creating new candidate solutions by combining existing ones according to its simple formulae, and then keeping whichever candidate solution has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem at hand. In this way the optimization problem is treated as a black box that merely provides a measure of quality given a candidate solution and the gradient is therefore not needed.

DE is originally due to Storn and Price.&lt;ref name=storn97differential/&gt;&lt;ref name=storn96usage/&gt; Books have been published on theoretical and practical aspects of using DE in [[parallel computing]], [[multiobjective optimization]], [[constrained optimization]], and the books also contain surveys of application areas.&lt;ref name=price05differential/&gt;&lt;ref name=feoktistov06differential/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Onwubolu and  B V Babu, {{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783540201670|title=New Optimization Techniques in Engineering|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chakraborty08advances/&gt; Surveys on the multi-faceted research aspects of DE can be found in journal articles .&lt;ref&gt;S. Das and P. N. Suganthan, "Differential Evolution: A Survey of the State-of-the-art", IEEE Trans. on Evolutionary Computation, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 4-31, Feb. 2011, DOI: 10.1109/TEVC.2010.2059031.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Das, S. S. Mullick, P. N. Suganthan, "Recent Advances in Differential Evolution - An Updated Survey," Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, doi:10.1016/j.swevo.2016.01.004, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algorithm {{Anchor|algo}} ==
&lt;!-- There is no need for extra pseudo-code when this algorithm description is made as detailed as it is! --&gt;

A basic variant of the DE algorithm works by having a population of [[candidate solutions]] (called agents). These agents are moved around in the search-space by using simple mathematical [[formula]]e to combine the positions of existing agents from the population. If the new position of an agent is an improvement then it is accepted and forms part of the population, otherwise the new position is simply discarded. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered.

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;f: \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the fitness function which must be minimized (note that maximization can be performed by considering the function &lt;math&gt;h := -f&lt;/math&gt; instead). The function takes a candidate solution as argument in the form of a [[Row vector|vector]] of [[real number]]s and produces a real number as output which indicates the fitness of the given candidate solution. The [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not known. The goal is to find a solution &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{m}) \leq f(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; in the search-space, which means that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the global minimum.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \Bbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; designate a candidate solution (agent) in the population. The basic DE algorithm can then be described as follows:

* Initialize all agents &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with random positions in the search-space.
* Until a termination criterion is met (e.g. number of iterations performed, or adequate fitness reached), repeat the following:
** For each agent &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the population do:
*** Pick three agents &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; from the population at random, they must be distinct from each other as well as from agent &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
*** Pick a random index &lt;math&gt;R \in \{1, \ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionality of the problem being optimized.
*** Compute the agent's potentially new position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = [y_1, \ldots, y_n]&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
**** For each &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, pick a uniformly distributed random number &lt;math&gt;r_i \sim U(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;
**** If &lt;math&gt;r_i &lt; CR &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i = R&lt;/math&gt; {{Dubious|i can't be equal to R since it is not integer|date=June 2018}} then set &lt;math&gt;y_i = a_i + F \times (b_i-c_i)&lt;/math&gt; otherwise set &lt;math&gt;y_i = x_i&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\text{CR} \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''crossover probability'' and the parameter &lt;math&gt;F \in [0,2]&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''differential weight'', both these parameters must be set by the user along with the population size &lt;math&gt;\text{NP} \geq 4&lt;/math&gt; and may greatly impact the optimization performance, see below.
*** If &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{y}) &lt; f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; then replace the agent &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the population with the improved candidate solution &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Pick the agent from the population that has the best fitness and return it as the best found candidate solution.

== Parameter selection ==

[[Image:DE Meta-Fitness Landscape (Sphere and Rosenbrock).JPG|thumb|Performance landscape showing how the basic DE performs in aggregate on the Sphere and Rosenbrock benchmark problems when varying the two DE parameters &lt;math&gt;\text{NP}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and keeping fixed &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}&lt;/math&gt;=0.9.]]

The choice of DE parameters &lt;math&gt;F, \text{CR}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{NP}&lt;/math&gt; can have a large impact on optimization performance. Selecting the DE parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research. [[Rules of thumb]] for parameter selection were devised by Storn et al.&lt;ref name=storn96usage/&gt;&lt;ref name=price05differential/&gt; and Liu and Lampinen.&lt;ref name=liu02setting/&gt; Mathematical convergence analysis regarding parameter selection was done by Zaharie.&lt;ref name=zaharie02critical/&gt; [[Meta-optimization]] of the DE parameters was done by Pedersen&lt;ref name=pedersen08thesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=pedersen10good-de/&gt; and Zhang et al.&lt;ref name=zhang11fitting/&gt;

== Variants ==

&lt;!-- Please add proper reference to conference-paper / journal-paper / tech report / master's or phd thesis. Please only add representative works. There must be hundreds of DE variants and Wikipedia is not the proper place to list them all. --&gt;

Variants of the DE algorithm are continually being developed in an effort to improve optimization performance. Many different schemes for performing crossover and mutation of agents are possible in the basic algorithm given above, see e.g.&lt;ref name=storn96usage/&gt; More advanced DE variants are also being developed with a popular research trend being to perturb or adapt the DE parameters during optimization, see e.g. Price et al.,&lt;ref name=price05differential/&gt; Liu and Lampinen,&lt;ref name=liu05fuzzy/&gt; Qin and Suganthan,&lt;ref name=qin05selfadaptive/&gt; Civicioglu&lt;ref name=civici/&gt; and Brest et al.&lt;ref name=brest06selfadapting/&gt; There are also some work in making a hybrid optimization method using DE combined with other optimizers.&lt;ref name=zx03depso/&gt;

The '''Dyatlov Pass incident''' ({{lang-ru|Ги́бель тургру́ппы Дя́тлова}}) refers to the unsolved deaths of nine ski [[hiking|hikers]] in the northern [[Ural Mountains]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Russia]]) between 1 February and 2 February 1959. The experienced trekking group, who were all from the [[Ural State Technical University|Ural Polytechnical Institute]], had established a [[campsite|camp]] on the slopes of [[Kholat Syakhl]] in an area now named in honor of the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov. During the night, something caused them to tear their way out of their tents and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for heavy snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.

After the group's bodies were discovered, an investigation by Soviet Union authorities determined that six had died from [[hypothermia]] while the other three showed signs of physical trauma. One victim had a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]]; two others had major chest fractures. Additionally, another team member was missing her tongue and eyes. The investigation concluded that an "unknown compelling force" had caused the deaths. Numerous theories have been put forward to account for the unexplained deaths, including animal attacks, hypothermia, [[avalanche]], [[infrasound]]-induced panic, military involvement, or some combination of these.

== Background ==
In 1959, a group was formed for a skiing expedition across the northern Urals in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Soviet Union]]. Igor Dyatlov, a twenty-three-year-old radio engineering student at the [[Ural State Technical University|Ural Polytechnical Institute]] (Уральский политехнический институт, УПИ; now [[Ural Federal University]]) was the leader who assembled a group of nine others for the trip, most of whom were fellow students and peers at the university.{{sfn|Eicher|2013|p=31}} Each member of the group, which consisted of eight men and two women, were experienced [[Grade (climbing)#Russian (post USSR countries)|Grade II]]-hikers with ski tour experience, and would be receiving Grade III certification upon their return.{{sfn|Eicher|2013|p=32}} At the time, this was the highest certification available in the Soviet Union, and required candidates to traverse {{convert|300|km|mi}}.{{sfn|Eicher|2013|p=32}} The goal of the expedition was to reach Otorten (Отортен), a mountain {{convert|10|km}} north of the site of the incident. This route, in February, was estimated as Category III, the most difficult.

The group arrived by train at [[Ivdel]] (Ивдель), a town at the centre of the northern province of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the early morning hours of 25 January 1959.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=90}} They then took a truck to Vizhai (Вижай) – a lorry village that is the last inhabited settlement to the north.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|work=The Telegraph|title=Yuri Yudin|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10026000/Yuri-Yudin.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While spending the night in Vizhai, the skiers purchased and ate loaves of bread to keep their energy levels up for the following day's hike.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=143}}

On 27 January, they began their trek toward Otorten from Vizhai. On 28 January, one of the members, Yuri Yudin, who suffered from several health ailments (including [[rheumatism]] and a [[congenital heart defect]]) was forced to turn back due to knee and joint pain that made him unable to continue the hike.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=34}}&lt;ref name="osadchuk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/25093 |title=Mysterious Deaths of 9 Skiers Still Unresolved |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times (Russia)|St. Petersburg Times]] |first=Svetlana |last=Osadchuk |date=19 February 2008 |via=CryptoZooNews, "Ural Mystery" posted by Loren Coleman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226101529/http://www.sptimes.ru/story/25093 |archive-date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining group of nine people continued the trek.

Diaries and cameras found around their last campsite made it possible to track the group's route up to the day preceding the incident.&lt;ref name=vice&gt;{{cite web|work=Vice|title=Russia's Dyatlov Pass Incident, the Strangest Unsolved Mystery of the Last Century|url=https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/wjj9yb/russias-dyatlov-pass-incident-the-strangest-unsolved-mystery-of-the-last-century|author=Mead, Derek|date=5 September 2017|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January, the group arrived at the edge of a highland area and began to prepare for climbing. In a wooded valley they cached surplus food and equipment that would be used for the trip back. The following day (1 February), the hikers started to move through the pass. It seems they planned to get over the pass and make camp for the next night on the opposite side, but because of worsening weather conditions — [[Winter storm|snowstorms]] and decreasing visibility — they lost their direction and deviated west, up towards the top of [[Kholat Syakhl]]. When they realised their mistake, the group decided to stop and set up camp there on the slope of the mountain, rather than moving {{convert|1.5|km}} downhill to a forested area which would have offered some shelter from the elements.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt; Yudin postulated that "Dyatlov probably did not want to lose the altitude they had gained, or he decided to practice camping on the mountain slope."&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;

== Search and discovery ==
Before leaving, Dyatlov had agreed he would send a telegram to their sports club as soon as the group returned to Vizhai. It was expected that this would happen no later than 12 February, but Dyatlov had told Yudin, before his departure from the group, that he expected to be longer. When the 12th passed and no messages had been received, there was no immediate reaction, as delays of a few days were common with such expeditions. It was not until the relatives of the travellers demanded a rescue operation on 20 February that the head of the institute sent the first rescue groups, consisting of volunteer students and teachers.&lt;ref name="osadchuk" /&gt; Later, the army and [[militsiya]] forces became involved, with planes and helicopters being ordered to join the rescue operation.

On 26 February, the searchers found the group's abandoned and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, the student who found the tent, said "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind."&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt; Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down towards the edge of a nearby woods, on the opposite side of the pass, {{convert|1.5|km}} to the north-east. However, after {{convert|500|m}} these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest's edge, under a large [[Pinus sibirica|siberian pine]] (in popular parlance it is called "cedar"), the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire. There were the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the pine and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt; They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.

Searching for the remaining four travellers took more than two months. They were finally found on 4 May under four metres of snow in a ravine 75 metres further into the woods from the pine tree. These four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that those who had died first had apparently relinquished their clothes to the others. Zolotaryov was wearing Dubinina's faux fur coat and hat, while Dubinina's foot was wrapped in a piece of Krivonishenko's wool trousers.

== Investigation ==
[[File:Dyatlov Pass incident 02.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the tent as the rescuers found it on 26 February, 1959: the tent had been cut open from inside, and most of the skiers had fled in socks or barefoot]]
A legal [[inquest]] started immediately after finding the first five bodies. A medical examination found no injuries which might have led to their deaths, and it was eventually concluded that they had all died of [[hypothermia]]. Slobodin had a small crack in his skull, but it was not thought to be a fatal wound.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=221}}

An examination of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=221}} had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|pages=221, 262}} According to Dr Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparing it to the force of a car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds related to the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure. However, major external injuries were found on Dubinina, who was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hibinaud/home/akt-issledovania-trupa-dubininoj|title=Акт исследования трупа Дубининой – hibinaud|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also had extensive [[Pruning (maceration)|skin maceration]] on the hands. It was claimed that Dubinina was found lying face down in a small stream{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=207}} that ran under the snow and that her external injuries were in line with [[putrefaction]] in a wet environment, and were unlikely to be related to her death.

There was initial speculation that the indigenous [[Mansi people|Mansi]] people might have attacked and murdered the group for encroaching upon their lands, but investigation indicated that the nature of their deaths did not support this hypothesis; the hikers' footprints alone were visible, and they showed no sign of hand-to-hand struggle.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;

Although the temperature was very low, around {{convert|-25|to|-30|C|F}} with a storm blowing, the dead were only partially dressed. Some of them had only one shoe, while others had no shoes or wore only socks.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt; Some were found wrapped in snips of ripped clothes that seemed to have been cut from those who were already dead.

Journalists reporting on the available parts of the inquest files claim that it states:
* Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.
* There were no indications of other people nearby on Kholat Syakhl apart from the nine travellers.
* The tent had been ripped open from within.
* The victims had died 6 to 8 hours after their last meal.
* Traces from the camp showed that all group members left the campsite of their own accord, on foot.
* To dispel the theory of an attack by the indigenous [[Mansi people|Mansi]] people, Dr Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being, "because the force of the blows had been too strong and no soft tissue had been damaged".&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;
* Released documents contained no information about the condition of the skiers' internal organs.
* There were no survivors of the incident.

At the time the verdict was that the group members all died because of a compelling natural force.&lt;ref name="guschin"/&gt; The inquest officially ceased in May 1959 as a result of the absence of a guilty party. The files were sent to a secret archive.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;

On 12 April 2018 the remains of Semyon Zolotarev were exhumated upon the initiative of journalists of the Russian tabloid ''Komsomolskaya Pravda''. Contradicting results were obtained: one of the experts stated that the character of the injuries resembled a person knocked down by a car, and the DNA analysis did not reveal any similarity to the DNA of living relatives. In addition, it turned out that the name of Semyon Zolotarev is not on the list of buried at the Ivanovskoye cemetery. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the face along the exhumated skull coincides with the post-war photographs of Semyon, although journalists express suspicions that another person was hiding under the name of Semyon Zolotarev after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gusel'nikov |first1=Alexey |title=Экспертиза ДНК: в могиле дятловца Семена Золотарева захоронен другой человек |url=https://ura.news/news/1052335076|language=Russian |website=URA.RU |accessdate=7 June 2018 |date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Мистика и тайны перевала Дятлова: Похоже, будто Семена Золотарева переехал автомобиль |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26838/3879326/|language=Russian |accessdate=7 June 2018 |work=Komsomolskaya Pravda |date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Тайна перевала Дятлова: ДНК-экспертиза отрицает родство предполагаемого Семена Золотарева с его племянницей |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26830/3870457/|language=Russian |accessdate=7 June 2018 |work=Komsomolskaya Pravda |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region was closed to expeditions and hikers for three years after the incident, but is currently accessible. {{refneeded|date=October 2018}}

==Related reports==
*12-year-old Yury Kuntsevich, who later became the head of the Yekaterinburg-based Dyatlov Foundation (see below), attended five of the hikers' funerals. He recalled that their skin had a "deep brown tan".&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I was 12 at that time, but I do remember the deep resonance that the accident had with the public, despite the authorities’ efforts to keep relatives and investigators silent," said Yury Kuntsevich, head of the Yekaterinburg-based Dyatlov Foundation, which is trying to unravel the mystery.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another group of hikers (about {{convert|50|km}} south of the incident) reported that they saw strange orange spheres in the sky to the north on the night of the incident.&lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt; Similar spheres were observed in Ivdel and adjacent areas continually during the period from February to March 1959, by various independent witnesses (including the meteorology service and the military). However, these sightings were not noted in the initial investigation in 1959, and these various independent witnesses only came forward years later. &lt;ref name="osadchuk"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Фото членов тургруппы Игоря Дятлова.jpg|thumb|240px|Tomb of the deceased at Mikhajlov Cemetery in [[Yekaterinburg]], Russia.]]
In 1967, Sverdlovsk writer and journalist Yuri Yarovoi ({{lang-ru|Юрий Яровой}}) published the novel ''Of the Highest Degree of Complexity'',&lt;ref&gt;1967 (Yarovoi, Yuri: ''Of the Highest Degree of Complexity'', Sredneuralskoye knizhnoye izdatelstvo, Sverdlovsk, 1967){{Unreliable source?|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the incident. Yarovoi had been involved in the search for Dyatlov's group and at the inquest as an official photographer during both the search and the initial stage of the investigation, and so had insight into the events. The book was written during the Soviet era when details of the accident were kept secret and Yarovoi avoided revealing anything beyond the official position and well-known facts. The book romanticised the accident and had a much more optimistic end than the real events – only the group leader was found deceased. Yarovoi's colleagues say that he had alternative versions of the novel, but both were declined because of censorship. Since Yarovoi's death in 1980, all his archives, including photos, diaries and manuscripts, have been lost.

Anatoly Gushchin ({{lang-ru|Анатолий Гущин}}) summarized his research in the book ''The Price of State Secrets Is Nine Lives'' (''Цена гостайны – девять жизней'', Sverdlovsk, 1990)&lt;ref name="guschin"&gt;Гущин Анатолий. ''Цена гостайны – девять жизней'', изд-во "Уральский рабочий", Свердловск, 1990 ({{literal translation}} Anatoly, Gushchin. ''The price of state secrets is nine lives'', Izdatelstvo "Uralskyi Rabochyi", Sverdlovsk, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers criticised the novel due to its concentration on the speculative theory of a Soviet secret weapon experiment, but its publication led to public discussion, stimulated by interest in the [[paranormal]]. Indeed, many of those who had remained silent for thirty years reported new facts about the accident. One of them was the former police officer, Lev Ivanov (Лев Иванов), who led the official inquest in 1959. In 1990, he published an article which included his admission that the investigation team had no rational explanation for the accident. He also stated that, after his team reported that they had seen flying spheres, he then received direct orders from high-ranking regional officials to dismiss this claim.&lt;ref name="ivanov"&gt;Иванов Лев: "Тайна огненных шаров", "Ленинский путь", Кустанай, 22–24 ноября 1990 г. (Ivanov, Lev: "Enigma of the fire balls", ''Leninskyi Put'', Kustanai, Nov 22–24 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eichar|2013|p=229}}

In 2000, a regional television company produced the documentary film ''The Mystery of Dyatlov Pass'' (''Тайна перевала Дятлова''). With the help of the film crew, a Yekaterinburg writer, Anna Matveyeva ({{lang-ru|Анна Матвеева}}), published a fiction/documentary novella of the same name.&lt;ref name="matveyeva"&gt;Анна, Матвеева. "[http://magazines.russ.ru/ural/2000/12/ural5.html Перевал Дятлова]", "Урал" N12-2000, Екатеринбург ({{literal translation}} Anna, Matveyeva. "[http://magazines.russ.ru/ural/2000/12/ural5.html Dyatlov pass]", "Ural"#12-2000, Ekaterinburg)&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the book includes broad quotations from the official case, diaries of victims, interviews with searchers and other documentaries collected by the film-makers. The narrative line of the book details the everyday life and thoughts of a modern woman (an [[alter ego]] of the author herself) who attempts to resolve the case.

Despite its fictional narrative, Matveyeva's book remains the largest source of documentary materials ever made available to the public regarding the incident. In addition, the pages of the case files and other documentaries (in photocopies and transcripts) are gradually being published on a web forum for enthusiastic researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pereval1959.forum24.ru/|script-title=ru:Перевал Дятлова: форум по исследованию гибели тургруппы И.

A ''Dyatlov Foundation'' was founded in  1999 at [[Yekaterinburg]], with the help of [[Ural State Technical University]], led by Yuri Kuntsevitch (Юрий Кунцевич). The foundation's stated aim is to continue investigation of the case and to maintain the Dyatlov Museum to preserve the memory of the dead hikers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Общая информация.

== Theories ==

=== Avalanche ===
The theory that an [[avalanche]] caused the hikers' deaths, while initially popular, has since been questioned. Reviewing the sensationalist "Yeti" hypothesis (see below), American [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]] author [[Benjamin Radford]] suggests as more plausible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"that the group woke up in a panic (...) and cut their way out the tent either because an avalanche had covered the entrance to their tent or because they were scared that an avalanche was imminent (...) (better to have a potentially repairable slit in a tent than risk being buried alive in it under tons of snow). They were poorly clothed because they had been sleeping, and ran to the safety of the nearby woods where trees would help slow oncoming snow. In the darkness of night they got separated into two or three groups; one group made a fire (hence the burned hands) while the others tried to return to the tent to recover their clothing, since the danger had apparently passed. But it was too cold, and they all froze to death before they could locate their tent in the darkness. At some point some of the clothes may have been recovered or swapped from the dead, but at any rate the group of four whose bodies were most severely damaged were caught in an avalanche and buried under 4 metres (13 ft) of snow (more than enough to account for the 'compelling natural force' the medical examiner described). Dubinina's tongue was likely removed by scavengers and ordinary predation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korbus|first1=Jason|last2=Nelson|first2=Bobby|title=SFR 291: The Russian Yeti of Dyatlov Pass w/ Benjamin Radford|url=https://strangefrequenciesradio.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/sfr-291-the-russian-yeti-of-dyatlov-pass-w-benjamin-radford/|website=Strange Frequency Radio|accessdate=19 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905070349/http://strangefrequenciesradio.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/sfr-291-the-russian-yeti-of-dyatlov-pass-w-benjamin-radford/|archivedate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Evidence contradicting the avalanche theory includes:&lt;ref name="Curious World Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyatlov Pass – Some Answers|url=http://www.aquiziam.com/dyatlov_pass_answers.html|work=Curious World|publisher=Curious Britannia Ltd.|accessdate=1 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004234442/http://aquiziam.com/dyatlov_pass_answers.html|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeptoid Podcast July 2008"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4108|number=108|title=Mystery at Dyatlov Pass|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The location of the incident did not have any obvious signs of an avalanche having taken place. An avalanche would have left certain patterns and debris distributed over a wide area. The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow layer of snow and, had there been an avalanche of sufficient strength to sweep away the second party, these bodies would have been swept away as well; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line.
* Over 100 expeditions to the region were held since the incident, and none of them ever reported conditions that might create an avalanche. A study of the area using up-to-date terrain-related physics revealed that the location was entirely unlikely for such an avalanche to have occurred. The "dangerous conditions" found in another nearby area (which had significantly steeper slopes and cornices) were observed in April and May when the snowfalls of winter were melting. During February, when the incident occurred, there were no such conditions.
* An analysis of the terrain, the slope and the incline indicates that even if there could have been a very specific avalanche that circumvents the other criticisms, its trajectory would have bypassed the tent. It had collapsed laterally but not horizontally.
* Dyatlov was an experienced skier and the much older Alexander Zolotaryov was studying for his Masters Certificate in ski instruction and mountain hiking. Neither of these two men would have been likely to camp anywhere in the path of a potential avalanche.

=== Infrasound ===
Another hypothesis popularised by [[Donnie Eichar]]'s 2013 book ''Dead Mountain'' is that wind going around Holatchahl Mountain created a [[Kármán vortex street]], which can produce [[infrasound]] capable of inducing [[panic attack]]s in humans.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|pages=246–9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zasky|first=Jason|url=http://failuremag.com/feature/article/return-to-dead-mountain/|title=Return to Dead Mountain|publisher=Failure magazine|date=February 1, 2014|accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Eichar's theory, the infrasound generated by the wind as it passed over the top of the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and mental distress in the hikers.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|pages=246–9}} Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope. By the time they were further down the hill, they would have been out of the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter.{{sfn|Eichar|2013|pages=246–9}} The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the ledge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.

=== Military tests ===
Speculation exists that the campsite fell within the path of a Soviet [[Blockbuster bomb|parachute mine]] exercise. This theory alleges that the hikers, woken by loud explosions, fled the tent in a shoeless, [[shell shocked]] panic and found themselves unable to return for supply retrieval. After some members froze to death attempting to endure the bombardment, others commandeered their clothing only to be fatally injured by subsequent parachute mine concussions. There are indeed records of parachute mines being tested by the Soviet military in the area around the time the hikers were there.{{sfn|McCloskey|2013}} Parachute mines detonate while still in the air rather than upon striking the Earth's surface and produce signature injuries similar to those experienced by the hikers: Heavy internal damage with comparably less external trauma. The theory coincides with reported sightings of glowing, orange orbs floating or falling in the sky within the general vicinity of the hikers,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} potentially military aircraft or descending parachute mines. This theory (among others) uses scavenging animals to explain Dubinina's injuries.&lt;ref&gt;"Dead Mountain: The Untold Story Of The Dyatlov Pass Incident." Publishers Weekly 260.32 (2013): 46. Business Source Elite. Web. 30 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate the bodies were unnaturally manipulated due to characteristic [[livor mortis]] markings discovered during autopsy, as well as burns to hair and skin. Photographs of the tent allegedly show that it was apparently erected incorrectly, something the experienced hikers were unlikely to have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nat Geo|title=Russia's Mystery Files|work=National Geographic Wild|url=http://natgeotv.com/uk/russias-mystery-files/videos/the-dyatlov-pass-incident|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory alleges the testing of [[radiological weapon]]s, and is partly based on the discovery of radioactivity on some of the clothing as well as the bodies being described by relatives as having orange skin and grey hair. However, radioactive dispersal would have affected all of the hikers and equipment instead of just some of it, and the skin and hair discolouration can be explained by a natural process of [[mummification]] after three months of exposure to the cold and winds. Furthermore, the initial suppression of files regarding the group's disappearance by Soviet authorities is sometimes mentioned as evidence of a cover-up, but the concealment of information regarding domestic incidents was standard procedure in the USSR and therefore far from peculiar. And by the late 1980s, all Dyatlov files had been released in some manner.&lt;ref name=spiked/&gt;

=== Paradoxical undressing ===
''International Science Times'' posited that the hikers' deaths were caused by [[hypothermia]], which can induce a behaviour known as [[paradoxical undressing]] in which hypothermic subjects remove their clothes in response to perceived feelings of burning warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/3571/20120801/dyatlov-pass-explained-science-solve-russias-terrifying.htm |last=Smith |first=Anthony |date=1 August 2012 |title=Dyatlov Pass Explained: How Science Could Solve Russia's Most Terrifying Unsolved Mystery |website=International Science Times |publisher=iScienceTimes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118145918/http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/3571/20120801/dyatlov-pass-explained-science-solve-russias-terrifying.htm |archive-date=18 January 2018 |dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is undisputed that six of the nine hikers died of hypothermia. However, others in the group appear to have acquired additional clothing (from those who had already died) which suggests that they were of a sound enough mind to try to add layers.

===Pseudoscientific theories===
The 2014 [[Discovery Channel]] special ''Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives'' explored the theory that the Dyatlov group was killed by a [[menk]] or Russian [[Yeti]]. The show begins with the premise that the skiers' injuries were such that only a creature with superhuman strength could have caused them.&lt;ref name="Radford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Radford|title=Dyatlov Pass and Mass Murdering Yeti?

=== Other ===
Keith McCloskey, who has researched the incident for many years and has appeared in several TV documentaries on the subject, travelled to the Dyatlov Pass in 2015 with Yury Kuntsevich of the Dyatlov Foundation and a group. At the Dyatlov Pass he noted:
* There were wide discrepancies in distances quoted between the two possible locations of the snow shelter where Dubinina, Kolevatov, Zolotarev and Thibault-Brignolles were found. One location was approximately 80 to 100 metres from the pine tree where the bodies of Doroshenko and Krivonischenko were found and the other suggested location was so close to the tree that anyone in the snow shelter could have spoken to those at the tree without raising their voices to be heard. This second location also has a rock in the stream where Dubinina’s body was found and is the more likely location of the two. However, the second suggested location of the two has a topography that is closer to the photos taken at the time of the search in 1959.{{sfn|McCloskey|2016|pages=52}}
* The location of the tent near the ridge was found to be too close to the spur of the ridge for any significant build-up of snow to cause an avalanche. Furthermore, the prevailing wind blowing over the ridge had the effect of blowing snow away from the edge of the ridge on the side where the tent was. This further reduced any build-up of snow to cause an avalanche. This aspect of the lack of snow on the top and near the top of the ridge was pointed out by Sergey Sogrin in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Sogrin,Sergey. "Was there any mystery in the Dyatlov Incident?". Uralsky Sledopyt. November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
McCloskey also noted: 
* Lev Ivanov’s boss, Evgeny Okishev (Deputy Head of the Investigative Department of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Prosecution Office), was still alive in 2015 and had given an interview to former Kemerovo prosecutor Leonid Proshkin in which Okishev stated that he was arranging another trip to the Pass to fully investigate the strange deaths of the last four bodies when Deputy Prosecutor General Urakov arrived from Moscow and ordered the case shut down.{{sfn|McCloskey|2016|pages=153-171}}
* Evgeny Okishev also stated in his interview with Leonid Proshkin that Klinov, head of the Sverdlovsk Prosecutor’s Office, was present at the first post mortems in the morgue and spent three days there. Something Okishev regarded as highly unusual and the only time, in his experience, it had happened.{{sfn|McCloskey|2016|pages=153-171}}

[[Donnie Eichar]], who investigated and made a documentary about the incident, evaluated several other theories that are deemed unlikely or have been discredited:&lt;ref name=spiked&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/dyatlov-pass-a-chilling-mystery-solved/16853 Dyatlov Pass: A Mystery Solved?], ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* They were attacked by [[Mansi people|Mansi]] or other local tribesmen.
:The local tribesmen were known to be peaceful and there was no track evidence of anyone approaching the tent.
* They were attacked and chased by animal wildlife.
:There were no animal tracks and the group would not have abandoned the relative security of the tent.
* High winds blew one member away, and the others attempted to rescue the person.
:A large experienced group would not have behaved like that, and winds strong enough to blow away people with such force would have also blown away the tent.
* An argument, possibly related to a romantic encounter that left some of them only partially clothed, led to a violent dispute.
:About this, Eichar states that it is "highly implausible. By all indications, the group was largely harmonious and sexual tension was confined to platonic flirtation and crushes. There were no drugs present and the only alcohol was a small flask of medicinal alcohol, found intact at the scene. The group had even sworn off cigarettes for the expedition." Furthermore, a fight could not have left the massive injuries that one body had suffered.

== In popular culture ==
Popular interest in Russia was revived in the 1990s in the wake of  Gushchin's 1990 novel, ''The Price of State Secrets Is Nine Lives.'' In 2000, a regional television company produced the documentary film, with a follow-up novella by Anna Matveyeva. Anna Kiryanova wrote a journal-style novel based on a fictionalized account of the incident in 2005.

In 2015 Russian band [[Kauan]] released the album ''Sorni Nai'' which attempts to reconstruct the events that led up to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angrymetalguy.com/best-and-worst-sounding-records-of-2015-angry-metal-fi/|title=Which Records Sounded the Best (and Worst) in 2015?|date=2 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident came to wider attention in popular media outside of Russia in the 2010s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105714">'''Exoplanetology''', or '''exoplanetary science''', is an integrated field of astronomical science dedicated to the search for and study of [[exoplanet]]s (extrasolar planets). It employs an interdisciplinary approach which includes [[astrobiology]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrogeology]], [[geochemistry]], and [[planetary science]].

== Nomenclature ==
{{Main|Exoplanet naming convention}}
The exoplanet naming convention is an extension of the system used for naming multiple-star systems as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). For an exoplanet orbiting a single star, the name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" (the parent star is considered to be "a") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbit size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the naming of [[circumbinary planet]]s. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.

== Definition ==

=== IAU ===
The official [[Definition of planet|definition of "planet"]] used by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) only covers the [[Solar System]] and thus does not apply to exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes
|date=2006
|url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/detail/iau0603/
|accessdate=25 April 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=Brit, R. R.
|date=2006
|title=Why Planets Will Never Be Defined
|url=http://www.space.com/3142-planets-defined.html
|work=[[Space.com]]
|accessdate=13 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2011, the only defining statement issued by the IAU that pertains to exoplanets is a working definition issued in 2001 and modified in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|date=28 February 2003
|title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets: Definition of a "Planet"
|url=http://astro.berkeley.edu/~basri/defineplanet/IAU-WGExSP.htm
|work=IAU position statement
|accessdate=23 November 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That definition contains the following criteria:

{{quote|
* Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
* Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarfs]]", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
* Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).
}}

=== Alternatives ===
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s working definition is not always used. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from [[brown dwarf]]s on the basis of formation. It is widely thought that giant planets form through core [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0710.5667 |title=Giant Planet Formation by Core Accretion| journal=Extreme Solar Systems |volume=398| page=235| bibcode = 2008ASPC..398..235M |author1=Mordasini| first1=C.| last2=Alibert| first2=Yann |last3=Benz| first3=W.| last4=Naef| first4=D.| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=0802.1810|title=Structure and evolution of super-Earth to super-Jupiter exoplanets.

Brown dwarfs form like stars from the direct gravitational collapse of clouds of gas and this formation mechanism also produces objects that are below the {{Jupiter mass|13|jup=y|link=y}} limit and can be as low as {{Jupiter mass|1|jup=y}}.&lt;ref name=ShivKumar&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=2003IAUS..211..529B| title=Nomenclature: Brown Dwarfs, Gas Giant Planets, and ?| last1=Kumar| first1=Shiv S.|volume=211| date=2003| page=532| journal=Brown Dwarfs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects in this mass range that orbit their stars with wide separations of hundreds or thousands of AU and have large star/object mass ratios likely formed as brown dwarfs; their atmospheres would likely have a composition more similar to their host star than accretion-formed planets which would contain increased abundances of heavier elements. Most directly imaged planets as of April 2014 are massive and have wide orbits so probably represent the low-mass end of brown dwarf formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/794/2/159| title = A Statistical Analysis of Seeds and Other High-Contrast Exoplanet Surveys: Massive Planets or Low-Mass Brown Dwarfs?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 794| issue = 2| page = 159| year = 2014| last1 = Brandt | first1 = T.

One study suggests that objects above {{Jupiter mass|10|jup=y}} formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06185 Evidence of an Upper Bound on the Masses of Planets and its Implications for Giant Planet Formation], Kevin C. Schlaufman, 18 Jan 2018. The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 853, Number 1, 2018 January 22, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa961c/meta&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with a mass below that cutoff.&lt;ref name="bodenheimer2013" /&gt; The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/57| title = The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 727| issue = 1| page = 57| year = 2011| last1 = Spiegel | first1 = D.

As of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00917 Exoplanets versus brown dwarfs: the CoRoT view and the future], Jean Schneider, 4 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt; based on a study of mass–density relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1506.05097|last1= Hatzes Heike Rauer|first1= Artie P.|title= A Definition for Giant Planets Based on the Mass-Density Relationship|year= 2015|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/810/2/L25|volume=810|issue= 2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|page=L25|bibcode = 2015ApJ...810L..25H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the [[#Mass|sin i ambiguity]]."&lt;ref name="eod"&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1012.5676 |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database|date=2010| bibcode = 2011PASP..123..412W |doi = 10.1086/659427| volume=123| issue=902|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific| pages=412–422| last1=Wright|first1=J.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core [[pressure]] is dominated by [[Lateral earth pressure#Coulomb theory|coulomb pressure]] or [[electron degeneracy pressure]] with the dividing line at around 5 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref name="whatbasribrown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Annu.

== Detection methods ==
{{Main article|Methods of detecting extrasolar planets}}

=== Direct imaging ===

[[File:Beta Pictoris.jpg|thumb|alt=Two directly imaged exoplanets around star Beta Pictoris, star-subtracted and artificially embellished with an outline of the orbit of one of the planets. The white dot in the center is the other exoplanet in the same system.|Directly imaged planet [[Beta Pictoris b]]]]
Planets are extremely faint compared with their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star in order to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme [[optothermal stability]].&lt;ref name="Perryman_book11"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Perryman|first = Michael|title = The Exoplanet Handbook|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2011|page = 149|isbn = 978-0-521-76559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than [[Jupiter]]) and widely separated from their parent star.

Specially designed direct-imaging instruments such as [[Gemini Planet Imager]], [[VLT-SPHERE]], and [[Subaru Telescope#Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system|SCExAO]] will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods. The following are the indirect methods that have proven useful:

=== Indirect methods ===
* [[Transit method]]
:[[File:Dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|alt=Edge-on animation of a star-planet system, showing the geometry considered for the transit method of exoplanet detection|When the star is behind a planet, its brightness will seem to dim]]If a planet crosses (or [[Astronomical transit|transits]]) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' telescope]] uses this method.

* [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Radial velocity|Radial velocity or Doppler method]]
:As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity—that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth—can be detected from displacements in the star's [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]]. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s or even somewhat less.&lt;ref name="Pepe_HarpsEarthlike11"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201117055| title = The HARPS search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone| journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| volume = 534| pages = A58| year = 2011| last1 = Pepe | first1 = F.| last2 = Lovis | first2 = C.| last3 = Ségransan | first3 = D.| last4 = Benz | first4 = W.| last5 = Bouchy | first5 = F.| last6 = Dumusque | first6 = X.| last7 = Mayor | first7 = M.| last8 = Queloz | first8 = D.| last9 = Santos | first9 = N.

:Microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in the magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1–10&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away from Sun-like stars.
* [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|Astrometry]]
:Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method has not yet been very productive. It has produced only a few disputed detections, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.
* [[Pulsar timing]]
:A [[pulsar]] (the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a [[supernova]]) emits radio waves extremely regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, they will cause slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses. [[PSR B1257+12|The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet]] was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.

:Disks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets.

== Orbital parameters ==
Most known extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered using indirect methods and therefore only some of their physical and orbital parameters can be determined. For example, out of the six independent [[orbital element|parameters]] that define an orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: [[semi-major axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[longitude of periastron]], and time of periastron. Two parameters remain unknown: [[inclination]] and [[longitude of the ascending node]].

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much further from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), takes 88 days for an orbit, but the smallest known orbits of exoplanets have orbital periods of only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in smaller orbits than Mercury's. [[Neptune]] is 30&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit it, but there are exoplanets that are thousands of AU from their star and take tens of thousands of years to orbit, e.g. [[GU Piscium b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technology.org/2014/05/14/enlightening-pisces-star-signs-lead-scientists-discovery/ |title=Enlightening Pisces star signs lead scientists to discovery |publisher=technology.org |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|radial-velocity]] and [[Transit method|transit]] methods are most sensitive to planets with small orbits.

The [[Kepler spacecraft|''Kepler'' space observatory]] has found planets with even shorter orbits of only a few hours, which places them within the star's upper atmosphere or [[corona]], and these planets are Earth-sized or smaller and are probably the left-over solid cores of giant planets that have evaporated due to being so close to the star,&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, Irene (15 August 2013) [http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/time-flies-on-these-kepler-planets-130815.htm "Time Really Flies on These Kepler Planets"].

The [[direct imaging]] method is most sensitive to planets with large orbits, and has discovered some planets that have planet–star separations of hundreds of AU. However, protoplanetary disks are usually only around 100&amp;nbsp;AU in radius, and [[Nebular hypothesis#Giant planets|core accretion models]] predict giant planet formation to be within 10&amp;nbsp;AU, where the planets can coalesce quickly enough before the disk [[photoevaporation|evaporates]].

Most planets that have been discovered are within a couple of AU from their host star because the most used methods (radial-velocity and transit) require observation of several orbits to confirm that the planet exists and there has only been enough time since these methods were first used to cover small separations. Some planets with larger orbits have been discovered by direct imaging but there is a middle range of distances, roughly equivalent to the Solar System's gas giant region, which is largely unexplored. Direct imaging equipment for exploring that region was installed on two large telescopes that began operation in 2014, e.g. [[Gemini Planet Imager]] and [[VLT-SPHERE]]. The [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#microlensing|microlensing]] method has detected a few planets in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;AU range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/?f=%22microlensing%22+IN+detection Catalog Listing]. Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt;
It appears plausible that in most exoplanetary systems, there are one or two giant planets with orbits comparable in size to those of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System. Giant planets with substantially larger orbits are now known to be rare, at least around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/878| title = A Uniform Analysis of 118 Stars with High-Contrast Imaging: Long-Period Extrasolar Giant Planets Are Rare Around Sun-Like Stars| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 717| issue = 2| pages = 878–896| year = 2010| last1 = Nielsen | first1 = E.

The distance of the [[#Habitability|habitable zone]] from a star depends on the type of star and this distance changes during the star's lifetime as the size and temperature of the star changes.

=== Eccentricity ===
The [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of an orbit is a measure of how elliptical (elongated) it is. All the planets of the Solar System except for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have near-circular orbits (e&lt;0.1).&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most exoplanets with orbital periods of 20 days or less have near-circular orbits, i.e. very low eccentricity. That is thought to be due to [[tidal circularization]]: reduction of eccentricity over time due to gravitational interaction between two bodies. The mostly sub-Neptune-sized planets found by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft with short orbital periods have very circular orbits.&lt;ref name="kepler1700"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's Kepler Mission Announces a Planet Bonanza, 715 New Worlds |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-mission-announces-a-planet-bonanza/ |date=26 February 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the giant planets with longer orbital periods discovered by radial-velocity methods have quite eccentric orbits. (As of July 2010, 55% of such exoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.2, whereas 17% have eccentricities greater than 0.5.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Moderate to high eccentricities (e&gt;0.2) of giant planets are ''not'' an observational selection effect, because a planet can be detected about equally well regardless of the eccentricity of its orbit. The statistical significance of elliptical orbits in the ensemble of observed giant planets is somewhat surprising, because current theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] suggest that low-mass planets should have their [[orbital eccentricity]] circularized by gravitational interactions with the surrounding [[protoplanetary disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Tanaka |first1=Hidekazu |title=Three-dimensional Interaction between a Planet and an Isothermal Gaseous Disk.

For weak [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler]] signals near the limits of the current detection ability, the eccentricity becomes poorly constrained and biased towards higher values. It is suggested that some of the high eccentricities reported for low-mass exoplanets may be overestimates, because simulations show that many observations are also consistent with two planets on circular orbits. Reported observations of single planets in moderately eccentric orbits have about a 15% chance of being a pair of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/702/1/716| title = Which Radial Velocity Exoplanets Have Undetected Outer Companions?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 702| issue = 1| pages = 716–723| year = 2009| last1 = Rodigas | first1 = T.

Radial velocity surveys found exoplanet orbits beyond 0.1 AU to be eccentric, particularly for large planets. Transit data obtained by the ''Kepler'' spacecraft, is consistent with the RV surveys and also revealed that smaller planets tend to have less eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1203.1631|bibcode = 2012MNRAS.425..757K |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.21627.x | volume=425 |issue = 1 |title=The exoplanet eccentricity distribution from Kepler planet candidates |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |pages=757–762|year = 2012 |last1 = Kane |first1 = Stephen R. |last2 = Ciardi |first2 = David R. |last3 = Gelino |first3 = Dawn M. |last4 = von Braun |first4 = Kaspar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle ===
[[Orbital inclination]] is the angle between a planet's [[orbital plane]] and another plane of reference. For exoplanets, the inclination is usually stated with respect to an observer on Earth: the angle used is that between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the planet's orbital plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star. Therefore, most planets observed by the [[transit method]] are close to 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, John (2008) ''Exoplanets: Detection, Formation, Properties, Habitability''.  Springer. {{ISBN|3-540-74007-4}}. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word 'inclination' is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin–orbit angle or spin–orbit alignment. In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. The ''Kepler'' spacecraft has found a few hundred multi-planet systems and in most of these systems the planets all orbit in nearly the same plane, much like the Solar System.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt; However, a combination of astrometric and radial-velocity measurements has shown that some planetary systems contain planets whose orbital planes are significantly tilted relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-tilt Out of Flatland: Orbits Are Askew in a Nearby Planetary System]. ''Scientific American''. 24 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of [[hot Jupiter]]s have orbital planes substantially misaligned with their parent star's rotation. A substantial fraction of hot-Jupiters even have [[retrograde orbit]]s, meaning that they orbit in the opposite direction from the star's rotation.&lt;ref name="2010question"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/nam2010/pr10.php |title=Turning planetary theory upside down |publisher=Astro.gla.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a planet's orbit having been disturbed, it may be that the star itself flipped early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727765.200-tilting-stars-may-explain-backwards-planets.html "Tilting stars may explain backwards planets"], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Vol. 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periastron precession ===
[[Apsidal precession|Periastron precession]] is the rotation of a planet's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. In the Solar System, perturbations from other planets are the main cause, but for close-in exoplanets the largest factor can be tidal forces between the star and planet. For close-in exoplanets, the [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contribution to the precession is also significant and can be orders of magnitude larger than the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|same effect for Mercury]]. Some exoplanets have significantly [[#Eccentricity|eccentric orbits]], which makes it easier to detect the precession. The effect of general relativity can be detectable in timescales of about 10 years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0806.0630| bibcode = 2008ApJ...685..543J |doi = 10.1086/590549 | volume=685| issue = 1 |title=Observability of the General Relativistic Precession of Periastra in Exoplanets|journal=The Astrophysical Journal| pages=543–552| year = 2008 |last1 = Jordán |first1 = Andrés |last2 = Bakos |first2 = Gáspár Á.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nodal precession ===
[[Nodal precession]] is rotation of a planet's orbital plane. Nodal precession is more easily seen as distinct from periastron precession when the orbital plane is [[inclination|inclined]] to the star's rotation, the extreme case being a polar orbit.

[[WASP-33]] is a fast-rotating star that hosts a [[hot Jupiter]] in an almost polar orbit. The [[Quadrupole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole mass moment]] and the proper [[angular momentum]] of the star are 1900 and 400 times, respectively, larger than those of the Sun. This causes significant [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|classical]] and [[general relativity|relativistic]] deviations from [[Kepler's laws]]. In particular, the fast rotation causes large nodal precession because of the star's [[oblateness]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession|Lense–Thirring effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1006.2707|doi = 10.1007/s10509-010-0468-x |bibcode = 2011Ap&amp;SS.331..485I | volume=331|issue = 2 |title=Classical and relativistic node precessional effects in WASP-33b and perspectives for detecting them| journal=Astrophysics and Space Science| pages=485–496| year = 2010 |last1 = Iorio |first1 = Lorenzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of spin and tilt of terrestrial planets ===
[[Impact event|Giant impacts]] have a large effect on the spin of [[terrestrial planets]]. The last few giant impacts during [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet's rotation rate. On average the spin [[angular velocity]] will be about 70% of the velocity that would cause the planet to break up and fly apart; the natural outcome of [[planetary embryo]] impacts at speeds slightly larger than [[escape velocity]]. In later stages terrestrial planet spin is also affected by impacts with [[planetesimal]]s. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three-dimensions. This results in the [[axial tilt]] of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde and retrograde]] spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with a small axial tilt, common for the Solar System's terrestrial planets except Venus, is not common in general for terrestrial planets built by giant impacts. The initial axial tilt of a planet determined by giant impacts can be substantially changed by stellar tides if the planet is close to its star and by satellite tides if the planet has a large satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |arxiv=1312.1689|bibcode = 2014prpl.conf..595R |doi = 10.2458/azu_uapress_9780816531240-ch026 | title=Terrestrial Planet Formation at Home and Abroad |journal=Protostars and Planets VI|page = 595 |year = 2014 |last1 = Raymond |first1 = S.

=== Tidal effects ===
For most planets, the rotation period and [[axial tilt]] (also called obliquity) are not known, but a large number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) that will probably have reached an [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] rotation that can be predicted (''i.e.'' [[tidally locked|tidal lock]], [[Mercury (planet)#Spin–orbit resonance|spin–orbit resonances]], and [[Retrograde and prograde motion#Planets|non-resonant equilibria such as retrograde rotation]]).&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

Gravitational tides tend to reduce the axial tilt to zero but over a longer timescale than the rotation rate reaches equilibrium. However, the presence of multiple planets in a system can cause axial tilt to be captured in a resonance called a [[Cassini state]]. There are small oscillations around this state and in the case of [[Mars]] these axial tilt variations are chaotic.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

[[Hot Jupiter]]s' close proximity to their host star means that their spin–orbit evolution is mostly due to the star's gravity and not the other effects. Hot Jupiters' rotation rate is not thought to be captured into spin–orbit resonance because of the way in which such a fluid-body reacts to tides; a planet like this therefore slows down into synchronous rotation if its orbit is circular, or, alternatively, it slows down into a non-synchronous rotation if its orbit is eccentric. Hot Jupiters are likely to evolve towards zero axial tilt even if they had been in a Cassini state during planetary migration when they were further from their star. Hot Jupiters' orbits will become more circular over time, however the presence of other planets in the system on eccentric orbits, even ones as small as Earth and as far away as the habitable zone, can continue to maintain the eccentricity of the Hot Jupiter so that the length of time for [[tidal circularization]] can be billions instead of millions of years.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt;

The rotation rate of planet [[HD 80606 b]] is predicted to be about 1.9 days.&lt;ref name="TidalEvoExop"/&gt; HD 80606 b avoids spin–orbit resonance because it is a gas giant. The eccentricity of its orbit means that it avoids becoming tidally locked.

=== Mass ===
When a planet is found by the [[radial-velocity method]], its [[#Inclination vs. spin–orbit angle|orbital inclination]] ''i'' is unknown and can range from 0 to 90 degrees. The method is unable to determine the [[true mass]] (''M'') of the planet, but rather gives a [[minimum mass|lower limit for its mass]], ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i''. In a few cases an apparent exoplanet may be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or red dwarf. However, the probability of a small value of i (say less than 30 degrees, which would give a true mass at least double the observed lower limit) is relatively low (1−{{radic|3}}/2 ≈ 13%) and hence most planets will have true masses fairly close to the observed lower limit.&lt;ref name="cumming08" /&gt;

If a planet's orbit is nearly perpendicular to the line of vision (i.e. ''i'' close to 90°), a planet can be detected through the [[transit method]]. The inclination will then be known, and the inclination combined with ''M''&amp;nbsp;sin''i'' from radial-velocity observations will give the planet's true mass.

Also, [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations and dynamical considerations in multiple-planet systems can sometimes provide an upper limit to the planet's true mass.

The mass of a transiting exoplanet can also be determined from the transmission spectrum of its atmosphere, as it can be used to constrain independently the atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and [[scale height]].&lt;ref name="JulienSeager2013"&gt;{{cite journal| last=de Wit| first=Julien|author2=Seager, S.| title=Constraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy| journal=Science| date=19 December 2013| volume=342| issue=6165|pages=1473–1477| arxiv=1401.6181| doi=10.1126/science.1245450| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1473|pmid=24357312| bibcode = 2013Sci...342.1473D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transit-timing variation]] can also be used to find a planet's mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/592230| title = Mass and Orbit Determination from Transit Timing Variations of Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 688| issue = 1| pages = 636–646| year = 2008| last1 = Nesvorný | first1 = D. | last2 = Morbidelli | first2 = A. | bibcode=2008ApJ...688..636N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radius, density, and bulk composition ===
Prior to recent results from the ''Kepler'' space observatory, most confirmed planets were [[gas giant]]s comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they are most easily detected. However, the planets detected by ''Kepler'' are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.&lt;ref name="kepler1700" /&gt;

If a planet is detectable by both the radial-velocity and the transit methods, then both its true mass and its radius can be determined, as well as its [[density]]. Planets with low density are inferred to be composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas planets of intermediate density are inferred to have water as a major constituent. A planet of high density is inferred to be rocky, like Earth and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System.

Gaseous planets that are hot is because they are close to their star, or because they are still hot from their formation and are expanded by the heat. For colder gas planets, there is a maximum radius which is slightly larger than Jupiter which occurs when the mass reaches a few Jupiter-masses. Adding mass beyond this point causes the radius to shrink.&lt;ref name="whatbasribrown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seager, S. and Lissauer, J. J.

{{Main article|Super-Earth|Mini-Neptune|Helium planet|Gas dwarf}}
If a planet has a radius and/or mass between that of Earth and Neptune, then there is a question about whether the planet is rocky like Earth, a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune, a small planet with a hydrogen/helium envelope (mini-Jupiter), or of some other composition.

Some of the Kepler transiting planets with radii in the range of 1–4 Earth radii have had their masses measured by radial-velocity or transit-timing methods. The calculated densities show that up to 1.5 Earth radii, these planets are rocky and that density increases with increasing radius due to gravitational compression. However, between 1.5 and 4 Earth radii the density decreases with increasing radius. This indicates that above 1.5 Earth radii, planets tend to have increasing amounts of volatiles and gas. Despite this general trend, there is a wide range of masses at a given radius, which could be because gas planets can have rocky cores of different masses and compositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/783/1/L6| title = The Mass-Radius Relation for 65 Exoplanets Smaller Than 4 Earth Radii| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 783| issue = 1| pages = L6| year = 2014| last1 = Weiss | first1 = L.

Excluding close-in planets that have lost their gas envelope due to stellar irradiation, studies of the [[metallicity]] of stars suggest a dividing line of 1.7 Earth radii between rocky planets and gas dwarfs, then another dividing line at 3.9 Earth radii between gas dwarfs and gas giants. These dividing lines are statistical trends and do not apply universally, because there are many other factors besides metallicity that affect planet formation, including distance from star – there may be larger rocky planets that formed at larger distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature13254| pmid = 24870544| title = Three regimes of extrasolar planet radius inferred from host star metallicities| journal = Nature| volume = 509| issue = 7502| pages = 593–595| year = 2014| last1 = Buchhave | first1 = L.

In 2014, new measurements of [[Kepler-10c]] found it to be a Neptune-mass planet (17 Earth masses) with a density higher than Earth's, indicating that Kepler-10c is composed mostly of rock with possibly up to 20% high-pressure water ice but without a hydrogen-dominated envelope.

[[Transit-timing variation]] measurements indicate that Kepler-52b, Kepler-52c and Kepler-57b have maximum masses between 30 and 100 times that of Earth, although the actual masses could be much lower. With radii about 2 Earth radii in size, they might have densities larger than that of an [[iron planet]] of the same size. They orbit very close to their stars, so they could each be the remnant core ([[chthonian planet]]) of an evaporated [[gas giant]] or [[brown dwarf]]. If a remnant core is massive enough it could remain in such a state for billions of years despite having lost the atmospheric mass.&lt;ref&gt;Mocquet, A.; Grasset, O.; Sotin, C.

Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars ([[B-type main-sequence star|B-type]] and [[O-type main-sequence star|O-type]] stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the [[protoplanetary disk]] would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high [[UV radiation]] and [[stellar wind|winds]] that could [[Photoevaporation|photoevaporate]] the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/521346| title = Mass‐Radius Relationships for Solid Exoplanets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 669| issue = 2| pages = 1279–1297| year = 2007| last1 = Seager | first1 = S.| last2 = Kuchner | first2 = M.| last3 = Hier‐Majumder | first3 = C.

For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13-Jupiter-mass limit used in the [[IAU]]'s working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold" /&gt;

Cold planets have a maximum radius because adding more mass at that point causes the planet to compress under the weight instead of increasing the radius. The maximum radius for solid planets is lower than the maximum radius for gas planets.&lt;ref name="mass/radius sold"/&gt;

=== Shape ===
When the size of a planet is described using its radius, this is approximating the shape by a sphere. However, the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles; so the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius, making it closer to an [[oblate spheroid]]. The oblateness of [[transit method|transiting]] exoplanets will affect the transit light curves. At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that [[HD 189733b]] is less oblate than [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="CarterWinn"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/709/2/1219| title = Empirical Constraints on the Oblateness of an Exoplanet| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 709| issue = 2| pages = 1219–1229| year = 2010| last1 = Carter | first1 = J.

If the planet is close to its star, then gravitational tides will elongate the planet in the direction of the star, making the planet closer to a [[triaxial ellipsoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015811| title = Distorted, nonspherical transiting planets: Impact on the transit depth and on the radius determination| journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| volume = 528| pages = A41| year = 2011| last1 = Leconte | first1 = J.| last2 = Lai | first2 = D.| last3 = Chabrier | first3 = G. | bibcode=2011A&amp;A...528A..41L|arxiv = 1101.2813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because tidal deformation is along a line between the planet and the star, it is difficult to detect from transit photometry; it will have an effect on the transit light curves an order of magnitude less than that caused by rotational deformation even in cases where tidal deformation is larger than rotational deformation (as is the case for tidally locked [[hot Jupiter]]s).&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Material rigidity of rocky planets and rocky cores of gas planets will cause further deviations from the aforementioned shapes.&lt;ref name="CarterWinn" /&gt; Thermal tides caused by unevenly irradiated surfaces are another factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0901.0735 |last1=Arras |first1=Phil |title=Thermal Tides in Short Period Exoplanets |last2=Socrates |first2=Aristotle |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface composition ===
Surface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with [[transmission spectroscopy]]. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1204.1544|bibcode = 2012ApJ...752....7H |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/752/1/7 | volume=752|issue = 1 | title=Theoretical Spectra of Terrestrial Exoplanet Surfaces| journal=The Astrophysical Journal| page=7|year = 2012 |last1 = Hu |first1 = Renyu |last2 = Ehlmann |first2 = Bethany L. |last3 = Seager |first3 = Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature of an exoplanet can be estimated by measuring the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star. For example, the planet [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly −220&amp;nbsp;°C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown [[albedo]], and because factors such as the [[greenhouse effect]] may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet [[HD 189733b]] has been estimated to have an average temperature of 1,205 K (932&amp;nbsp;°C) on its dayside and 973 K (700&amp;nbsp;°C) on its nightside.&lt;ref name="knutson_charbonneau07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05782 | url=http://www.ucolick.org/~jfortney/papers/Knutson07.pdf|arxiv=0705.0993 | pmid=17495920 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..183K  | title = A map of the day–night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7141 | pages = 183–6 | year = 2007 | last1 = Knutson | first1 = H.

=== Habitable zone ===
{{main article|Habitable zone}}
The habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: [[desert planet]]s (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

Planetary [[#Rotation and axial tilt|rotation rate]] is one of the major factors determining the [[#Atmospheric circulation|circulation of the atmosphere]] and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that [[albedo|reflect]] more and so can be habitable much closer to their star.

=== Ice ages and snowball states ===
{{See also|Ice age|Snowball Earth}}
The outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets are completely frozen, but  planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling then this creates more ice, but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling, creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen, this stops [[Solution weathering|carbon dioxide weathering]], resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a [[greenhouse effect]] which thaws the planet again. Planets with a large [[axial tilt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=1401.5323|bibcode = 2015P&amp;SS..105...43L|title = Habitability of Earth-like planets with high obliquity and eccentric orbits: Results from a general circulation model |journal = Planetary and Space Science|author1 = Linsenmeier |first1 = Manuel |last2 = Pascale |first2 = Salvatore |last3 = Lucarini |first3 = Valerio |year = 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.pss.2014.11.003 |volume=105 |pages=43–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; are less likely to enter snowball states and can retain liquid water further from their star. Large fluctuations of axial tilt can have even more of a warming effect than a fixed large tilt.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Peter (15 April 2014) [http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/04/15/astronomers-tilt-a-worlds-could-harbor-life/ Astronomers: 'Tilt-a-worlds' could harbor life]. www.washington.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2013.1129| pmid = 24611714| title = Effects of Extreme Obliquity Variations on the Habitability of Exoplanets| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 14| issue = 4| pages = 277–291| year = 2014| last1 = Armstrong | first1 = J.

=== Tidal heating ===
If a planet has an eccentric orbit, then [[tidal heating]] can provide another source of energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water. Tides also [[tidal circularization|circularize]] orbits over time so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2012.0851| pmid = 23537135| title = Tidal Venuses: Triggering a Climate Catastrophe via Tidal Heating| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 13| issue = 3| pages = 225–250| year = 2013| last1 = Barnes | first1 = R. | last2 = Mullins | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Meadows | first4 = V.

==Overview==
Each author has recorded the subjective experiences of various persons in violent environments and surroundings. These are the perspectives of the offenders, victims, noncombatants, soldiers, insurgents, black marketers, heroes, scavengers and researchers. Articles also show how anthropologists are often compelled to create innovative data gathering strategies when working in the midst of dangerous environments.

[[File:Fitzhugh Nagumo Phase Space Graph.png|thumb|right|The blue line is the trajectory of the FHN model in phase space. The pink line is the cubic nullcline and the yellow line is the linear nullcline. In this case &lt;math&gt;I_{\rm ext}=0.5, a=0.8, b=0.7&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The '''FitzHugh&amp;ndash;Nagumo model''' ('''FHN'''), named after [[Richard FitzHugh]] (1922&amp;ndash;2007) who suggested the system in 1961 and J. Nagumo ''et al''. who created the equivalent circuit the following year, describes a prototype of an excitable system (e.g., a [[neuron]]).

The FHN Model is an example of a [[relaxation oscillator]] because, if the external stimulus &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{ext}}&lt;/math&gt; exceeds a certain threshold value, the system will exhibit a characteristic excursion in [[phase space]], before the variables &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; relax back to their rest values.

This behaviour is typical for spike generations (a short, nonlinear elevation of membrane voltage  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, diminished over time by a slower, linear recovery variable &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;) in a neuron after stimulation by an external input current.

The equations for this [[dynamical system]] read

: &lt;math&gt;
\dot{v}=v-\frac{v^3}{3} - w + I_{\rm ext} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\tau \dot{w} = v+a-b w.
&lt;/math&gt;

The dynamics of this system can be nicely described by zapping between the left and right branch of the cubic [[nullcline]].

The FitzHugh&amp;ndash;Nagumo model is a simplified version of the [[Hodgkin&amp;ndash;Huxley model]] which models in a detailed manner activation and deactivation dynamics of a spiking neuron. In the original papers of FitzHugh, this model was called '''Bonhoeffer&amp;ndash;van der Pol oscillator''' (named after [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] and [[Balthasar van der Pol]]) because it contains the [[van der Pol oscillator]] as a special case for &lt;math&gt; a=b=0 &lt;/math&gt;. The equivalent circuit was suggested by Jin-ichi Nagumo, Suguru Arimoto, and Shuji Yoshizawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=647|title=SIAM: Obituaries: Jin-Ichi Nagumo|website=www.siam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries''' is an American corporation that owns and operates a chain of [[Cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[Mortuary|mortuaries]] in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Orange County, California|Orange]], and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] counties in [[Southern California]]. The company was founded by a group of San Francisco businessmen in 1906. [[Hubert L. Eaton|Dr. Hubert Eaton]] assumed management control in 1917 and is credited with being Forest Lawn's "founder" because of his origination of the "memorial-park" plan. The first location was in Tropico, which later became part of [[Glendale, California]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Its facilities are officially known as ''memorial parks''. The parks are best known for the large number of [[celebrity]] burials, especially in the Glendale and Hollywood Hills locations. Eaton opened the first mortuary ([[funeral home]]) on dedicated cemetery grounds after a battle with established funeral directors who saw the "combination" operation as a threat. He remained as general manager until his death in 1966 when he was succeeded by his nephew, Frederick Llewellyn.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Garnett Silk''' (born '''Garnet Damion Smith'''; 2 April 1966 – 9 December 1994), was a Jamaican [[reggae]] musician and [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]], known for his diverse, emotive, powerful and smooth voice. During the early 1990s he was hailed as a rising talent, however his career was ended by his early death in 1994, while attempting to save his mother from her burning house.

==Biography==

===Little Bimbo===
Smith was born in [[Manchester, Jamaica]].  His musical career began at the age of twelve, when he performed under the name Little Bimbo.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Dave (2002) "Reggae &amp; Caribbean Music", Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s he worked as a [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]] on [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] such as ''Conquering Lion'', ''Soul Remembrance'', ''Pepper's Disco'', ''Stereophonic'', and ''Destiny Outernational'' (where he first met [[Tony Rebel]]).&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He recorded his first track in 1985, but it would be two years later before his first single, "Problem Everywhere" was released.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; An album of material from this period (''Journey'') was later released. In 1988, he joined [[Sugar Minott]]'s ''Youth Promotion'' label, releasing "No Disrespect", and working regularly with Tony Rebel, Smith now being billed simply as 'Bimbo'. The pair began performing as a duo around the sound systems to much acclaim. The ''Garnett Silk Meets the Conquering Lion: A Dub Plate Selection'' album dates from about this time and features a clutch of exclusive recordings the DJ cut for the sound system from the mid-1980s through the end of the decade. Rebel, a [[Rastafari movement|Rastarfari]], eventually converted Smith to his religion with the help of [[dub poetry|dub poet]] [[Yasus Afari]], a close friend of both the DJs.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

===Singing career===
In 1989, at the suggestion of veteran singer [[Derrick Morgan]], Smith turned from deejaying to singing, with a recording session at [[Bunny Lee]]'s studio with Rebel, including tracks recorded separately, as a duo, and with Anthony Selassie, and he began working under his real name.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The [[Heartbeat Records|Heartbeat]] label's ''[[Tony Rebel Meets Garnett Silk in a Dancehall Conference]]'' compiles these early Morgan-overseen recordings. The success of this session led him to continue as a singer, going on to work with producers [[King Tubby]], [[Prince Jammy]], and [[Donovan Germain]], before signing a two-year contract with [[Steely &amp; Clevie]] in 1990, recording an album's worth of songs for them. It was the production duo who decided to change his name to Garnet Silk, in reference to his smooth voice.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonitto, Brian (2014) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Garnet-Silk-earns-his-name-_18031145 Garnet Silk earns his name]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 29 November 2014. Retrieved 29 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of the tracks recorded during this period, "We Can Be Together," a duet with [[Chevelle Franklin]], was actually released at the time, and discouraged by this, he returned to Manchester and threw himself into songwriting, often in partnership with an old friend, Anthony "Fire" Rochester.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Another encounter with Tony Rebel brought an introduction to Courtney Cole, owner of the Roof International label. Silk would record a plethora of songs at the producer's [[Ocho Rios]] studio, amongst them were the hits "Mama," "Seven Spanish Angels," and a cover of the [[Johnny Nash]] classic "I Can See Clearly Now". Roof International would posthumously bundle up these early singles and other material recorded at this time for the ''Nothing Can Divide Us'' album, which the [[VP Records|VP]] label picked up for the US

By 1992, Silk was in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] in the studio with producer [[Bobby Digital (Jamaican producer)|Bobby Digital]], recording his debut album ''It's Growing''. Split between deeply cultural themes, spiritual songs, and romantic numbers, the album went on to become one of the best selling in Jamaica that year, and he had his first major [[hit single]] with "Hey Mama Africa" (produced by Richard "Bello" Bell) for the Star Trail label, which was Silk's first international hit, and topped the reggae chart in Britain.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Over the next two years, the singer would record with most of the major name producers on the island, both on his own and in partnership with Tony Rebel. He cut a swathe of songs with King Jammy, including "Fill Us Up With Your Mercy" and "Lord Watch Over Our Shoulders." The latter track titled a 1994 compilation released by the Greensleeves label in the UK and boasts seven Jammy cuts and a clutch of hits for other producers.

1993's ''Gold'', released by the UK Charm label, bundled up more hits from this period. Amongst them was "Zion in a Vision," a Jamaican number one cut with producer [[Black Scorpio|Jack Scorpio]], as well as "Hey Mama Africa". he also recorded for [[Sly &amp; Robbie]], including the deeply religious "Thank You, Jah" and the haunting "Green Line." But the pace was becoming too much and Silk collapsed during a show at the Ritz in New York City, suffering from low blood pressure and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The exhausted singer was forced to cancel all his scheduled appearances for the next six months, most crucially of all, what would have been his debut at [[Reggae Sumfest]]. However, Silk bounced back in 1994 and set back to work. In a show of good grace, he rejoined Steely &amp; Clevie and cut the "Love Is the Answer" single, another massive hit. "Fight Back," produced by Richie Stephens, was next up. By then, the singer was ready to re-take the stage, which he did with a vengeance, headlining that year's Reggae Sumfest and [[Reggae Sunsplash]] festivals.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; His set at the latter event was captured for the ''Live at Reggae Sunsplash 1994'' album, released in 1999 by the Tabou1 label. Silk's backing band was Jahpostles, who originally formed in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Campbell2012"&gt;Campbell, Howard (2012) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/Entertainment/Jahpostles-trod-on_12486182 Jahpostles trod on]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 10 September 2012, retrieved 10 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Having signed an international distribution deal with [[Atlantic Records]], Silk now entered [[Tuff Gong]] studios with producer [[Errol Brown]] and the cream of Jamaica's session men (including [[Aston Barrett]], Sly &amp; Robbie, [[Tyrone Downie]], [[Earl "Chinna" Smith]], and [[Uziah "Sticky" Thompson]]), to begin work on his second album. He'd recorded ten songs and the album was nearing completion when he went home to visit his mother. Silk had borrowed a pair of guns from his attorney after his home had been burglarized, but had no idea how to use them. Sitting with a couple of friends at his mother's house in [[Mandeville, Jamaica]], on 9 December, one offered to show him how they worked, at which point the gun accidentally misfired, hitting a [[propane]] tank and setting the house ablaze.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The singer, his friends, and his two brothers made it out safely, only to discover that Silk's mother was still trapped inside. The singer rushed back into the house to save her, but it was too late and both were lost in the fire.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

===Posthumous===
Silk's music has been kept alive by several tributes, including [[Macka B]]'s "Tribute to Garnett Silk" and the Earth Day concert, and numerous compilation albums, including two collections of his dubplates, ''Kilamanjaro Remembers Garnett Silk'' (Jam Down, 1999) and ''Rule Dem'' (Trojan/Sanctuary 2006).

In 2000, Atlantic finally released ''The Definitive Collection'', a two-CD set showcasing the ten tracks the singer had recorded during sessions for his unfinished second album.

[[Jet Star (record distribution company)|Jet Star]] also released a greatest hits [[compilation album]], ''[[Gold (Garnett Silk album)|Gold]]'' in 2000. The album contains some of Silk's most well known songs including: "Hello Africa", "Mama", "Oh Me, Oh My" and "Jah, Jah is the Ruler".&lt;ref name="allmusic1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jo-Ann Greene |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gold-jet-star-mw0000108325 |title=Gold [Jet Star&amp;#93; - Garnett Silk : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2000-08-22 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silk's son Garnet Smith Jr. has followed him into a career in music.&lt;ref name="CambLiv"&gt;Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2012) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/Entertainment/As-smooth-as-Silk- As smooth as Silk?]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 2 November 2012, retrieved 10 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Silk's nephew Anthony Cruz recorded a tribute album in 2013, featuring cover versions of fifteen of Silk's songs.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Simone (2013) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Tribute-to-Garnet-Silk_14733116 Tribute to Garnet Silk]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 24 July 2013.

'''George W. Adey''' (1869 – after 1901) was an English professional [[association football|footballer]] born in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], [[Birmingham]], who played as a [[wing half]] or [[inside forward]]. He made 71 appearances for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]] in [[the Football League]], and went on to play for [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joyce |first=Michael |title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939 |publisher=SoccerData (Tony Brown) |location=Nottingham |year=2004 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Tony |title=Birmingham City: A Complete Record |year=1995 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |page=68 |isbn=978-1-85983-010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1901 profile of the Small Heath club and players in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', [[C.B. Fry]] wrote that "Adey is not showy, but he is a fine tackler, and remarkably persistent", and that he and his half-back colleagues [[Alex Leake]] and [[Walter Wigmore]] "get through an amount of work that is simply astonishing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fry |first=C.B. |authorlink=C.B.

End comment--&gt;

The Grail Movement is a [[new spiritual movement]] dedicated to the dissemination and spread of the work ''[[In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message]]'' by Abd-ru-shin.  Most members reside in 16 countries across Europe, primarily Germany and France, with the Grail Movement reporting hundreds of members in Britain and in the USA. It can also be found in  [[Canada]], Brazil and currently established in twenty-two (22) [[Africa]]n countries such as [[Nigeria]], Zaire ([[DR Congo]]) and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], as well as in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Ecuador amongst others.

Worldwide, there are approximately 10,000 members of the Grail Movement. A declaration of the personal commitment to adhere to the principles of the Grail Message can be made by a request for the "Sealing", a Grail Act (ceremony) that takes place during one of three annual Grail Festivals. This, however, is a personal decision on the part of the individual and leads neither to commitment to an organization nor to formal links with other adherents.

==Background==
&lt;!-- History of the group needs to be added --&gt;
The Grail Movement had its beginnings when Oskar Ernst Bernhardt took up residence in Vomperberg, Tyrol (Austria) in 1928, in order to focus on the writing of his major work "In the Light of Truth" - The Grail Message (as Abd Ru Shin), which was then followed by other works.

The establishment of the Grail Settlement on Vomperberg came about when groups of readers of The Grail Message, wishing to live and work in his immediate vicinity, took up residence there. The Settlement developed gradually; adding residences, work and administration buildings and then a small hall with seating for about 300 people. This hall was used by Abd-ru-shin for Sunday Hours of Worship and for the three annual Grail Festivals, Easter Festival etc., to which adherents of the Grail Message also journeyed.

This development was interrupted in 1938 when the Nazi regime annexed Austria and expropriated the Grail Settlement. Abd-ru-shin was arrested on the first day of the annexation and taken to Innsbruck prison. All residents were expelled so that the Settlement could be used as a Nazi training camp. Abd-ru-shin was eventually released but kept under house arrest and surveillance until he died in 1941 in Kipsdorf, Germany.

It was not until late in 1945 when the Allies returned the Settlement to his widow Maria Bernhardt that, under her direction, new development began. During this time the term "Grail Movement" was in common use, as a group designation for adherents of the Grail Message. Over the years national Grail Movements have formed in many countries, some of which, (e.g., Canada, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Congo (Zaire) and Nigeria) have built their own Halls of Worship although Abd-ru-shin had explicitly stated in his writings that he had not come to establish a new religion.&lt;ref&gt;https://grail-message.com/for-your-guidance-100/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14570">[[File:Idealisti italiani.png|upright=1.7|thumb|[[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]]]]
'''Italian idealism''', born from interest in the [[German idealism|German one]] and particularly in [[Hegelism|Hegelian]] doctrine, developed in [[Italy]] starting from the [[spiritualism]] of the nineteenth-century [[Risorgimento]] tradition, and culminated in the first half of the twentieth century in its two greatest exponents: [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]].

==Risorgimento Hegelianism==
In the age of [[Romanticism]], Italian patriots' philosophical circles, especially in [[Naples]], found in [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] the way to give a spiritual and cultural imprint to the historical path towards [[Italian unification|national unification]].&lt;ref&gt;Guido Oldrini, ''Gli Hegeliani di Napoli'', Milan, Feltrinelli, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in the Hegelian doctrine in Italy spread especially for the works of [[Augusto Vera]] (1813–1885) and [[Bertrando Spaventa]] (1817–1883), without omitting also the importance of the studies on Hegel "[[Aesthetic]]" by [[Francesco De Sanctis]] (1817–1883), author of the ''[[Storia della letteratura italiana (De Sanctis)|Storia della letteratura italiana]]''.

De Sanctis's concept of [[art]] and of [[italian literature|literary history]], inspired by Hegel, will stimulate the genesis of Crocian idealism.&lt;ref name=Garin974&gt;{{harvnb|Garin|2008|pp=974–976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augusto Vera]], author of writings and commentaries about Hegel, was a famous philosopher in Europe, who interpreted the Hegelian [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] in a [[religion|religious]] and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] sense.&lt;ref name=Garin961&gt;{{harvnb|Garin|2008|pp=961–964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposite interpretation was formulated by [[Bertrando Spaventa|Bertrand Spaventa]], for whom the [[Spirit]] was [[immanent]] in the [[history of philosophy]].

Reconstructing the development of [[Italian philosophy]], Spaventa argued that [[Italian Renaissance]] thought of [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] had been at the origin of [[modern philosophy]], but had stopped due to the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Its task now was to catch up with [[European philosophy]], linking up with [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]]'s mind philosophy, which along with those of [[Pasquale Galluppi|Galluppi]], [[Antonio Rosmini|Rosmini]], and [[Vincenzo Gioberti|Gioberti]], had anticipated themes of [[Kantism]] and [[German idealism]].
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|it|Se la filosofia non è una vana esercitazione dell'intelletto, ma quella forma reale della vita umana, nella quale si compendiano e trovano il loro vero significato tutti i momenti anteriori dello spirito, è cosa naturale che un popolo libero si riconosca e abbia la vera coscienza di se stesso anche ne' suoi filosofi.&lt;ref name=Spaventa/&gt;}}
|If philosophy is not a vain exercise of the intellect, but the real form of human life within which are compounded and find their true meaning all the past moments of the spirit, then it is natural for a free people to recognize itself and find the true conscience of itself in its own philosophers.&lt;ref name=Spaventa&gt;[[Bertrando Spaventa]], ''[https://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/s/spaventa/la_filosofia_italiana/odt/spaventa_la_filosofia_italiana.odt La filosofia italiana nelle sue relazioni con la filosofia europea]'', [[Giovanni Gentile]] ed., Bari: G. Laterza &amp; f., 1908 (translated by [[Eugenio Garin]], ''History of Italian Philosophy'', Giorgio A. Pinton ed., vol. 1, page XLV, Rodopi, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spaventa reformulated the [[Hegelian dialectic]], reinterpreting it from the perspective of [[Kant]]ian and [[Fichte|Fichtian]] conscientialism or [[subjectivism]].
He considered the act of [[thinking]] prevalent with respect to the phases of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectification]] and synthesis. That is, he supported the need to «mentalise» [[Hegel]], because the [[Mind]] is the protagonist of every original production.
The [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of the actual thinking of the [[Spirit]] was then placed by Spaventa, as the only reality, not only after the hegelian moments of [[Idea]] and of [[Nature]], but so as to permeate them also from the beginning.&lt;ref name=Garin964&gt;{{harvnb|Garin|2008|pp=964–974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentile and Croce==
{{see also|Actual idealism}}
After a parenthesis characterized by [[positivism]], in 1913 [[Giovanni Gentile]] (1875–1944) with the publication of ''The reform of Hegelian dialectics'' resumed Spaventa's interpretation of the Hegelian [[Idea]], seeing in Hegelian [[Spirit]] the category of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] as coinciding with the [[pure act]] of thought in which the whole [[reality]] of nature, history and spirit was transfused.&lt;ref name=Garin995&gt;{{harvnb|Garin|2008|pp=995–1066}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Every thing exists only in the mental act of thinking it: there are no single empirical entities separated from the [[Transcendentals|trascendental]] [[consciousness]]; even the [[past]] lives only in the actual, [[present]] moment of memory. To Gentile, who considered himself the "philosopher of [[Fascism]]",&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Moss (2004), ''[https://books.google.it/books?id=a3ufdGvSo1MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:082046838X&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiez8Os0NfZAhUpDMAKHWz1ApkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mussolini's Fascist Philosopher: Giovanni Gentile Reconsidered]''. New York: Peter Lang. {{ISBN|9780820468389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[actual idealism]] was the sole remedy to [[philosophy|philosophically]] preserving [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free]] [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], by making the act of thinking self-creative and, therefore, without any contingency and not in the potency of any other fact.&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt;

Gentile reproached [[Hegel]] for having built his [[dialectic]] with elements proper to "thought", that is to say that of determined [[thought]] and of the [[sciences]]. For Gentile, instead, only in "thinking in action" is dialectical [[self-consciousness]] that includes everything.
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|it|Una concezione idealistica mira a concepire lo stesso assoluto, il tutto, come idea: ed è perciò intrinsecamente idealismo assoluto. Ma assoluto l'idealismo non può essere se l'idea non coincide con lo stesso atto del conoscerla; perché - è questa la più profonda origine delle difficoltà in cui si dibatte il platonismo - se l'idea non fosse lo stesso atto per cui l'idea si conosce, l'idea lascerebbe fuori di sè qualche cosa, e l'idealismo pertanto non sarebbe più assoluto.&lt;ref name=Gentile&gt;[[Giovanni Gentile]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/thetheoryofminda00gentuoft#page/n1/mode/2up The Theory of Mind as Pure Act]'' [1916], chapter XVII, § 1, pp. 253-254, translated by Herbert Wildon Carr, London, Macmillan, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
|An idealistic conception aims at conceiving the absolute, the whole, as an idea, and is therefore intrinsically absolute idealism. But absolute it cannot be unless the idea coincides with the act of knowing it, because — and here we find the very root of the difficulty in which Platonism is entangled — were the idea not the act itself through which it is known, it would leave something outside itself, and the idealism would then no longer be absolute.&lt;ref name=Gentile/&gt;}}

Gentile made a pivotal distinction to factors concerning Idealism's own criteria for reality, which have stood since [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s adage «''esse est percipi''» by distinguishing between the [[abstract and concrete|concrete]] real «act of thinking» (''pensiero pensante''), and the abstract «static thought» (''pensiero pensato'').&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt;

To his actual vision was opposed since 1913 [[Benedetto Croce]] (1866–1952, cousin of [[Bertrando Spaventa]]) who in his ''Essay on Hegel'' interpreted Hegelian thought as immanentist [[historicism]]: he also understood the Hegelian dialectic of the opposites in a different way, integrating it with that of the «distincts».&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt; According to Croce, in fact, the life of the [[Spirit]] also consists of autonomous moments that are not opposed, but rather distinct, that is: 
*"[[Art]]", [[intuitive]] [[knowledge]] of the [[particular]], which aims to [[beauty]]; 
*"[[Philosophy]]", [[logical]] knowledge of the [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]], which aims to [[truth]]; 
*"[[Economy]]",  [[volition (psychology)|volition]] of the particular, which aims to [[useful]]; 
*"[[Ethics]]", volition of the universal, which aims to [[good]].&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt;

Referring to [[Giambattista Vico]], Croce identified [[philosophy]] with [[history]], understood not as a capricious sequence of events, but the implementation of [[Reason]], in the light of which it becomes possible the historical understanding of the genesis of facts, and their simultaneous justification with her own unfolding.
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|it|La storia non è mai giustiziera, ma sempre giustificatrice; e giustiziera non potrebbe farsi se non facendosi ingiusta, ossia confondendo il pensiero con la vita, e assumendo come giudizio del pensiero le attrazioni e le repulsioni del sentimento.&lt;ref name=Croce&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''[https://books.google.it/books?id=5FHuAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Theory and history of historiography]'' [1917], p. 89, translated by Douglas Ainslie, London, Harrap, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
|History never metes out justice, but always ''justifies''; she could not carry out the former act without making herself unjust — that is to say, confounding thought with life, taking the attractions and repulsions of sentiment for the judgments of thought.&lt;ref name=Croce/&gt;}}
[[Historian]]'s task is therefore to overcome every form of [[emotion]]ality towards the studied matter, and to present it in form of [[knowledge]], without referring to good or evil.&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt;

After having characterized Italian philosophical [[Italian culture|culture]] for over forty years, after the [[second world war]] the neo-idealism entered a crisis, replaced by [[existentialism]], [[neo-positivism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[marxism]].&lt;ref name=Garin995/&gt;

'''Jacksonville Jane Doe''' (officially known as ''' Jane Doe 95-7000''') is the name given to a set of female human remains, discovered in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina]] on December 6, 1995.&lt;ref name=doenetwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=hb /&gt; The woman has yet to be identified.&lt;ref name=jd /&gt;&lt;ref name=face&gt;{{cite web|title=Putting a face to a mystery  Featuring Project EDAN|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/media/news29.html|accessdate=25 February 2014|author=Mike Sherrill and Kinea White|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her face has since been [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]], in 2D as well as 3D, as an attempt to show what she may have looked like when she was alive.&lt;ref name=doenetwork&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 319UFNC|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/319ufnc.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=face /&gt;&lt;ref name=news /&gt;

==Physical characteristics==

[[File:Jacksonville Jane Doe.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructions by Wesley Neville]]

The body was found in a field, believed to have been disposed around two years before.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt; She stood at approximately between 5'5" and 5'8" tall and her weight could not be estimated due to the condition of her body. The victim's age range was estimated to have been between the early and late 30s, although [[The Doe Network]] reports that the age range was as large as 25 to 40.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt;&lt;ref name= jd/&gt; Near the [[skeleton]] was a strand of reddish hair that may have belonged to her. She had various evidence of dental work on her teeth, although some had protruded from her mouth. Examination of her body also indicated she had a divided rib.&lt;ref name=hb&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacksonville Jane Doe 95-7000|url=http://www.hellbeasts.com/?p=4953|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=face /&gt; Items such as a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoe, gold jewelry, hoop earrings, red, black and yellow clothing, a hotel key, and subway tokens were also present at the scene.&lt;ref name=doenetwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=news /&gt;  No evidence of foul play was found on her bones, although it is believed that she was murdered.&lt;ref name=hb /&gt;

Boatswain's Mate '''John Breen''' (1827 to December 13, 1875) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] soldier who fought in the [[American Civil War]]. Breen received the United States' highest award for bravery during combat, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his action at Petersburg, [[Virginia]] on 3 October 1862. He was honored with the award on 3 April 1863.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html |title=Civil War (A-L) Medal of Honor Recipients |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milwaukee"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cemeteries.org/news0010.asp |title=Medal of Honor Recipient - John Breen Honored at Calvary on Saturday, October 2, 2004 |accessdate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002131810/http://www.cemeteries.org/news0010.asp |archivedate= 2 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Breen was born in 1827 in [[Ireland]] to William and Margaret Breen. He moved to New York and first enlisted into the United States Navy in 1852 under the name Charles Mercer. He was discharged after three years but later reenlisted under his correct name at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. During this service he was assigned to various vessels including the U.S.S. Brandywine, the U.S.S. Seymour and the U.S.S. Commodore Perry. It was aboard the USS Commodore that Breen earned the Medal of Honor for his action on 3 October 1862 in successfully repelling Confederate ground troops positioned at the Blackwater River.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee"/&gt;

Following the war, Breen and his wife, Ellen Grant, relocated to Milwaukee where he continued a career as a sailor.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee"/&gt; He died on 13 December 1875 of acute pneumonia and his remains are interred at the Calvary Cemetery and Mausoleum in Milwaukee.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=1&amp;f=5&amp;t=280253 |title=Students give forgotten Civil War hero a proper tribute |date=30 September 2004 |first=Jim |last=Stingl |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hodiak''' (April 16, 1914 – October 19, 1955) was an American actor who worked in radio, stage and film.

==Early life==
Hodiak was born in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, the son of Walter Hodiak (October 25, 1888 – August 21, 1962) and Anna Pogorzelec (February 28, 1888 – October 17, 1971). He was of Ukrainian and Polish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Successor to Gable?|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2622669/big_spring_daily_herald/|agency=Big Springs Daily Herald|date=September 30, 1943|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 15, 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodiak grew up in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]].

==Acting career==
Hodiak had his first theatrical experience at age 11, acting in Ukrainian and Russian plays at the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. From the moment he first appeared on the stage, he resolved to become an actor. Hodiak was not even swayed when as a third baseman on his local high school baseball team, he was offered a contract with a St. Louis Cardinals [[farm team|farm club]]. He turned the offer down.

===Radio===
When Hodiak first tried out for a radio acting job, he was turned down because of his accent. He became a [[caddie]] at a Detroit golf course, then worked at a Chevrolet automobile factory – and practiced his diction. When he conquered the diction hurdle, he became a radio actor and moved to Chicago. There Hodiak created the role of the comic strip character [[Li'l Abner]] on radio.&lt;ref name="Maltin p. 401"&gt;Maltin 1994, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article220424944 |title=From Radio To Screen |newspaper=[[Voice (Hobart)|Voice]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |location=Tasmania, Australia |date=11 January 1947 |accessdate=31 October 2017 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodiak also had the role of McCullough in the radio soap opera ''[[Girl Alone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairfax |first1=Arthur |title=Mr. Fairfax Replies |journal=Movie Radio Guide |date=December 28, 1940 |volume=10 |issue=12 |page=43 |url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/Movie%20Radio%20Guide/MRG%20410103.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119064204/http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/Movie%20Radio%20Guide/MRG%20410103.pdf |archivedate=January 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36947808 |title=JOHN HODIAK and his wife |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |volume=62 |issue=3,536 |location=Western Australia |date=3 April 1947 |accessdate=31 October 2017 |page=22 (Women's Magazine) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood===
Hodiak arrived in Hollywood in 1942 and signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. He refused to change his name, saying, "I like my name. It sounds like I look."

Hodiak was cast in a few small parts at MGM, including ''[[A Stranger in Town (1943 film)|A Stranger in Town]]'' (1943), ''[[I Dood It]]'' (1943) and ''[[Swing Shift Maisie]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article135045009 |title=Introducing JOHN HODIAK |newspaper=[[The North Western Courier]] |volume=XXVII |issue=57 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 July 1945 |accessdate=31 October 2017 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stardom===
[[File:Lifeboat (1944) 1.jpg|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;L-R: [[Walter Slezak]], John Hodiak, [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Henry Hull]], [[William Bendix]], [[Heather Angel (actress)|Heather Angel]], [[Mary Anderson (actress, born 1918)|Mary Anderson]], [[Canada Lee]], and [[Hume Cronyn]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944)]]

Hodiak then caught the eye of [[film director|director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and, on loan to [[20th Century Fox]], was featured in ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) opposite [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

MGM was impressed and cast him in the third lead in ''[[Song of Russia]]'' (1944) supporting Robert Taylor and [[Susan Peters]]. He was [[Ann Sothern]]'s love interest in ''[[Maisie Goes to Reno]]'' (1944) and competed with [[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]] for [[Lana Turner]] in ''[[Marriage Is a Private Affair]]'' (1944).

20th Century Fox borrowed Hodiak again to play the title role in ''[[Sunday Dinner for a Soldier]]'' (1944), opposite [[Anne Baxter]] whom he married in real life. Fox kept him on to play Maj. Joppolo in ''[[A Bell for Adano]]'' ([[1945 in film|1945]]) opposite [[Gene Tierney]].&lt;ref name="Maltin p. 401"/&gt;

Back at MGM, Hodiak was in ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), second billed as [[Judy Garland]]'s love interest.

Fox gave him his first proper star part in ''[[Somewhere in the Night (film)|Somewhere in the Night]]'' (1946), directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]. Hodiak played opposite [[Lucille Ball]] in MGM's ''[[Two Smart People]]'' (1946), which lost money. So too did the thriller ''[[The Arnelo Affair]]'' (1947).

===Supporting Actor===
Hodiak went to Paramount for ''[[Desert Fury]]'' (1947), playing third lead to [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]]. He starred in ''[[Love from a Stranger (1947 film)|Love from a Stranger]]'' (1947) for [[Eagle Lion]], then supported Lana Turner and [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Homecoming (1948 film)|Homecoming]]'' (1948). He supported Gable again in ''[[Command Decision (film)|Command Decision]]'' (1948). The two Gable films were hits but Hodiak was voted "box office poison" by exhibitors at the end of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55923929 "Mary Armitage's Film Close-ups."] ''Sunday Mail (Adelaide)'' Sunday Magazine Supplement, January 29, 1949, p. 3. Retrieved: May 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodiak was down the cast list for ''[[The Bribe]]'' (1949). He was second billed in MGM's war film ''[[Battleground (film)|Battleground]]'' (1949) a huge success. Also popular was ''[[Malaya (film)|Malaya]]'' (1949) where Hodiak supported James Stewart and [[Spencer Tracy]].

Hodiak was a love rival for Robert Taylor in ''[[Ambush (1950 film)|Ambush]]'' (1950), a popular Western. MGM gave him another lead role, co-starring with [[Hedy Lamarr]] in ''[[A Lady Without Passport]]'' (1950), but it lost money. He was third billed in ''[[The Miniver Story]]'' (1950), the flop sequel to ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'', and fourth lead in ''[[Night into Morning]]'' (1951), an unsuccessful comedy.

Hodiak supported [[Spencer Tracy]] in ''[[The People Against O'Hara]]'' (1951) and Clark Gable in ''[[Across the Wide Missouri (film)|Across the Wide Missouri]]'' (1952). He was second billed to [[Walter Pidgeon]] in ''[[The Sellout (film)|The Sellout]]'' (1953).

===Broadway and B Movies ===
In 1952, Hodiak went to New York City and made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''The Chase'' by [[Horton Foote]] and directed by [[José Ferrer]]. The play was a failure, but its star received fantastic critical notices.

Hodiak went over to Allied Artists to star in a low budget [[Korean War]] film, ''[[Battle Zone (film)|Battle Zone]]'' (1952). At Columbia he starred in two Westerns, ''[[Ambush at Tomahawk Gap]]'' (1953) and ''[[Conquest of Cochise]]'' (1953) and a Korean War film, ''[[Mission Over Korea]]'' (1953). He did another Korean War film for Allied Artists, ''[[Dragonfly Squadron]]'' (1954).

He then originated the role of Lieutenant Maryk in Paul Gregory's production of the play ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court Martial]]'' (1954–55) by [[Herman Wouk]] adapted from his novel ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]''. The play – also starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lloyd Nolan]] – ran for two years and Hodiak's portrayal brought him nationwide acclaim.

When the show closed after its U.S. tour, Hodiak began work on ''[[Trial (1955 film)|Trial]]'' (1955) at MGM, billed fourth as the prosecuting attorney. When it wrapped, he played Major Ward Thomas in ''[[On the Threshold of Space]]'' (1956) at 20th Century Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75862023 |title=Hollywood Tragedies, 3—JOHN HODIAK |newspaper=[[The Mirror (Western Australia)|The Mirror]] |volume=36 |issue=1811 |location=Western Australia |date=11 February 1956 |accessdate=31 October 2017 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
Most [[libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the [[capital punishment]] (death penalty) is an extreme exertion of state power and is of little use in a free society, while it is of great use to a tyrannical government. Proponents of capital punishment believe that such punishment may be justified as a deterrent to particularly atrocious crimes (although it is the case in the [[United States]] that states with the death penalty have higher murder rates than ones which don't&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/the-death-penalty-and-deterrence&lt;/ref&gt;) and as a means of keeping dangerous individuals permanently incapacitated.  Furthermore, if people commit crimes, they may sacrifice their rights; if the legal system is legitimate, perhaps capital punishment is justified.

There is also the fundamental problem of the possibility of error, or even outright framing of the accused. To this effect, lack of trust in government to make decisions (including life-and-death decisions) competently or for the best motives may confound the issue.

In any case, to [[anarcho-capitalist]]s, making judges, police officers, and other law enforcement personnel just as responsible for their acts as any citizen, with no privilege or special right or exemption, will prevent abuse of force in general, and of deadly force in particular. [[Walter Block]] went so far as to say, "We have seen that in the libertarian philosophy, the death penalty is justified for those whose crimes rise to a sufficient degree of severity. Surely, there are heads of state whose evil deeds many times eclipse such a level. Thus, it would altogether be justified to end their lives by violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Radical libertarianism: applying libertarian principles to dealing with the unjust government, Part II|author=W Block|publisher=Reason Papers|date=2006|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludwig Lange''' (born June 21, 1863 in [[Gießen]]; died July 12, 1936 in [[Weinsberg]]) was a [[Germans|German]] [[physicist]].

==Biography==
He was the son of the philologist and archaeologist [[Ludwig Lange (philologist)|Ludwig Lange]] and his wife Adelheide Blume. He studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and also [[psychology]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of Gießen]] from 1882-1885. He was an assistant of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] from 1885-1887 and attained his [[Ph.D.]] in 1886. He was working many years as a [[Privatdozent]], and in the field of [[photography]]. Since 1887 he exhibited growing symptoms of a [[Neuropathy|nervous disease]]. In 1936 he died in a [[psychiatric hospital]] ([[Klinikum am Weissenhof]]) in Weinsberg.&lt;ref&gt;Laue 1948, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Lange is known for inventing terms like [[inertial frame of reference]] and inertial time (1885), which were used by him instead of Newton's "absolute space and time". This was very important for the development of [[Special relativity|relativistic mechanics]] after 1900. DiSalle describes Lange's definition in this way:&lt;ref&gt;DiSalle 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|An inertial system is a coordinate system with respect to which three free particles, projected from a single point and moving in non-coplanar directions, move in straight lines and travel mutually-proportional distances. The law of inertia then states that relative to any inertial system, any fourth free particle will move uniformly.}}

He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from New York, 1912, 1916, and 1924.

His resignation as borough president in April 1928 occurred during an investigation of a sewer graft scandal. In his criminal trial he was represented by attorney [[Max Steuer]]. In October 1928 he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the city, and was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $500. Following an unsuccessful appeal, he served the prison sentence in 1930-31.

He died from a cerebral hemorrhage, in [[Forest Hills Gardens, Queens]], Queens County, New York on November 24, 1935. His body was interred at Mount St. Mary's Cemetery in Flushing, New York.

'''Nidarabad massacre''' ({{lang-bn|নিদারাবাদ হত্যাকান্ড}}) refers to the murder of Birajabala Debnath and her children by a group of mobs in Nidarabad village in Bangladesh on 6 September 1989.

== Background ==
The village of Nidarabad in under Harashpur Union of [[Nasirnagar Upazila]] in [[Brahmanbaria District]] in [[Bangladesh]]. The Debnaths were a poor Hindu family belonging to the [[Yogi Nath|Yogi caste]]. Shashanka and Birajabala Debnath had three daughters and two sons and they were expecting their sixth child. The eldest daughter Suniti was married.&lt;ref name="kk18092010"&gt;{{cite news |title='সম্পত্তির জন্য মানুষ এমন পিশাচ হতে পারে' |author= |url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/?view=details&amp;type=gold&amp;data=Hotel&amp;pub_no=285&amp;cat_id=1&amp;menu_id=86&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;index=5&amp;archiev=yes&amp;arch_date=18-09-2010 |newspaper=Kaler Kantho |date=September 18, 2010 |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shashanka Debnath earned the family livelihood by selling ''moa'', a kind of crunchy ball made of puffed rice and jaggery.&lt;ref name="kk18092010"/&gt; Their family assets consisted of the meagre ancestral land.&lt;ref name="sgd205-208"&gt;{{cite book |title=Empire's Last Casualty: Indian Subcontinent's vanishing Hindu and other Minorities |last=Ghosh Dastidar |first=Sachi |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Firma KLM |location=Kolkata |isbn=81-7102-151-4 |pages=205–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of local land sharks led by one Tajul Islam were repeatedly threatening the [[Bengali Hindu]] family to leave their ancestral land and emigrate to [[India]]. However, the Debnath family stood their ground and refused to leave their ancestral property. On 16 October 1987, Shashanka Debnath was abducted and killed. His dismembered body was disposed off in a nearby village. Shashanka's body was not found and he was assumed to be missing. During this time, one of the killers tried to take possession of the land using a forged deed.&lt;ref name="roy271"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Tathagata |title=My People, Uprooted |year=2002 |publisher=Ratna Prakashan |location=Kolkata |isbn=81-85709-67-X |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birajabala then lodged a complaint at the police for the attempted forgery and her husband's murder.&lt;ref name="roy271"/&gt;

== Killings ==
After the midnight of 6 September 1989, a group of 15 to 20 men broke into the Debnaths' home.&lt;ref name="sgd205-208"/&gt; They abducted Birajabala and her five children at gunpoint and carried them off. A boat was waiting for them, into which they were boarded forcefully. The kidnappers then sailed to the Dhopajhuri beel. Then the kidnappers forced the captives to disembark on the bank of the beel.&lt;ref name="sgd205-208"/&gt;

One of the attackers brandished lethal knife on Birajabala, whence she begged for her life. Unmoved, the attacker killed 45-year-old Birajabala Debnath in front of her five minor children, who started shivering in terror. Her body was then cut into pieces and stuffed them into an oil barrel packed with salt and lime. After that, they cut the eldest daughter, 17-year-old Niyati, as the other children repeated begged for their lives. One by one they cut youngest daughter, 13-year-old Pranati, followed by Subhas 13, Suman 7, and Sujan, the youngest son who was just 23 months old. Their bodies too were similarly stuffed in oil barrels packed with lime and salt and dumped in the water body.&lt;ref name="sgd205-208"/&gt;

After the gruesome murders, the land sharks spread a rumour that the Debnath family has left for India and they took possession of their properties. Eight days later, on 14 September 1989, their dead bodies were accidentally discovered when one of the barrels rose up to the water surface and collided with a boat.

== Trial ==
On 28 September 2012, one of criminals Idris Patwari, who had been sentenced was arrested by from his home in Bagdiya village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=সেভেন মার্ডার মামলার যাবজ্জীবন সাজাপ্রাপ্ত আসামী দুধর্ষ ডাকাত ইদ্রিস গ্রেফতার |author= |url=http://www.newsbrahmanbaria.com/?p=9423 |newspaper=News Brahmanbaria |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online hate speech''' is a type of speech that takes place online (e.g. the [[Internet]], [[Social media|social media platforms]]) with the purpose to attack a person or a group on the basis of attributes such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[ethnic origin]], [[sexual orientation]], [[disability]], or [[gender]].

Hate speech online is situated at the intersection of multiple tensions: it is the expression of conflicts between different groups within and across societies; it is a vivid example of how technologies with a transformative potential such as the Internet bring with them both opportunities and challenges; and it implies complex balancing between fundamental rights and principles, including [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and the defense of [[Dignity|human dignity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Countering Online Hate Speech|last=Gagliardone|first=Iginio|last2=Gal|first2=Danit|last3=Alves|first3=Thiago|last4=Martinez|first4=Gabriela|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233231e.pdf|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech is a broad and contested term. [[Multilateral treaty|Multilateral treaties]] such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) have sought to define its contours. [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Multi-stakeholders processes]] (e.g. the Rabat Plan of Action) have been initiated to bring greater clarity and suggest mechanisms to identify hateful messages. And yet, hate speech continues largely to be used in everyday discourse as a generic term, mixing concrete threats to individuals' and groups' security with cases in which people may be simply venting their anger against authority. Internet intermediaries—organizations that mediate online communication such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Google]]—have advanced their own definitions of hate speech that bind users to a set of rules and allow companies to limit certain forms of expression. National and regional bodies have sought to promote understandings of the term that are more rooted in local traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Internet]]'s speed and reach makes it difficult for governments to enforce national legislation in the [[virtual world]]. Issues around hate speech online bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), and the challenges that these spaces pose for regulators. Some of the companies owning these spaces have become more responsive towards tackling the problem of hate speech online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The character of hate speech online and its relation to offline speech and action are widely talked about—by [[Politician|politicians]], [[Activism|activists]] and academics—but the debates tend to be removed from systematic empirical evidence. The character of perceived hate speech and its possible consequences has led to placing much emphasis on the solutions to the problem and on how they should be grounded in international human rights norms. Yet this very focus has also limited deeper attempts to understand the causes underlying the phenomenon and the dynamics through which certain types of content emerge, diffuse and lead—or not—to actual [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or [[violence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Hate speech ===
Hate speech lies in a complex nexus with [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], individual, group and [[minority rights]], as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. Its definition is often contested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm (particularly, discrimination, hostility or [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]) based upon the target's being identified with a certain social or demographic group. It may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. The concept may extend also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted [[discrimination]], hostility and violent attacks. At critical times, such as during elections, the concept of hate speech may be prone to [[wikt:manipulation|manipulation]]: accusations of fomenting hate speech may be traded among political opponents or used by those in power to curb [[dissent]] and [[criticism]]. Hate speech (be it conveyed through text, images or sound) can be identified by approximation through the degrading or [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] functions that it serves. There may be two types of messages. The first is to the targeted group and functions to dehumanize and diminish members assigned to this group. It often sounds more or less like:

"Don't be fooled into thinking you are welcome here. [...] You are not wanted, and you and your families will be shunned, excluded, beaten, and driven out, whenever we can get away with it. We may have to keep a low profile right now. But don't get too comfortable. [...] Be afraid."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of hate speech is to let others with similar views know they are not alone, to reinforce a sense of an in-group that is (purportedly) under threat. A typical message sent this time to like-minded individuals can read like:

"We know some of you agree that these people are not wanted here. We know that some of you feel that they are dirty (or dangerous or criminal or [[Terrorism|terrorist]]). Know now that you are not alone. [...] There are enough of us around to make sure these people are not welcome. There are enough of us around to draw attention to what these people are really like".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech relies on tensions, which it seeks to re-produce and amplify. Such speech unites and divides at the same time. It creates "us" and "them".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
The proliferation of hate speech online, observed by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues (HRC, 2015), poses a new set of challenges. Both [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and organizations created to combat hate speech have recognized that hateful messages [[Dissemination|disseminated]] online are increasingly common and have elicited unprecedented attention to develop adequate responses.&lt;ref&gt;See Council of Europe, "Mapping study on projects against hate speech online", 15 April 2012. See also interviews: Christine Chen, Senior Manager for Public Policy, Google, 2 March 2015; Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, Facebook, 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hatebase|HateBase]], a web-based application that collects instances of hate speech online worldwide, the majority of cases of hate speech target individuals based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] and [[nationality]], but incitements to hatred focusing on [[religion]] and class have also been on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;See HateBase, Hate speech statistics, http://www.hatebase.org/popular&lt;/ref&gt;

While hate speech online is not intrinsically different from similar expressions found offline, there are peculiar challenges unique to online content and its regulation. Those challenges related to its permanence, itinerancy, [[Human rights and encryption|anonymity]] and cross-jurisdictional character are among the most complex to address.

Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute, has noted, "The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can inflict on the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesn't stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates."&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Andre Oboler, CEO, Online Hate Prevention Institute, 31 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]]'s conversations organized around trending topics may facilitate the quick and wide spreading of hateful messages, but they also offer the opportunity for influential speakers to shun messages and possibly end popular threads [[Online youth radicalization|inciting violence]]. [[Facebook]], on the contrary, may allow multiple threads to continue in parallel and go unnoticed; creating longer lasting spaces where certain individuals and groups are offended, ridiculed and discriminated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hate speech online can be itinerant. Even when content is removed, it may find expression elsewhere, possibly on the same platform under a different name or on different online spaces. If a [[website]] is shut down, it can quickly reopen using a [[Web hosting service|web-hosting service]] with less stringent [[Regulation|regulations]] or via the reallocation to a country with laws imposing higher threshold for hate speech. The itinerant nature of hate speech also means that poorly formulated thoughts that would have not found public expression and support in the past may now land on spaces where they can be visible to large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;There are cases of individuals who had to serve jail sentences for tweets written when drunk or for having jokingly tweeted they were planning to blowing up an airport (Rowbottom 2012).{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anonymity]] can also present a challenge to dealing with hate speech online. "(T)he internet facilitates anonymous and pseudonymous discourse, which can just as easily accelerate destructive behavior as it can fuel public discourse"&lt;ref&gt;Citron &amp; Norton 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As Drew Boyd, Director of Operations at The [[Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention|Sentinel Project]], has stated, "the Internet grants individuals the ability to say horrific things because they think they will not be discovered. This is what makes online hate speech so unique, because people feel much more comfortable speaking hate as opposed to real life when they have to deal with the consequences of what they say".&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Drew Boyd, Director of Operations, The Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, 24 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments and [[social media]] platforms have sought to enforce real name [[Policy|policies]]. Such measures have been deeply contested as they hit at the [[right to privacy]] and its intersection with free expression. The majority of [[Internet troll|online trolling]] and hate speech attacks come from [[Pseudonym|pseudonymous]] accounts, which are not necessarily anonymous to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Ian Brown, University of Oxford, 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Genuinely anonymous online communications are rare, as they require the user to employ highly technical measures to ensure that he or she cannot be easily identifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A further complication is the [[Transnationalism|transnational]] reach of the Internet, raising issues of cross jurisdictional co-operation in regard to legal mechanisms for combating hate speech. While there are [[Mutual legal assistance treaty|Mutual Legal Assistance treaties]] in place amongst many countries, these are characteristically slow to work. The transnational reach of many [[Private sector|private-sector]] [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Internet intermediaries]] may provide a more effective channel for resolving issues in some cases, although these bodies are also often impacted upon by cross-jurisdictional appeals for data (such as revealing the identity of the author of a particular content).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the dissemination of hate speech through conventional channels, hate speech dissemination online often involves multiple actors, whether knowingly or not. When perpetrators makes use of an online social platform to disseminate their hateful message they do not only hurt their victims, but may also violate terms of service in that platform and at times even state law, depending on their location. The victims, on their part, may feel helpless in the face of online harassment, not knowing to whom they should turn to for help. In the types of responses mapped throughout the study, it appears that collective action, usually undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] and [[Advocacy group|lobby groups]], has been an effective [[modus operandi]] to raise awareness and encourage different stakeholders to take action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Stormfront'' precedent ===
In the aftermath of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|2014]]'s [[Islamic terrorism|dramatic incidents]], calls for more restrictive or intrusive measures to contain the Internet's potential to spread hate and violence are common, as if the links between [[Online youth radicalization|online and offline violence]] were well known. On the contrary, as the following example indicates, appearances may often be deceiving. [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] is considered the first "hate website"&lt;ref&gt;Meddaugh and Kay, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Launched in March 1995 by a former [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan leader]], it quickly became a popular space for discussing ideas related to [[Neo-Nazism]], [[White nationalism]] and [[White separatism]], first in the [[United States|United States of America]] and then globally&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The forum hosts calls for a racial holy war and incitement to use violence to resist [[immigration]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a space for recruiting [[Activism|activists]] and possibly coordinating violent acts&lt;ref&gt;Chang et al. 2014{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The few studies that have explored who the users of Stormfront actually are depict a more complex picture. Rather than seeing it as a space for coordinating actions, well-known extreme right activists have accused the forum to be just a gathering for "[[Keyboard man|keyboard warriors]]". One of them for example, as reported by De Koster and Houtman, stated, "I have read quite a few pieces around the forum, and it strikes me that a great fuss is made, whereas little happens. The section activism/politics itself is plainly ridiculous. [...] Not to mention the assemblies where just four people turn up"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even more revealing are some of the responses to these accusations provided by regular members of the website. As one of them argued, "Surely, I am entitled to have an opinion without actively carrying it out. [...] I do not attend demonstrations and I neither join a political party. If this makes me a keyboard warrior, that is all right. I feel good this way. [...] I am not ashamed of it"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. De Koster and Houtman surveyed only one national chapter of Stormfront and a non-representative sample of users, but answers like those above should at least invite to caution towards hypotheses connecting expressions and actions, even in spaces whose main function is to host extremist views.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Frameworks ==

=== International principles ===
Hate speech is not explicitly mentioned in many [[International human rights law|international human rights]] documents and [[Treaty|treaties]], but it is indirectly called upon by some of the principles related to human dignity and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. For example, the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which was drafted as a response to the atrocities of the [[World War II]], contains the right to equal protection under the law in Article 7, which proclaims that: "All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR also states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDHR was decisive in setting a framework and agenda for human rights protection, but the Declaration is [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]]. A series of binding documents have been subsequently created to offer a more robust protection for freedom of expression and protection against discrimination. Out of those documents, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) is the most important and comprehensive when addressing hate speech and contains the right to freedom of expression in Article 19 and the prohibition of advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence in Article 20. Other more tailored international legal instruments contain provisions that have repercussions for the definition of hate speech and identification of responses to it, such as: the [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (1951), the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], ICERD (1969), and, to a lesser extent, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], CEDAW (1981).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hate speech and the ICCPR ===
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] is the legal instrument most commonly referred to in debates on hate speech and its regulation, although it does not explicitly use the term "hate speech". Article 19, which is often referred to as part of the "core of the Covenant"&lt;ref&gt;Nowak 1993{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, provides for the right to freedom of expression. This sets out the right, and it also includes general strictures to which any limitation of the right must conform in order to be legitimate. Article 19 is followed by Article 20 that expressly limits freedom of expression in cases of "advocacy of national, [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious hatred]] that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence"&lt;ref&gt;Leo et al. 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The decision to include this provision, which can be characterised as embodying a particular conceptualisation of hate speech, has been deeply contested. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]], the [[United Nations]] body created by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] to oversee its implementation, cognizant of the tension, has sought to stress that Article 20 is fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 11, Article 20: Prohibition of Propaganda for War and Inciting National, Racial or Religious Hatred, 29 July 1983, para. 2. In 2011, The Committee elucidated its views on the relationship of Article 19 and 20 when it reaffirmed that the provisions complement each other and that Article 20 "may be considered as lex specialis with regard to Article 19". Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 34, Article 19: Freedoms of opinion and expression, CCPR/C/GC/34, 12 September 2011, paras. 48-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It can legitimately be limited by states under restricted circumstances:

"3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order ([[Public policy doctrine|ordre public]]), or of [[public health]] or [[Morality|morals]]."&lt;ref&gt;Article 19 (3) if the ICCPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Article 19 (3) and Article 20, there is a distinction between optional and obligatory limitations to the right to freedom of expression. Article 19 (3) states that limitations on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] "may therefore be subject to certain restrictions", as long as they are provided by law and necessary to certain legitimate purposes. Article 20 states that any advocacy of (certain kinds of) hatred that constitutes incitement to [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or violence "shall be prohibited by law". Despite indications on the gravity of speech offenses that should be prohibited by law under Article 20, there remains complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Even the Human Rights Committee, which has decided on cases concerning Article 20, has avoided providing a definition of incitement to hatred. Human Rights Council. Incitement to Racial and Religious Hatred and the Promotion of Tolerance: Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, 20 September 2006, para. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular there is a grey area in conceptualising clear distinctions between (i) expressions of hatred, (ii) expression that advocate hatred, and (iii) hateful speech that specifically constitutes incitement to the practical harms of discrimination, hostility or violence. While states have an obligation to prohibit speech conceived as "advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence", as consistent with Article 20 (2),&lt;ref&gt;Faurisson v. France , C. Individual opinion by Elizabeth Evatt and David Kretzmer, co-signed by Eckart Klein (concurring), para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; how to interpret such is not clearly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Council. Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Addendum, Expert seminar on the links between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, A/HRC/10/31/Add.3, 16 January 2009, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other international legal instruments ===

==== ICERD ====
The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD), which came into force in 1969, has also implications for conceptualising forms of hate speech. The ICERD differs from the ICCPR in three respects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its conceptualisation of hate speech is specifically limited to speech that refers to race and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. It asserts in Article 4, paragraph (a), that state parties:

"Shall declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another color or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; This obligation imposed by the ICERD on state parties is also stricter than the case of Article 20 of the ICCPR covering the criminalisation of racist ideas that are not necessarily inciting discrimination, hostility or violence."

An important difference is in the issue of [[Intention|intent]]. The concept of "advocacy of hatred" introduced in the ICCPR is more specific than discriminatory speech described in the ICERD, since it is taken to require consideration of the intent of author and not the expression in [[Isolationism|isolation]]—this is because "advocacy" is interpreted in the ICCPR as requiring the intent to sow hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, para. 39;&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has actively addressed hate speech in its General Recommendation 29, in which the Committee recommends state parties to:

"(r) Take measures against any dissemination of ideas of caste superiority and inferiority or which attempt to justify violence, hatred or discrimination against descent-based communities; (s) Take strict measures against any incitement to discrimination or violence against the communities, including through the Internet; (t) Take measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent-based discrimination;"&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, General Recommendation 29, Discrimination Based on Descent (Sixty-first session, 2002), U.N. Doc. A/57/18 at 111 (2002), reprinted in Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N.Doc. HRI\GEN\1\Rev.6 at 223 (2003), paras. r, s and t&lt;/ref&gt;

These points, which reflect the ICERD's reference to the dissemination of expression, have significance for the [[Internet]]. The expression of ideas in some online contexts may immediately amount to spreading them. This is especially relevant for private spaces that have begun to play a public role, as in the case of many [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Genocide Convention ====
Similarly to the ICERD, the [[Genocide Convention]] aims to protect groups defined by race, nationality or ethnicity, although it also extends its provisions to religious groups. When it comes to hate speech the Genocide Convention is limited only to acts that publicly incite to [[genocide]], recognized as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", regardless of whether such acts are undertaken in peacetime or in wartime&lt;ref&gt;Defeis 1992{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically [[Gender violence|gender-based]] hate speech (as distinct from discriminatory actions) is not covered in depth in [[international law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== CEDAW ====
The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1981, imposes obligations on states to condemn discrimination against women&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the CEDAW.&lt;/ref&gt; and "prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish" acts of gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;General recommendation No. 28 on the core obligations of States parties under article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional responses ===
Most [[Regional organization|regional instruments]] do not have specific articles prescribing [[prohibition]] of hate speech, but they more generally allow states to limit freedom of expression—which provisions can be applied to specific cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== American Convention on Human Rights ====
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] describes limitations on freedom of expression in a manner similar to the ICCPR in Article 19 (3). The [[Organization of American States]] has also adopted another declaration on the principles of freedom of expression, which includes a specific clause stating that "prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or [[impartiality]] is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression, 20 October 2000, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American Court has advised that "(a)buse of freedom of information thus cannot be controlled by [[Risk|preventive measures]] but only through the subsequent imposition of sanctions on those who are guilty of the abuses".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also imposes a test for States willing to enact restrictions on freedom of expression, as they need to observe the following requirements: "a) the existence of previously established grounds for liability; b) the express and precise definition of these grounds by law; c) the legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved; d) a showing that these grounds of liability are ‘necessary to ensure' the aforementioned ends."&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American System has a [[Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression|Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression]] who conducted a comprehensive study on hate speech. His conclusion was that the Inter-American Human Rights System differs from the United Nations and the [[European Union|European]] approach on a key point: The Inter-American system covers only hate speech that actually leads to violence, and solely such speech can be restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights ====
The [[African Union|African]] Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights takes a different approach in Article 9 (2), allowing for restrictions on rights as long as they are "within the law". This concept has been criticized and there is a vast amount of legal scholarship on the so-called "claw-back" clauses and their interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Viljoen 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that countries can manipulate their own legislation and weaken the essence of the right to freedom of expression. The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa elaborates a higher standard for limitations on freedom of expression. It declares that the right "should not be restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression".&lt;ref&gt;African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, 32nd Session, Banjul, 17 - 23 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam ====
In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (which was later renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OIC) adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] (CDHRI), which calls for criminalisation of speech that extends beyond cases of imminent violence to encompass "acts or speech that denote manifest intolerance and hate".&lt;ref&gt;Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Sixth OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia, Presented to the 40th Council of Foreign Ministers, Conakry, Republic of Guinea, December 2013, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arab Charter on Human Rights ====
The Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was adopted by the [[Council of the Arab League|Council]] of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] in 2004, includes in Article 32 provisions that are relevant also for online communication as it guarantees the right to "freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, regardless of geographical boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; It allows a limitation on a broad basis in paragraph 2 "Such rights and freedoms shall be exercised in conformity with the fundamental values of society".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ====
The [[ASEAN Human Rights Declaration]] includes the right to freedom of expression in Article 23. Article 7 of the Declaration provides for general limitations, affirming, "the realisation of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds."&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ====
The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] which declares the right to freedom of expression in Article 11, has a clause which prohibits abuse of rights. It asserts that the Charter must not be interpreted as implying any "limitation to a greater extent than is provided for therein".&lt;ref&gt;Article 54 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a limitation which implies a strict test of necessity and proportionality is the provision on freedom of expression in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which underlines that the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities. It "may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a [[Democracy|democratic]] society, in the interests of [[national security]], [[territorial integrity]] or [[Public security|public safety]], for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] is careful to distinguish between hate speech and the right of individuals to express their views freely, even if others take offence.&lt;ref&gt;Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, para. 49. More cases of hate Speech under the European Court can be found at: http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf 49&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional instances relevant specifically to online hate speech. The [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) in 2000 issued a General Policy Recommendation on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, [[Xenophobia|Xenophobic]] and [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] Material via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;ECRI General Policy Recommendation No. 6, On Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Antisemitic Material via the Internet, adopted on 15 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the CoE Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, which regulates mutual assistance regarding investigative powers, provides signatory countries with a mechanism to deal with [[Data (computing)|computer data]], which would include [[Transnationalism|transnational]] hate speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, paras 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the CoE launched an additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime which addresses online expression of racism and xenophobia. The convention and its protocol were opened for signature and ratification of countries outside [[Europe]], and other countries, such as [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], are already part of this convention. The Protocol imposes an obligation on Member States to criminalise racist and xenophobic insults online of "(i) persons for the reason that they belong to a group distinguished by race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, 28 January 2003, art 5 para 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet]] intermediaries such as [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]], [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] or [[Web search engine|Search Engines]], stipulate in their [[terms of service]] how they may intervene in allowing, restricting, or channelling the creation and access to specific content. A vast amount of online interactions occur on social networking platforms that transcend national jurisdictions and which platforms have also developed their own definitions of hate speech and measures to respond to it. For a user who violates the terms of service, the content he or she has posted may be removed from the platform, or its access may be restricted to be viewed only by a certain category of users (e.g. users living outside a specific country).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The principles that inspire terms of service agreements and the mechanisms that each company develops to ensure their [[implementation]] have significant repercussions on the ability that people have to express themselves online as well as to be protected from hate speech. Most intermediaries have to enter in negotiations with national governments to an extent that varies according to the type of intermediary, areas where the company is registered, and the legal regime that applies. As Tsesis explains, "(i)f transmissions on the Internet are sent and received in particular locations, then specific fora retain jurisdiction to prosecute illegal activities transacted on the Internet"&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, 2001{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Internet Service Providers are the most directly affected by national legislation because they have to be located in a specific country to operate. Search Engines, while they can modify search results for self-regulatory or commercial reasons, have increasingly tended to adapt to the intermediary liability regime of both their registered home jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which they provide their services, either removing links to content proactively or upon request by authorities&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon et al. 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

All Internet intermediaries operated by [[Privately held company|private companies]] are also expected to respect [[human rights]]. This is set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights elaborated by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. The document emphasizes [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate responsibility]] in upholding human rights. In principle 11, it declares that: "Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Guiding Principles also indicate that in cases in which human rights are violated, companies should "provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Internet intermediaries and conceptions of hate speech, this means that they should ensure that measures are in place to provide a commensurate response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social responses ==

=== Civil society ===
[[Myanmar]] is transitioning towards greater openness and access to the Internet has grown at unprecedented rates. In this context, however, social media have often been used by some to spread calls to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hatespeech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her concern over the spread of [[misinformation]], hate speech and [[Hate speech|incitement to violence]], discrimination and hostility in the media and Internet, particularly targeted against a minority community&lt;ref&gt;HRC, 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The growing tension online has gone parallel with cases of actual violence leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; One challenge in this process has concerned ethnic and religious minorities. In 2013, 43 people were killed due to clashes that erupted after a dispute in the [[Rakhine State|Rakhine state]] in the Western Part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, more than 200 people were killed and thousands displaced 37 because of ethnic violence, which erupted after an alleged rape case.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marshall, "Special Report: Plight of Muslim Minority Threatens Myanmar Spring," Reuters, 15 June 2012, https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-myanmar-rohingya-idUSBRE85E06A20120615&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop, the rapid emergence of new online spaces, albeit for a fraction of the population, has reflected some of these deeply rooted tensions in a new form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dealing with intolerance and hate speech online is an emerging issue. Facebook has rapidly become the platform of choice for those citizens making their first steps online. In this environment there have been individual and groups, which have championed a more aggressive use of the medium, especially when feeling protected by a sense of righteousness and by claims to be acting in defense of the [[national interest]]. Political figures have also used online media for particular causes. In social media, there has been the use of derogatory terms in reference to minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Kinetz, "New Numerology of Hate Grows in Burma", Irrawaddy, 29 April 2013 http://www.irrawaddy.org/religion/new-numerology-of-hate-grows-in-burma.html. Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014; Steven Kiersons, "The Colonial Origins of Hate Speech in Burma", The Sentinel Project, 28 October 2013, https://thesentinelproject.org/2013/10/28/the-colonial-origins-of-hate-speech-in-burma/ ., http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hate-speech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex situation, a variety of actors has begun to mobilize, seeking to offer responses that can avoid further violence. Facebook has sought to take a more active role in monitoring the uses of the social network platform in Myanmar, developing [[Partnership|partnerships]] with local organizations and making guidelines on reporting problems accessible in Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McLaughlin, "Facebook takes steps to combat hate speech", The Myanmar Times, 25 July 2014. http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11114-facebook-standards-marked-for-translation.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The local civil society has constituted a strong voice in openly condemning the spread of online hate speech, but at the same time calling for alternatives to [[censorship]]. Among the most innovative responses has been Panzagar, which in Burmese means "flower speech", a campaign launched by blogger and activist [[Nay Phone Latt]] to openly oppose hate speech. The goal of the initiative was offering a joyful example of how people can interact, both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;San Yamin Aung, "Burmese Online Activist Discusses Campaign Against Hate Speech", Irrawaddy, http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local activists have been focussed upon local solutions, rather than trying to mobilize [[Civil society|global civil society]] on these issues. This is in contrast to some other online campaigns that have been able to attract the world's attention towards relatively neglected problems. Initiatives such as those promoted by the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] for the [[War in Darfur|civil war in Sudan]], or the organization [[Invisible Children]] with the [[Kony 2012|Kony2012]] campaign that denounced the atrocities committed by the [[Lord's Resistance Army|Lord Resistance Army]], are popular examples. As commentaries on these campaigns have pointed out, such global responses may have negative repercussions on the ability for local solutions to be found&lt;ref&gt;Schomerus, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Private companies ===
Internet intermediaries have developed disparate definitions of hate speech and guidelines to regulate it. Some companies do not use the term hate speech, but have a descriptive list of terms related to it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Yahoo! ====
[[Yahoo!]]'s terms of service prohibit the posting of "content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, [[Harassment|harassing]], tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, [[Defamation|libellous]], invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/smallbusiness/bizmail/spam/spam-44.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twitter ====
In December of 2017, [[Twitter]] began enforcing new policies towards hate speech, banning multiple accounts as well as setting new guidelines for what will be allowed on their platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16789606/twitter-new-safety-policies-hate-groups|title=Twitter starts enforcing new policies on violence, abuse, and hateful conduct|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire page in the Twitter Help Center devoted to describing their Hateful Conduct Policy, as well as their enforcement procedures. The top of this page states “Freedom of expression means little if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. We do not tolerate behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person’s voice. If you see something on Twitter that violates these rules, please report it to us.” Twitter’s definition of [[hate speech]] ranges from “violent threats” and “wishes for the physical harm, death, or disease of individuals or groups” to “repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone.”

Punishments for violations range from suspending a user’s ability to tweet until they take down their offensive/ hateful post to the removal of an account entirely. In a statement following the implementation of their new policies, Twitter said “In our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process” . . . “We’ll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks, and will keep you posted on progress along the way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy|title=Hateful conduct policy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes come amidst a time where action is being taken to prevent hate speech around the globe, including new laws in Europe which pose fines for sites unable to address [[hate speech]] reports within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42510868|title=Germany to enforce hate speech law|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== YouTube ====
[[YouTube]], a subsidiary of the tech company [[Google]], has outlined a clear “Hate Speech Policy” amidst several other user policies on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803176|title=Hate speech policy - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is worded as such: “We encourage free speech and try to defend your right to express unpopular points of view, but we don't permit hate speech. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes, such as: race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation/gender identity”. YouTube has built in a user reporting system in order to counteract the growing trend of hate speech. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027|title=Report inappropriate content - Android - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular deterrents against hate speech, users are able to anonymously report another user for content they deem inappropriate. The content is then reviewed against YouTube policy and age restrictions, and either taken down or left alone.

==== Facebook ====
[[Facebook]]'s terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that "Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious [[Disability|disabilities]] or [[Disease|diseases]]". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt; It further states that "We allow humour, [[satire]] or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Facebook’s hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook's Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=Propublica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, “We’re sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build…We must do better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook’s Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's [[hate speech]]  policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes.   For example, the statement “Female sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks," would not be considered hate speech on Facebook’s platform and therefore would not be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/13/technology/facebook-hate-speech-quiz.html|title=What Does Facebook Consider Hate Speech? Take Our Quiz|last=Carlsen|first=Audrey|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation.
 
Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/|title=Community Standards: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content’s severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys “violent speech or support for death/disease/harm.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2018/04/24/facebook-community-standards-content-policy-nudity-sexual-content-hate-speech/|title=This is what Facebook won’t let you post|last=Mills|first=Chris|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microsoft ====
[[Microsoft]] has specific rules concerning hate speech for a variety of its [[Application software|applications]]. Its [[policy]] for mobile phones prohibits applications that "contain any content that advocates discrimination, hatred, or violence based on considerations of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, status as a veteran, or membership in any other social group."&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh184842(v=vs.105).aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also rules regarding online gaming, which prohibit any communication that is indicative of "hate speech, controversial religious topics and sensitive current or historical events".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/legal/codeofconduct&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media and information literacy ===
{{Main|Media literacy}}

[[Media Literacy|Media and Information Literacy]] aims to help people to engage in a [[Information society|digital society]] by being able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically; while being able to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-and-information-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citizenship]] education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict&lt;ref&gt;Osler and Starksey, 2005{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of its main objectives is raising awareness on the political, social and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including [[freedom of speech]] and the responsibilities and social implications that emerge from it. The concern of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] with hate speech is twofold: it encompasses the knowledge and skills to identify hate speech, and should enable individuals to counteract messages of hatred. One of its current challenges is adapting its goals and strategies to the digital world, providing not only [[argumentative]] but also [[Technology|technological]] knowledge and skills that a citizen may need to counteract online hate speech. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Information literacy]] cannot avoid issues such as rights to free expression and privacy, critical citizenship and fostering [[empowerment]] for [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]&lt;ref&gt;Mossberger et al. 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple and complementary literacies become critical. The emergence of new technologies and social media has played an important role in this shift. Individuals have evolved from being only [[Consumer|consumers]] of media messages to producers, creators and curator of information, resulting in new models of participation that interact with traditional ones, like [[voting]] or joining a [[political party]]. Teaching strategies are changing accordingly, from fostering critical reception of media messages to include empowering the creation of media content&lt;ref&gt;Hoechsmann and Poyntz, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of media and information literacy itself continues to evolve, being augmented by the dynamics of the Internet. It is beginning to embrace issues of [[Identity politics|identity]], ethics and rights in [[cyberspace]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris Declaration: Paris Declaration on MIL in the Digital Era. http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-andinformation/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/2014/paris-declaration-on-mediaand-information-literacy-adopted/&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these skills can be particularly important when identifying and responding to hate speech online.

Series of initiatives aimed both at providing information and practical tools for Internet users to be active [[Digital citizen|digital citizens]]:
* ‘No place for hate' by [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), [[United States]];
* ‘In other words' project by [[Province of Mantua|Provincia di Mantova]] and the [[European Commission]];
* ‘Facing online hate' by [[MediaSmarts]], [[Canada]];
* ‘No hate speech movement' by Youth Department of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Europe]];&lt;ref&gt;The ‘No Hate Speech Movement' is a regional campaign that encompasses 50 countries far beyond the European Continent. Although the campaign has common goals and develops joint strategies, the particular projects and initiatives rune in every country are the responsibility of the National coordinators and subject to the capacity and resources in each country.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ‘Online hate' by the [[Online Hate Prevention Institute]], [[Australia]].
Education is also seen as being a tool against hate speech. Laura Geraghty from the ‘No Hate Speech Movement' affirmed: "Education is key to prevent hate speech online. It is necessary to raise awareness and empower people to get online in a responsible way; however, you still need the legal background and instruments to prosecute hate crimes, including hate speech online, otherwise the preventive aspect won't help".&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Laura Geraghty, No Hate Speech Movement, 25 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Pierina Morosini''' (7 January 1931 - 6 April 1957) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] from [[Bergamo]] and was killed after a man tried to rape her.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-pierina-morosini/|title=Blessed Pierina Morosini|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morosini served as a member of the [[Catholic Action]] movement.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/52000|title=Blessed Pierina Morosini|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her beatification was held on 4 October 1987 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

==Life==
[[File:Urna della Beata Pierina Morosini.JPG|thumb|left|210px|Tomb.]]
Pierina Morosini was born in [[Fiobbio]] on 7 January 1931 as the first of nine children to the farmers Rocco Morosini and Sara Noris.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Her [[baptism]] was celebrated on 8 January 1931 in the local parish church in the name of "Pierina Eugenia". She received her [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] on 10 January 1937 from the [[Bishop of Bergamo]] [[Adriano Bernareggi]] and made her [[First Communion]] in May 1938.

Morosini lived her childhood near the mountains during [[World War II]] and soon became a member of [[Catholic Action]] in 1942 where she became an active member. She later became a seamstress on 18 March 1946 after the conflict and worked in a textile plant in [[Albino (BG)|Albino]]. The next month she was hospitalized for a brief period after an accident and there met the [[Order of Friars Minor|Capuchin]] [[priest]] Luciano Mologni who became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]]. Morosini left her village once in her entire life in order to attend the beatification of [[Maria Goretti]] in [[Rome]] in 1947 and made the pilgrimage there with other Catholic Action members from 25 to 30 April.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; Each morning before work she received the [[Eucharist]] and recited [[rosaries]] back and forth from home to work.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Morosini began to don a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] scapular and also joined the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] while her 1950 attempt to convince her parents to allow her to join a religious order in Bergamo failed.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

On 4 April 1957 she was walking home just before 3:00pm and a man came up to her. He made lewd comments to her and tried to rape her despite her attempts to reason with him; she failed to escape but was stoned in the attempt. Morosini attempted to defend herself and she was beaten to death with stones in which her skull was smashed.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Her brother found her in a pool of blood and called for help and she was rushed to hospital at once. Morosini died without regaining consciousness at the Bergamo hospital on 6 April 1957 from her injuries. Her remains were later relocated on 10 April 1983.

==Beatification==
[[File:Beatificazione di Pierina Morosini.jpg|thumb|right|John Paul II presides over the beatification.]]
The beatification cause commenced on 17 November 1979 after Morosini was titled as a [[Servant of God]] and the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" to the cause; the diocesan process spanned from 7 April 1980 until 28 May 1983 and received C.C.S. validation on 17 February 1984 before the latter received the [[Positio]] dossier in 1986. Theologians approved the cause on 13 January 1987 while the C.C.S. did so as well on 3 July 1987; [[Pope John Paul II]] confirmed that Morosini had died "in defensum castitatis" and therefore approved her beatification on 3 July 1987.

John Paul II beatified Morosini on 4 October 1987 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11746">In biology, '''polyspermy''' describes an [[Ovum|egg]] that has been [[Fertilisation|fertilized]] by more than one [[Spermatozoon|sperm]].  [[Ploidy|Diploid]] organisms normally contain two copies of each [[chromosome]], one from each parent.  The cell resulting from polyspermy, on the other hand, contains three or more copies of each chromosome—one from the egg and one each from multiple sperm.  Usually, the result is an inviable [[zygote]]. This may occur because sperm are too efficient at reaching and fertilizing eggs due to the selective pressures of [[sperm competition]]. Such a situation is often deleterious to the female: in other words, the [[male-male competition]] among sperm spills over to create [[sexual conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnqvist, G. &amp; Rowe, L.

==Chicken and zebra finch eggs require multiple sperm==
In the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1818/20151682 |title=Polyspermy in birds: sperm numbers and embryo survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; as reported in the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/bird-eggs-are-fertilized-by-more-than-one-sperm.html |title=Bird Eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield, and one of the study’s authors, reported that eggs of zebra finches and chickens require multiple sperm, from 10 to hundreds of sperm, to penetrate the egg to ensure successful fertilization and growth of the bird embryo.

== Physiological polyspermy ==
Physiological polyspermy happens when the egg normally accepts more than one sperm but only one of the multiple sperm will actually fuse its nucleus with the nucleus of the egg. Physiological polyspermy is present in some species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Some species utilize physiological polyspermy as the proper mechanism for developing their offspring. Some of these animals include birds, [[ctenophora]], reptiles and amphibians, just to name a few. Some vertebrates that are both [[amniote]] or anamniote. For example, [[urodele amphibians]], [[cartilaginous fish]], birds and reptiles, undergo physiological polyspermy because of the [[internal fertilization]] of their yolky eggs. Sperm triggers [[egg activation]] by the induction of free calcium ion concentration in the cytoplasm of the egg. This induction plays a very critical role in both physiological polyspermy and monomeric polyspermy species. The rise in calcium causes activation of the egg. The egg will then be altered on both a biochemical and morphological level.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y. (2012). Egg activation in physiological polyspermy. Reproduction, 144(1), 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals as well as sea urchins, the sudden rise in calcium concentration occurs because of the influx of calcium ions within the egg. These calcium ions are responsible for the [[cortical granule]] reaction, and are also stored in the egg's endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology. 6th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2000. Gamete Fusion and the Prevention of Polyspermy. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10033/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Physiological Polyspermy.png|thumb|During Physiological Polyspermy, the egg accepts multiple sperms but only allows one sperm to fuse its nucleus with the egg's nucleus.]] 

Unlike physiological polyspermy, monospermic fertilization deals with the analysis of the egg calcium waves, as this is the typical reproduction process in all species. Species that undergo physiological polyspermy have [[polypoidy]]-preventing mechanisms that act inside the egg. This is quite different from the normal polyspermy block on the outside of the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, N. A. T. H. A. L. I. E., &amp; Charbonneau, M. I. C. H. E. L. (1992). Intracellular free Ca2+ changes during physiological polyspermy in amphibian eggs. Development, 114(3), 617-624.&lt;/ref&gt; However, polyspermy is impossible in human reproduction. The decline in the numbers of sperm that swim to the oviduct is one of two ways that prevents polyspermy in humans. The other mechanism is the blocking of sperm in the fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;Mio, Y., Iwata, K., Yumoto, K., Kai, Y., Sargant, H. C., Mizoguchi, C., … Nishikori, K. (2012). Possible mechanism of polyspermy block in human oocytes observed by time-lapse cinematography. Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, 29(9), 951–956. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-012-9815-x&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Developmental Biology Interactive, if an egg becomes fertilized by multiple sperm, the embryo will then gain various paternal centrioles. When this happens, there is a struggle for extra chromosomes. This competition causes disarrayment in [[cleavage furrow]] formation and the consequence is death of the [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast block of polyspermy==
The eggs of [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms are [[adaptation|adapted]] to avoid this situation.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. G. 1996. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female Control: Sexual Selection by Cryptic Female Choice]''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses are particularly well characterized in the [[sea urchin]], which responds to the acceptance of one sperm by inhibiting the successful penetration of the egg by subsequent sperm.  Similar defenses exist in other [[eukaryotes]].

The prevention of polyspermy in sea urchins depends on a change in the electrical [[charge (physics)|charge]] across the surface of the egg, which is caused by the fusion of the first sperm with the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, LA.. 1976. Fast block to polyspermy in sea urchin eggs is electrically mediated. ''Nature" '''261''':68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfertilized sea urchin eggs have a negative charge inside, but the charge becomes positive upon fertilization.  When sea urchin sperm encounter an egg with a positive charge, sperm-egg fusion is blocked.  Thus, after the first sperm contacts the egg and causes the change, subsequent sperms are prevented from fusing.  This "electrical polyspermy block" is thought to result because a positively charged molecule in the sperm surface [[membrane (biology)|membrane]] is repelled by the positive charge at the egg surface.&lt;ref&gt;Iwao, Y., Jaffe, L.A. 1989. Evidence that the voltage-dependent component in the fertilization process is contributed by the sperm. ''Developmental Biology''. '''134''':446-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical polyspermy blocks operate in many animal species, including [[frog]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[marine worm]]s, but not in the several [[mammal]]s that have been studied ([[hamster]], [[rabbit]], [[mouse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, L. A.,  M. Gould. 1985. Polyspermy-preventing mechanisms. In C. B. Metz &amp; A. Monroy (editors) Biology of Fertilization. Academic, New York. pp. 223-250.&lt;/ref&gt;  In species without an electrical block, polyspermy is usually prevented by secretion of materials that establish a mechanical barrier to polyspermy.  Animals such as sea urchins have a two-step polyspermy prevention [[evolutionary game theory|strategy]], with the fast, but transient, electrical block superseded after the first minute or so by a more slowly developing permanent mechanical block.  It is thought that electrical blocks evolved in those species where a very fast block to polyspermy is needed, due to the presence of many sperm arriving simultaneously at the egg surface, as occurs in animals such as sea urchins.  In sea urchins, fertilization occurs externally in the ocean, such that hundreds of sperm can encounter the egg within several seconds.

==Slow block of polyspermy==
In mammals, in which fertilization occurs internally, fewer sperm reach the fertilization site in the [[oviduct]]. This may be the result of the female genital tract being adapted to minimize the number of sperm reaching the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, A. W. H. 1953. Distribution of sperms in the genital tract of the female rabbit after coitus. ''Australian Journal of Biological Sciences'' '''6''':693-705.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, polyspermy preventing mechanisms are essential in mammals; a secretion reaction, the "[[cortical reaction]]" modifies the extracellular coat of the egg (the [[zona pellucida]]), and additional mechanisms that are not well understood modify the egg's plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, A.J, Evans, J.P. 2006. Mammalian membrane block to polyspermy: new insights into how mammalian eggs prevent fertilisation by multiple sperm. "Reprod Fertil Dev." '''18''':53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The zona pellucida is modified by serine proteases that are released from the cortical granules. The proteases destroy the protein link between the cell membrane and the vitelline envelope, remove any receptors that other sperm have bound to, and help to form the fertilization envelope from the cortical granules.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|title=Developmental Biology, 10th ed.|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers|location=Sunderland, MA USA|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cortical reaction occurs due to calcium oscillations inside the oocyte. What triggers such oscillations is PLC-zeta, a phospholipase unique to sperm that is very sensitive to calcium concentrations. When the first spermatozoa gets inside the oocyte, it brings in PLC-zeta, that is activated by oocyte's basal calcium concentrations, initiates formation of IP3 and causes calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, generating the oscillations in calcium concentration that will activate the oocyte and block polyspermy.&lt;ref&gt;Miao, YL &amp; Williams CJ. 2012. Calcium signaling in mammalian egg activation and embryo development: the influence of subcellular localization. Molecular Reproduction &amp; Development 79:742-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary advantage==
Female defenses select for ever more aggressive male sperm however, leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]]. On the one hand, polyspermy creates inviable zygotes and lowers female fitness, but on the other, defenses may prevent fertilization altogether. This leads to a delicate compromise between the two, and has been suggested as one possible cause for the relatively high [[infertility]] rates seen in mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, E. H., G. Arnqvist, T. E. Pitcher. 2002. The evolution of infertility: Does hatching rate in birds coevolve with female polyandry? ''Journal of Evolutionary Biology''. '''15''':702-709.&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, polyspermy is allowed to happen resulting in more than one sperm entering the egg creating viable offspring without detrimental effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snook|first=Rhonda R.|last2=Hosken|first2=David J.|last3=Karr|first3=Timothy L.|date=2011-12-01|title=The biology and evolution of polyspermy: insights from cellular and functional studies of sperm and centrosomal behavior in the fertilized egg|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/142/6/779|journal=Reproduction|language=en|volume=142|issue=6|pages=779–792|doi=10.1530/REP-11-0255|issn=1470-1626|pmid=21964827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulseless electrical activity''' ('''PEA'''), also known as '''electromechanical dissociation''', refers to [[cardiac arrest]] in which the [[electrocardiogram]] shows a heart rhythm that should produce a [[pulse]], but does not. Pulseless electrical activity is found initially in about 55% of people in cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=Bal2016/&gt;

Under normal circumstances, electrical activation of muscle cells precedes mechanical contraction of the heart (known as ''electromechanical coupling''). In PEA, there is electrical activity, but the heart either does not contract or there are other reasons this results in an insufficient [[cardiac output]] to generate a pulse and supply blood to the organs.&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt; While PEA is classified as a form of cardiac arrest, significant cardiac output may still be present which may be determined and best visualized by bedside ultrasound.

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
[[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is the first treatment for PEA, while potential underlying causes are identified and treated. The medication [[epinephrine]] may be administered.&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt; Survival is about 20%.&lt;ref name=Bal2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldzizhar|first1=A|last2=Manuylova|first2=E|last3=Marchenko|first3=R|last4=Kryvalap|first4=Y|last5=Carey|first5=MG|title=Ventricular Tachycardias: Characteristics and Management.|journal=Critical care nursing clinics of North America|date=September 2016|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–29|pmid=27484660|doi=10.1016/j.cnc.2016.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Pulseless electrical activity leads to a loss of cardiac output, and the blood supply to the [[brain]] is interrupted. As a result, PEA is usually noticed when a person [[Unconsciousness|loses consciousness]] and stops [[breathing]] spontaneously. This is confirmed by examining the [[airway]] for obstruction, observing the chest for respiratory movement, and feeling the [[pulse]] (usually at the [[carotid artery]]) for a period of 10 seconds.&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt;

==Causes==
These possible causes are remembered as the 6 Hs and the 6 Ts.&lt;ref name=ACLS_2003_H_T&gt;{{cite book |author=Mazur, Glen |title=Acls: Principles And Practice |publisher=Amer Heart Assn |location=[Dallas, TX] |year=2003 |pages=71–87 |isbn=0-87493-341-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACLS_2003_EP_HT&gt;{{cite book |author1=Barnes, Thomas Garden |author2=Cummins, Richard O. |author3=Field, John |author4=Hazinski, Mary Fran |title=ACLS for experienced providers |publisher=American Heart Association |location=[Dallas, TX] |year=2003 |pages=3–5 |isbn=0-87493-424-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECC_2005_7.2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |title=Part 7.2: Management of Cardiac Arrest |journal=Circulation  |date=December 2005 |volume=112 |issue=24 Suppl |pages=IV 58–66 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166557 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Hs and Ts]]

Pressure effects associated with artificial ventilation may also contribute to significant reduction in cardiac output, resulting in a clinical diagnosis of PEA.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The possible mechanisms by which the above conditions can cause pulseless in PEA or the same as those recognized as producing circulatory shock states. These are (1) impairment of cardiac filling, (2) impaired pumping effectiveness of the heart, (3) circulatory obstruction and (4) pathological vasodilation causing loss of vascular resistance and excess capacitance. More than one mechanism may be involved in any given case.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Dissociazione elettromeccanica (PEA).svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Pulseless electrical activity, it is possible to observe by invasive blood pressure (red) the transition from a normal mechanical activity of the heart, which progressively changes in rhythm and contractile quality to asystolia, even in the presence of normal electrical activity (green), also confirmed by the pulse oximeter detection even if with artifacts (blue)]]
The absence of a pulse confirms a clinical diagnosis of cardiac arrest, but PEA can only be distinguished from other causes of cardiac arrest with a device capable of [[electrocardiography]] (ECG/EKG). In PEA, there is organised or semi-organised electrical activity in the heart as opposed to asystole (flatline) or to the disorganised  electrical activity of either [[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[ventricular tachycardia]].&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Cardiac resuscitation guidelines (ACLS/BCLS) advise that [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] should be initiated promptly to maintain [[cardiac output]] until the PEA can be corrected. The approach in treatment of PEA is to treat the underlying cause, if known (e.g. relieving a tension pneumothorax). Where an underlying cause for PEA cannot be determined and/or reversed, the treatment of pulseless electrical activity is similar to that for [[asystole]].&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt; There is no evidence that external cardiac compression can increase cardiac output in any of the many scenarios of PEA, such as hemorrhage, in which impairment of cardiac filling is the underlying mechanism producing loss of a detectable pulse.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

A priority in resuscitation is placement of an intravenous or intraosseous line for administration of medications. The mainstay of drug therapy for PEA is [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) 1&amp;nbsp;mg every 3–5 minutes. Although previously the use of [[atropine]] was recommended in the treatment of PEA/asystole, this recommendation was withdrawn in 2010 by the [[American Heart Association]] due to lack of evidence for therapeutic benefit.&lt;ref name="2010AHA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |title=Part 8: Adult Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support|journal=Circulation  |date=November 2010 |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl |pages=S729–S767 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729 |pmid=20956224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epinephrine too has a limited evidence base, and it is recommended on the basis of its mechanism of action.

Sodium bicarbonate 1meq per kilogram may be considered in this rhythm as well, although there is little evidence to support this practice. Its routine use is not recommended for patients in this context, except in special situations (e.g. preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]]).&lt;ref name="2010AHA" /&gt;

All of these drugs should be administered along with appropriate CPR techniques. [[Defibrillator]]s cannot be used to correct this rhythm, as the problem lies in the response of the myocardial tissue to electrical impulses.

A '''ratite''' is any of a diverse group of [[flightless bird|flightless]] and mostly large and long-legged birds of the infraclass [[Palaeognathae]].&lt;ref name="ITIS" /&gt; [[Kiwi]]s, however, are relatively much smaller and shorter-legged, as well as being the only [[nocturnal]] ratites.

The systematics of and relationships within the paleognath clade have been in flux. Previously, all the flightless members had been assigned to the order Struthioniformes, which is more recently regarded as containing only the [[ostrich]].&lt;ref name = "Brands" /&gt;&lt;ref name = TOLweb /&gt; The modern bird superorder Palaeognathae consists of ratites and flighted [[Neotropic]] [[tinamou]]s (compare to [[Neognathae]]).&lt;ref name = "Phillips2010" /&gt; Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no [[keel (bird)|keel]] on their [[sternum]] – hence the name from the Latin ''ratis'' ([[raft]], a vessel which has no keel). Without this to anchor their wing muscles, they could not fly even if they were to develop suitable wings.{{citation needed|reason=Archaeopteryx had no keel but could still fly so this factoid needs a citation|date=June 2015}} Recent research has indicated that ratites are a [[paraphyletic]] group; tinamous fall within them, and are the [[sister group]] of the extinct [[moa]].&lt;ref name = "Phillips2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Allentoft2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Baker2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msu153| title = Genomic Support for a Moa-Tinamou Clade and Adaptive Morphological Convergence in Flightless Ratites| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| year = 2014| last1 = Baker | first1 = A.

== Species ==
{{See also|List of ratites}}

=== Living forms ===
The [[Africa]]n [[ostrich]] is the largest living ratite. A large member of this species can be nearly {{convert|2.8|m|ft}} tall, weigh as much as {{convert|156|kg|lb}},&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt; and can outrun a horse.

Of the living species, the [[Australia]]n [[emu]] is next in height, reaching up to {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} tall and about {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt; Like the ostrich, it is a fast-running, powerful bird of the open plains and [[woodland]]s.

Also native to Australia and the islands to the north are the three species of [[cassowary]]. Shorter than an emu, but heavier and solidly built, cassowaries prefer thickly vegetated [[tropical]] forest. They can be very dangerous when surprised or cornered because of their razor sharp [[Talon (anatomy)|talons]]. In [[New Guinea]], cassowary eggs are brought back to villages and the chicks raised for eating as a much-prized delicacy, despite (or perhaps because of) the risk they pose to life and limb. They reach up to {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} tall and weigh as much as {{convert|59|kg|lb}}&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt;

[[South America]] has two species of [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]], large fast-running birds of the [[Pampas]]. The larger [[American rhea]] grows to about {{convert|1.4|m|ft}} tall and usually weighs {{convert|15|to(-)|40|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt;

The smallest ratites are the five species of [[kiwi]] from [[New Zealand]]. Kiwi are [[chicken]]-sized, shy, and [[nocturnal]]. They nest in deep [[burrow]]s and use a highly developed sense of smell to find small insects and grubs in the soil. Kiwi are notable for laying eggs that are very large in relation to their body size. A kiwi egg may equal 15 to 20 percent of the body mass of a female kiwi. The smallest species of kiwi is the [[little spotted kiwi]], at {{convert|0.9|to(-)|1.9|kg|lb}} and {{convert|35|to(-)|45|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt;

=== Holocene extinct forms ===
At least nine species of [[moa]] lived in New Zealand before the arrival of humans, ranging from turkey-sized to the [[giant moa]] ''[[Dinornis giganteus]]'' with a height of {{convert|3.7|m|ft}} and weighing about {{convert|230|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt; They became extinct by A.D. 1400 due to hunting by [[Māori people|Māori]] settlers, who arrived around A.D. 1280.

''[[Aepyornis maximus]]'', the "elephant bird" of [[Madagascar]], was the heaviest bird ever known. Although shorter than the tallest moa, a large ''A. maximus'' could weigh over {{convert|400|kg|lb}} and stand up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name = Grzimelek /&gt; Accompanying it were three other species of ''[[Aepyornis]]'' as well as three species of the smaller genus ''[[Mullerornis]]''. All these species went into decline following the arrival of humans on Madagascar around 2000 years ago, and were gone by the 17th or 18th century if not earlier.

== Classification ==&lt;!-- AnAcadCiêncBras74:365; CanJZool81:962 --&gt;
[[File:Kiwi, ostrich, Dinornis.jpg|thumb|Comparison of a [[kiwi]], [[ostrich]], and ''[[Dinornis]]'', each with its egg]]

There are two [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] approaches to ratite classification: the one applied here combines the groups as [[family (biology)|families]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Struthioniformes''', while the other supposes that the lineages evolved mostly independently and thus elevates the families to order rank (e.g. '''Rheiformes''', '''Casuariformes''' etc.).

== Evolution ==

The longstanding story of their evolution suggests that they share a common flightless ancestor that lived on [[Gondwana]], whose descendants were carried by [[continental drift]] to their present locations. Supporting this idea, some studies based on morphology, immunology and DNA sequencing has indicated that ratites are [[monophyletic]].&lt;ref name = "Haddrath, O &amp; Baker, A (2001)" /&gt; Cracraft's (1974) biogeographic vicariance hypothesis suggests that ancestral flightless paleognaths, the ancestors of ratites, were present and widespread in Gondwana during the Late Cretaceous. As the supercontinent fragmented due to [[plate tectonics]], they were carried by plate movements to their current positions and evolved into the species present today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phylogeny and evolution of ratite birds|last = Cracraft|first = J|date = October 1974|journal = Ibis|doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1974.tb07648.x|pmid = |volume=116|issue = 4|pages=494–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known ratite fossils date to the [[Paleocene]] epoch about 56 million years ago (e.g. ''[[Diogenornis]]'', a possible early relative of the rhea).&lt;ref name = Laurinetal2012 /&gt; However, more primitive [[paleognathae|paleognaths]] are known from several million years earlier,&lt;ref name = Leonardetal2005 /&gt; and the classification and membership of the Ratitae itself is uncertain. Some of the earliest ratites occur in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Buffetaut2014" /&gt;

Recent analyses of genetic variation between the ratites do not support this simple picture. The ratites may have diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanan ancestor. Also, the Middle Eocene ratites such as ''[[Palaeotis]]'' and ''[[Remiornis]]'' from Central Europe may imply that the "out-of-Gondwana" hypothesis is oversimplified. Furthermore, recent analysis of twenty nuclear genes has  indicated that the flighted [[tinamou]]s cluster within the ratites, thus demonstrating that ratites are a paraphyletic group. The authors say the data "unequivocally places tinamous within ratites".&lt;ref name = "Harshman" /&gt; A later study using forty novel nuclear loci confirmed the aforementioned conclusion.&lt;ref name = "Smith2013" /&gt;

A comparative study of the full mitochondrial DNA sequences of living ratites plus two moas places moas in the basal position, followed by rheas, followed by ostriches, followed by kiwis, with emus and cassowaries being closest relatives.&lt;ref name = "Haddrath, O &amp; Baker, A (2001)" /&gt; Another study has reversed the relative positions of moas and rheas, and indicated that elephant birds are not close relatives of ostriches or other ratites,&lt;ref name = "Cooper" /&gt; while a study of nuclear genes shows ostriches branching first, followed by rheas and tinamous, then kiwis splitting from emus and cassowaries.&lt;ref name = "Harshman" /&gt; In a recent study, elephant birds were shown to be most closely related to the New Zealand kiwi.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt;

These studies share branching dates which suggest that, while ancestral moas may have been present in New Zealand since it split off from Gondwana, the ancestors of kiwis appear to have arrived there from Australia more recently, perhaps by island-hopping and possibly by [[Proapteryx|powered flight]]. A recent extensive morphological comparison makes South American and Australian ratites a clade, with three successively more distant sister groups consisting of ostriches, elephant birds, and a clade of New Zealand ratites.&lt;ref name = Bourdon /&gt;

All analyses (apart from one recent morphological study) show that rheas and extant Australo-Pacific ratites are monophyletic. The DNA data showing the ostriches branching first would match the sequence of Gondwana's [[plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] breakup.&lt;ref name = "Harshman" /&gt; Other, but not all, aspects of ratite [[biogeography|paleobiogeography]] were found to be consistent with the [[Allopatric speciation|vicariance]] ([[plate tectonics|plate tectonic]] split-up of Gondwana) hypothesis. The sister-group relationship of New Zealand ratites to other ratites proposed on morphological grounds would not be consistent with vicariance, while the proposed South American-Australian clade would be.&lt;ref name = Bourdon/&gt;

Recent phylogenomic studies indicate that tinamous nest within this group. This makes 'ratites' [[paraphyletic]] rather than monophyletic.&lt;ref name = "Harshman" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hackett" /&gt; Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. While the ratites were traditionally thought of as an ancestrally flightless, monophyletic group, the branching of the tinamous within the ratite lineage suggests that ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times.&lt;ref name = Harshman /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Holmes" /&gt; More recent evidence suggests six or more times.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but such a development is without precedent in avian history, while loss of flight is commonplace.&lt;ref name = "Harshman" /&gt;

By 2014, a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny including fossil members showed tinamous nested well within the group.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; Ostriches were placed on the first ([[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]) branch, followed by rheas, then a clade consisting of moas and tinamous, followed by the final two branches, a clade of emus plus cassowaries, and one of elephant birds plus kiwis.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; The moa-tinamou relationship is consistent with other earlier and current findings,&lt;ref name = "Phillips2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Allentoft2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Baker2014" /&gt; while the finding of a sister relationship between elephant birds and kiwis is new. Additional support for this relationship was obtained from morphological analysis.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt;

While the basal position of ostriches would be predicted by [[vicariance|vicariant speciation]] based on continental drift, the elephant bird-kiwi relation appears to require dispersal across oceans by flight; the phylogeny as a whole suggests multiple independent [[parallel evolution|parallel]] origins of flightlessness (at least six times, or once in each major ratite lineage) and gigantism (at least five times).&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; [[Cope's rule|Gigantism]] in birds is normally [[Island gigantism|insular]]; however, a ten-million-year-long window of opportunity for evolution of avian gigantism on continents may have existed following the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]], before mammals had evolved to large size. Additionally, ratite ancestors were able to fill diurnal herbivory niches originally filled by dinosaurs.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; However, some authorities have been skeptical of the new findings and conclusions.&lt;ref name = "Zimmer2014" /&gt;

Kiwis and tinamous are the only palaeognath lineages not to evolve gigantism, perhaps because of competitive exclusion by giant ratites already present on New Zealand and South America when they arrived or arose.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt; The fact that New Zealand has been the only land mass to support two major lineages of flightless ratites may reflect the absence of native mammals, which allowed kiwis to occupy a mammal-like nocturnal [[Ecological niche|niche]].&lt;ref name="Le DucRenaud2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Le Duc|first1=D.|last2=Renaud|first2=G.|last3=Krishnan|first3=A.|last4=Almén|first4=M.

L.|title= Unexpected diversity of ratites (Aves, Palaeognathae) in the early Cenozoic of South America: palaeobiogeographical implications|journal=Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology|volume=41|date= 2016-07-05|pages= 1–11|doi= 10.1080/03115518.2016.1184898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, studies on genetic and morphological divergence and fossil distribution show that paleognaths as a whole probably had an origin in the northern hemisphere. Early Cenozoic northern hemisphere paleognaths such as ''[[Lithornis]]'', ''[[Pseudocrypturus]]'', ''[[Paracathartes]]'' and ''[[Palaeotis]]'' appear to be the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of the clade. The various ratite lineages were probably descended from flying ancestors that colonised the south in multiple waves, probably initially in South America, and then evolved gigantism.&lt;ref name="Yonezawa2017" /&gt;

===Loss of flight===

Loss of flight allows birds to eliminate the energetic cost of maintaining flight-enabling [[Bird anatomy#Muscular system|pectoral muscle]] mass.&lt;ref name = Mcnab1994 /&gt; The basal metabolic rate of volant species is much higher than that of flightless terrestrial birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~jetterso/documents/CuboandArther2001.pdf|title = Patterns of correlated character evolution in flightless birds: a phylogenetic approach|last = Cubo|first = Arthur|date = May 4, 2001|journal = Evolutionary Ecology|volume = 14|issue = 8|pages = 693–702|doi = 10.1023/a:1011695406277|pmid = |access-date = |citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.1294}}&lt;/ref&gt; But energetic efficiency can only help explain the loss of flight when the benefits of flying are not critical to fitness.

Research on flightless rails indicates the flightless condition evolved in the absence of predators.&lt;ref name="Mcnab2006" /&gt; This shows flight to be generally necessary for survival and dispersal in birds.&lt;ref name="Diamond1991" /&gt; In apparent contradiction to this, many landmasses occupied by ratites are also inhabited by predatory mammals.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2014" /&gt; However, the [[K–Pg extinction event]] created a window of time with large predators absent that may have allowed the ancestors of ratites to evolve flightlessness.&lt;ref name="Phillips2010" /&gt; They subsequently underwent selection for large size.&lt;ref name="Phillips2010" /&gt; One hypothesis suggests that as predation pressure decreases on islands with low raptor species richness and no mammalian predators, the need for large, powerful flight muscles that make for a quick escape decreases.&lt;ref name = "Wright2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Natalie A.|last2=Steadman|first2=David W.|last3=Witt|first3=Christopher C.|date=2016-04-26|title=Predictable evolution toward flightlessness in volant island birds|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=113|issue=17|pages=4765–4770|doi=10.1073/pnas.1522931113|issn=1091-6490|pmc=4855539|pmid=27071105|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.4765W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, raptor species tend to become generalist predators on islands with low species richness as opposed to specializing in the predation of birds. An increase in leg size compensates for a reduction in wing length in insular birds that have not lost flight by providing a longer lever to increase force generated during the thrust that initiates takeoff.&lt;ref name = "Wright2016" /&gt;

== Description ==
Ratites in general have many physical characteristics in common, which are often not shared by the family [[Tinamidae]], or tinamous. First, the [[pectoralis major muscle|breast muscles]] are underdeveloped. They do not have keeled [[sternum|sterna]]. Their wishbones ([[furcula]]e) are almost absent. They have a simplified wing skeletons and musculature. Their legs are stronger and do not have air chambers, except the [[femur]]s. Their tail and flight feathers have retrogressed or have become decorative plumes. They have no feather vanes, which means they do not need to oil their feathers, hence they have no [[preen gland]]s. They have no separation of pterylae (feathered areas) and apteria (non-feathered areas),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedictionary.com for definitions of the two latin words&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, they have [[palaeognath]]ous [[palate]]s.&lt;ref name = Bruning /&gt;

Ostriches have the greatest [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]], rheas show some [[dichromatism]] during the breeding season. Emus, cassowaries, and kiwis show some dimorphism, predominantly in size.

While the ratites share a lot of similarities, they also have major differences. Ostriches have only two toes, with one being much larger than the other. Cassowaries have developed long inner toenails, used defensively. Ostriches and rheas have prominent wings; although they don't use them to fly, they do use them in courtship and predator distraction.&lt;ref name = "Bruning" /&gt;

Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On an [[allometric]] basis, [[paleognath]]s have generally smaller brains than [[neognath]]s. Kiwis are exceptions to this trend, and possess proportionally larger brains comparable to those of [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]], though evidence for similar advanced cognitive skills is currently lacking.&lt;ref name="Corfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corfield|first1=J.

== Behavior and ecology ==

=== Feeding and diet ===
Ratite chicks tend to be more [[omnivorous]] or [[insectivorous]]; similarities in adults end with feeding, as they all vary in diet and length of digestive tract, which is indicative of diet. Ostriches, with the longest tracts at {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are primarily [[herbivorous]]. Rheas' tracts are next longest at between {{convert|8|-|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and they also have [[caecum|caeca]]. They are also mainly [[herbivores]], concentrating on broad-leafed plants. However, they will eat insects if the opportunity arises. Emus have tracts of {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} length, and have a more omnivorous diet, including insects and other small animals. Cassowaries have nearly the shortest tracts at {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Finally, kiwis have the shortest tracts and eat earthworms, insects, and other similar creatures.&lt;ref name = "Bruning" /&gt; [[Moas]] and [[elephant birds]] were the largest native herbivores in their faunas, far larger than contemporary herbivorous mammals in the latter's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.07.001|title=Stratigraphic distribution of large flightless birds in the Palaeogene of Europe and its palaeobiological and palaeogeographical implications|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=138|pages=394–408|year=2014|last1=Buffetaut|first1=Eric|last2=Angst|first2=Delphine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some extinct ratites might have had odder lifestyles, such as the narrow-billed ''[[Diogenornis]]'' and ''[[Palaeotis]]'', compared to the shorebird-like [[lithornithids]], and could imply similar animalivorous diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alvarenga |first=H.

F. |year=1983 |title=Uma ave ratitae do Paleoceno Brasileiro: bacia calcária de Itaboraí, Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil |journal=Boletim do Museu Nacional, Nova Série, Geologia |volume=41 |pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mayr, Paleogene Fossil Birds&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Ratites are different from the flying birds in that they needed to adapt or evolve certain features to protect their young. First and foremost is the thickness of the shells of their eggs. Their young are hatched more developed than most and they can run or walk soon thereafter. Also, most ratites have communal nests, where they share the incubating duties with others. Ostriches are the only ratites where the female incubates; they share the duties, with the males incubating at night.  Cassowaries and emu are polyandrous, with males incubating eggs and rearing chicks with no obvious contribution from females. Ostriches and rheas are polygynous with each male courting several females. Male rheas are responsible for building nests and incubating while ostrich males incubate only at night. Kiwis stand out as the exception with extended monogamous reproductive strategies where either the male alone or both sexes incubate a single egg.&lt;ref name = "Bruning" /&gt; Without exception, ratite chicks are capable of swimming and even diving.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

== Ratites and humans ==
Ratites and humans have had a long relationship starting with the use of the egg for water containers, jewelry, or other art medium. Male ostrich feathers were popular for hats during the 18th century, which led to hunting and sharp declines in populations. Ostrich farming grew out of this need, and humans harvested feathers, hides, eggs, and meat from the ostrich. Emu farming also became popular for similar reasons and for their [[emu oil]]. Rhea feathers are popular for dusters, and eggs and meat are used for chicken and pet feed in South America. Ratite hides are popular for leather products like shoes.&lt;ref name = "Bruning" /&gt;

=== United States regulation ===
The USDA’s [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) began a voluntary, fee-for-service ratite inspection program in 1995 to help the fledgling industry improve the marketability of the meat. A provision in the FY2001 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 106-387) amended the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act]] to make federal inspection of ratite meat mandatory as of April 2001 (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).&lt;ref name = "Womach2005" /&gt;

'''Charles Henry "Speedy" Atkins''' (1875–1928) was an American tobacco worker in [[Paducah, Kentucky]], who became posthumously notable. A pauper at death, he drowned in the [[Ohio River]]. The city turned over his body for a pauper's burial to his friend A.Z. Hamock, the only African-American undertaker in town. Hamock preserved Atkins' body in an experiment with preservatives, and occasionally displayed it after his death. Hamock's wife had custody of the remains for 45 years, during which Atkins' mummy acquired increasing notoriety. The body of Atkins was finally buried in 1994, 66 years after he drowned. The event was covered by national media and TV.

==Biography==
Charles Atkins was born in [[Tennessee]] and, as an adult, moved to [[Kentucky]] to find work. Not much is known about his life. He settled in downtown [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] as an hourly employee at a plant with ties to the [[tobacco industry]]. He gained the nickname "Speedy" at work because of his speed with handling [[tobacco]]. He was also known as a womanizer. Single and without known relatives, he befriended A. Z. Hamock, an African American who owned the city's only [[funeral home]] for blacks in the segregated city.

In May 1928, Speedy went fishing and fell with his line into the [[Ohio River]], where he drowned. The city transferred his body to Hamock's Funeral Home for a [[pauper's funeral|pauper's burial]]. Having created a powerful [[preservative]], Hamock decided to experiment with it to preserve Atkins' body. The mixture transformed the corpse into a wooden-like [[statue]]. While Atkins' black skin was altered to a reddish color, his facial features remained recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOqU-9BTZO4C&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=charles+speedy+atkins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akdPsJ2lK9&amp;sig=L_gLmejbAx-Ax9hJCiAe_zMtPRU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bVDpSfOMHZHFtgeNuqTBBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA94,M1 Quigley, Christine. ''Modern Mummies''], McFarland, 1998, pp. 94-96. {{ISBN|0-7864-0492-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0492-6}}. Retrieved April 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamock put the preserved body of Speedy on occasional display at the funeral home; he mostly stored it in a closet.&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times"/&gt; He did not charge a fee for viewers. Washed away by waters of the [[Ohio River]] during the Paducah [[flood of 1937]], Speedy's body was recognized and returned to Hamock at his funeral home.

After Hamock died in 1949, his wife [[Velma Gaines-Hamock|Velma]] took over custody of Speedy's body. She kept it for another 45 years before burial. During the 66 years that Speedy's body was preserved, awareness of the mummified corpse became more widespread.

Mrs. Hamock planned to bury the [[mummy]] in 1991 on her late husband's 100th birthday,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1332945.html] "Man to be buried in '91", ''Washington Post'', 16 July 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; but waited until May 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"66-tear-old corpse to be laid to rest in Paducah", ''Lexington Herald'', 26 June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TV show to feature Paducah corpse", ''Lexington Herald'', 4 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15830994.html "Black man who died 66 years ago is finally buried"], ''Jet'', 29 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 people attended Atkins' 1994 funeral and burial in [[Maplelawn Cemetery]] in Paducah.&lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4241651.html "Embalmed 'Speedy' Is Laid to Rest - Finally"], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 6 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
Because of his body's unique condition, "Speedy" Atkins' mummy was featured in national media as well as [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not]], the TV program ''[[That's Incredible]]'', and the ''[[National Enquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sceurman, Mark, ''Weird Kentucky'', Sterling Publishing Company, 2008.

The '''Stay Puft Marshmallow Man''' is a fictional character from the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]], which sometimes appears as a giant, lumbering paranormal monster. It is the main antagonist in the film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984) and first appears as a picture logo on a prop package of marshmallows in Dana Barrett's apartment, on a graffiti advertisement on the building next to the Ghostbusters' [[Headquarters|HQ]], and then in the climax of the film as the physical manifestation of the [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] deity [[Gozer]].  Subsequently, it has been incorporated into many other Ghostbusters media, including the animated series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', [[comic books]], a [[stage show]], and video games.

In the ''Ghostbusters'' universe, it is the [[mascot]] of the fictional Stay Puft [[Marshmallow]] Corporation, much like [[Michelin]]'s [[Michelin Man|Bibendum]] (also known as the "Michelin Man") and the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] (both of which it resembles). Within that universe, it is also the subject of a ''Marshmallow Man'' cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Gameweasel.com|title=Episode 90: Interview with the executive producer of ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'', Brendon Goss, where he talks about the game and the "Stay Puft Marshmallow Man" cartoon within the Ghostbusters Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the ''Ghostbusters'' logo, the image of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man has become one of the most recognizable emblems of the franchise.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Appearance and character==
Stay Puft is a large white [[humanoid]] figure made of conjoined [[marshmallow]]s. He wears a white [[sailor cap]] with a red ribbon attached on top, and a blue [[hatband]]. Around his neck is a blue traditional sailor's collar and a red [[neckerchief]].

After images of him are seen on a billboard and a bag of the marshmallows earlier in the film, he is then seen in the climax of ''Ghostbusters'' as one of two physical bodies of [[Gozer]], a god who is defeated when Stay Puft is destroyed. Stay Puft's exact to-scale height in the movie is 112.5 feet (34.3 m) tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theraffon.net/~spookcentral/gb1_dvd1999_featurette_sfx.htm |title=– In the 15th Anniversary Edition''Ghostbusters'' DVD interview with the SFX team, Mark Stetson (the model shop supervisor for the film) states that the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is exactly one hundred and twelve and a half feet tall |publisher=Theraffon.net |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his height in the novelization of the movie is given at 100 feet (30.5 m).

He is then recreated and subsequently captured a number of different times by the Ghostbusters. Although mean and destructive at first, he later befriends Slimer and the Ghostbusters in the animated series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', and helps them out with various problems.

==Concept and debut==
[[Dan Aykroyd]] conceived of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man for his initial script for ''Ghostbusters'' the movie. He created the character to show that "it seems harmless and puffy and cute—but given the right circumstances, everything can be turned black and become evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jonah Goldberg|Goldberg, Jonah]] |work=[[National Review]]|date= February 3, 2003 | title=Incredible, Unstoppable Titan of Terror! | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205756/incredible-unstoppable-titan-terror/jonah-goldberg | accessdate=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Akroyd, Dan|work=Ghostbusters: Special Edition DVD|title=Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stay Puft was only one of many large-scale monsters in this early draft of the script, but after Aykroyd worked with co-writer [[Harold Ramis]] and director [[Ivan Reitman]], the team scaled back the intended sequence until only Stay Puft remained out of the original large-scale monsters.

The likeness of Stay Puft was inspired by Peter O'Boyle, a security guard at [[Columbia Pictures]] whom Reitman met while filming his previous movie, ''[[Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone]]'' (1983). According to Sam Delaney of ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Stay Puft's familiar mascot combined elements of real-life brand ambassadors the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] and [[Michelin Man|Bibendum]] (a.k.a.  the Michelin Ti&lt;!--"tire" is quoted material; do not change--&gt;re Man)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 26, 2007| title=Brand designs | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/features/story/0,,2135108,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate= August 13, 2007| first=Sam | last=Delaney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stay Puft is seen only briefly in the movie. He is "conjured up"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mueller, author of "Ghostbusters, The Supernatural; Spectacular, page 240, Tor Edition&lt;/ref&gt; as a new form for the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] god Gozer, who previously arrives atop an [[apartment building]] at [[55 Central Park West]] in New York City in the form of an androgynous woman with metallic skin and eyes. After a quick battle with the Ghostbusters she vanishes, and then as a disembodied voice Gozer tells the Ghostbusters that the next thing they think of will be the form it will assume to destroy their world. Ray Stantz (Aykroyd) instead makes the decision to think of this marshmallow mascot when the Ghostbusters are given a choice as to which physical form Gozer will conquer the world in.

As he explains, "It just popped in there", and that he "tried to think of the most harmless thing", describing Mr.&amp;nbsp;Stay Puft as "something that could never possibly destroy us". Moments later, a giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is seen walking towards the apartment building. The Ghostbusters shoot at Stay Puft with their [[proton pack]]s, setting him on fire, but do not succeed in stopping his advance. They then get the idea of shooting at the portal through which the god emerged, by crossing the streams of all four of their packs. The plan triggers an explosion that destroys the gate and Stay Puft, reducing the latter into molten marshmallow cream that rains down onto the roof of the [[skyscraper]] and bystanders on the street below.

===Special effects===
The character as seen in the movie was created by Bill Bryan using miniatures, optical compositing, and Bryan himself in a [[latex]] suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Vince Lambolito |date=3 February 2003 | title=Our Top 20 FX Suits! | url=http://cardboardmonocle.com/blog/?page_id=747 | work=Cardboard Monocle | accessdate=13 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716093643/http://cardboardmonocle.com/blog/?page_id=747 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was made of two layers, an outer flammable layer and inner fire-proof layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Starlog]]|date= October 1984 |issue= 87|title= The Haunting Special Effects of ''Ghostbusters''|author=Hutchison, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the finished movie's most noticeable errors appear in the Stay Puft scenes: he is seen with and without his [[bow tie]], while in other scenes the optical rendering was so poor that he passes through a church rather than crushing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commentary |edition= 15th Anniversary |work=Ghostbusters'' DVD''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Games===
* In [[Activision]]'s ''[[Ghostbusters (Activision video game)|Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), designed by [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], small ghosts terrorize the city and gather together in front of the "Zuul Building" and occasionally other locations, where after enough of them have collected they would form the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, who could destroy some of the nearby buildings. After enough ghosts have entered the Zuul Building, the player could then go to it and find Stay Puft moving back and forth blocking the entrance. If the player could pass him without being squashed, the player would then climb the stairs and either win the game or find the final boss [[Gozer]] at the top of the building, in the form of a woman. On the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, Stay Puft is seen again from the roof on a screen just, below the final boss. He is climbing the building and acts as a counter: if he reaches the top of the building the game ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Ultimate Unauthorized Nintendo Strategies, Volume 2|authors=Sandler, Corey &amp; Badgett, Tom |title=Chapter 5: NES Golden Oldies (''Ghostbusters'' section)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters Mega Drive/Genesis video game|Ghostbusters]]'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghostbusters|author=Sega Genesis|asin=B000035XJB|publisher=Sega}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Sega Genesis]], "Stay Puft" appears outside a highrise building punching inward as the player progresses through the level and then appears as a boss at the top of the building, but is not related to Gozer. Here he claims to have eaten too many marshmallows, then realizing he had become the Marshmallow Man. In addition to trying to punch the player from the left and right sides of the screen, he also uses special powers such as breathing fire and shooting laser bolts from his eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Sega Genesis Secrets, Volume 2|authors=DeMaria, Rusel &amp; Meston, Zach |title=Chapter 5, ''Ghostbusters'' (High-Rise Building section)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Traveller's Tales|TT Games]]' ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', he is a playable character in the game, with archive audio from the [[Ghostbusters|first film]] for his dialogue. He comes in his own Fun Pack, with a terror dog as his personal vehicle. He is also a boss in the Ghostbusters Level Pack and the [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Answer the Call]] Story Pack in brick built form.

===Stage productions===
* In the ''[[Ghostbusters Spooktacular]]'' stage show (1990-1996) at [[Universal Studios]], Florida, the ending battle with Stay Puft has the Ghostbusters destroying him directly, rather than firing at the portal to close the dimensional gateway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theuniversalevolution.com/universal-studios-florida/ghostbusters-spooktacular-show |title=Video archive footage of "Ghostbusters Spooktacular" stage show |publisher=Theuniversalevolution.com |date=1992-03-12 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-movie appearances==
[[File:gb138.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Outside of appearances in the television series, Stay Puft (seen here menacing the Ghostbusters and [[Slimer]]) appeared in numerous issues of the various [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comicbook series]] as well. From ''The Real Ghostbusters'' #138. Published by [[Marvel UK]].]]
Following the original film, the television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' brought Stay Puft back; in fact Joe Medjuck, the executive producer of the show, states that Stay Puft was in the first script they received from Dan Aykroyd on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD|title=The Real Ghostbusters Complete Collection|type=Interview|publisher=[[Time–Life|Direct Holdings Americas]], [[CPT Holdings]]|location=Fairfax, Virginia|id=80083-Z|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode titled, "Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream", a spectral [[Sandman]] creates versions of anything which a person is dreaming of – in this way a new version of Stay Puft is created – however, whatever is created disappears when the person awakens. In the episode "Dedcon 1", Stay Puft appears as a guest of honor at a ghost convention. After another episode, "Cry Uncle", he is accidentally freed from the Ghostbusters' containment system and later recaptured. He reappears in episode 65, "The Revenge of Murray the Mantis", where he is "released" from the Ghostbusters' containment unit to help defeat a giant [[mantis]] too powerful for the Ghostbusters to fight on their own. Stay Puft is controlled with the help of [[Slimer]] (a green blob-like creature). After defeating the Mantis, Stay Puft floats behind the Ghostbusters in a parade. He later helps them again in the episode "Sticky Business" number 85, when the president of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Company asks the Ghostbusters if he can use their large Stay Puft in a television commercial. Once again Slimer goes into the containment unit to bring Stay Puft out. An episode{{which|date=August 2015}} explains that Egon took a sample of the marshmallow ectoplasm and positively charged it, thus creating a friendly version of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that would assist the Ghostbusters when needed. When questioned by a policeman in the series about the abrupt personality change, Peter replied that Stay Puft was "all better now". The character was voiced by [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]], and later by [[Frank Welker]] in this series.

Set two years after the events in the film ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' (1989), the [[Atari]] game ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' (2009) brings back the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man to ravage [[Times Square]] while searching for Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn. Stay-Puft has the ability to spawn tiny marshmallow monsters which do his bidding. Peter, Ray, and a new rookie escort Dr. Selwyn to the roof of a tall building. In pursuit, Stay Puft climbs the side of the building while Egon at street level preparing a large trap. The rookie burns Stay Puft's face with "Boson Darts" from an upgraded proton pack, causing Stay Puft to fall to street level, where he exploded upon impact, scattering his marshmallow body all over Times Square and his hat, which hangs from one of the neighboring buildings. Towards the game's climax, the characters realize that Gozer assumed the form of Stay Puft again because he can only have one destructor form for each dimension he enters; he was locked into the form of the Marshmallow Man when summoned back to the Earthly plane. This causes Ray to admit he didn't pick such a bad destructor after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghostbusters: The Video Game Official Guide Book |edition= [[Prima Games]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Personal Computer|PC]] version}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the realistic version, the player can listen to one of the in-game answering machine messages from an upset member of the fictional company that owns the Stay Puft Marshmallow brand (voiced by [[Chuck Huber]]), who is unhappy with the recent Gozer/Stay Puft attack believing it was a publicity stunt by the Ghostbusters. A Stay Puft Figurine appears as one of the collectible paranormal objects found in the game; it is found in the kitchen area of the Sedgewick Hotel and, after being collected, will appear in the Ghostbuster Firehouse's bunkhouse.

'''Terminal illness''' or '''end-stage disease''' is an incurable [[disease]] that cannot be adequately treated and is reasonably expected to result in the [[death]] of the patient. This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as [[cancer]] or advanced [[heart disease]] than for [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. In popular use, it indicates a disease that will  progress until death with near absolute certainty, regardless of treatment. A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a '''terminal patient''', '''terminally ill''' or simply '''terminal'''. There is no standardized [[life expectancy]] for a patient to be considered terminal, although it is generally months or less. [[Life expectancy]] for terminal patients is a rough estimate given by the physician based on previous data and does not always reflect true longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hui|first=David|last2=Nooruddin|first2=Zohra|last3=Didwaniya|first3=Neha|last4=Dev|first4=Rony|last5=De La Cruz|first5=Maxine|last6=Kim|first6=Sun Hyun|last7=Kwon|first7=Jung Hye|last8=Hutchins|first8=Ronald|last9=Liem|first9=Christiana|date=2014-01-01|title=Concepts and Definitions for "Actively Dying," "End of Life," "Terminally Ill," "Terminal Care," and "Transition of Care": A Systematic Review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392413002431|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|volume=47|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2013.02.021|pmc=3870193}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illness which is lifelong but not fatal is a [[chronic condition]].

Terminal patients have many options for disease management after diagnosis. Examples include [[Caregiver|caregiving]], continued treatment, [[Hospice|hospice care]], and [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]]. Decisions regarding management are made by the patient and his or her family, although medical professionals may give recommendations or more about the services available to terminal patients.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lima|first=Liliana De|last2=Pastrana|first2=Tania|date=2016|title=Opportunities for Palliative Care in Public Health|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032315-021448|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=37|issue=1|pages=357–374|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032315-021448|pmid=26989831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":64"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendry|first=Maggie|last2=Pasterfield|first2=Diana|last3=Lewis|first3=Ruth|last4=Carter|first4=Ben|last5=Hodgson|first5=Daniel|last6=Wilkinson|first6=Clare|date=2013-01-01|title=Why do we want the right to die?

Lifestyle after diagnosis largely varies depending on management decisions and also the nature of the disease, and there may be living restrictions depending on the condition of the patient. Oftentimes, terminal patients may experience depression or anxiety associated with oncoming death, and family and caregivers may struggle with psychological burdens as well. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help alleviate some of these burdens, and is often incorporated in palliative care.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":114"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Block|first=Susan D.|title=Psychological Issues in End-of-Life Care|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/jpm.2006.9.751|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|volume=9|issue=3|pages=751–772|doi=10.1089/jpm.2006.9.751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because terminal patients are aware of their oncoming deaths, they have more time to prepare advance care planning, such as [[Advance healthcare directive|advance directives]] and living wills, which have been shown to improve end-of-life care. While death cannot be avoided, patients can still strive to die a good death.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/aging/endliferia/endria.html|title=Advance Care Planning, Preferences for Care at the End of Life {{!}} AHRQ Archive|website=archive.ahrq.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":94"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qaseem|first=Amir|last2=Snow|first2=Vincenza|last3=Shekelle|first3=Paul|last4=Casey|first4=Donald E.|last5=Cross|first5=J.

== Management ==
{{main|End-of-life care}}
By definition, there is not a cure or adequate treatment for terminal illnesses.  However, some kinds of medical treatments may be appropriate anyway, such as treatment to reduce pain or ease breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq|title=Last Days of Life|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some terminally ill patients stop all debilitating treatments to reduce unwanted side effects.  Others continue aggressive treatment in the hope of an unexpected success. Still, others reject conventional medical treatment and pursue [[unproven cancer therapy|unproven treatments]] such as radical dietary modifications.  Patients' choices about different treatments may change over time.&lt;ref name="pmid17608872"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fried TR, O'Leary J, Van Ness P, Fraenkel L |title=Inconsistency over time in the preferences of older persons with advanced illness for life-sustaining treatment  |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=1007–14 |year=2007 |pmid=17608872 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01232.x |pmc=1948955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palliative care]] is normally offered to terminally ill patients, regardless of their overall disease management style, if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life. [[Hospice|Hospice care]], which can be provided at home or in a long-term care facility, additionally provides emotional and spiritual support for the patient and loved ones.  Some complementary approaches, such as [[relaxation therapy]], [[massage]], and [[acupuncture]] may relieve some symptoms and other causes of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;|year=1996|title=Integration of behavioral and relaxation approaches into the treatment of chronic pain and insomnia.

=== Caregiving ===
Terminal patients often need a [[caregiver]], who could be a&amp;nbsp;[[nurse]], licensed practical nurse or a family member. Caregivers can help patients receive medications to reduce pain and control symptoms of&amp;nbsp;[[nausea]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;[[vomiting]]. They can also assist the individual with daily living activities and movement. Caregivers provide assistance with food and&amp;nbsp;[[Psychology|psychological]]&amp;nbsp;support and ensure that the individual is comfortable.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitnick|first=Sheryl|last2=Leffler|first2=Cathy|last3=Hood|first3=Virginia L.|date=2010|title=Family Caregivers, Patients and Physicians: Ethical Guidance to Optimize Relationships/|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=25|issue=3|pages=255–260|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1206-3|issn=0884-8734|pmc=2839338|pmid=20063128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patient's family may have questions and most caregivers can provide information to help ease the mind. Doctors generally do not provide estimates for fear of instilling false hopes or obliterate an individual's hope.&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas Cancer therapy and research center. [http://www.ctrc.net/ctrc_2_2.cfm?db_content=psycopingterminal "Terminal Cancer Overview"] 2010-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the caregiver works along with physicians and follows professional instructions. Caregivers may call the physician or a nurse if the individual:
* experiences excessive pain.
* is in distress or having difficulty [[breathing]].
* has difficulty passing urine or is [[constipation|constipated]].
* has fallen and appears hurt.
* is depressed and wants to harm themselves.
* refuses to take prescribed medications, raising [[Medical ethics|ethical]] concerns best addressed by a person with more extensive formal training.
* or if the caregiver does not know how to handle the situation.

Most caregivers become the patient's listeners and let the individual express fears and concerns without judgment. Caregivers reassure the patient and honor all advance directives. Caregivers respect the individual's need for privacy and usually hold all information confidential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/hub_cancer/phyneeds.cfm Physical Needs of the Person With Terminal Cancer] University of Virginia. Retrieved on 2010-02-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":174"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitnick|first=Sheryl|last2=Leffler|first2=Cathy|last3=Hood|first3=Virginia L.|date=2010|title=Family Caregivers, Patients and Physicians: Ethical Guidance to Optimize Relationships|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=25|issue=3|pages=255–260|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1206-3|issn=0884-8734|pmc=2839338|pmid=20063128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palliative care ===
Palliative care focuses on addressing patients' needs after disease diagnosis. While palliative care is not disease treatment, it addresses patients' physical needs, such as pain management, offers emotional support, caring for the patient psychologically and spiritually, and helps patients build support systems that can help them get through difficult times. Palliative care can also help patients make decisions and come to understand what they want regarding their treatment goals and quality of life.&lt;ref name=":183"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=Mary K.|last2=Rock|first2=Laura K.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ellen P.|date=2017-02-01|title=Understanding Palliative Care and Hospice: A&amp;nbsp;Review for Primary Care Providers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619616307637|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|volume=92|issue=2|pages=280–286|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2016.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palliative care has been proven to improve patients' [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality-of-life]] and satisfaction and also help family members cope with their loved one's disease. Additionally, it lowers hospital admissions costs. However, needs for palliative care are often unmet whether due to lack of government support and also possible [[Palliative care#Acceptance|stigma]] associated with palliative care. For these reasons, the World Health Assembly recommends development of palliative care in health care systems.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

[[Palliative care]] and [[hospice]] care are often confused, and they have similar goals. However, hospice care is specifically for terminal patients while palliative care is more general and offered to patients who are not necessarily terminal.&lt;ref name=":162"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Samantha|last2=Brick|first2=Aoife|last3=O’Hara|first3=Sinéad|last4=Normand|first4=Charles|date=2014-02-01|title=Evidence on the cost and cost-effectiveness of palliative care: A literature review|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216313493466|journal=Palliative Medicine|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=130–150|doi=10.1177/0269216313493466|issn=0269-2163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":183"/&gt;

=== Hospice care ===
While hospitals focus on treating the disease, [[hospice]]s focus on improving patient [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality-of-life]] until death. A common misconception is that hospice care hastens death because patients "give up" fighting the disease. However, patients in hospice care often live the same length of time as patients in the hospital. A study of 3850 liver cancer patients found that patients who received hospice care, and those who did not, survived for the same amount of time. In fact, a study of 3399 adult lung cancer patients showed that patients who received hospice care actually survived longer than those who did not. Additionally, in both of these studies, patients receiving hospice care had significantly lower healthcare expenditures.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiang|first=Jui-Kun|last2=Kao|first2=Yee-Hsin|date=April 2015|title=The impact of hospice care on survival and cost saving among patients with liver cancer: a national longitudinal population-based study in Taiwan|journal=Supportive Care in Cancer: Official Journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1049–1055|doi=10.1007/s00520-014-2447-1|issn=1433-7339|pmid=25281229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiang|first=Jui-Kun|last2=Kao|first2=Yee-Hsin|last3=Lai|first3=Ning-Sheng|date=2015-09-25|title=The Impact of Hospice Care on Survival and Healthcare Costs for Patients with Lung Cancer: A National Longitudinal Population-Based Study in Taiwan|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138773|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|pages=e0138773|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138773|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospice care allows patients to spend more time with family and friends. Since patients are in the company of other hospice patients, they have an additional support network and can learn to cope together. Hospice patients are also able to live at peace away from a hospital setting; they may live at home with a hospice provider or at an inpatient hospice facility.&lt;ref name=":183"/&gt;

=== Medications for terminal patients ===
Terminal patients experiencing pain, especially cancer-related pain, are often prescribed opioids to relieve suffering. The specific medication prescribed, however, will differ depending on severity of pain and disease status.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caraceni|first=Augusto|last2=Hanks|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Kaasa|first3=Stein|last4=Bennett|first4=Michael I|last5=Brunelli|first5=Cinzia|last6=Cherny|first6=Nathan|last7=Dale|first7=Ola|last8=De Conno|first8=Franco|last9=Fallon|first9=Marie|date=2012-02-01|title=Use of opioid analgesics in the treatment of cancer pain: evidence-based recommendations from the EAPC|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204512700402|journal=The Lancet Oncology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=e58–e68|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist inequities in availability of opioids to terminal patients, especially in countries where opioid access is limited.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

A common symptom that many terminal patients experience is [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]], or difficulty with breathing. To ease this symptom, doctors may also prescribe opioids to patients. Some studies suggest that oral opioids may help with breathlessness. However, due to lack of consistent reliable evidence, it is currently unclear whether they truly work for this purpose.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011008.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Barnes|first=Hayley|last2=McDonald|first2=Julie|last3=Smallwood|first3=Natasha|last4=Manser|first4=Renée|date=2016-03-31|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011008.pub2/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the patient's condition, other medications will be prescribed accordingly. For example, if patients develop depression, antidepressants will be prescribed. Anti-inflammation and anti-nausea medications may also be prescribed.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caresearch.com.au/caresearch/ProfessionalGroups/NursesHubHome/Clinical/MedicationManagement/PalliativeMedications/tabid/1554/Default.aspx|title=Palliative Medications|website=www.caresearch.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued treatment ===
Some terminal patients opt to continue extensive treatments in hope of a miracle cure, whether by participating in experimental treatments and [[clinical trial]]s or seeking more intense treatment for the disease. Rather than to "give up fighting," patients spend thousands more dollars to try to prolong life by a few more months. What these patients often do give up, however, is quality of life at the end of life by undergoing intense and often uncomfortable treatment. A meta-analysis of 34 studies including 11,326 patients from 11 countries found that less than half of all terminal patients correctly understood their disease [[prognosis]], or the course of their disease and likeliness of survival. This could influence patients to pursue unnecessary treatment for the disease due to unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref name=":183"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":192"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Chen Hsiu|last2=Kuo|first2=Su Ching|last3=Tang|first3=Siew Tzuh|date=2017-05-01|title=Current status of accurate prognostic awareness in advanced/terminally ill cancer patients: Systematic review and meta-regression analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216316663976|journal=Palliative Medicine|volume=31|issue=5|pages=406–418|doi=10.1177/0269216316663976|issn=0269-2163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physician-assisted suicide ===
[[Assisted suicide|Physician-assisted suicide]] (PAS) is a highly controversial concept, only legal in a few countries. In PAS, physicians, with voluntary written and verbal consent from the patient, give patients the means to die, usually through lethal drugs. The patient then chooses to "die with dignity," deciding on his/her own time and place to die. Reasons as to why patients choose PAS differ. Factors that may play into a patient's decision include future disability and suffering, lack of control over death, impact on family, healthcare costs, insurance coverage, personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and much more.&lt;ref name=":64"/&gt;

PAS may be referred to in many different ways, such as aid in dying, assisted dying, death with dignity, and many more. These often depend on the organization and the stance they take on the issue. In this section of the article, it will be referred to as PAS for the sake of consistency with the pre-existing Wikipedia page: [[Assisted suicide|Assisted Suicide]].

In the United States, PAS or [[Medical aid in dying in the United States|medical aid in dying]] is legal in select states, including Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and New Mexico, and there are groups both in favor of and against legalization.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.compassionandchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FS-Medical-Aid-in-Dying-is-Not-Assisted-Suicide-FINAL-1.27.16-Approved-for-Public-Distribution.pdf|title=Medical Aid in Dying Is Not Assisted Suicide|last=Compassion and Choices|first=|date=|website=Compassion and Choices|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups favor PAS because they do not believe they will have control over their pain, because they believe they will be a burden on their family, and because they do not want to lose autonomy and control over their own lives among other reasons. They believe that allowing PAS is an act of compassion.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulmasy|first=Lois Snyder|last2=Mueller|first2=Paul S.|date=2017-10-17|title=Ethics and the Legalization of Physician-Assisted Suicide: An American College of Physicians Position Paper|url=http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2654458/ethics-legalization-physician-assisted-suicide-american-college-physicians-position-paper|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=167|issue=8|doi=10.7326/M17-0938|issn=0003-4819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some groups believe in personal choice over death, others raise concerns regarding insurance policies and potential for abuse. According to Sulmasy et al., the major non-religious arguments against physician-assisted suicide are quoted as follows:
* (1) “it offends me,” suicide devalues human life;
* (2) slippery slope, the limits on euthanasia gradually erode;
* (3) “pain can be alleviated,” palliative care and modern therapeutics more and more adequately manage pain;
* (4) physician integrity and patient trust, participating in suicide violates the integrity of the physician and undermines the trust patients place in physicians to heal and not to harm"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulmasy|first=Daniel P.|last2=Travaline|first2=John M.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Louise A.|last4=Ely|first4=E. Wesley|date=2016|title=Non-faith-based arguments against physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia|journal=The Linacre Quarterly|volume=83|issue=3|pages=246–257|doi=10.1080/00243639.2016.1201375|issn=0024-3639|pmc=5102187|pmid=27833206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Again, there are also arguments that there are enough protections in the law that the slippery slope is avoided. For example, the [[Oregon Ballot Measure 16 (1994)|Death with Dignity Act in Oregon]] includes waiting periods, multiple requests for lethal drugs, a psychiatric evaluation in the case of possible depression influencing decisions, and the patient personally swallowing the pills to ensure voluntary decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PROVIDERPARTNERRESOURCES/EVALUATIONRESEARCH/DEATHWITHDIGNITYACT/Pages/ors.aspx|title=Oregon Health Authority : Oregon Revised Statute : Death with Dignity Act : State of Oregon|website=www.oregon.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians and medical professionals also have disagreeing views on PAS. Some groups, such as the [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP), the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), the [[World Health Organization]], [[American Nurses Association]], Hospice Nurses Association, [[American Psychiatric Association]], and more have issued position statements against its legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/physician-assisted-suicide|title=Physician-Assisted Suicide {{!}} American Medical Association|website=www.ama-assn.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/always-care-never-kill-how-physician-assisted-suicide-endangers-the-weak|title=Always Care, Never Kill: How Physician-Assisted Suicide Endangers the Weak, Corrupts Medicine, Compromises the Family, and Violates Human Dignity and Equality|last=Anderson|first=Ryan|website=The Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACP's argument concerns the nature of the doctor-patient relationship and the tenets of the medical profession. They state that instead of using PAS to control death: "through high-quality care, effective communication, compassionate support, and the right resources, physicians can help patients control many aspects of how they live out life's last chapter."&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

Other groups such as the [[American Medical Student Association|American Medical Students Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Medical Women's Association]], and more support PAS as an act of compassion for the suffering patient.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

In many cases, the argument on PAS is also tied to proper palliative care. The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care issued a position statement arguing against considering legalizing PAS unless comprehensive palliative care systems in the country were in place. It could be argued that with proper palliative care, the patient would experience fewer intolerable symptoms, physical or emotional, and would not choose death over these symptoms. Palliative care would also ensure that patients receive proper information about their disease prognosis as not to make decisions about PAS without complete and careful consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Lima|first=Liliana|last2=Woodruff|first2=Roger|last3=Pettus|first3=Katherine|last4=Downing|first4=Julia|last5=Buitrago|first5=Rosa|last6=Munyoro|first6=Esther|last7=Venkateswaran|first7=Chitra|last8=Bhatnagar|first8=Sushma|last9=Radbruch|first9=Lukas|title=International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care Position Statement: Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/jpm.2016.0290|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|volume=20|issue=1|pages=8–14|doi=10.1089/jpm.2016.0290|pmc=5177996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical care ==
Many aspects of medical care are different for terminal patients compared to patients in the hospital for other reasons.

=== Doctor-patient relationships ===
[[Doctor–patient relationship|Doctor-patient relationships]] are crucial in any medical setting, and especially so for terminal patients. There must be an inherent trust in the doctor to provide the best possible care for the patient. In the case of terminal illness, there is often ambiguity in communication with the patient about his/her condition. While terminal condition prognosis is often a grave matter, doctors do not wish to quash all hope, for it could unnecessarily harm the patient's mental state and have [[unintended consequences]]. However, being overly optimistic about outcomes can leave patients and families devastated when negative results arise, as is often the case with terminal illness.&lt;ref name=":192"/&gt;

=== Mortality predictions ===
Often, a patient is considered terminally ill when his or her estimated life expectancy is six months or less, under the assumption that the disease will run its normal course based on previous data from other patients. The six-month standard is arbitrary, and best available estimates of longevity may be incorrect. Though a given patient may properly be considered terminal, this is not a guarantee that the patient will die within six months.  Similarly, a patient with a slowly progressing disease, such as [[AIDS]], may not be considered terminally ill if the best estimate of longevity is greater than six months. However, this does not guarantee that the patient will not die unexpectedly early.&lt;ref name="titleTerminal Illness2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/terminal.asp|title=Terminal Illness|work=|format=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013074453/http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/terminal.asp|archivedate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, physicians slightly overestimate the survival time of terminally ill cancer patients, so that, for example, a person who is expected to live for about six weeks would likely die around four weeks.&lt;ref name="pmid128812602"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Glare P|author2=Virik K|author3=Jones M|last4=Hudson|first4=M|last5=Eychmuller|first5=S|last6=Simes|first6=J|last7=Christakis|first7=N|display-authors=3|year=2003|title=A systematic review of physicians' survival predictions in terminally ill cancer patients|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12881260|journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=327|issue=7408|pages=195–8|doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7408.195|pmc=166124|pmid=12881260|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent systematic review on palliative patients in general, rather than specifically cancer patients, states the following: "Accuracy of categorical estimates in this systematic review ranged from 23% up to 78% and continuous estimates over-predicted actual survival by, potentially, a factor of two." There was no evidence that any specific type of clinician was better at making these predictions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Nicola|last2=Reid|first2=Fiona|last3=Harris|first3=Adam|last4=Harries|first4=Priscilla|last5=Stone|first5=Patrick|date=2016-08-25|title=A Systematic Review of Predictions of Survival in Palliative Care: How Accurate Are Clinicians and Who Are the Experts?|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161407|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e0161407|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0161407|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare spending ===
Healthcare during the last year of life is costly, especially for patients who used hospital services often during end-of-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Gerald F|last2=Lubitz|first2=James D|date=2010|title=Long-Term Trends in Medicare Payments in the Last Year of Life|journal=Health Services Research|volume=45|issue=2|pages=565–576|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01082.x|issn=0017-9124|pmc=2838161|pmid=20148984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, according to Langton et al., there were "exponential increases in service use and costs as death approached."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langton|first=Julia M|last2=Blanch|first2=Bianca|last3=Drew|first3=Anna K|last4=Haas|first4=Marion|last5=Ingham|first5=Jane M|last6=Pearson|first6=Sallie-Anne|title=Retrospective studies of end-of-life resource utilization and costs in cancer care using health administrative data: A systematic review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216314533813|journal=Palliative Medicine|language=en|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1167–1196|doi=10.1177/0269216314533813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many dying terminal patients are also brought to the [[emergency department]] (ED) at the end of life when treatment is no longer beneficial, raising costs and using limited space in the ED.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forero|first=Roberto|last2=McDonnell|first2=Geoff|last3=Gallego|first3=Blanca|last4=McCarthy|first4=Sally|last5=Mohsin|first5=Mohammed|last6=Shanley|first6=Chris|last7=Formby|first7=Frank|last8=Hillman|first8=Ken|date=2012|title=A Literature Review on Care at the End-of-Life in the Emergency Department|journal=Emergency Medicine International|volume=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/486516|issn=2090-2840|pmc=3303563|pmid=22500239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are often claims about "disproportionate" spending of money and resources on end-of-life patients, data have not proven this type of correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scitovsky|first=Anne A|date=2005|title="The High Cost of Dying": What Do the Data Show?|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=83|issue=4|pages=825–841|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2005.00402.x|issn=0887-378X|pmc=2690284|pmid=16279969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of healthcare for end-of-life patients is 13% of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. However, of the group of patients with the highest healthcare spending, end-of-life patients only made up 11% of these people, meaning the most expensive spending is not made up mostly of terminal patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aldridge|first=Melissa D.|last2=Kelley|first2=Amy S.|date=2015|title=The Myth Regarding the High Cost of End-of-Life Care|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=105|issue=12|pages=2411–2415|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302889|issn=0090-0036|pmc=4638261|pmid=26469646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent studies have shown that [[palliative care]] and [[hospice]] options as an alternative are much less expensive for end-of-life patients.&lt;ref name=":103"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":113"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":162"/&gt;

== Psychological impact ==
Coping with impending death is a hard topic to digest universally. Patients may experience [[grief]], [[fear]], [[loneliness]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[anxiety]] among many other possible responses. Terminal illness can also lend patients to become more prone to psychological illness such as [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s. [[Insomnia]] is a common symptom of these.&lt;ref name=":114"/&gt;

It is important for loved ones to show their support for the patient during these times and to listen to his or her concerns.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/end-of-life/in-depth/grief/art-20047491?pg=1|title=Supporting a terminally ill loved one|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are terminally ill may not always come to accept their impending death. For example, a person who finds strength in&amp;nbsp;[[denial]]&amp;nbsp;may never reach a point of acceptance or accommodation and may react negatively to any statement that threatens this&amp;nbsp;[[defense mechanism]].&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Impact on patient ===
[[Depression (differential diagnoses)|Depression]] is relatively common among terminal patients, and the prevalence increases as patients become sicker. Depression causes quality of life to go down, and a sizable portion of patients who request [[assisted suicide]] are depressed. These negative emotions may be heightened by lack of sleep and pain as well. Depression can be treated with [[antidepressant]]s and/or therapy, but doctors often do not realize the extent of terminal patients' depression.&lt;ref name=":114"/&gt;

Because depression is common among terminal patients, the American College of Physicians recommends regular assessments for depression for this population and appropriate prescription of antidepressants.&lt;ref name=":94"/&gt;

[[Anxiety disorder]]s are also relatively common for terminal patients as they face their mortality. Patients may feel distressed when thinking about what the future may hold, especially when considering the future of their families as well. It is important to note, however, that some palliative medications may facilitate anxiety.&lt;ref name=":114"/&gt;

=== Coping for patients ===
Caregivers may listen to the concerns of terminal patients to help them reflect on their emotions. Different forms of [[psychotherapy]] and psychosocial intervention, which can be offered with palliative care, may also help patients think about and overcome their feelings. According to Block, "most terminally ill patients benefit from an approach that combines emotional support, flexibility, appreciation of the patient’s strengths, a warm and genuine relationship with the therapist, elements of life-review, and exploration of fears and concerns."&lt;ref name=":114"/&gt;

=== Impact on family ===
Terminal patients' families often also suffer psychological consequences. If not well equipped to face the reality of their loved one's illness, family members may develop depressive symptoms and even have increased mortality. Taking care of sick family members may also cause stress, grief, and worry. Additionally, financial burden from medical treatment may be a source of stress.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

=== Coping for family ===
Discussing the anticipated loss and planning for the future may help family members accept and prepare for the patient's death. [[Intervention (counseling)|Interventions]] may also be offered for [[anticipatory grief]]. In the case of more serious consequences such as [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]], a more serious [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] or [[therapy]] is recommended.&lt;ref name=":174"/&gt;

Grief counseling and grief therapy may also be recommended for family members after a loved one's death.&lt;ref name=":223"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-pdq#section/all|title=Last Days of Life|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dying ==
When dying, patients often worry about their quality of life towards the end, including emotional and physical suffering.&lt;ref name=":64"/&gt;

In order for families and doctors to understand clearly what the patient wants for himself or herself, it is recommended that patients, doctors, and families all convene and discuss the patient's decisions before the patient becomes unable to decide.&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":94"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brinkman-Stoppelenburg|first=Arianne|last2=Rietjens|first2=Judith AC|last3=van der Heide|first3=Agnes|date=2014-09-01|title=The effects of advance care planning on end-of-life care: A systematic review|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216314526272|journal=Palliative Medicine|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1000–1025|doi=10.1177/0269216314526272|issn=0269-2163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advance directives ===
At the end of life, especially when patients are unable to make decisions on their own regarding treatment, it is often up to family members and doctors to decide what they believe the patients would have wanted regarding their deaths, which is a heavy burden and hard for family members to predict. An estimated 25% of American adults have an advanced directive, meaning the majority of Americans leave these decisions to be made by family, which can lead to conflict and guilt. Although it may be a difficult subject to broach, it is important to discuss the patient's plans for how far to continue treatment should they become unable to decide. This must be done while the patient is still able to make the decisions, and takes the form of an [[Advance healthcare directive|advance directive]]. The advance directive should be updated regularly as the patient's condition changes so as to reflect the patient's wishes.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/finding-and-paying-for-treatment/understanding-financial-and-legal-matters/advance-directives/faqs.html|title=Frequently asked questions|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":174"/&gt;

Some of the decisions that advance directives may address include receiving fluids and nutrition support, getting blood transfusions, receiving antibiotics, resuscitation (if the heart stops beating), and intubation (if the patient stops breathing).&lt;ref name=":223"/&gt;

Having an advance directive can improve end-of-life care.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

It is highly recommended by many research studies and meta-analyses for patients to discuss and create an advance directive with their doctors and families.&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":94"/&gt;

=== Do-not-resuscitate ===
One of the options of care that patients may discuss with their families and medical providers is the [[Do not resuscitate|do-not-resuscitate]] (DNR) order. This means that if the patient's heart stops, CPR and other methods to bring back heartbeat would not be performed. This is the patient's choice to make and can depend on a variety of reasons, whether based on personal beliefs or medical concerns. DNR orders are medically and legally binding.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osinski|first=Aart|last2=Vreugdenhil|first2=Gerard|last3=Koning|first3=Jan de|last4=Hoeven|first4=Johannes G. van der|date=2017-02-01|title=Do-not-resuscitate orders in cancer patients: a review of literature|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-016-3459-9|journal=Supportive Care in Cancer|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=677–685|doi=10.1007/s00520-016-3459-9|issn=0941-4355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions like these should be indicated in the advance directive so that the patient's wishes can be carried out to improve end-of-life care.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

=== Symptoms near death ===
A variety of symptoms become more apparent when a patient is nearing death. Recognizing these symptoms and knowing what will come may help family members prepare.&lt;ref name=":223"/&gt;

During the final few weeks, symptoms will vary largely depending on the patient's disease. During the final hours, patients usually will reject food and water and will also sleep more, choosing not to interact with those around them. Their bodies may behave more irregularly, with changes in breathing, sometimes with longer pauses between breaths, irregular heart rate, low blood pressure, and coldness in the extremities. It is important to note, however, that symptoms will vary per patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospicepatients.org/hospic60.html|title=Hospice Patients Alliance: Signs of Approaching Death|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospicepatients.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Good death ===
Patients, healthcare workers, and recently bereaved family members often describe a "good death" in terms of effective choices made in a few areas:&lt;ref name="pmid10819707"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Steinhauser K, Clipp E, McNeilly M, Christakis N, McIntyre L, Tulsky J |title=In search of a good death: observations of patients, families, and providers |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=132 |issue=10 |pages=825–32 |date=16 May 2000|pmid=10819707 | url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/132/10/825 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-10-200005160-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Assurance of effective pain and symptom management.
* Education about death and its aftermath, especially as it relates to decision-making.
* Completion of any significant goals, such as resolving past conflicts.&lt;ref name=":152"/&gt;

In the last hours of life, [[palliative sedation]] may be recommended by a doctor or requested by the patient to ease the symptoms of death until he or she passes away. Palliative sedation is not intended to prolong life or hasten death; it is merely meant to relieve symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claessens|first=Patricia|last2=Menten|first2=Johan|last3=Schotsmans|first3=Paul|last4=Broeckaert|first4=Bert|date=2008-09-01|title=Palliative Sedation: A Review of the Research Literature|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392408001000|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|volume=36|issue=3|pages=310–333|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">In [[information system]] and [[information technology]], '''trust management''' is an abstract system that processes symbolic representations of social [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], usually to aid automated decision-making process. Such representations, e.g. in a form of cryptographic credentials, can link the abstract system of trust management with results of trust assessment. Trust management is popular in implementing [[information security]], specifically [[access control]] policies.

The concept of trust management has been introduced by [[Matt Blaze]]&lt;ref&gt;Blaze, M. et al. (2003) "Experience with the KeyNote Trust Management System: Applications and Future Directions." ''Proc. of First Int. Conf. on Trust Management iTrust 2003.'' Springer-Verlag LNCS 2692, pp. 284-300.&lt;/ref&gt; to aid the automated verification of actions against security policies. In this concept, actions are allowed if they demonstrate sufficient credentials, irrespective of their actual identity, separating symbolic representation of trust from the actual person.

Trust management can be best illustrated through the everyday experience of tickets. One can buy a ticket that entitles him e.g. to enter the stadium. The ticket acts as a symbol of trust, stating that the bearer of the ticket has paid for his seat and is entitled to enter. However, once bought, the ticket can be transferred to someone else, thus transferring such trust in a symbolic way. At the gate, only the ticket will be checked, not the identity of a bearer.

==Overview==
Trust management can be seen as a symbol-based automation of social decisions related to trust,&lt;ref&gt;Cofta, P. (2007) ''Trust, Complexity and Control. Confidence in a Convergent World.'' J Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; where social agents instruct their technical representations how to act while meeting technical representations of other agents. Further automation of this process can lead to automated trust negotiations (e.g. see Winslett&lt;ref&gt;[[Marianne Winslett|Winslett, M.]] (2003) An Introduction to Trust Negotiations. In: P. Nixon and S. Terzis (eds.): ''Trust Management 2003'', LNCS 2692, pp. 275-283.&lt;/ref&gt;) where technical devices negotiate trust by selectively disclosing credential, according to rules defined by social agents that they represent. The definition and perspective on trust management was expanded in 2000 to include concepts of honesty, truthfulness, competence and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrone Grandison, Morris Sloman. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.17.1128&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf A Survey of Trust in Internet Applications].  IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, Fourth Quarter 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Trust levels, the nature of the trust relationship and the context were presented in the paper by Grandison and Sloman.

Web Services Trust Language (WS-Trust)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S. et al. (2005) [http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/trust/WS-Trust.pdf  Web Services Trust Language (WS-Trust)].&lt;/ref&gt; brings trust management into the environment of web services. The core proposition remain generally unchanged: the Web Service (verifier) is accepting a request only if the request contains proofs of claims (credentials) that satisfy the policy of a Web Service.

It is also possible to let technical agents monitor each other's behaviour and respond accordingly by increasing or decreasing trust. Such systems are collectively called Trust-Based Access Control (TBAC)&lt;ref&gt;Dimmock, N., Bacon, J., Ingram, D., and Moody. K. (2005) Risk Models for Trust-Based Access Control (TBAC). In: P. Herrmann (ed): ''iTrust2005'', LNCS 3477, pp. 364-371&lt;/ref&gt; and their applicability have been studied for several different application areas.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. J., and Davis IV, N. J. (2005) "Towards a Decentralized Trust-Based Access Control System for Dynamic Collaboration." ''Proc. of the 2005 IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance and Security.''&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view on trust management&lt;ref&gt;Josang, A., Keser, C., and Dimitrakos, T. (2005) "Can We Manage Trust?" In: P. Herrmann et al. (Eds.): ''iTrust 2005'', LNCS 3477, pp. 93-107.&lt;/ref&gt; questions the possibility to technically manage trust, and focuses on supporting the proper assessment of the extent of trust one person has in the other.

Trust management is also studied in specific IT-related field such as transportation.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ma, O. Wolfson, J. Lin. (2011) '' [http://www.cs.uic.edu/~sma/Papers/trust.pdf A Survey on Trust Management for Intelligent Transportation System.] ''Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on [[computational transportation science]], IWCTS '11.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Trust management is an important topic in online social network these days.&lt;ref&gt;W. Villegas, B. Ali, and M. Maheswaran "An Access Control Scheme for Protecting Personal Data." ''Sixth Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST 2008), October 2008, pp. 24-35, New Brunswick, Canada.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7285">'''Virgil H. "Bert" Effinger''' (1873 – 15 December 1955) was a renegade member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] who became the self-proclaimed leader of the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]] in the [[United States]], active mostly in Ohio and Michigan. The secret, white [[vigilante]] group was made up of native-born Protestant men, many from the South, who were threatened by immigration and contemporary industrial society during the struggles of the [[Great Depression]]. One-third of the members in Michigan lived in [[Detroit]]. Effinger advocated a [[fascism|fascist]] revolution in the US with himself as dictator.

The Black Legion was rumored in the mid-1930s in the Detroit area to be responsible for numerous murders and attacks on persons and property. It was exposed by prosecution in [[Wayne County, Michigan]] for the 1936 kidnapping and murder of Charles Poole, a French-Canadian Catholic organizer for the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] organizer. Eleven members were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In related prosecutions after additional investigation, another 37 men of the Black Legion were convicted of other crimes, and all received prison sentences. Group membership withered under the spotlight and scandals. In 1938 Effinger tried to found a new group but was unsuccessful. He died nearly two decades later in a [[psychiatric hospital]], having always denied membership in the Legion.

Born in [[Newark, Ohio]], Effinger served with the [[United States Army]] during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Philip Rees |first=Philip |last=Rees |title=[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]] |year=1990 |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=110 |isbn=0-13-089301-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in [[Lima, Ohio]] after his military service, Effinger worked as a salesman in the town.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael E. |last=Birdwell |title=Celluloid Soldiers: The Warner Bros.'s Campaign Against Nazism |location=New York |publisher=New York University Press |year=2001 |page=45 |isbn=0-8147-9871-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong [[racist]], [[anti-Semite]] and [[anti-Catholic]], he joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and attained the rank of Grand Titan within the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen Harlan |last=Norwood |title=Strikebreaking and Intimidation: Mercenaries and Masculinity in Twentieth-Century America |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2002 |page=196 |isbn=0-8078-2705-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After national scandals in 1925 and growing local political opposition in many areas, the KKK declined in influence in the Midwest and nationally. By that time in eastern Ohio, a [[paramilitary]] group known as the Black Guards (later the Black Legion) had been formed to provide security for KKK officers.

==Black Legion==
{{main|Black Legion (political movement)}}
Effinger took control in 1931 of the Black Legion; he believed it could be the basis for a network of revolutionary cells.&lt;ref name="Bird"/&gt; He supported expansion by a military structure of brigades, battalions, etc. and soon advocated a [[revolution]], intending for the Legion to seize power in [[Washington D.C.]] and install him as dictator.&lt;ref name="Bird"/&gt; Effinger described his movement as "a [[guerrilla]] army designed to fight the [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (USA)|Democratic]] parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francis |last=MacDonnell |title=Insidious Foes: The Axis Fifth Column and the American Home Front |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |page=46 |isbn=0-19-509268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rewrote history, claiming that the Legion dated to the revolutionary-era [[Boston Tea Party]], rather than the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Bird"/&gt;

Under Effinger's vision, the Legion expanded in Ohio and Michigan during the early 1930s of the [[Great Depression]], where a chapter was first founded by Arthur Lupp in [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] in 1931. Its membership was similar to those previously attracted to the KKK: white Protestant native-born men, many from the South, who were threatened by immigration and other changes in society; many lacked skills for the industrial jobs of major cities. While Effinger claimed leadership, the chapters were highly independent.

The Black Legion members had a long list of enemies: immigrants, Catholics, Jews, blacks, labor organizers, communists, and socialists. The Black Legion was linked in Michigan especially to a handful of racist and political murders as well as attempts to appeal to a wider base of the community by [[arson]] and bomb attacks on [[communism|communist]] bookshops and labor organizers.&lt;ref&gt;Birdwell, ''Celluloid Soldiers'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Legion expanded even more in Michigan than Ohio, reaching an estimated membership of 20,000 to 30,000 in the mid-1930s, with one third based in Detroit. They were later found to have been particularly influential in [[Highland Park, Michigan]], with a mayor, chief of police, and city councilman as members, among many others. Their network helped members get jobs and exert political influence.

In May 1936 Charles Poole, a Catholic [[Works Progress Administration]] organizer, was shot and killed in southwest [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] by Legion member Major Dayton Dean after being kidnapped by him and a gang of followers. While crimes against non-whites or communists were often ignored by small-town police at the time, offenses for religious affiliation tended to be taken more seriously.&lt;ref name="Well"/&gt; Poole's killers were vigorously pursued by Detroit city police and the Wayne County Prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name="Well"&gt;Birdwell, ''Celluloid Soldiers'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean pleaded guilty and testified against other members of his gang and the Legion; he and ten others were sentenced to life in prison. Investigations resulting from his testimony and public outrage about the group led to convictions of another 37 men for crimes ranging from attempted murder to other murders; they all received prison sentences. With so many leaders jailed, the Black Legion collapsed.

==Later years==
In 1938 he attempted to organize a successor movement, the Patriotic Legion of America, this time admitting Catholics.&lt;ref name="Well" /&gt; This organization was to be located in San Antonio, Texas.  The Patriotic Legion of America was brought to the attention of the FBI after a printer in San Antonio forwarded a charter document to the Bureau.  The new group failed, and Effinger disappeared into obscurity.&lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt; He died in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 1955, having always denied any involvement in the Black Legion. &lt;ref name="Rees" /&gt; He had no criminal record.

'''William Brown''' was an [[English people|English]] [[association football|footballer]] who played in [[the Football League]] for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=Michael|title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939|year=2004|publisher=SoccerData|isbn=1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brown was a reserve outside-left at Everton during the inaugural Football League season. He was signed between 1887 and 1888 from Stanley (Liverpool) Football Club. He played six times mainly at outside-left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=Who's Who of Everton|year=2004|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=1 84018 819 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==League &amp; Everton Debut==
Outside-left was one of three problem forward positions for Everton and probably explains why Everton struggled to score goals in the 1888-1889 season.
[[James Costley]] was injured after a 6-2 home win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. On 3 November 1888 [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] were the visitors to Anfield and this match gave William Brown a chance for his League and Everton debut. He played outside-left. Very little happened in the first half and the scores were level, 0-0 at half-time. Early in the second-half Brown crowned his debut with a debut League goal putting a shot past Bolton goalkeeper, [[Sam Gillam]]. Bolton played well after Brown scored and quickly equalised. Brown formed a good partnership with Everton inside-left, [[Edgar Chadwick]] but it was [[Nick Ross (footballer, born 1862)|Nick Ross]] who scored the winner with a powerful shot. Everton pressed for a third but it was Bolton who came closest to scoring. Everton hung on to the lead in a close fought match. Final score - Everton 2-1 Bolton Wanderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Mark|title=The Origins of the Football League|year=2013|publisher=Amberley|isbn=978 1 4456 1881 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing Record==
Brown's debut saw him play three successive matches at left-wing for Everton but he was left out/injured after a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor, Burnley. Brown returned to the team on 22 December 1888 for the trip to Deepdale, Preston but he now played centre-forward (another of Everton' problem positions) in place of [[R Morris (footballer)|R Morris]]. He played two games at centre-forward but was replaced by [[John Angus (early footballer)|Jack Angus]]. His final appearance was for the visit of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 9 February 1889. He replaced Jack Angus at outside-left. Everton lost 2-1. Everton finished eighth in the League Scoring 35 goals, the second lowest tally by a League team in that first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= English National Football Archive| first=| last=| url=http://www.enfa.co.uk//| accessdate=2018-02-05}} (registration &amp; fee required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Football==
Brown was not retained for the 1889-1890 season and disappears from the records.
