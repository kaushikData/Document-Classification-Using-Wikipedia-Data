      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11921">{{Indigenous rights}}
'''Ancestral domain''' or '''ancestral lands''' refers to the [[Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples|lands, territories and resources of indigenous peoples]], particularly in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The term differs from [[indigenous land rights]], [[Aboriginal title]] or [[Native title in Australia|Native Title]] by directly indicating relationship to land based on [[ancestry]], while [[wiktionary:Domain|domain]] indicates relationships beyond material lands and territories, including [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[cultural]] aspects that may not be acknowledged in [[land titles]] and [[legal doctrine]] about [[trade|trading]] [[ownership]].

== Concept ==

Indigenous peoples may prefer to be described as custodians or guardians of their ancestral domain or lands rather than as title owners or [[land owner]]s.

The concept of [[individual]] [[Property rights (economics)|property ownership]] and [[land tenure]] that can be traded was often introduced as part of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State of the World's Indigenous Peoples Chapter 2 Culture |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_chapter2.pdf|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Melbourne Aboriginal Cultural Protocols Guidelines|url=http://www.murrupbarak.unimelb.edu.au/files/miip/Cultural_Protocols_University_Council%20(Final).pdf|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Briefing Guardians|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/guardians|publisher=Survival International |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Western model of land ownership gives an individual the property right to control land as a [[commodity]], indigenous conceptions have a cultural and spiritual character. They invoke a mutual responsibility and relationship between land and people.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Indigenous Rights in International Politics: The Case of "Overcompliant" Liberal States. | year = 2008 |last= Lightfoot |first= Sheryl |doi= 10.1177/030437540803300105|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political |volume=33|issue=1|pages=83–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Mick Dodson|Michael Dodson]] [[Order of Australia|AM]] described [[Aboriginal Australians]]' idea of country using the term during his [[Australian of the Year]] speech. He said:
{{Quote|For us, country is a word for all the values, places, resources, stories and cultural obligations associated with the area and its features. It in fact describes the entirety of our ancestral domains. So when we acknowledge traditional country, as increasingly people do so in Australia, it's no empty [[ritual]]: it's to acknowledge who we, the Aboriginal people, are and our place in this nation. In doing that, it seems to me, all Australians might have a clearer notion of who they are and where they stand in relation to their history and the land they live in.&lt;ref name="museumvid"&gt;{{cite video |title=Australian of the Year speech, Professor Michael Dodson AM|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/immigrationmuseum/discoverycentre/identity/videos/politics-videos/australian-of-the-year-speech-professor-michael-dodson/|publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="country protocol"&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol for Welcome to and Acknowledgement of Country|url=https://www.lawsociety.com.au/cs/groups/public/documents/internetcontent/680910.pdf|publisher=Law Society of New South Wales |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==

The term was used as early as the 1920s in the work of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of ILO's work|url=http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Aboutus/HistoryofILOswork/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the ILO was concerned with the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in their roles as workers in the overseas colonies of European powers. It became increasingly evident that indigenous peoples were exposed to severe labour exploitation and had a need for special protection in cases where they were expelled from their ancestral domains only to become seasonal, migrant, bonded or home-based [[labourers]]. This recognition led to adoption in 1930 of the ILO's [[Forced Labour Convention]] (No. 29).&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

Following the creation of the [[United Nations]], the ILO with the participation of other parts of the UN system created the [[Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention]] (No. 107). Convention No. 107 was adopted in 1957 as the first international treaty on this subject.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

This involved the underlying assumption that the only possible future for indigenous and tribal peoples was integration into larger society, and that the state should make decisions regarding indigenous development. In 1986 an ILO committee of experts concluded that "the integrationist approach of the Convention was obsolete and that its application was detrimental in the modern world." &lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

In 1988 and 1989, the revision of Convention No. 107 was on the agenda of the International Labour Conference (ILC) and in June 1989, the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169) was adopted.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

This paved the way for the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2007.

== Documentation ==

Indigenous peoples in Asia have used [[counter-mapping|community mapping]] to advocate for [[land rights]]. This mapping may include documenting [[sacred sites]] and [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial]] but geographically-linked [[traditional knowledge]] of land.&lt;ref name="map1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Talubo|first= Joan |last2= Pauline |title=Community Mapping in the Philippines: A Case Study on the Ancestral Domain Claim of the Higaonons in Impasug-ong, Bukidnon |url=https://www.academia.edu/1136474/Community_Mapping_in_the_Philippines_A_Case_Study_on_the_Ancestral_Domain_Claim_of_the_Higaonons_in_Impasug-ong_Bukidnon|publisher=Regional Community Mapping Network Workshop |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuminez|first= Astrid |title=This Land is Our Land: Moro Ancestral Domain and Its Implications for Peace and Development in the Southern Philippines|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sais/summary/v027/27.2tuminez.html |publisher=SAIS Review of International Affairs |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map3"&gt;{{cite web|last= Widodo |first= Kasmita |title=Indonesia's 'One Map Policy' Down to Earth|url=http://andikhardiyanto.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/indonesias-one-map-policy-down-to-earth/ |publisher=MERDESA Institute for Rural Reconstruction |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional contexts ==

=== Indonesia ===

In 2013, the Indonesian [[Constitutional Court]] amended the 1999 Law on Forestry to return land rights to indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands are forested.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web|last= Pasandaran |first= Camelia |title=Constitutional Court Annuls Government Ownership of Customary Forests|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/constitutional-court-annuls-government-ownership-of-customary-forests/ |publisher=Jakarta Globe |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first= Chris |title=Indigenous peoples' rights and the status of forest land in Indonesia|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2013/10/09/indigenous-peoples-rights-and-the-status-of-forest-land-in-indonesia/ |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, there have been many land conflicts regarding indigenous community territories in resource-rich [[Kalimantan]]. According to data quoted in the [[Jakarta Post]], following the enactment of the Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development (MP3EI) in 2011, some 135 communities became involved in conflict with businesses.&lt;ref name="Indonews"&gt;{{cite web|last= Sabarini |first= Prodita |title=NGO maps out indigenous community territories|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/24/ngo-maps-out-indigenous-community-territories.html |publisher=Jakarta Post |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conflicts involve indigenous peoples' traditional cultures being uprooted by [[palm oil]] plantations, or [[logging]] or [[mining]] interests.

[[NGOs]] in Indonesia set up the Ancestral Domain Registration Agency. A community mapper said the agency was created to "be prepared for the court ruling. If it the Constitutional Court ruled that customary forests belonged to indigenous peoples, we wanted to be able to show where those customary forests were located." &lt;ref name=Indonews/&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{see|List of traditional territories of the indigenous peoples of North America|registered traplines}}
The common term in Canada is "traditional territory".  This can refer the entire [[homeland]] of a large ethnic group or the particular hunting and trapping grounds of a small [[band society]].  In areas where treaties have been signed, it refers to the land outside of [[Indian reserves]] in which a particular indigenous nation still claims an interest.  In the case of specific rights to hunt and fish in a territory, these are called "[[aboriginal rights]]" and are a separate legal category from "[[treaty rights]]".  In the case of areas where there are no treaties, such as most of [[British Columbia]], the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that [[aboriginal title]] applies to the entirety of a nation's claimed homeland, and not just to the particular locations of villages and other intensely-used sites.  This was a unanimous ruling by the court in the 2017 case ''[[Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia]]''.  However, in that same year, the Canadian court rejected the spiritual use of a site as being sufficient to establish aboriginal title, in ''[[Ktunaxa Nation v British Columbia (Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations)]]''.

=== Philippines ===

In the [[Philippines]], the term is used to refer to indigenous peoples' [[land rights]] in law.&lt;ref name="UP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Romualdo|first= Arlyn |last2= Palisoc |first2= VCD |title=Protecting IPs' Rights to Ancestral Domains and Lands|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/protecting-ips-rights-to-ancestral-domains-and-lands/|publisher=University of the Philippines |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral lands are referred to in the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippines Constitution]]. Article XII, Section 5 says: "The State, subject to the provisions of this Constitution and national development policies and programs, shall protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well-being." &lt;ref name="Inq"&gt;{{cite web|last= Bernas |first= Joaquin  |title=Ancestral domain vs regalian doctrine (2) |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20080929-163630/Ancestral-domain-vs-regalian-doctrine-2/|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s research on forest land ownership in the Philippines found conflicts in institutional mandates among the [[Local Government Code]], [[mining law]] and the [[National Integrated Protected Areas Act]], and recommended exclusive resource use rights to community-based forest management communities.&lt;ref name="law1"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Trends in forest ownership, forest resources tenure and institutional arrangements: are they contributing to better forest management and poverty reduction?|url= http://www.fao.org/forestry/10543-03d5a1b99b199bb5b040e70eba8414526.pdf |publisher=FAO |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">The '''Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010''', {{USStatute|111|294|124|3177|2010|12|09}}, was a United States law that addressed the banning of depictions of [[cruelty to animals]] to satisfy a [[crush fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama signs law banning 'crush videos' depicting animal cruelty|first=Bill|last=Mears|date=December 10, 2010|work=[[CNN News]]|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-10/politics/animal.cruelty_1_dog-fighting-videos-crush-videos-animal-cruelty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill (law)|bill]], {{USBill|111|hr|5566}}, was introduced by Rep. [[Elton Gallegly]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[California|CA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local congressman introduces new bill to stop the sale of animal cruelty videos|first=Richard|last=Simon|date=April 21, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/04/animal-cruelty-videos-law-supreme.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and primarily modifies {{usc|18|48}}.

==Background==
{{main|United States v. Stevens}}

The act revised the version of 18 U.S.C. § 48 which had entered into effect on December 9, 1999 was an [[unconstitutional]] abridgment of the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of speech  by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The previous law, placed into effect by {{USPL|106|152}} enacted on December 9, 1999, aimed at banning the [[publication]], sale, and ownership of so-called "[[crush videos]]", which are films that feature a person or another animal crushing or trampling another smaller animal to [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopcrush.org/?page_id=2 About Crush « STOPCRUSH.ORG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty/crush_videos.php Stopping Crush Videos], [http://www.pet-abuse.com Pet-Abuse.Com].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was too vague and broad in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]'', and, in an 8–1 decision, it nullified the 1999 law.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/us/21scotus.html Justices Reject Ban on Videos of Animal Cruelty], April 20, 2010 The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian '''''Anti-terrorism Act''''' ({{lang-fr|Loi antiterroriste}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Anti-terrorism Act|abbr =S.C.|year =2001|chapter =41|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2001_41/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ''Act'') was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] in the [[United States]]. It received [[Royal Assent]] on December 18, 2001, as Bill C-36. The "[[omnibus bill]]"{{fact|date=April 2018}} extended the powers of government and institutions within the [[Canada|Canadian]] security establishment to respond to the threat of terrorism. 

The expanded powers were highly controversial due to widely perceived incompatibility with the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]],&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Colleen Bell, "Subject to Exception: Security Certificates, National Security and Canada's Role in the 'War on Terror'" '''21(1)''' ''Canadian Journal of Law and Society'' 63-83 at 73; Sherene Razack, ''Casting Out: The Eviction of Muslims from Western Law and Politics'' (Toronto, Buffalo, &amp; London: University of Toronto Press, 2008) at 161; and Kent Roach, "Defining Terrorism: The Need for a Restrained Definition" in ''The Human Rights of Anti-Terrorism,'' Nicole LaViolette &amp; Craig Forcese, eds. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2008) 97-127 at 97-98 and 127.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular for the Act's provisions allowing for 'secret' trials, preemptive detention and expansive security and surveillance powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/ cbc.ca: "411 error"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008232255/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/ |date=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Act'''s passage has been compared to the government's activation of the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' in accordance to [[October Crisis|terrorist activity]] by the [[Front de libération du Québec|FLQ]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

It was opposed by Parliamentarians [[Marjory LeBreton]] and [[Andrew Telegdi]], and criminal defense lawyer [[David Paciocco]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegdi.org/mmvii/newsrel_27feb07.htm telegdi.org: "So-called anti-terrorism act"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728025237/http://www.telegdi.org/mmvii/newsrel_27feb07.htm |date=2007-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziyad Mia, of the [[Toronto]] [[Muslim Lawyers Association]], "questioned whether the definition of terrorist activity would apply to a group that resisted, by acts of violence, the regimes of [[Saddam Hussein]] or [[Robert Mugabe]]," and pointed out that it criminalized the [[French Resistance]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;Diab, Robert. "Guantanamo North", 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutions==
In January 2010, [[Zakaria Amara]], from [[Mississauga]], a suspect in the [[2006 Toronto terrorism case]], was sentenced to imprisonment for life. This sentence was the stiffest given so far under the Act. [[Saad Gaya]] from [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], a fellow suspect in the same case, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crime/article/752507--life-term-for-terror-ringleader thestar.com: "Life term for terror ringleader - Man planned to detonate three bombs at 9 a.m., when Toronto's downtown core would be bustling"], 19 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Combating Terrorism Act'' (2013)==
Some of the bill's provisions were set to expire on March 1, 2007. The [[Stephen Harper|Harper]] government urged that these be renewed, while all three opposition parties were opposed. Specifically, the provisions had to do with preventative arrest and investigative hearings.  On February 28, 2007, the House of Commons voted 159-124 against renewing the provisions, which later led to their expiry, as originally planned in the [[sunset clause]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In 2012, the Government of Canada introduced in the [[Senate of Canada]] Bill S-7, the ''[[Combating Terrorism Act]]'', which was to renew the expired provisions for a new five-year term, and introduced new crimes for leaving Canada to join or train with a terror group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/politics/controversial-anti-terror-bill-passes-allowing-preventative-arrests-secret-hearings nationalpost.com: "Controversial anti-terror bill passes, allowing preventative arrests, secret hearings"], 25 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also increased the maximum prison sentences for some offences related to harbouring suspected terrorists. On April 19, just after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the government rearranged the Parliamentary agenda to fast-track Bill S-7 to a vote on April 22 or 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/canada-politics/harper-government-poised-fast-track-anti-terrorism-bill-220341767.html yahoo.com: "Harper government to fast track anti-terrorism bill"], 19 Apr 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Act'' received royal assent on April 25, 2013.&lt;ref name="canlaw"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7651">The '''Ralph M. Brown Act''', located at California Government Code 54950 ''et seq.'', is an act of the [[California]] [[California State Legislature|State Legislature]], authored by Assemblymember [[Ralph M. Brown]] and passed in 1953, that guarantees the public's right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The Brown Act: Open Meetings for Local Legislative Bodies | publisher= [[California Attorney General]] | volume= Foreword, Introduction, and Table of Contents | last= Lockyer | first= Bill | year= 2003 | url= http://ag.ca.gov/publications/2003_Intro_BrownAct.pdf | accessdate= 2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brown Act, originally a 686 word [[statute]] that has grown substantially over the years, was enacted in response to mounting public concerns over informal, undisclosed meetings held by local elected officials.  City councils, county boards, and other local government bodies were avoiding public scrutiny by holding secret "workshops" and "study sessions." The Brown Act solely applies to California city and county government agencies, boards, and councils. The Act has been interpreted to apply to email communication as well, leading to restrictions on the number of parties that can be copied on electronic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncity.com/Western-City/June-2011/The-Brown-Act-and-the-Perils-of-Electronic-Communication/ |title=The Brown Act and the Perils of Electronic Communication |publisher=westerncity.com |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparable [[Bagley-Keene Act]] mandates open meetings for State government agencies.

==History==

The introduction to the Brown Act describes its purpose and intent:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/california/codes/california_government_code_54950&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this State do not yield their [[sovereignty]] to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating [[authority]], do not give their [[public servant]]s the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Sacramento Bee'' said of the act:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A law to prohibit secret meetings of official bodies, save under the most exceptional circumstances, should not be necessary.  Public officers above all other persons should be imbued with the truth that their business is the public's business and they should be the last to tolerate any attempt to keep the people from being fully informed as to what is going on in official agencies.  Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case. Instances are many in which officials have contrived, deliberately and shamefully, to operate in a vacuum of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacramento Bee,'' October 5, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Supporters of the Brown Act say it still lacks enforcement (and has never had a successful prosecution)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=First Amendment Coalition|url= https://firstamendmentcoalition.org/open-meetings-3/facs-brown-act-primer/brown-act-primer-enforcement/|title=Brown Act Primer: Enforcement |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;contending the law has been eroded by court decisions and government officials' efforts to block access to records.  "The unfulfilled promise, I'm afraid, that 50 years has revealed, is enforcement," commented Terry Francke, of the [[California First Amendment Coalition]], on the 50th anniversary of the bill's passage in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= California's sunshine law celebrates 50 years | publisher= [[First Amendment Center]] | url= http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/californias-sunshine-law-celebrates-50-years | access-date= 2005-06-01 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140329114520/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/californias-sunshine-law-celebrates-50-years | archive-date= 2014-03-29 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Malta}}
The '''Chief Justice of Malta''' is the [[primus inter pares]] of the judicial branch of [[Malta]]. The Chief Justice leads the business of the Superior Courts and is appointed by the [[President of Malta]] acting in accordance with the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta]] after consulting with the [[Leader of the Opposition (Malta)|Leader of Opposition]]. 

The judicial appointments committee which is constituted according to the provisions of the Constitution and chaired by the Chief Justice, is not consulted on the appointment. This to ensure that the outgoing Chief Justice would not have a say on the choice of his/her successor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-12-30/local-news/New-Chief-Justice-to-be-appointed-by-government-in-consultation-with-the-Opposition-6736183072&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Duties==

Where more than one judge is assigned to sit ordinarily in a court, or in a chamber or section of the court, the distribution of duties in general between the judges appertains to the Chief Justice. 

By virtue of his office, the Chief Justice of Malta is ex officio: 

*Deputy Chairman of the [[Commission for the Administration of Justice of Malta]].
*President of the Court of Appeal (Superior Jurisdiction)
*President of the Court of Criminal Appeal (Superior Jurisdiction)
*President of the Constitutional Court

The Chief Justice may designate one of the Magistrates sitting in the Inferior Courts as Senior Magistrate, who shall perform such duties and functions as may be assigned to his by the Chief Justice himself. 

If the office of Chief Justice is vacant or if the Chief Justice is for any reason unable to perform the functions of his office, then, until a person has been appointed to and has assumed the functions of that office or until the Chief Justice has resumed those functions, as the case may be, those functions shall (except to such extent, if any, as other provision is made by law) be performed by such one of the other judges of the Superior Courts as may be designated in that behalf by the President, acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.

The '''Coloured Persons Representative Council of the Republic of South Africa'''&lt;ref&gt;The name is sometimes written as "Coloured Persons' Representative Council"; however the text of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, omits the apostrophe.&lt;/ref&gt; was a partially elected council with limited legislative powers, intended to represent [[coloured]] South Africans during the [[apartheid]] era. It was first elected in 1969, re-elected in 1975, and permanently dissolved in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=M.A. |title=The failure of the Coloured Persons' Representative Council and its constitutional repercussions, 1956–1985 |url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1024/ |last=Saks |first=David Yoram |year=1991 |publisher=Rhodes University |accessdate=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] was created to represent coloured voters in the [[Tricameral Parliament]].

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1986''' was the ninth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[London]], the [[United Kingdom]], between 3 August 1986 and 5 August 1986, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This was a special meeting held in between the biennial CHOGMs in order to consider the recommendations of the [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] regarding economic sanctions against South Africa due to its policies of apartheid. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to support mandatory sanctions resulted in an acrimonious meeting and almost led to a split in the Commonwealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">'''A consignment agreement''' is an agreement between a consignee and consignor for the storage, transfer, sale or resale and use of the commodity. The consignee may take goods from the [[consignment stock]] for use or resale subject to payment to the consignor agreeably to the terms bargained in the consignment agreement. The unsold goods will normally be returned by the consignee to the consignor.

==Consignment and distribution agreements==
It may be accompanied by a consignment agreement ([[Franchising]], distributorship or [[OEM]]).
Goods are stored at the premises of the [[distributor]], or premises of a [[Party (law)|third party]], at distributor's disposal, but remain the property of the [[export]]er.

This agreement decreases the exporter's risk because he remains the owner of the commodities in storage.  The distributor does not need to pay until he has sold the commodities, so he improves his [[cash flow]]. 
Both parties must ensure that the consignment agreement is formulated very carefully, so no room for doubt remains with regard to third parties, specifically the distributor's [[creditor]]s in case of his bankruptcy. 
The distributor and the exporter have incompatible interests. The distributor's interest will be to increase the amount of the stock in consignment because this has no effect on his cash situation. Therefore the parties should agree on reasonable stock rolling adapted to the [[Demand (economics)|market demand]], and consider how quickly the exporter may produce and deliver additional goods in order to avoid stock disruption.

Fulfillment of certain conditions is requested by the customs and VAT authorities. Due to the European VAT rules, it is easier to have a consignment stock between EU countries. The distributor is required to keep accurate accounts, but dispensable to have a [[bonded warehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Didier  |last=Rigault |year=2010 |title= International Business Agreements | ISBN =978-82-991430-9-7 | page=83 |publisher=The International Business Law Group |location=Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5726">The '''Copyright Act 1842''' (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which received the [[Royal Assent]] on 1 July 1842 and was repealed in 1911. It revised and consolidated the [[copyright law of the United Kingdom]].
It was one of the [[Copyright Acts 1734 to 1888]].{{refn|group=n|The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2.}}

==Duration of copyright==
It repealed the former Copyright Acts, and provided that in future the copyright of every book published in the lifetime of its author would endure for the remainder of the author's life and for a further seven years after their death. If this period was less than forty-two years from the first publication, then the copyright would persist for a full forty-two years regardless of the date of their death. Any work published after the author's death would remain the copyright of the owner of the manuscript for the same forty-two year period.

Where copyright already existed in a work under earlier legislation, it was to be extended to that provided for by the new act, except that if the copyright had been sold{{refn|group=n|As the ''Companion'' tactfully put it, in cases "where it shall belong to an assignee for other considerations than natural love and affection."}} it would lapse at the end of the present term of copyright, unless an extension was agreed to by both the proprietor and the author. This ensured that authors would have the opportunity to be compensated for the fact that rights they had sold some years previously, possibly for a fixed sum, had become substantially more valuable.

In an early form of a [[compulsory license]], the Privy Council was given the authority to authorize the republication of any book which the proprietor refused to publish after the death of the author.

Copyright in encyclopedias, magazines, periodicals, and series works was to be vested in the proprietors as though they were themselves the authors, saving that essays, articles, &amp;c. first published as part of a collected periodical work, the republication right was to revert to the original author after twenty-eight years and continue for the remainder of the term.

The Act extended to dramatic works, previously covered by the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833, and to their "right of representation"{{refn|group=n|The right to license them for performance.}} which was to have the same term as copyright. The copyright and the right of representation of a dramatic work could be assigned separately. The Act also extended to musical works, and extended the provisions of the 1833 Act to cover such works.

Copyrights were declared to be personal property, and thus capable of [[bequest]].

==Library deposit and registration==

One copy of any book printed after the Act came into force{{refn|group=n|And of any subsequent edition which had significant additions}} was to be submitted within one month of publication to the [[British Museum]], at the expense of the publisher. The [[Bodleian Library]], [[Cambridge University Library]], the [[Advocates' Library]] and the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin]], were all empowered to demand copies, which were to be delivered within a month of receiving the demand.

A registry of copyrights was to be kept at [[Stationers' Hall]], and an entry was to be taken as ''prima facie'' proof of proprietorship; an assignation of copyright recorded in the register was to be considered as having the force of a legal deed. Entry in the register was a necessary precondition to suing under the Act, but an omission did not affect the legal title, simply the ability to sue.

==Copyright infringement==
Any illegal copies of work were forfeit, to become the property of the proprietor of the copyright, and could be recovered from their publisher by legal action. All editions published outside British jurisdiction were illegal; only the copyright proprietor was permitted to import them, and any unauthorized imports were likewise forfeit. Any illegally imported copies could be seized by customs agents, and fined on conviction at a rate of £10 plus double the value of each copy of the book. 

The Act extended throughout the British Empire. It was repealed by sections 36 and 37(2) of, and schedule 3 to, the [[Copyright Act 1911]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10801">A '''copyright troll''' is a party (person or company) that enforces [[copyright]]s it owns for purposes of making money through [[litigation]], in a manner considered unduly aggressive or opportunistic, generally without producing or licensing the works it owns for paid distribution. Critics object to the activity because they believe it does not encourage the production of [[creativity|creative]] works, but instead makes money through the inequities and [[unintended consequences]] of high [[statutory damages]] provisions in copyright laws intended to encourage creation of such works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rashmi Rangnath|date=2008-01-29|title=What a copyright troll looks like|publisher=Public Knowledge|url=https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/what-copyright-troll-looks|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607015822/https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/what-copyright-troll-looks|archivedate=2017-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the term and the concept of a copyright troll began to appear in the mid-2000s. It derives from the [[pejorative]] "[[patent troll]]s", which are companies that enforce patent rights to earn money from companies that are selling products, without having products of their own for sale.&lt;ref name="ipf"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=13469&amp;deptid=3|title=Copyright Trolls - A Different Embodiment of the Patent Troll?|author=Caroline Horton Rockafellow|date=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from organizations such as [[ASCAP]], which collect royalties and enforce copyrights of its members.&lt;ref name="ipf"/&gt;

==Notable examples==
One commentator describes Harry Wall, husband of nineteenth-century British comic singer Annie Wall, as the world's first copyright troll.&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Privilege and Property. Essays on the History of Copyright|editor1=Ronan Deazley |editor2=Martin Kretschmer |editor3=Lionel Bently |author=Isabella Alexander|page=339|publisher=Open Book Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRBkCOC8d-4C&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=%22copyright+troll%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22copyright%20troll%22&amp;f=false|isbn=9781906924188|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wall set up "the Authors', Composers' and Artists' Copyright Protection Office", to collect fees for unauthorized performances of works by composers (often deceased) based on the threat of litigation for [[statutory damages]] under the [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom#19th century extension of copyright|Dramatic Copyright Act of 1842]].&lt;ref name="wall"/&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[SCO–Linux controversies|SCO Group's effort]] to obtain royalties in regards to the open source operating system Linux, was viewed as copyright trolling by some of the approximately 1,500 companies from whom SCO demanded licensing royalties, based on a copyright that a court eventually ruled belonged instead to [[Novell]]. Novell, by contrast, had no interest or intention of enforcing its copyright against the alleged infringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wired Magazine|series=Threat Level|title=Battered SCO Files for Bankruptcy to Stay Afloat|author=David Kravets|date=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Kravets|date=March 31, 2010|title=Copyright Troll Loses High-Stakes Unix Battle|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/unix-copyrights/#ixzz0yUsnFxzG|publisher=Wired Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also applied to two parties that separately sued [[Google]] in 2006, after posting content they knew would be indexed by [[Google]]'s [[Googlebot]] spider, with the industry standard "[[noindex]]" opt-out tags deliberately omitted. After ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google Inc.]]'', adult magazine [[Perfect 10 (magazine)|''Perfect 10'']] was described as a copyright troll for setting up image links with the intent to sue Google for infringement after Google added them to its image search service.&lt;ref name="ipf"/&gt; In ''[[Field v. Google]]'', a Nevada lawyer took "affirmative steps" to get his legal writings included in Google's search results so that he could sue Google, and was ruled to have acted in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Proceed With Caution: How Digital Archives Have Been Left in the Dark|author=Alyssa N. Knutson|publisher=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|page=437|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the term has been used to describe entities that bring questionable claims against companies in the fashion industry over purported copyrights in fabric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Copyright Trolls Are Never in Fashion: Copyright Infringement Suits and Strategies for Fighting Back|author=American Bar Association|date=May 24, 2013|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/cle/programs/t13crt1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Righthaven cases==
In 2010, copyright holding company [[Righthaven LLC]] was called a copyright troll by commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/09/03/vegas-baby-ruling-a-possible-boon-to-copyright-troll-suits/|date=September 3, 2010|title=Vegas, Baby!

The matter was covered by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', ''[[Wired News]]'', ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', and other newspapers and news blogs,&lt;ref name="lvs"/&gt; as well as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which offered to assist the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 25, 2010|author=Eva Galperin|title=EFF Seeks to Help Righthaven Defendants|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/08/eff-seeks-righthaven-defendants|publisher=EFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper's competitor, the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'', covered all 107 of the lawsuits as of September 1, 2010,&lt;ref name="lvs"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|author=Steve Green|date=September 1, 2010|title=Why we are writing about the R-J copyright lawsuits|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/sep/01/why-we-are-writing-about-r-j-copyright-lawsuits/}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as the first known instance of a copyright troll buying the rights to a news story based on finding that its copyright had been infringed.&lt;ref name="aba"/&gt; The Review-Journal's publisher responded by defending the lawsuits, and criticizing the Sun for covering them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|url=http://www.lvrj.com/blogs/sherm/Protecting_newspaper_content_--_You_either_do_it_or_you_dont.html?ref=268|title=Protecting newspaper content -- You either do it, or you don't|author=Sherman Frederick|date=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2010, the company entered an agreement with [[WEHCO Media]] in Arkansas to pursue similar actions, and announced that it was in negotiation with a number of other publishers.&lt;ref name="borrow"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=
Threat Level Privacy, Crime and Security Online|author=David Kravets|date=August 30, 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/copyright-troll-expanding/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wired Magazine described the activity as "borrowing a page from the patent trolls", and noted that the company was demanding $75,000 from each infringer, and agreeing to settlements of several thousand dollars per defendant.&lt;ref name="borrow"/&gt;

In April 2011, a Colorado court ruled in ''Righthaven v. Hill'' that:
: "Although Plaintiff’s business model relies in large part upon reaching settlement agreements with a minimal investment of time and effort, the purpose of the courts is to provide a forum for the orderly, just, and timely resolution of controversies and disputes. Plaintiff’s wishes to the contrary, the courts are not merely tools for encouraging and exacting settlements from Defendants cowed by the potential costs of litigation and liability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=22839253&amp;z=4b060b3b case: 1:11-cv-00211-JLK]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second half of 2011, defendants with resources to fight Righthaven in court were winning cases on grounds that their usage fell within the [[fair use]] doctrine and that Stephens Media had actually not assigned full ownership of the copyrighted material to Righthaven. Righthaven was also sanctioned by at least one judge for failing to disclose that Stephens Media got a 50 percent cut of any lawsuit proceeds involving the ''Review-Journal.'' Successful defendants demanded court costs and legal fees, which Righthaven refused to pay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/creditor-righthaven/ David Kravets, "Creditor Moves to Dismantle Copyright Troll Righthaven"], ''Wired'', 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2011, Righthaven was insolvent and on the auction block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2011/dec/22/dismantling-righthaven-appears-under-way-loss-webs Steve Green, "Dismantling of Righthaven appears under way with loss of website"], ''Vegasinc'', 22 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal defense==
Two lawyers have provided a framework for a legal defense against copyright trolls.&lt;ref&gt;Sag, Matthew and Haskell, Jake, (March 28, 2017) [https://ssrn.com/abstract=2933200 Defense Against the Dark Arts of Copyright Trolling] Iowa Law Review, Forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the lawsuits about online copyright infringement rely on a minimal amount of information that targets non-infringers as well as infringers, there are ways to defend against the lawsuit by defense lawyers and pro se defendants that is described in the framework.

[[Image:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|{{lang|la|Digestorum, seu Pandectarum libri quinquaginta. Lugduni apud Gulielmu[m] Rouillium}}, 1581. Biblioteca Comunale "Renato Fucini" di Empoli]]
The '''''Digest''''', also known as the '''Pandects''' ({{lang-la|Digesta seu Pandectae}}, adapted from {{lang-grc|πανδέκτης}} {{lang|grc-Latn|pandéktēs}}, "all-containing"), is a name given to a compendium or digest of juristic writings on [[Roman law]] compiled by order of the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire|Eastern Roman]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century CE (530–533). It is divided into 50 books.

The Digest was part of a reduction and codification of all [[Roman laws]] up to that time, which later came to be known as the {{lang|la|[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]}} (lit. "Body of Civil Law"&lt;ref&gt;To distinguish it from the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).   The other two parts were a collection of statutes, the [[Codex Justinianus|{{lang|la|Codex|nocat=y}} (Code)]], which survives in a second edition, and an introductory textbook, the [[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]];  all three parts were given force of law.   The set was intended to be complete, but Justinian passed further legislation, which was later collected separately as the {{lang|la|[[Novellae Constitutiones]]}} (New Laws or, conventionally, the "Novels").

==History==
{{main|Corpus Juris Civilis}}
The original ''Codex Justinianus'' was promulgated in April of 529 by the C. "Summa". This made it the only source of imperial law, and repealed all earlier codifications.&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation, see [[Fred H. Blume]], ''[http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/blume-justinian/_files/docs/book-1pdf/book%201-introduction.pdf C. Summa]'' in "The Annotated Justinian Code".&lt;/ref&gt; However, it permitted reference to ancient jurists whose writings had been regarded as authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Honoré, 'Justinian's Codification' in ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' 803-804. (Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth eds. 3rd rev. ed 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Under Theodosus II's [[Law of Citations]], the writings of [[Papinian]], [[Paul (jurist)|Paul]]us, [[Ulpian]], Modestinus, and [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] were made the primary juristic authorities who could be cited in court.  Others cited by them also could be referred to, but their views had to be "informed by a comparison of manuscripts".&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Jolowicz &amp; Barry Nicholas, ''Historical Introduction to the Study of Roman Law'' 452 (3rd ed. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal surviving manuscript is the [[Littera Florentina]] of the late sixth or early seventh century. In the Middle Ages, the Digest was divided into three parts, and most of the manuscripts contain only one of these parts.&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz &amp; Nicholas, supra note 2 at 491. For a detailed account of how the Digest and other parts of the Corpus Juris Civilis were transmitted from the end of antiquity to the Renaissance, see Charles M. Radding &amp; Antonio Ciaralli, ''The Corpus Iuris Civilis in the Middle Ages:  Manuscripts and Transmissions from the Sixth Century to the Juristic Revival'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Digest was translated into English in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''The Digest of Justinian'' (Theodor Mommsen, Paul Krueger, &amp; Alan Watson eds., 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digest was discovered in [[Amalfi]] in 1135, prompting a revival of learning of Roman law throughout Europe. Other sources claim it was discovered in 1070 and formed a major impetus for the founding of the first university in Europe, the University of Bologna (1088).{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Conflicts of law==
The codified authorities often conflicted. Therefore, Justinian ordered these conflicts to be settled and fifty of these were published as the "quinquaginta decisiones" (fifty decisions).  Soon after, he further decreed that the works of these ancient writers, which totalled over 1,500 books, be condensed into fifty books.  These were to be entitled, in Latin, ''Digesta'' (Ordered abstracts) or, in Greek, Πανδέκται ''Pandectae'' ("Encyclopedia").&lt;ref name="Honoré, supra note 1 at 804"&gt;Honoré, supra note 1 at 804.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this order of December 15, 530 ("Deo auctore"), Tribonian created a commission of sixteen members to do the work—one government official, four professors, and eleven advocates.&lt;ref name="Jol&amp;Nic-480"&gt;Jolowicz &amp; Nicholas, supra note 2 at 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was given the power to condense and alter the texts in order to simplify, clarify, and eliminate conflicts among them.&lt;ref name="Jol&amp;Nic-480"/&gt; The Digest's organization is complex:  each of the fifty books is divided into several titles, each containing several extracts, and many of the extracts have several parts or paragraphs.  Research in the modern era has created a highly probable picture of how the commission carried out its task.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of how the committee worked and how the "Digest" is organized, see Jolowicz &amp; Nicholas, supra note 2 at 483-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Approximately two-fifths of the Digest consists of the writings of [[Ulpian]], while some one-sixth belongs to [[Julius Paulus|Paulus]].&lt;ref name="Honoré, supra note 1 at 804"/&gt; The work was declared to be the sole source of non-statute law: commentaries on the compilation were forbidden, or even the citing of the original works of the jurists for the explaining of ambiguities in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Mackeldey ''Handbook of the Roman Law'' pp. 57-58, citing Const. ''Tanta'', § 21; Const. ''Dedit'' § 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dry state''' is a state in the United States in which the manufacture, distribution, importation, and sale of [[alcoholic beverages]] are prohibited or tightly restricted. While some states, such as [[North Dakota]], entered the United States as dry states, others went dry after passage of [[prohibition]] legislation. Currently, no state in the United States remains completely dry, but some states contain [[Dry county|dry counties]].

Prior to the adoption of nationwide prohibition in 1920, state legislatures in the United States passed local option laws that allowed a county or township to go dry if it chose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =James H.

However, this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eminent Domain|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/eminent+domain|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-American historical context, property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and [[public utility|public utilities]]. However, in the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party. This was initially done only to "blighted" property, on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new 3rd party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.

Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [[fee simple]], and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.

Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).

==Meaning==
The term "eminent domain" was taken from the legal treatise ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), written by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]] [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1625,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Nowak |first2=Ronald D. |last2=Rotunda |title=Constitutional Law |publisher=Thomson West |location=St. Paul, MN |year=2004 |page=263 |edition=Seventh |isbn=0-314-14452-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used the term ''dominium eminens'' ([[Latin]] for ''supreme lordship'') and described the power as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp; The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may also take personal property, even intangible property such as [[contract]] rights, [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s, and [[copyright]]s. Even the taking of a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[sports team]]'s franchise has been held by the California Supreme Court to be within the purview of the "public use" constitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking (of the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[NFL]] franchise) was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/32C3d60.htm |title=City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders (1982) 32 C3d 60 |website=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taking of property must be accompanied by payment of "just compensation" to the [former] owner. In theory, this is supposed to put the owner in the same position "pecuniarily" that he would have been in had his property not been taken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property's fair market value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted, this is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see [[Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States]] (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys' and appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments, and may be partially covered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.

Most states use the term ''eminent domain'', but some U.S. states use the term ''[[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]'' (New York) or ''expropriation'' (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Code, Public Lands, Art. 2, Sec. 27, Appropriations |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBL/27 |website=NYSenate.gov |publisher=The New York Senate |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 19, Expropriation |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/laws_Toc.aspx?folder=75&amp;level=Parent |website=Louisiana State Legislature |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''condemnation'' is used to describe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property.

The constitutionally required "just compensation" in partial takings is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance damages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner [remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those must be deducted, typically from severance damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Eminent Domain|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/eminent_domain.html |website=ExpertLaw.com |publisher=ExpertLaw |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former owners of the property rarely receive full market value because some elements of value are deemed noncompensable in eminent domain law.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the [[common law]]. When it came time to draft the [[United States Constitution]], differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution requires that the taking be for a "public use" and mandates payment of "just compensation" to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_03_04_benson.pdf |title=The Evolution of Eminent Domain: A Remedy for Market Failure or an Effort to Limit Government Power and Government Failure? |format=PDF |website=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal law, Congress may take private property directly (without recourse to the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking compensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=''Linggi v. Garovotti'', 45 Cal.2d 20, 286 P.2d 15 (1955).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15917425264572652948|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of "public use".

=== Canada ===
In Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to "be made whole" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.

==Europe==
In many European nations, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence" and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of [[national security]], public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights#toc|First Protocol]] to the Convention, which states that "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or [[public interest]], is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of [[tax]]es. Settled case-law of ECHR provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;See James v.the UK, decision of ECHR dated by 21 February 1986, para 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a [[Déclaration d'utilité publique]] is commonly required, to demonstrate a public benefit.

Notably, in 1945, by decree of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] based on untried&lt;ref name="shame" /&gt; accusations of collaboration, the [[Renault]] company was expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as ''Régie Nationale des Usines Renault''&lt;ref name="shame"&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Renault and the shame of a nation |publisher=The Daily Telegraph, Ian Morton |date=14 May 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;—without compensation.&lt;ref name="ogre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign News: Was He Murdered? |publisher=Time Magazine |date=Feb 6, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
{{main|Compulsory purchase in England and Wales}}
After his victory in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] seized virtually all land in England. Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the Crown's right of [[purveyance]] for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [[Magna Carta]] required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in [[Lincolnshire]] the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries well into the 20th century, such as [[Attorney-General v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd]] (1919).

In [[England and Wales]], and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of [[English law]], the related term '''compulsory purchase''' is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken land is determined by the [[Upper Tribunal]]. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the [[Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]], the [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1973]], the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], the [[Planning and Compensation Act 1991]], and the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]].

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] states in its Article 14 (3) that "an expropriation is only allowed for the public good"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/14.html |title=Art. 14 GG |website=Dejure.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just compensation must be made. It also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court.

===Italy===
[[File:Espropria graffiti in Turin October 2016.jpg|thumb|''Espropria'', "expropiate". Protest graffiti in [[Turin]]]]
''Esproprio'', or more formally ''espropriazione per pubblica utilità'' (literally "expropriation for public utility") in [[Italy]] takes place within the frame of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], as an expression of the ''potere ablatorio'' (ablative power). The law regulating expropriation is the D.P.R. n.327 of 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/01325dla.htm |title=D.P.R. 327/2001 |website=Camera.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended by D.Lgs. n.302 of 2002;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/02302dl.htm |title=Dlgs 302/2002 |website=Parlamento.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it supersedes the old expropriation law, the Royal Decree n.2359 of 1865. Also other national and regional laws may apply, not always giving a full compensation to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;In other countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Germany) is provided fair compensation according to the free market value both for regular expropriations or for absolutely unlawful occupations: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=Occupazione acquisitiva: nodo irrisolto nonostante le modifiche al Testo unico |journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2003 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89339045}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expropriation can be total (the whole property is expropriated) or partial; permanent or temporary.

The article 42 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] and the article 834 of the [[Law of Italy|Italian Civil Code]] state that a private good can be expropriated for public utility. Furthermore, the article 2 of the Constitution binds Italian citizens to respect their ''mandatory duties of political, economical and social solidarity''.

The implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuale pratico dell'espropriazione|last=Assini, N.-Tescaroli, N.|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=Padua|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* legality: a public institution can exporpriate private goods only in the cases law allowes it and respecting its procedures (following the article 23 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]);
* compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by the law. According to the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]], this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.
''Nazionalizzazione'' ("nationalization"), instead, is provided for by article 43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto [[monopoly]], and an essential service of public utility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the [[Enel|1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector]].

===Spain===
Article 33.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] allows forced expropriation ("expropiación forzosa") only where justified on the grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of appropriate compensation as provided for in law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=33&amp;tipo=2 Constitución Española de 1978 Art 33 part 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Expropriation. The right of state or municipality to buy property when it is determined to be of "particular public interest", is regulated in Expropriationslagen (1972:719).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1972:719 |title=Expropriationslag (1972:719) (ExprL) |publisher=Lagen.nu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government purchases the property at an estimated market value plus a 25% compensation. The law also states that the property owner shall not suffer economic harm because of the expropriation.

==Australia==
{{Main|Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution}}

In Australia, section 51(xxxi) of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] permits the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] to make laws with respect to "the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044012/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense, rather it is for the court to determine what is just. It may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice, lest the law be invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/20.html/ |title=''Andrews v Howell'' (1941) 65 CLR 255 |website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] has extended the states' power to resume property to any form of physical property.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} For the purposes of section 51(xxxi), money is not property that may be compulsorily acquired.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} (The following is cited by a dead link) A statutory right to sue has been considered "property" under this section.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired, that is, the Commonwealth can "only legislate for the acquisition of Property for particular purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Australian Constitutional Commission, ''Final Report of the Constitutionali Commission'' vol 1 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1988): 600. {{ISBN|0-644-06897-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner's title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The states and territories' powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited. The section 43(1) of the Lands Acquisition Act 1998 (NT) grants the Minister the power to acquire land 'for any purpose whatever'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143837/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Australia interpreted this provision literally, relieving the Territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2008/20.html/ |title=Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment [2008&amp;#93; HCA 20 (15 May 2008) |website=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding permitted the Territory government to acquire land subject to Native Title, effectively extinguishing the Native Title interest in the land. Kirby J in dissent, along with a number of commentators, viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reale |first=Andreana |title=Assisted Theft: Compulsory land acquisition for private benefit in Australia and the US |journal=Alternative Law Journal |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=147–51 |publisher=Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd |location=Melbourne |year=2009 |url=http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''resumption'' is a reflection of the fact that, as a matter of Australian law, all land was originally owned by [[the Crown]] before it was sold, leased or granted&lt;ref&gt;Samantha J. Hepburn, ''Principles of Property Law'', 2nd ed. (Newport, NSW: Cavendish, 2001):45-46. {{ISBN|1-876905-08-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, through the act of compulsory acquisition, the Crown is "resuming" possession.

Brazil's expropriation laws are governed by the Presidential Decree No. 3365 of July 21, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECRETO-LEI Nº 3.365, DE 21 DE JUNHO DE 1941|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del3365.htm|publisher=Presidência da República|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Art. 19, No. 24, of the [[Chilean Constitution]] says in part, "In no case may anyone be deprived of his property, of the assets affected or any of the essential faculties or powers of ownership, except by virtue of a general or a special law which authorizes expropriation for the public benefit or the national interest, duly qualified by the legislator. The expropriated party may protest the legality of the expropriation action before the ordinary courts of justice and shall, at all times, have the right to indemnification for patrimonial harm actually caused, to be fixed by mutual agreement or by a sentence pronounced by said courts in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Chile.pdf |title=Chile |website=Confinder.richmond.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===
In Panama, the government must pay a fair amount of money to the owner of the property to be expropriated.

==Asia==

===India===
{{Main|Land Acquisition in India|The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013}}
The Constitution originally provided for the [[right to property]] under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to 'acquire, hold and dispose of property'. Article 31 provided that "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or acquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the "acquisition or requisition of property" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III). It is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the state's 'eminent domain' powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180417/http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th [[Constitution of India#Amendment|amendment]] act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref name="44amact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm |title=The Constitution (Amendment) |website=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution to provide, "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.&lt;ref name="pgA33"&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Land acquisition in India is currently governed by [[The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013]], which came into force from 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name=LARR2011&gt;{{cite web |title=The Land Acquisition, Rehabilation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 – Full Text of Bill |publisher=Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India |url=http://rural.nic.in/latest/bill_chapter_07092011_E.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2013, land acquisition in India was governed by [[Land Acquisition Act, 1894|Land Acquisition Act of 1894]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Debjani |title=The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice, Special Section Artic… 9 Pages The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=2015 |volume=50 |issue=50 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17572189/The_history_of_eminent_domain_in_colonial_thought_and_legal_practice_Special_Section_Article_Economic_and_Political_Weekly_Vol._L_No.50_December_2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the new LARR (amendment) ordinance 31 December 2014 diluted many clauses of the original act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Ordinances/RTFCTLARR%20Ordinance%202014.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Ordinance |date=2014 |website=Prsindia.irg |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The liberalisation of the economy and the Government's initiative to set up special economic zones have led to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Should-right-to-property-return/articleshow/4202212.cms |work=The Times Of India |first1=Dhananjay |last1=Mahapatra |title=Should right to property return? |date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the government has the power to compulsorily acquire private land at the prevailing market rate for public purposes such as roads, highways, railways, dams, airports, etc.

==Other countries==
Many countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the English-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. [[Japan]], for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of [[Narita International Airport]], and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of [[Roppongi Hills]].

There are other countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. [[Singapore]] practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it to carry out its [[Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme]] for urban renewal. The [[Amendments to the Land Titles Act]] allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of [[majoritarianism]].

In the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months’ additional interest.

Since the 1990s, the [[Zimbabwe]]an government under [[Robert Mugabe]] has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform movement in Zimbabwe]]. The government argued that such land reform was necessary to redistribute the land to Zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during [[colonialism]] – these farmers were never compensated for this seizure.&lt;ref&gt;Dancaescu, Nick. Note. Land reform in Zimbabwe. 15 Fla. J. Int'l L. 615 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10240">The '''EnOcean''' technology is an [[energy harvesting]] wireless technology used primarily in building automation systems, and is also applied to other applications in industry, transportation, logistics and [[Home automation|smart homes]]. Modules based on EnOcean technology combine micro energy converters with ultra low power electronics, and enable wireless communications between batteryless [[Wireless sensor network|wireless sensors]], switches, controllers and gateways. 

In March 2012, the EnOcean wireless standard was ratified as the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 14543-3-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wireless sensor networks, energy harvesting and standardization |url=http://www.energyharvestingjournal.com/articles/wireless-sensor-networks-energy-harvesting-and-standardization-00004399.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard covers the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) layers 1-3 which are the physical, data link and networking layers. 

The energy harvesting wireless modules are manufactured and marketed by the company EnOcean which is based in [[Oberhaching]], Germany. EnOcean offers its technology and licenses for the patented features within the EnOcean Alliance framework.

==Technology==
EnOcean technology is based on the energetically efficient exploitation of slight mechanical motion and other potentials from the environment, such as indoor light and temperature differences, using the principles of [[energy harvesting]].&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Enocean eco200.jpg|thumb|right|Motion Energy Converter for Mechanical Energy Harvesting]]  --&gt; In order to transform such energy fluctuations into usable electrical energy, electromagnetic, [[Solar energy|solar]], and [[Thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric]] energy converters are used. 

EnOcean-based products (such as sensors and light switches) perform without batteries and are engineered to operate maintenance-free. The radio signals from these sensors and switches can be transmitted wirelessly over a distance of up to 300 meters in the open and up to 30 meters inside buildings. Early designs from the company used piezo generators, but were later replaced with electromagnetic energy sources to reduce the operating force (3.5 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]]), and increase the service life to 100 operations a day for more than 25 years. [[File:EnOcean STM310 mit Solarzelle white.jpg|thumb|right|Indoor Light Converter for Solar Energy Harvesting]]

EnOcean wireless data packets are relatively small, with the packet being only 14 bytes long and are transmitted at 125 kbit/s. RF energy is only transmitted for the 1's of the binary data, reducing the amount of power required. Three packets are sent at [[pseudo-random]] intervals reducing the possibility of [[Radio frequency|RF]] packet collisions. Modules optimized for switching applications transmit additional data packets on release of [[Push-button|push-button switches]], enabling other features such as light dimming to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieonline.co.uk/cie2/articlen.asp?pid=1572&amp;id=16612 ''Energy for free'' in  the ''Components in Electronics'' magazine, April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  The transmission frequencies used for the devices are 902&amp;nbsp;MHz, 928.35&amp;nbsp;MHz, 868.3&amp;nbsp;MHz and 315&amp;nbsp;MHz. [[File:EnOcean ECT310.jpg|thumb|right|Ultra Low Power DC/DC Converter for Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting]]
On May 30, 2017 EnOcean unveiled a series of light switches utilizing [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] radio (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enocean.com/en/about-us/press-releases/enocean-launches-easyfit-wall-switches-for-wireless-and-self-powered-control-of-bluetooth-lighting-systems/|title=EnOcean - Press Release {{!}} EnOcean launches Easyfit wall switches for wireless and self-powered control of Bluetooth lighting systems|last=Oberhaching|first=EnOcean GmbH {{!}} Kolpingring 18a {{!}} D-82041|website=www.enocean.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Application examples==
One example of the technology is a battery-free wireless light switch. Advantages are that
it saves time and material by eliminating the need to install wires between the switch and
controlled device, e.g., a light fixture. It also reduces noise on switched circuits, as the
switching is performed locally at the load. 
Other lighting applications include [[occupancy sensor]]s, [[light sensor]]s and key card switches. Furthermore,  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[hvac]]) applications such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, [[Carbon dioxide sensor|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensor]]s, metering sensors already use EnOcean’s energy harvesting wireless technology.

==Company==
EnOcean [[GmbH]] is a venture-funded spin-off company of [[Siemens AG]] founded in 2001. It is a [[Germany|German]] company headquartered in [[Oberhaching]], near [[Munich]], which currently employs 60 employees in Germany and the USA.  It is a technology supplier of [[Self-powered equipment|self-powered modules]] (transmitters, receivers, transceivers, energy converter) to companies (e.g. [[Siemens Building Technologies]], Distech Controls, [[Zumtobel]], Omnio, [[Osram]], Eltako, Wieland Electric, Pressac, Peha, Thermokon, Wago, Herga), which develop and manufacture products used in [[building automation]] ([[light]], [[Window blind|shading]], [[Environmental Control System|hvac]]), [[industrial automation]], and [[automotive industry]] (replacement of the conventional battery in tyre pressure sensors).

The company won the Bavarian Innovation Prize 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayern.de/Wirtschaftsstandort/Innovationspreis/Preistraeger_2002/enocean.html ''Bavarian Innovation Prize 2002'' for EnOcean]&lt;/ref&gt; for its technology, the award "Technology Pioneer 2006"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/fp/TechPioneersENERGY/index.htm ''Technology Pioneer in Energy 2006'' by the World Economic Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[World Economic Forum]], the "Top-10 Product for 2007" award by Building Green&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildinggreen.com/press/topten2007/top-10-list.cfm#enocean ''BuildingGreen Top-10 Product for 2007']&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the  global cleantech 100 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/global-clean-technology-100-green-tech "The Guardian Global Cleantech 100"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliance==
A group of companies including EnOcean, [[Texas Instruments]], [[Omnio]], [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]], [[Masco]], and [[MK Electric]] formed the EnOcean Alliance in April 2008 as a non-profit, mutual benefit corporation. The EnOcean Alliance aims to internationalise this technology, and is dedicated to creating interoperability between the products of OEM partners, in order to bring about the existence of a broad range of interoperable wireless monitoring and controlling products for use in and around residential,
commercial and industrial buildings. For this the EnOcean Alliance has drawn up the
application level protocols are referred to as EEPs (EnOcean Equipment Profiles). Together
with the three lower levels of the international wireless standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 the
Alliance lay the foundation for a fully interoperable, open wireless technology. More than 250
companies currently belong to the EnOcean Alliance. The headquarters of the organization is
in San Ramon, California.

Market research company WTRS estimated that EnOcean module shipments might reach $1.4B in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EnOcean Module Shipments of Wireless Sensors to Reach $1.4 billion in 2013, Says WTRS |url=http://www.wtrs.net/pressrelease_070908.htm |accessdate=9 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502122752/http://www.wtrs.net/pressrelease_070908.htm |archivedate=2 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software automation==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32102">[[File:Alte Fabrik Finkemeier 002.jpg|thumb|Tires are an example of products subject to extended producer responsibility in many industrialized countries.]]
In the field of [[waste management]], '''extended producer responsibility''' ('''EPR''') is a strategy designed to promote the integration of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{OECD (2001). ''Extended Producer Responsibility: A Guidance Manual for Governments''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives as it
"focuses on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael R.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Ian P.|date=2014-10-01|title=Product recovery decisions within the context of Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923474813000817|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|series=Engineering and Technology Management for Sustainable Business Development|volume=34|pages=9–28|doi=10.1016/j.jengtecman.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by [[Thomas Lindhqvist]] in a 1990 report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist &amp; Karl Lidgren, "Models for Extended Producer Responsibility," in Sweden, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry, the following definition emerged: "[EPR] is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product, by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life-cycle of the product and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist, "Towards an [EPR]- analysis of experiences and proposals," April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

EPR uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach, which differs from [[product stewardship]], which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Waste to Wealth|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain [[priority product]]s by requiring manufacturers internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based upon the principle that because producers (usually brand owners) have the greatest control over product design and marketing and these same companies have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|title=Producer Responsibility Recycling|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|accessdate=May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111452/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR may take the form of a reuse, buy-back, or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party, a so-called ''producer responsibility organization'' (PRO), which is paid by the producer for used-product management. In this way, EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry, obliging producers, importers and/or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensuring the safe handling of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hanisch, C. (2000). Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?. Environ Sci Technol, 34 (7), pp.170 A-175 A.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example for producer responsibility organizations are the member organizations of PRO EUROPE. PRO EUROPE s.p.r.l. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, is the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO EUROPE are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner.  In many countries, this is done through the [[Green Dot (symbol)|Green Dot]]  trademark of which PRO EUROPE is the general licensor. The Green Dot has evolved into a proven concept in many countries as implementation of Producer Responsibility. In twenty-five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of sales packaging.

==Take-back==

In response to all of the growing problem of excessive waste, several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products' useful life, or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials, or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take-back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all wastes are managed in a way that protects public health and the environment.
The goals of take-back laws are to
#encourage companies to design products for reuse, recyclability, and materials reduction;
#correcting market signals to the consumer by incorporating waste management costs into the product’s price;
#promoting innovation in recycling technology.&lt;ref&gt;James Sallzman, Sustainable Consumption and the Law, 27ENVTL. L. 1274 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
Take-back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to redesign their products to minimize waste management costs, by designing their products to contain safer materials (so they do not need to be managed separately) or designing products that are easier to recycle and reuse (so recycling becomes more profitable).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Roeder, Hazardous Waste: Advocacy Group Recommendations Promote Manufacturer Responsibility, DAILY ENV”T REP., March 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest take-back activity began in Europe, where government-sponsored take-back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on [[WEEE|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)]]. The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/96/EC of 27 January 2003 on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), 203 O.J. (l 37) 46&lt;/ref&gt; These take-back programs have been now adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States, most of these policies have been implemented at the state level, due to the political impasse at the federal level.

== Plastic bags ==

Recycling, banning, and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/24472/epr.pdf|title=Extended Producer Responsibility An examination of its impact on innovation and greening products|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, under the Clinton presidency, the President's Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/EPR.html|title=Proceedings - Extended Product Responsibility|website=clinton2.nara.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can, however, make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market, which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toffel|first=Michael W.|last2=Stein|first2=Antoinette|last3=Lee|first3=Katharine L.|date=2008-01-01|title=Extending Producer Responsibility: An Evaluation Framework for Product Take-Back Policies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hbs/wpaper/09-026.html|publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is banning or taxation of plastic bags, which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States, EPR has not successfully been made mandatory, instead being voluntary.  What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation, producer responsibility, and recycling to combat pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160624090252/https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 24, 2016|title=Public Policy Approaches for the Reduction of Plastic Bag Marine Debris|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics==

Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of [[electronic waste|e-waste]] — used electronics contain materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In 2007, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, people threw away 2.5 million tons of cell phones, TVs, computers, and printers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reagan|first=Robert|date=March 15, 2015|title=A COMPARISON OF E-WASTE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CHINA|url=|journal=Vermont Journal of Environmental Law|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturer Takeback Programs|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronics/manufacturer-takeback-programs/|publisher=Electronics Takeback Coalition|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that local and manufacturer-supported extended producer responsibility laws give manufacturers greater responsibility for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of their own products.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;

The kinds of chemicals found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in the bulbs in flat screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system.  Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer.  Poorer countries are dumping grounds for the United States' e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, 25 states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/wp-content/uploads/Lessons-Learned-from-State-E-waste-laws.pdf|title=Ten Lessons Learned from State E-Waste Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronics TakeBack Coalition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e-waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.productstewardship.us/page/State_EPR_Laws_Map|title=Map of State EPR Laws|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Product Stewardship Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Essentially, these EPR programs have included some driver for increased collection of e-waste, and that is why these states have seen a greater impact on proper e-waste disposal than others. 

Advocates for EPR also argue that including "high expectations for performance" into the laws, and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements, contribute to making the laws successful. In this way, manufacturers can be incentivized to collect more and dispose of e-waste more properly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the larger the scope of products that can be collected, the more e-waste will be disposed of properly.

Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|European Union]] has taken steps to combat the issue of electronic waste management. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/e-waste1.htm|title=How E-waste Works|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|date=|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese laws regarding e-waste are similar to the ones in the EU, but they focus on banning the import of e-waste. This has proven to be difficult, however, because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-million-tons-illegal-e-waste-smuggled-china-each-year-180949930/|title=Eight Million Tons of Illegal E-Waste is Smuggled into China Each Year|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|date=February 28, 2014|website=Smithsonian|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to dispose of e-waste in [[Electronic waste in China|China]] today, a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution.

When producers either face a financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, they may be incentivized to design more sustainable, less [[electronic waste|toxic]], and easily recyclable electronics.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806123116/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070812124841/http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers' end-of-life costs.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epr"&gt;http://www.eprworkinggroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended producer responsibility is often cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash|first=Bhavani|title=The Light Bulb Conspiracy: The Story of Planned Obsolescence|url=http://www.ecowalkthetalk.com/blog/2011/08/26/the-light-bulb-conspiracy-the-story-of-planned-obsolescence/|publisher=Eco Walk the Talk|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annie Leonard interview &amp; "Story of Electronics" release|url=http://www.nourishthespirit.com/annie-leonard-interview-story-of-electronics-release/|publisher=Nourish the Spirit|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one way to fight [[planned obsolescence]], because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer.

===Disadvantages===
Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle, such as [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium-ion polymer batteries]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility, it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value, such as with CRT televisions, which can contain up to five pounds of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do CRT monitors contain lead?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question678.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; 

Other critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera|first=Ray|title=Mayor Calls Electronics Recycling Bill 'Illegal'|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/mayor-says-hell-ignore-veto-on-electronic-recycling/#comment-39647|work=City Room|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market, by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally-friendly designs because "manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material-use per unit of output, reduced energy use in making and delivering each product, and improved environmental performance."&lt;ref&gt;Gattuso, Dana, and Joel Schwartz. "Extended Producer Responsibility." Reason Foundation. Reason Foundation, 1 June 2002. Web. 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reason Foundation]] argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling, but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials, so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/studies/show/extended-producer-responsibili|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|last=Schwartz|first=Joel|date=June 1, 2002|website=Reason Foundation|publisher=The Reason Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

EPR has been implemented in many forms, which may be classified into three major approaches:
* Mandatory
* Negotiated
* Voluntary

It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers' preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries ("on-site" or "direct" allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale, most existing schemes for [[corporate sustainability]] reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company, and not supply-chain impacts&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council on Sustainable Development an World Resources Institute (2001). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Conches-Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this world view, "upstream and downstream [environmental] impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors' spheres of influence are not reflected".&lt;ref&gt;Spangenberg, J. H. and S. Lorek (2002). Environmentally sustainable household consumption: from aggregate environmental pressures to priority fields of action. Ecological Economics, 43, pp. 127-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence, especially in the industrialised world, are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer-focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption-related aspects, demand-side measures to environmental problems are rarely exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, T. (1999). Consumption and environment: some conceptual issues. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;Munksgaard, J. and K. A. Pedersen (2001). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accounts for open economies: producer or consumer responsibility. Energy Policy, 29, pp. 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Environmental Protection Agency (1998). Denmark's Second National Communication on Climate Change submitted under the UN FCCC. [http://www.mst.dk Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, at the company level, "when adopting the concept of eco-efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO 14001, it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company".&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. and L. Karlson (2002). Business incentives for sustainability: a property rights approach. Ecological Economics, 40, pp. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 "Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life-cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start."&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. (2005) Environmental Strategies in Industry: Turning Business Incentives into Sustainability. Report 5455. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; A life-cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks: "Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility (physical and/or financial) not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product, but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products."&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2001, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; "The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they were facing severe landfill shortages. [... As a result,] EPR is generally applied to post-consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management."&lt;ref&gt;Environment Protection Authority New South Wales 2003, p. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover, applying conventional [[life cycle assessment]], and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to [[Double counting (accounting)|double-counting]]. Using [[input-output analysis]], researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers' supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gallego, B. and M. Lenzen (2005). A consistent input-output formulation of shared producer and consumer responsibility. Economic Systems Research, 17(4), pp. 365-391.&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain – producers and consumers.

==Examples==

Auto Recycling Nederland (ARN) is a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) that organises vehicle recycling in the [[Netherlands]]. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union's [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]].

The Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology (SWICO), an ICT industry organisation, became a PRO to address the problem of [[electronic waste]].

The Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (CAP-EPR) was adopted in Canada in 2009 under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP-EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts, Canada fell short of many other [[Group of Eight|G8]] and [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/current_priorities/waste/pn_1499_epr_cap_e.pdf|title=Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=October 2009|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the CAP-EPR’s 2009 inception, most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. “Nine out of ten provinces have [since implemented] EPR programs or [put] requirements in place… As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones, almost half of the product categories for Phase 1 are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/extended/CAP-EPR%20Progress%20Report.pdf|title=Progress Report on the Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extender Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

In Germany, since the adoption of EPR, "between 1991 and 1998, the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from 94.7 kg to 82 kg, resulting in a reduction of 13.4%".&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"&gt;Hanisch, Carola. "Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?" Environmental Science &amp; Technology 34.7 (2000): 170A-75A. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to Germany's influence in EPR, the "European Commission developed one waste directive" for all of member states (Hanisch 2000). One major goal was to have all member states recycle "25% of all packaging material"&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"/&gt; and have accomplished the goal.

In the United States, EPR is gaining popularity "with 40 such laws enacted since 2008. In 2010 alone, 38 such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States, and 12 were signed into law."&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. "Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States." ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' 17.2 (2013): 175-85. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these laws are only at the state level as there are no federal laws for EPR. So far, "only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as 32 states having at least one EPR law".&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4728">Throughout history, there were a number of political '''factions within the RSDLP''' ([[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]), in addition to the major split of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]].

* '''[[Bolsheviks]]''' formed in 1903 from the major split in the RSDLP which also produced the Mensheviks.  This faction followed [[Vladimir Lenin]], and organized a separate party, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, aka Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) in 1912.  After the [[October Revolution]], it became the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
*'''[[Borba (Paris)|Borba]]''', an expatriate group based in Paris
* '''[[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Labour Bund]]''' had an autonomous statute inside the RDSLP between the [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|first congress]] in [[Minsk]] in March 1898 and the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|second congress]] in [[Brussels]] and [[London]] in August 1903, and again from the [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Fourth (Unification) Congress]] in [[Stockholm]] in April 1906.&lt;ref name=Angel&gt;Angel Smith, [[Stefan Berger]], "Nationalism, labour and ethnicity 1870-1939", Manchester University Press ND, 1999, pg. 150, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2GO7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=The+Bund+Menshevik&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Bund%20Menshevik&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Liquidators''' ('''Liquidationists''') were a faction of the Mensheviks who left in 1905 (plus their ideological compatriots who remained), maintaining that with the availability of legal participation in political life, the  underground revolutionary party must be liquidated.
* '''[[Mensheviks]]''' formed from the 1903 split with the Bolsheviks, under the leadership of [[Julius Martov]].  With the formal severing of ties in 1912, the Mensheviks used the name Russian Social Democratic Party (Mensheviks), or sometimes without the qualifier.  At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the majority supporting the war ("Defencists") maintained control of the RSDLP(M) under [[Fyodor Dan]] and others, while those opposed to the war left as the Menshevik Internationalists under Martov .
* '''Menshevik Internationalists''' were the faction who opposed involvement of Russian socialists in the war effort, who split from the Mensheviks in 1914 under that faction's founder, Martov.  It eventually merged with Mezhraiontsy, which later merged with the Bolsheviks.
* '''[[Mezhraiontsy]]''' formed in 1913 to attempt bridging the divide between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, but eventually merged in 1917 with the Bolsheviks.
* '''Otzovists''' (or '''Recallists''') were a group of radical [[Bolsheviks]] who demanded to cease all participation of the RSDLP in legal state establishments, in particular, to recall the RSDLP representatives from the  [[State Duma (Imperial)|State Duma]], hence the name ("to recall" is ''otozvat'' in Russian). Among the prominent Otzovists were [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky (politician)|Mikhail Pokrovsky]], [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], and [[Andrei Bubnov]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;James D. White, "The First Pravda and the Russian Marxist Tradition", [[Soviet Studies]], Vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 1974), pp. 181-204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cliff&gt;Tony Cliff, "Building the Party: Lenin 1893-1914", 2002, {{ISBN|1-931859-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates among Bolsheviks whether to boycott the new constituency of the [[State Duma (Imperial)|Russian parliament]] known as the [[Third Duma]] started after the defeat of the revolution in mid-1907 and the adoption of a new, highly restrictive election law.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; This faction subsequently organised itself in the [[Vpered]] group.
* '''Ultimatists''' were a radical faction of Bolsheviks which demanded that an ultimatum must be sent to Bolshevik deputies of Duma demanding them to be uncompromisingly radical. While [[Vladimir Lenin]] sided with them twice (according to [[Julius Martov]]'s ''History''), he eventually denounced them, dubbing them "liquidators inside out".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Souvarine, "Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism", 2005, {{ISBN|1-4191-1307-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5F9eL9C2QzEC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=ultimatists&amp;lr= p. 119]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimatists controlled the [[St. Petersburg]] Bolshevik organization until September 1909.&lt;ref name=cliff/&gt;
* '''[[Yedinstvo]]''' (or '''Plekhanovites''') were associates and followers of [[Georgi Plekhanov]].
* '''[[Yuzhny Rabochy]]''', opposed to the Iskra programme of building a centralised party.

A '''referendum on the new [[constitution of France]]''' was held in [[French Sudan]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] held across the [[French Union]]. The new constitution would see the country become part of the new [[French Community]] if accepted, or result in independence if rejected. It was approved by 97.54% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fr011958 Frankreich, 28. September 1958 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gaza flotilla raid''' was a military operation by Israel against [[Ships of Gaza flotilla raid|six civilian ships]] of the "[[Gaza Freedom Flotilla]]" on 31 May 2010 in [[international waters]] in the Mediterranean Sea. Nine activists were killed on one ship during the raid and ten Israeli soldiers were wounded, one seriously. One Turkish activist died later of his wounds.

On 22 March 2013 Netanyahu apologised for the incident in a 30-minute telephone call with Erdoğan, stating that the results were unintended; the Turkish prime minister accepted apology and agreed to enter into discussions to resolve the compensation issue.&lt;ref name="bbc220313"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN220313" /&gt; Following the telephone apology, Israel's [[Channel 10 (Israel)|Channel 10]] television channel reported that compensation talks had commenced; however, a disparity became immediately apparent, as Turkey sought $1 million for each of the flotilla deaths, while Israel response was $100,000. As of 27 March 2013, an agreement was made between the two nations in regard to three points: 1. Compensation will only be paid to the family members of the people killed aboard the Marmara; 2. Confirmation of a signed commitment from Turkey, whereby Turkey will be unable to sue Israel over the incident; 3. The Turkish government will return the monetary compensation to Israel in the event that civilian lawsuits are ever filed by Turkish citizens; a meeting was also planned for the discussion of future relations between Turkey and Israel.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;{{cite news |title=Compensation Agreement with Turkey 'Close'|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/166607#.UVShnxyG0j4|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Arutz Sheva|date=27 March 2013|author=Gil Ronen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chana"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkish Price Tag: $1 Million Per Mavi Marmara Death|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/166604#.UVVIWasY0uo|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Arutz Sheva|date=27 March 2013|author=Chana Ya'ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few minutes after 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, [[Sa'ar 5-class corvette]]s [[INS Lahav|INS ''Lahav'']] and [[INS Hanit|INS ''Hanit'']], and the [[Sa'ar 4-class missile boat]] INS ''Nitzachon'' left [[Haifa]] naval base to intercept the flotilla. The three warships had speedboats, [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters, and 71 [[Shayetet 13]] commandos on board. The [[Israeli Navy]] made initial contact with the flotilla at 11&amp;nbsp;p.m. (2000 UTC) on 30 May, about {{convert|120|mi|km}} northwest of Gaza, {{convert|80|mi|km}} off the coast of southern [[Lebanon]], in [[international waters]], ordering the ships to follow them to port or otherwise be boarded.&lt;ref name="bbc-faq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=176955 |title=Gaza flotilla changes course |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=31 May 2010|date=31 May 2010|author=Yaakov Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz-israel tows"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel tows Gaza aid ships to Ashdod after 10 activists killed in clashes with navy|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-tows-gaza-aid-ships-to-ashdod-after-10-activists-killed-in-clashes-with-navy-1.293089|date=31 May 2010|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shayetet 13 commandos who participated in the operation underwent a month of training prior to the operation, including dummy takeovers of a ship at sea with fifty soldiers performing the role of activists. The Israeli Navy said that the soldiers were trained for "a [[Bil'in]]-type opposition".&lt;ref name="Harel-2010"/&gt; [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], a veteran Israeli correspondent aboard the Israeli missile boat ''INS Nitzachon'', reported that the assessment was that the passengers would show "light resistance and possibly minor violence".

They were instructed to use their sidearms only in an emergency, when their lives were at risk.&lt;ref name="Katz they came"/&gt;{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=14}}

Ahead of the operation, the soldiers were briefed by Vice-Admiral [[Eli Marom]], the commander of the Israeli Navy. Marom stated that the IDF had no intention of harming any flotilla passengers and would act professionally. He also warned soldiers that the passengers could provoke them in ways such as throwing cigarettes, spitting, and cursing, but, "we do not respond to these types of actions. We act as professional soldiers do".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|yphfyN0dqi8|Israeli Navy Commander Vice Admiral Eliezer Marom Briefs Forces Set to Intercept Gaza Flotilla}}&amp;nbsp;– [[IDF Spokesperson's Unit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli Navy radioed Tural Mahmut, the captain of the ''Mavi Marmara'', sending him this message: "Mavi Marmara, you are approaching an area of hostilities, which is under a naval blockade. The Gaza coastal area and Gaza Harbour are closed to all maritime traffic. The Israeli government supports delivery of humanitarian supplies to the civilian population in Gaza Strip and invites you to enter [[Ashdod]] port. Delivery of supplies will be in accordance with the authorities' regulations and through the formal land crossing to Gaza and under your observation, after which you can return to your home ports aboard the vessels on which you arrived." The reply was: "Negative, negative. Our destination is Gaza." Shortly after, three Israeli warships began shadowing the flotilla. Two warships flanked the flotilla on either side, but at a distance. An Israeli aircraft also flew overhead.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt;

Five days after the raid, IDF released an audio recording purporting to be of a radio exchange between the Israeli Navy and the flotilla. After Israeli warnings that the ships were approaching a [[naval blockade|blockade]], voices responded "Go back to [[Auschwitz]]!" and "Don't forget [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://idfspokesperson.com/2010/06/05/clarificationcorrection-regarding-audio-transmission-between-israeli-navy-and-flotilla-on-31-may-2010-posted-on-5-june-2010/ Clarification/Correction Regarding Audio Transmission Between Israeli Navy and Flotilla on 31 May 2010, Posted on 5 June 2010] &lt;br&gt; {{YouTube|9dE2StbDL_Q|The full audio recording}}, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] YouTube channel.&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Healey, the captain of ''Challenger&amp;nbsp;I'', and activist [[Huwaida Arraf]] who was on the bridge of the ship, disputed the authenticity of the recording.

Hours before the raid, the head of the İHH, [[Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım]], declared, "We're going to defeat the Israeli commandos–we're declaring it now. If you bring your soldiers here, we will throw you off the ship and you'll be humiliated in front of the whole world." Later, according to the crew, a group of about 40 İHH activists took over the ship.&lt;ref name="DeathInTheMed"/&gt;

The [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] (ITIC), an Israeli non-governmental organization that, according to ''[[Haaretz]]'', is "widely seen as an unofficial branch of Israel's intelligence community",&lt;ref name="h20100531"/&gt; said that, based on laptop files and passenger testimony, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had prior knowledge that the activists on the flotilla would use violence. In addition, the ITIC said a group of 40 "militant" activists boarded before the rest of the passengers, were not searched as they boarded, and that [[İHH (İnsani Yardım Vakfı)|İHH]] President [[Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım]] had briefed this group with a mission of keeping Israelis from taking control of the ship.&lt;ref name="h20100531"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfeffer |first=Anshel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/probe-erdogan-knew-gaza-flotilla-would-be-violent-1.295144 |title=Probe: Erdogan knew Gaza flotilla would be violent|work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Abraham Rabinovich, Jerusalem |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/israel-points-finger-at-turkish-pm/story-e6frg6so-1225878143687 |title=Israel points finger at Turkish PM |work=The Australian |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDF identified a group of some 50 men who were responsible for attacking IDF soldiers. The members of this group were not carrying identity cards or passports, but each carried an envelope with some $10,000 in cash. The Israeli defense establishment suspected that the funding may have come from elements in the Turkish government. One member of the group, who was identified as its ringleader, travelled to [[Bursa]] to recruit members. The members were stationed in groups throughout the ship, mostly on the upper deck, and communicated with each other via walkie-talkies. The members were well-trained and equipped with gas masks and bulletproof vests.&lt;ref name="mercenaries"&gt;{{cite news |last=Efune |first=Dovid |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=177452 |title=IDF: Mercenaries to blame for violence |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boarding of the ''[[MV Mavi Marmara|Mavi Marmara]]'' started in the early morning at 4:30&amp;nbsp;[[Israel Standard Time|IST]]. The operation began with an attempt to board the ship from speedboats. As the boats approached, activists fired water hoses at them, and pelted them with a variety of objects. The Israelis replied with paintballs and stun grenades. One stun grenade was picked up and tossed back into a boat. When the commandos tried boarding the ship, activists cut the ladders with electric disc saws. The boats then turned slightly away from the ship, but remained close.&lt;ref name="DeathInTheMed"/&gt;{{Sfn|IDF timeline part 1|2010|loc=5:57–6:19}}

Three Israeli commandos were captured. The first captured soldier, the commanding officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier was surrounded by a team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued.&lt;ref name="Raved-2010"/&gt; The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off with his back to the hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, and dragged him into the lounge.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=21}} The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=20}} Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|pp=3, 7 (see footnote), 20}} Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"/&gt;

Israel and the flotilla activists disagreed over whether guns seized from the captive soldiers were used by the activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2011/death_in_med.pdf |title=Finding of the Editorial Standards Committee of the BBC Trust&amp;nbsp;– Panorama:Death in the Med |page=48}}. Ken O'Keefe, one of the activists, said "What I do know for sure is that I had one of their guns.... And if I wanted to use that gun I could easily have used it.... But I didn't do that and I did not see anybody from IHH use a weapon. If we wanted to we could have used weapons and killed some of their soldiers. That is a fact."&lt;/ref&gt; Commandos reported that at least two of the captive soldiers had their sidearms wrested away, and that there was live fire against them at a later stage.&lt;ref name="cnn israeli version"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Israeli military gives version of flotilla incident|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/05/31/gaza.flotilla.israeli.raid/|publisher=CNN | date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=31 May 2010 |title=IDF chief: No connection between Gaza sail and peace efforts |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3896684,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israelis saw flotilla as political provocation that had to be stopped"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0601/1224271581953.html |title=Israelis saw flotilla as political provocation that had to be stopped |work=The Irish Times | date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IDF, activists also used firearms that they brought along with them, as investigators found bullet casings not matching IDF-issued guns. The IDF reported that the second soldier to descend from the first helicopter was shot in the stomach,{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=8}} and another soldier was shot in the knee. IDF Chief of Staff [[Gabi Ashkenazi]] said that activists also seized three stun grenades from soldiers.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazi Bullets"&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams|first=Dan|agency=Reuters |title=Israelis Fired 308 Bullets Aboard Gaza Ship|date=24 October 2010|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/24/us-israel-flotilla-general-idUSTRE69N0Q320101024|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the third soldier was thrown from the roof, the commandos requested and received permission to use live fire.&lt;ref name="Raved-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brutal ambush"/&gt; The soldiers then opened fire with pistols, and activists dispersed to the front and back of the roof after taking casualties. An IDF medical officer on board located a secure spot, and oversaw treatment of injured soldiers. A second helicopter carrying 12 soldiers arrived over the ship. As the helicopter approached, activists attacked the IDF commandos, who repulsed them with gunshots aimed at their legs. At the same time, the speedboats trailing the ship approached again. They were met with a barrage of objects, including iron balls from slingshots, and allegedly with a burst of gunfire, forcing the boats to pull back again.{{Sfn|IDF timeline part 1|2010|loc=7:48–8:39 (end)}}{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=5}}

Soldiers from the second helicopter successfully slid down and moved to gain control of the front of the roof and secure the lower decks. Passengers attacked them, and were dispersed with shots fired towards their legs. The first attempt to secure the lower decks was met with violent resistance, allegedly including live fire. Shortly afterward, a third helicopter arrived, carrying 14 soldiers. They successfully abseiled onto the ship, and the commander from the third helicopter met up with the commander from the second helicopter, after which the forces began moving towards the ship's bridge. They were attacked twice by activists, and responded with gunfire. The commandos reached the bridge after thirty minutes, and took command. Upon orders from the soldiers, the captain instructed all activists to enter their cabins. At this stage, most of the activists assembled on the sides of the ship retreated into the hull. The speedboats approached for a third time, and most of the remaining activists again hurled objects at the boats. Soldiers inside the boats then opened fire, taking careful aim to hit the resisting passengers and forcing the activists to disperse, enabling the soldiers to board from ladders. The soldiers were met with resistance, and responded with live fire. They managed to fight their way to the roof, where they met up with the rest of the force.&lt;ref name="DeathInTheMed"/&gt;{{Sfn|IDF timeline part 2|2010|loc=0:00–2:21}} An assessment was made, and three soldiers were found to be missing. A force was prepared to rush the passenger halls and locate the soldiers. According to the IDF, soldiers spotted activists escorting the three captive soldiers onto the deck. One of the captive soldiers said that the activist guarding him waved to one of the IDF naval vessels to show that they were holding Israeli soldiers. At that point, he elbowed the activist in the ribs and jumped into the water, although the guard tried to hold him back. A second soldier also jumped into the water, while the third remained unconscious on the deck. IDF soldiers dispersed the activists with [[non-lethal weapon]]s, and rescued the unconscious soldier, while the two soldiers in the water were picked up by the speedboats.{{Sfn|IDF timeline part 2|2010|loc=2:22–3:04}}&lt;ref name="brutal ambush"/&gt;{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|p=16}} According to some accounts by activists and journalists, the captive soldiers were released after negotiations mediated by [[Haneen Zoabi]], in which the IDF agreed to airlift the wounded in exchange for their release.&lt;ref name="Harel-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nahmias |first=Roee |date=9 June 2010 |title=Egyptian lawmaker slammed for speaking of beaten troops |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3902389,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5saXLRgBL?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3902389,00.html |archivedate=8 September 2010 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news |date=7 June 2010 |author=Ynet and agencies |title=Soldiers thought we would kill them |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3900842,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 June 2011 }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{Cite news |author=Yara Bayoumy |date=3 June 2010 |title=Israeli marines were held during ship raid-witness: Soldiers freed after Israel agreed to airlift wounded |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6521UG |agency=Reuters |accessdate=5 June 2010 }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/gaza-flotilla-captain-activists-prepared-attack-against-idf-raid-1.295591 |title=Gaza flotilla captain: Activists prepared attack against IDF raid. |work=Haaretz |date=11 June 2010 |archivedate=29 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sLdoSPRh?url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-navy-commandos-gaza-flotilla-activists-tried-to-lynch-us-1.293089 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera-20100603"/&gt;
The passengers were taken one-by-one from their cabins and searched on deck. Some were handcuffed and forced to kneel for hours. Women, elderly men, and western nationals were temporarily handcuffed or uncuffed shortly afterward and allowed to sit on benches. During the course of the journey to Ashdod port, passengers were brought inside and allowed to sit down. According to the UNHRC fact-finding mission, passengers were subject to various forms of abuse.{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|pp=27, 31, 37}}
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Combat Gear Found Aboard the Mavi Marmara.jpg|thumb|Bulletproof vests found on the deck of the Marmara.]]
IDF Lieutenant-General [[Gabi Ashkenazi]] testified to Israel's Turkel Commission that the IDF had fired 308 live rounds and about 350 [[bean bag]] rounds and paintballs. An aide to the general said that 70 of these shots were aimed to cause injury, while the others would have been warning shots. IDF Major-General [[Giora Eiland]] said that the IDF had found evidence of four instances of soldiers coming under fire from activists, and that in at least one case, the fire came from weapons that were not stolen from commandos.&lt;ref name="DeathInTheMed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brutal ambush"/&gt;

===''Sfendoni'' boarding===
The operation to take the ''Sfendoni'' took place at the same time as the boarding of the ''Mavi Marmara''. The ''Sfendoni'' attempted to evade Israeli naval vessels. According to one soldier, the ship attempted to run down his vessel, and chased it after it evaded, but the IDF vessel made a sharp turn and positioned itself behind it.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|pp=11–12}} Speedboats approached the ship, and soldiers climbed onto the ship from ladders after firing plastic bullets, paintballs, and stun grenades. Some soldiers were shoved down a ladder onto the lower deck, where a group of passengers scuffled with soldiers, and an attempt was made to take a soldiers' weapon.{{Sfn|Meir Amit report|2010|pp=11–12}} Once on board, the soldiers advanced towards the bridge. A number of activists formed a human chain to block them, and the Israelis responded with electric shocks.{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|p=33}}

Retired diplomat [[Edward Peck (American diplomat)|Edward Peck]], who was on board the ''Sfendoni'', said that the commandos were well-trained, and behaved reasonably well. When two soldiers entered the bridge, an activist grabbed the wheel tightly and protested that the boat was in international waters. A scuffle then ensued between soldiers and a few activists. The soldiers used physical force, electric shocks, and stun grenades to gain control, but there were no major injuries.{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|p=33}}&lt;ref name="ArrafWP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvxs-sfentoni-raid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvxs.gr/node/59618|title=Αποκλειστικά στο tvxs ντοκουμέντο από την επίθεση στη Σφενδόνη (Video document of the raid at Sfendoni ship)|publisher=tvxs.gr|accessdate=6 June 2010}} [http://vimeo.com/12285010 Direct link to the video.] (Greek)&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Larudee, a 64-year-old former linguistics professor from El Cerrito, California, on board the ''Sfendoni'', was beaten and [[taser|tased]] according to his family, who said that Israeli consular officials informed them that Larudee, a pacifist, was beaten after refusing to follow the orders of troops.&lt;ref name="Lar1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Parks | first = Richard | title = El Cerrito Man Beaten, Jailed in Israel, Wife Says | work = The Bay Citizen | accessdate = 2 June 2010 | date = 2 June 2010 | url = http://www.baycitizen.org/international/story/el-cerrito-man-beaten-jailed-israel-wife/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100603205731/http://www.baycitizen.org/international/story/el-cerrito-man-beaten-jailed-israel-wife/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lar2"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Berton | first = Justin | title = 4 local pro-Palestine activists reported safe | work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2 June 2010 | date = 2 June 2010 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/02/MNBU1DO3AA.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the boat was under Israeli control, activists were made to sit down and restrained with plastic ties. One man who complained that the plastic ties were too tight had them removed, then ran and jumped overboard, and was picked up by another boat. Passengers were searched one-by-one and then taken to the main salon. They were allowed to prepare food, but refused to eat until an IDF cameraman ceased filming them.{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010|p=33}}

Israel reported that seven soldiers were injured in the clash. Four soldiers were moderately wounded, of which two were initially in critical condition, and an additional three soldiers were lightly wounded. Two of the injured soldiers sustained gunshot wounds. One was shot in the knee, in addition to three fractures and a crack in the hand, a deep cut in the left ear, a stab wound to the chest, internal bleeding, and cuts. The other one was shot in the abdomen. The remaining soldiers sustained varying injuries from beatings and stabbing.

Two of the injured soldiers who were rescued after jumping overboard were taken to Israel by sea, while the rest were treated by IDF medical personnel aboard the ''Mavi Marmara'' and airlifted to Israel by helicopter. The Israeli commandos wounded in the raid were taken to [[Rambam Health Care Campus|Rambam Hospital]] in [[Haifa]], where some required surgery. While in hospital, the soldiers were visited by hundreds of people, including military officials and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambam.org.il Rambam is treating the commando soldiers injured in the flotilla incident]&amp;nbsp;– Rambam Hospital&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 2011, it was reported that three commandos who sustained moderate and serious injuries had still not been recognized as disabled veterans and granted state benefits. The Ministry of Defense demanded that additional proof of injury be produced, though its rehabilitation wing had already made a preliminary decision to grant them disability status. The commandos filed a lawsuit against the Defense Ministry, and hired private attorneys. A source close to the proceedings told ''[[Ynet]]'' that the soldiers were supposed to have received their benefits three or four months after the proceedings began, especially with the photographs and video footage that documented the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zitun |first=Yoav |date=25 December 2011 |title=Soldiers hurt in flotilla raid yet to get benefits |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4166524,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli military said that in addition to medical aid and construction materials, they found knives, clubs, slingshots, bulletproof vests, gas masks, and night vision goggles aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''.&lt;ref name="wheelchair"/&gt; A statement released by Foreign Affairs Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] stated that violence against the soldiers was pre-planned, and that "light weaponry" was found on the ships, including pistols that had been seized from IDF commandos.

The IDF released nearly 20 videos of the incident. Both sides were described as lacking context and confusing the issue of who initiated hostilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/world/middleeast/02media.html |title=After Raid, Videos Carry on the Fight |work=The New York Times |date= 1 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos were taken from Israeli naval vessels and helicopters using night-vision technology.

The IDF also showed confiscated footage from the ship's surveillance cameras, which purportedly showed activists preparing for a clash hours before the Israeli Navy made contact with the ship.&lt;ref name="IsraeliVideo" /&gt;

Don't use violence, we need help."

===Detention of activists===
Following the boardings, Israeli naval forces towed the flotilla's vessels to Ashdod, from where the activists were taken into custody by authorities, pending deportation.&lt;ref name="bbc-deaths as"/&gt;

Some 629 activists were detained by the [[Israel Prison Service]], after they refused to sign deportation orders. A Turkish mother who had brought her one-year-old child with her agreed to extradition after she was advised that prison conditions were "too harsh" for her baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web &lt;!-- title revised from Israel detains dozens of Gaza flotilla activists upon arrival in Ashdod, original url was http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-detains-dozens-of-gaza-flotilla-activists-upon-arrival-in-ashdod-1.293339 --&gt; |last1=Kyzer |first1=Liel |last2=Yair |first2=Ettinger |date=31 May 2010 |title='The ship turned into a lake of blood,' says activist on Gaza flotilla |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/the-ship-turned-into-a-lake-of-blood-says-activist-on-gaza-flotilla-1.293339 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Micheál Martin]] described the arrests as "kidnapping" and questioned the logic of bringing the detainees to Israel only to deport them there, instead of giving them "unconditional release".&lt;ref name="Martin: Irish citizens 'kidnapped' in international waters"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/martin-irish-citizens-kidnapped-in-international-waters-459870.html |title=Martin: Irish citizens 'kidnapped' in international waters |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel planned to prosecute two dozen activists, charging they had assaulted its troops.

A group of thirteen female activists attacked Immigration Authority personnel accompanying them to the airport for deportation. The activists began to yell and curse while in the police bus taking them to the airport, cursing officers and Israel. When they arrived at the airport, two attacked an officer, trying to push, slap and scratch him while shouting "free Palestine" and "Israel is a terror state". The two were eventually restrained by several officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Branovsky |first=Yael |date=2 June 2010 |title=Flotilla passengers attack immigration officers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3898233,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to flotilla activist Fintan Lan Ken, an Irish-American passenger was beaten by security officials at the airport before boarding and had to be hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=Irish Times |title=Activists claim Israeli officials beat them |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0603/breaking16.html |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab [[Knesset]] Member [[Haneen Zoabi]] was released on 1 June. She attempted to address the Knesset, but was interrupted by other lawmakers, who told her to "go to Gaza, traitor." She received multiple death threats by phone and mail, and was placed under armed protection after nearly 500 people signed up to a Facebook page calling for her execution.&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; As a punitive measure for her involvement in the flotilla raid, the Knesset stripped her of five parliamentary privileges: the right to carry a diplomatic passport, the right to financial assistance for legal expenses, the right to visit countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations, the right to participate in Knesset discussions, and the right to vote in parliamentary committees. A Knesset committee recommended that her parliamentary immunity be revoked, but Knesset Speaker [[Reuven Rivlin]] blocked the recommendation from being voted on.

Four other [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] who participated in the flotilla were detained and later released on bail. On 3 June, the [[Ashkelon]] Magistrates' Court accepted an appeal for their release with bail, under the conditions that they remain under house arrest until 8 June, and do not leave the country for 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;Adalah, "[http://www.adalah.org/eng/pressreleases/pr.php?file=03_06_10 Magistrates' Court Orders Release of Detained Delegation of Arab Leaders from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla with Restrictive Conditions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902221606/http://www.adalah.org/eng/pressreleases/pr.php?file=03_06_10 |date=2 September 2010 }}", press release, 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli nationals who were on board were investigated on suspicion of attempting to enter the Gaza Strip unlawfully. None of them were suspected of assaulting Israeli soldiers. In September 2011, [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney-General]] [[Yehuda Weinstein]] ended the investigation.

A BBC investigation found that the aid consignment consisted of "thousands of tons" of aid, including large quantities of much needed building supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2011/death_in_med.pdf|title=Findings of the Editorial Standards Committee of the BBC Trust (Death in the Med), pg 109-110)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel said humanitarian aid confiscated from the ships would be transferred to Gaza, but that it would not transfer banned items such as cement.&lt;ref name="haaretz-at least" /&gt; At the same briefing, they said that they found construction equipment, including concrete and metal rods, that were not allowed into Gaza.

==Aftermath==

===The UN===
On 31 May 2010, Prime Minister Netanyahu asked President Obama to veto any [[UN Security Council]] condemnations of Israel, but the president refused to comply.&lt;ref name="may ease Gaza blockade"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Benn |first1=Aluf |last2=Mozgovaya |first2=Natasha |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/under-u-s-pressure-netanyahu-may-ease-gaza-siege-1.294038 |title=Under U.S. pressure, Netanyahu may ease Gaza blockade |date=3 June 2010 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the UN Security Council, the US subsequently blocked demands for an international inquiry into the raid and the criticism of Israel for allegedly violating international law, as proposed by Turkey, Palestine and Arab nations.&lt;ref name="investigation"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGreal |first=Chris |date=1 June 2010 |title=Israel should lead investigation into attack on Gaza flotilla, says US |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/01/israel-investigation-attack-gaza-flotilla-us |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a formal UN Panel of Inquiry was announced in August 2010. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon completed a two-month consultation with Turkey and Israel to convene the panel that was led by former Prime Minister of New Zealand Geoffrey Palmer (Chair) and the outgoing President of Colombia, [[Alvaro Uribe]] (Vice-Chair).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary-General Announces Launch of Panel of Inquiry on 31 May Flotilla Incident after Intensive Consultation with Leaders of Israel, Turkey|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/C1A79FDC099C8AC1852577730050D3A0|work=Department of Public Information (DPI)|publisher=UNISPAL|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=2 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200935/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/C1A79FDC099C8AC1852577730050D3A0|archivedate=2 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of the panel was then followed by Ban Ki-moon's announcement of the Turkish and Israeli representatives who had been appointed by the respective leaders of the two countries: [[Joseph Ciechanover]] was appointed by Netanyahu to be the Israeli representative was and Turkey's panel member was [[Özdem Sanberk]]. In regard to Ciechanover and Sanberk, the Secretary-General publicly stated, "Both men have distinguished records of public service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ban announces Israeli, Turkish members of inquiry panel into flotilla incident|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35561&amp;Cr=gaza&amp;Cr1=#.UVVY26sY0up|work=UN News Centre|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York, 7 August 2010 – Statement by the Secretary-General on the naming of the Israeli and Turkish members of the Panel of Inquiry on the flotilla incident of 31 May 2010|url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/?nid=4715|work=United Nations – Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the UN investigative committee said that the Israeli '''naval blockade''' of Gaza was legal,{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=45}} but that Israel used excessive force and should have waited to enforce the blockade closer to the shoreline. It also concluded that Turkey should have taken action to try to prevent the flotilla from taking place.{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=48}} In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used excessive force and boarded the flotilla when it was far away from the blockade zone.&lt;ref name="BBC-2011-09-01"&gt;{{cite news |date=1 September 2011 |title=Gaza ship raid excessive but blockade legal, says UN |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14757623 |work=BBC |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
On 2 June, Israel released over 600 of the detained activists.&lt;ref name="hsguardfi602"/&gt; On 4 June, the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] upheld a decision of attorney-general [[Yehuda Weinstein]] to halt the police investigation of the incident.&lt;ref name="Ihalt"/&gt; On 5 June, the Israeli government's press division apologized for circulating a link to the satiric "[[We Con the World]]" video that mocked activists on board, satirizing their purportedly peaceful intentions.

===Palestinian territories===
[[Palestinian Authority]] president, and [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation]] ([[Palestine Liberation Organisation|PLO]]) since 11 November 2004, [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said, "Israel has committed a massacre,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/abbas-israel-has-committed-a-massacre-on-the-gaza-flotilla-1.293186?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Abbas: Israel has committed a massacre on the Gaza flotilla|date=31 May 2010|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared a three-day [[state of mourning]]. Palestinian government official [[Mustafa Barghouti]] stated that Israel's actions would lead to the [[Economic and political boycotts of Israel|international boycott]] growing in strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3896805,00.html |title=Fatah official: Israel world's most despicable country – Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salam Fayyad]] said "Israel went beyond all that could be expected. / This [attack] is a transgression against all international covenants and norms and it must be confronted by all international forums."&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/05/20105316216182630.html |title=Outrage over Israeli attack – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Hamas officials cited the raid on a flotilla as evidence that there is "more to gain" from the international condemnation produced by Israel's use of force than by attacking Israel. Aziz Dweik, "a leading Hamas lawmaker in the West Bank", said "When we use violence, we help Israel win international support. The Gaza flotilla has done more for Gaza than 10,000 rockets."&lt;ref name="wsjjuly2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levinson |first=Charles |date=2 July 2010 |title=Israel's Foes Embrace New Resistance Tactics |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704638504575318390063707222 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Egypt opened its [[Rafah Border Crossing]] with the Gaza Strip to allow humanitarian and medical aid to enter following international criticism of the raid and a call for the border to be opened by Hamas's leader [[Khaled Meshaal]]. It is not clear how long it will remain open. According to an Egyptian security source, construction materials such as concrete and steel are still required to be transported via Israel's border crossings.&lt;ref name="Macdonald-2010"/&gt;

===Turkey===
On 4 June 2010, a Turkish state-run news agency reported a possible trial against Israel in which a Turkish autopsy report would be used as evidence. On 29 June the İHH said that the attack on the flotilla was planned.{{sfn|IHH Summary Report|2010|p=38}} Lawyers representing the IHH wrote to [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], prosecutor at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) asking to prosecute the Israelis involved. Although Israel is not a member of the ICC, the lawyer said the ''Mavi Marmara'' was sailing under flag of the [[Comoros]] and many Turks were on board, and both these countries were signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hirsch |first=Afua |date=8 October 2010 |title=Gaza flotilla attack: calls for international criminal court to step in |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/08/israel-aid-flotilla-raid-calls |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=1 July 2011 |quote=.

Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper ''[[Hürriyet]]'' that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained in the ''Hürriyet'' interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit, "We will monitor the situation to see if the promises are kept or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel 'agrees' to Gaza easing|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/israel-agrees-to-gaza-easing/story-e6frg6so-1226607972165|accessdate=28 March 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=28 March 2013|author=John Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only consider exploring the removal of the Gaza blockade if peace ("quiet") is achieved in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel flotilla apology 'did not include promise to lift Gaza siege'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/9950999/Israel-flotilla-apology-did-not-include-promise-to-lift-Gaza-siege.html|accessdate=28 March 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=24 March 2013|author=Robert Tait|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel–Turkey diplomatic crisis====
[[Israel–Turkey relations]] reached a low point after the incident. Turkey recalled its ambassador, cancelled joint military exercises, and called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] harshly referred to the raid as a "bloody massacre" and "state terrorism", and harshly criticized Israel in a speech before the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]].&lt;ref group="text" name="Tagesschau Erdogan"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wurzel |first=Steffen |publisher=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]] |title=Ab heute ist nichts mehr, wie es war |trans-title=From today on, nothing is anymore as it used to be |language=German |date=1 June 2010 |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/tuerkeiisrael102.html |accessdate=4 June 2010 |quote={{lang|de|Die türkisch-israelischen Beziehungen sind nach der Militäraktion Israels auf dem Tiefpunkt.

Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan accused Israel of 'state terrorism' and predicted in a speech to party members: 'From today on, nothing is anymore as it used to be.' He distanced himself clearly from antisemitical tones.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Grand National Assembly held a debate on whether to impose sanctions on Israel, and eventually came out with a statement criticizing the attack as illegal, demanding that Israel apologize, pay compensation, and prosecute those involved, and calling on the Turkish government to review ties with Israel and take "effective measures". The flotilla raid was among the issues discussed during a security meeting of Turkish military commanders chaired by Prime Minister Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-06-02-israel-releases-flotilla-detainees_N.htm |title=Israel deports all activists from Gaza-bound ships |work=USA Today |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the following months, Israel–Turkey relations remained tense. Turkey demanded that Israel apologize, pay compensation to the deceased's families, and lift the Gaza blockade, and stated that it would be impossible to renew normal ties with Israel otherwise. The United States also pressed Israel to apologize. Israel rebuffed demands by both Turkey and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Somfalvi |first=Attila |date=17 August 2011 |title=Netanyahu to Clinton: No apology to Turkey |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4109923,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the release of the UN Palmer report, Turkey gave Israel an ultimatum to either issue an apology for the raid, or face "Plan B", without elaborating what action in intended to take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Benhorin |first=Yitzhak |date=1 September 2011 |title=Turkish ultimatum to Israel: Apologize or face 'plan B' |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4116792,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Israel refused to apologize, Turkey expelled Israel's ambassador and all diplomatic personnel above second-secretary level, and reduced its own diplomatic representation in Israel to second-secretary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 September 2011 |title=Turkey expels Israeli ambassador |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4117001,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Erdoğan also announced that Turkish warships would escort future aid flotillas to Gaza, and that Turkey would stop Israel from "unilaterally exploiting" natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 September 2011 |title=Turkey: Warships will back next flotilla |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4119834,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, a series of military confrontations were reported between Turkey and Israel. Turkey boosted its air and naval operations in the Mediterranean, and a Turkish warship sailed the approximate route that the flotilla took. Though it did not enter Israeli territorial waters, it sailed in ranges where warships typically update friendly nations of their presence to prevent misunderstandings. Israel then began closely monitoring Turkish naval activity. A Turkish media report said that two Israeli fighter jets and a helicopter circled over a Turkish exploration ship searching for gas reservoirs off the coast of [[Cyprus]], breaching Cypriot airspace, ignoring warnings from Turkish air controllers in [[Northern Cyprus]], and approaching the Turkish coastline in the process, and that they were only driven off when two Turkish fighter jets were scrambled to incercept them. The IDF denied the report.  A Turkish Foreign Ministry official also told Arab ambassadors that on several occasions, Turkish fighter jets were scrambled and chased away Israeli fighter jets flying near the Syrian shore.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fishman |first=Alex |date=2 October 2011 |title=Erdogan playing with fire |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4129642,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey changed its [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] (Identification Friend or Foe) radar system into re-categorizing Israeli aircraft as hostile targets, which would allow Turkish planes to engage Israeli targets, as opposed to the old system, which identified Israeli planes as friendlies and would have prevented any Turkish plane from firing at them. Turkey said that its naval submarine radar system would be changed next.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt; A Turkish newspaper also reported that three Turkish warships ready to deploy to the Mediterranean were instructed that if they encountered any Israeli warship outside Israel's territorial waters, they would come within 100 meters and neutralize the Israeli ship's weapons system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=12 September 2011 |title=Report: Turkey to defuse Israeli Navy weapons |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4121396,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Today's Zaman]]'' reported that Israeli intelligence had wiretapped the radio conversations of [[Turkish Air Force]] cadets training to fly fighter jets at the Konya 3rd Main Jet Command Base to gather intelligence on Turkish training programs and flight strategies. According to the report, Turkish intelligence discovered this, and the Turkish Air Force initiated a project to encrypt communications between fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=2 May 2012 |title=Report: Israel spied on Turkish military training flights |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4224009,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a telephone apology from Netanyahu to Erdoğan on 22 March 2013, discussions commenced between Turkey and Israel in regard to compensation and diplomatic relations between the two countries. As of 27 March 2013, a media report anticipated a meeting that would be led by Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Feridun Sinirlioglu and Israel's Ciechanover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ban announces Israeli, Turkish members of inquiry panel into flotilla incident|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35561&amp;Cr=gaza&amp;Cr1=#.UVVPjKsY0up|work=United Nations News Centre|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to discuss the specific matter of Turkey–Israel ties.&lt;ref name="Chana" /&gt;

===Easing of Gaza blockade===
{{Main article|2010 easing of the blockade of the Gaza Strip}}

Following the raid, Israel faced mounting international calls to ease or lift its blockade.&lt;ref name="JTA Reaction mixed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Ravid|first1=David|last2=Reuters|newspaper=Haaretz|title=Israel to ease Gaza land blockade|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-to-ease-gaza-land-blockade-1.296736|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June, Israeli Prime Minister's Office announced a decision to relax the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barak|first=Ravid|newspaper=Haaretz|title=Government announces let-up to Gaza siege&amp;nbsp;– but only in English|date=17 June 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/government-announces-let-up-to-gaza-siege-but-only-in-english-1.296809|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement received a cool response from the international community.&lt;ref name="Guardian Easing"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Black|first=Ian|newspaper=Guardian|title=Israel's partial easing of Gaza blockade dismissed as inadequate|date=17 June 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/17/israel-gaza-blockade-partial-easing|accessdate=18 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. Israel stated it would expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority as well as projects that are under international supervision.&lt;ref name="Ynet Cabinet"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Somfalvi |first1=Attila |date=20 June 2010 |title=Cabinet: All non-military items can enter Gaza freely |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3907978,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel announced that it would continue to inspect at the port of [[Ashdod]] all goods bound for Gaza by sea. Internationally, this decision received mixed reactions.&lt;ref name="JTA Reaction mixed"/&gt;

In November 2010, [[Catherine Ashton]], the European Union's [[High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] stated that inadequate amounts of goods were entering Gaza to meet Gaza's humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Ashton also called for Israel to permit entry of construction material that [[UNRWA]] requested to rebuild schools and to Israel to allow exports from Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=DPA |date=22 November 2010 |title=EU's Ashton: Israel failed to ease Gaza blockade |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/eu-s-ashton-israel-failed-to-ease-gaza-blockade-1.326149 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=1 July 2011 |quote=.

===Investigations===
Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, reiterated his demands for a United Nations investigation. He said: "We have no trust at all that Israel, a country that has carried out such an attack on a civilian convoy in international waters, will conduct an impartial investigation. To have a defendant acting simultaneously as both prosecutor and judge is not compatible with any principle of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem, Jenny Percival and agencies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/14/israel-gaza-flotilla-raid-inquiry |title=Israeli cabinet approves internal inquiry into Gaza flotilla raid |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ankara doesn't 'trust' Israel probe"/&gt;

====The Israeli Inquiry====
{{See also|Turkel Commission}}
Following the raid, Israel's government set up the Turkel Commission, a commission of inquiry headed by Israeli Supreme Court Justice [[Jacob Turkel]], to investigate the raid. It was chaired by Justice Turkel, and had four members: [[Shabtai Rosenne]], Professor of International Law at [[Bar-Ilan University]], [[Amos Horev]], a retired Israeli Major-General and President of the [[Technion|Technion Institute of Technology]], Miguel Deutch, Professor of Law at [[Tel Aviv University]], and Reuven Merhav, former Director-General of the Foreign Ministry. Rosenne died at age 93 during the Commission's work, and was not replaced. The commission had two non-voting foreign observers: Former [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[David Trimble]], and former [[Judge Advocate General (Canada)|Judge Advocate General]] of the [[Canadian Forces]] [[Ken Watkin]], both of whom were friendly to Israel according to the BBC and Der Spiegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinvorth |first1=Daniel |last2=Schult |first2=Christoph |date=16 June 2010 |title=Smuggled Images of Israeli Assault: Gaza Raid Photos Fuel Propaganda War |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,700992,00.html |work=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Paul |date=14 June 2010 |title=Israel hopes inquiry will turn spotlight on activists |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10307637 |work=BBC |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also contracted the services of two foreign international law experts: Professors Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg and [[Michael N Schmitt|Michael Schmitt]].&lt;ref name="Kittrie2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Orde F.

The inquiry was charged with investigating the legality of the Gaza blockade, the legality of the Israeli Navy's actions during the raid, and determining whether investigations of claims of war crimes and breaches of international law conformed to Western standards. The Committee was also charged with investigating the Turkish position, and the actions taken by flotilla participants, especially the IHH, and examining the identities and intentions of the flotilla's participants.

During the investigation, the Committee heard the testimonies of two flotilla passengers and two Israeli human rights activists. The Committee requested the assistance of the Turkish Embassy in Israel in finding the Captain of the ''Mavi Marmara'' so he could be invited to testify. The request was denied, with the response being that the Committee could look at the testimony of the Captain contained in the Turkish report. The Committee also issued an open invitation to all passengers and crew to testify, and requested assistance from the Turkish Embassy in Israel in building a list of prospective witnesses, but received no immediate reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?=191718 |title=Israel |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also heard the testimonies of three politicians including the Prime Minister, three IDF officials (one testified twice), two government bureaucrats, and a Prison official.

The 300-page Turkel Committee report{{sfn|Turkel Report Part 1 Overview|2011}} found the actions of the Israeli Navy in the raid and Israel's naval blockade of Gaza were both legal under international law,{{sfn|Turkel Report Summary|2011|p=9}}&lt;ref name="BBCJAN232011" /&gt; and accused a group of "IHH activists" of having armed themselves and conducting hostilities "in an organized manner".{{sfn|Turkel Report Part 1|2011|p=278}}

Turkey and Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] dismissed the Israeli investigation, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon repeated the demand for an independent investigation, stating that the Israeli investigation will not have international credibility.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

According to ''[[Haaretz]]'' journalist Barak Ravid, UN Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Inquiry on 31 May 2010, found that Israel's Turkel commission that investigated the events was professional, independent and unbiased. It also criticized the Turkish government's behavior in its dealings with the committee, concluding that the Turkish investigation was politically influenced and its work was not professional or independent.&lt;ref name="election-victory"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravid |first=Barak |title=Gaza flotilla probe: IDF used excessive force but naval blockade legal |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/gaza-flotilla-probe-idf-used-excessive-force-but-naval-blockade-legal-1.371821 |newspaper=Haaretz |date= 6 July 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Turkish Inquiry====
Turkey also established an inquiry into the events, which found, in contrast to the Israeli inquiry, the blockade and the Israeli raid to have been illegal. After the Turkish inquiry, Turkey described the raid as a violation of international law, "tantamount to banditry and piracy", and described the killings of activists as "state-sponsored terrorism".&lt;ref name="BBCJAN232011"/&gt; Concerning the Israeli inquiry, Turkey said its own commission was "surprised, appalled and dismayed that the national inquiry process in Israel has resulted in the exoneration of the Israeli armed forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67836d6e-26f9-11e0-80d7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1BzBnW7u9 |title=Turkey and Israel clash over inquiries |date=23 January 2011 |work=Financial Times |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UNHRC fact-finding mission====&lt;!-- linked from Deaths section, please keep the link updated --&gt;
On 23 July 2010 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] launched an independent fact-finding mission to investigate violations of international law that may have occurred during the flotilla raid.{{Sfn|UNHRC report|2010}} Israel refused to allow the panel to interview Israeli witnesses and accused the UNHRC of a history of anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref name="Lynch-2010"/&gt;

In its first report, submitted in September 2010, the UN fact-finding mission found that the IDF broke international law, and that there was evidence sufficient to initiate prosecutions for breaches of the [[Geneva Convention]]. The report stated that: "The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence,"&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; and determined that Israeli commandos summarily executed six passengers aboard the MV ''Mavi Marmara''.&lt;ref name="Lynch-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unmultimedia.org"/&gt; It cites forensic analysis indicating that Furgan Dogan was shot five times, including once in the face while he was lying on his back. "All of the entry wounds were on the back of his body except for the face wound, which entered the right of his nose", the report concluded. "According to forensic analysis, tattooing around the wound in his face indicates that the shot was delivered at point-blank range."&lt;ref name="Lynch-2010"/&gt;

The report stated: "There is clear evidence to support prosecutions of the following crimes within the terms of [[:s:Geneva Convention/Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 147|article 147]] of the Fourth Geneva Convention: wilful killing; torture or inhuman treatment; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx|publisher=OHCHR Media Centre|title=UN Fact-finding Mission report on Gaza flotilla&amp;nbsp;– Press Conference}}, 23 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The report also stated that it found no medical evidence of IDF commandos being shot.&lt;ref name="Lynch-2010"/&gt; It recommended that Israel pay reparations, and also described Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip as "totally intolerable and unacceptable in the 21st century".

The United States expressed concern about the tone, content and conclusions of the report, while the European Union said that it should be transferred to the UN Secretary-General's investigation.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|title=US concerned UNHRC flotilla probe may stop peace talks|date=28 September 2010|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=189515|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September 2010 the UN Human Rights Council voted to endorse the report, with 30 of the 47 countries voting in favor, the United States voting against, and 15 countries, including EU members, abstaining.&lt;ref name="Lynch-2010"/&gt;

====UN Palmer Report====
On 2 August 2010, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced that the U.N. would conduct an investigation of the incident. [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]], former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of [[New Zealand]], presided over the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=3 August 2010 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/3984251/Former-NZ-PM-to-lead-Gaza-flotilla-attack-probe |title=Former NZ PM to lead Gaza flotilla attack probe |work=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 August 2010 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10663218 |title=Palmer to head UN flotilla inquiry |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-member panel also included [[Álvaro Uribe]], outgoing Colombian president, as vice chair, and one representative each from Israel and Turkey. The panel started its work on 10 August 2010. The terms of reference for the 'method of work' of the inquiry were given by Ban Ki Moon they are outlined in the report as follows: "The Panel is not a court. It was not asked to make determinations of the legal issues or to adjudicate on liability ... The Panel was required to obtain its information from the two nations primarily involved in its inquiry, Turkey and Israel, and other affected States ... the limitation is important. It means that the Panel cannot make definitive findings either of fact or law.

The commission questioned the motivations of the Flotilla, stating, "There exist serious questions about the conduct, true nature and objectives of the flotilla organizers, particularly IHH."{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=48}} The commission recognized that the IDF were met with "organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers" upon boarding the vessel and therefore force was necessary for purposes of self-defense,&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Keinon |first=Herb |title='Palmer report: Gaza blockade legal, IDF force excessive' |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=236369 |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but said, "the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force by Israeli forces during the take-over of the ''Mavi Marmara'' was unacceptable."{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=4}}

Of those killed, the report noted, "no evidence has been provided to establish that any of the deceased were armed with lethal weapons". It further noted, "at least one of those killed, Furkan Dogan, was shot at extremely close range. Mr. Dogan sustained wounds to the face, back of the skull, back and left leg. That suggests he may already have been lying wounded when the fatal shot was delivered, as suggested by witness accounts to that effect."&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/opinion/06iht-edcohen06.html |title=Israel Isolates Itself |author=Roger Cohen |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2011 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of satisfactory explanation was pointed out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range has not been adequately accounted for in the material presented by Israel.{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=61}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In regards to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|Gaza blockade]], the commission writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Israel faces a real threat to its security from militant groups in Gaza ... The naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report was also critical of the flotilla, describing it as "reckless". Turkey was criticized as well for not doing more to persuade flotilla participants to avoid armed conflict with Israeli soldiers.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt; Finally, the report presented the following as [[rapprochement]], i.e., for the re-establishment of cordial relations between Turkey and Israel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An appropriate statement of regret should be made by Israel in respect of the incident in light of its consequences. Israel should offer payment for the benefit of the deceased and injured and their families ... Turkey and Israel should resume full diplomatic relations ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israel's ambassador to the U.S., [[Michael Oren]], said "We think it was a fair and balanced report", and that Israel would not apologize to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelemen |first=Michele |date=2 September 2011 |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/02/140151959/u-n-releases-review-on-israeli-raid |title=U.N.

====ICC probe====
In 2013, [[Fatou Bensouda]], the Chief Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], opened a preliminary examination into the incident after the government of [[Comoros]], under whose flag the Mavi Marmara was sailing, filed a complaint over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/comoros-files-complaint-against-israel-at-icc/|title=ICC opens initial probe against Israel over Marmara raid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Bensouda decided not to pursue the case, declaring that while it was possible that war crimes were committed, the possible crimes were not grave enough to fall within the scope of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-marmara-case-closed-israel-calls-international-probe-pointless/|title=As ICC closes Marmara case, Israel says it should never have been opened|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The government of Comoros appealed the decision, and in June 2015, three judges of a Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC ruled that the prosecutor made material errors in her assessment of the incident's gravity and requested that the investigation be reopened in a 2-1 majority. Bensouda appealed the decision in July 2015, citing the opinion of the dissenting judge and errors made by the majority, claiming that the Pre-Trial Chamber had exceeded it's mandate by applying a strict and mistaken standard to review the decision, and that the interpretation of the legal standard required of her was faulty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inss.org.il/publication/the-international-criminal-court-on-the-mavi-marmara-continued/&lt;/ref&gt; Five judges of the ICC Appeals Chamber dismissed her appeal and ordered her to reexamine the case in a 3-2 majority ruling. 

Bensouda subsequently reopened a probe into the incident, and her office received over 5,000 pages of additional evidence, including testimonies from more than 300 ''Mavi Marmara'' passengers and Turkish autopsy reports, as well as arguments in defense of the action from Israeli Attorney General [[Avichai Mandelblit]] and his Senior Adviser Gil Limon. In November 2017, after examining the case for two years, Bensouda reaffirmed her previous conclusion and announced that there was no basis for prosecution due to the fact that any possible crimes committed were not on a large scale or as part of a plan or policy, and thus fell outside of the court's mandate, criticizing the judges' analysis on how to examine the gravity of the Israeli soldiers' conduct, and for disregarding the fact that the soldiers had encountered violent resistance. Bensouda also noted that many of the witnesses who provided testimony had apparently received help in wording their testimonies, and rejected some other testimonies on the basis of the witness' involvement in violent activities, and others on the basis that testimony was provided on things the witness could not possibly have seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5059006,00.html|title=Israeli achievement: No ICC probe over Gaza flotilla raid|date=19 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish criminal investigation===
Turkey's [[Bakırköy|Istanbul Bakırköy]] prosecutor's office, assisted by the [[Ankara]] prosecutor's office, opened a criminal investigation. Possible charges, against Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Chief of Staff [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], would include murder, injury, attacking Turkish citizens, and piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Turkish prosecutors go after Israeli politicians |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-212202-turkish-prosecutors-go-after-israeli-politicians.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608092214/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-212202-turkish-prosecutors-go-after-israeli-politicians.html |archivedate=8 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Istanbul state prosecutor Mehmet Akif Ekinci wrote to the [[Israeli Ministry of Justice|Israeli Justice Ministry]], demanding that it disclose the names and addresses of the soldiers who took part in the raid. The demand was reportedly based on the testimonies of over 500 activists aboard the ''Mavi Marmara''. There was no response to the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 October 2011 |title=Turkey seeks Israeli arrests over flotilla raid |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4134689,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=14 May 2011 |title=Turkey demands names of soldiers involved in flotilla raid |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068368,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, IHH-affiliated lawyer Ramzan Turk claimed the organization had given Istanbul's chief prosecutor the names of ten Israeli soldiers involved in the raid. Turk claimed that the names were given to the IHH by IDF soldiers who did not take part in the raid and "regretted the incident". The prosecutor reportedly also approached Turkish intelligence, seeking a list of Israelis involved in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=9 September 2011 |title=Report: Turkey obtains names of flotilla raid soldiers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4120091,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September, the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|MIT]], Turkey's national intelligence agency, submitted to the state prosecution a list of 174 Israelis it claimed were involved in the raid. Benjamin Netanyahu topped the list as the "primary responsible party". The list also included all of Israel's cabinet ministers, a variety of high and low-ranking officers, and the photographs of ten soldiers who could not be identified by name.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=26 September 2011 |title=Report: Turkey operated agents in Israel to track soldiers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4127645,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Today's Zaman]]'' reported that the MIT had operated agents inside Israel to confirm the soldiers' identities, a claim denied by the Turkish government. According to a report in ''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'', photographs and information from various media sources helped in the identification of the soldiers, and Turkish intelligence agents apparently tracked down the soldiers on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 September 2011 |title=Report: Turkey 'hunted' Israeli commandos on Facebook |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4127587,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |agency=Israel News |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a ''[[Ynet]]'' report later revealed that the soldiers listed as having taken part in the raid had already completed their military service by the time of the raid, and that the names included those of a [[Golani Brigade]] maintenance officer, a [[Paratroopers Brigade]] company commander, and an [[Artillery Corps (Israel)|Artillery Corps]] battery commander. The IDF Spokesperson's Office stated that the names were "recycled" from previous lists that were published on anti-Israel websites during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Military officials claimed that the list was created for [[psychological warfare]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haas |first=Sa'ar |date=27 September 2011 |title=Turkish list of flotilla soldiers a sham? |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4128276,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2012, the Turkish Justice Ministry announced that the State Prosecutor's Office had completed its probe into the raid. Justice Minister [[Sadullah Ergin]] said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry had been approached with a request for the names of IDF soldiers who took part, and said that the soldiers would be indicted in Turkish courts when Israel complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ynet |date=9 May 2012 |title=Turkey ready to indict flotilla soldiers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4226698,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel did not grant the request. On 23 May, Istanbul state prosecutor Mehmet Akif Ekinci prepared indictments carrying life sentences for four Israeli commanders involved in the raid: Chief of Staff [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], Navy commander [[Eli Marom]], Air Force intelligence chief Avishai Levy, and military intelligence chief [[Amos Yadlin]], charging each of them with first-degree murder, assault, and torture. The indictment called for ten life sentences to be imposed on each of them: nine for every activist killed, and one for a wounded activist still in a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magnezi |first=Aviel |date=23 May 2012 |title=Turkey seeks 10 life sentences for Israeli commanders |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4233296,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May, they were indicted by an Istanbul court after a panel of judges voted unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 May 2012 |title=Turkish court charges senior IDF officers |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4235019,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 144-page indictment, they were accused of inciting murder and injury.

====The Lindenstrauss Report====
In June 2012, [[State Comptroller of Israel|Israeli State Comptroller]] [[Micha Lindenstrauss]] released a report on the decision-making process leading to the flotilla raid. It found major fault with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making process over the events, stating that he failed to organize an orderly and coordinated discussion with other Israeli leaders, instead consulting Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] in undocumented meetings. Netanyahu was also criticized for his failure to call a cabinet meeting to discuss the matter, despite the requests of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Chief of Staff [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], and Strategic Affairs Minister [[Moshe Yaalon]]. He instead consulted the forum of seven, a group of seven cabinet ministers with no constitutional basis, once before leaving to visit North America. The meeting took place five days before the raid, and relevant officials, including the Justice and Internal Security Ministers, were not invited, and the discussion was not in line with national security-related decision-making protocols. The report also found fault with Netanyahu failing to hold a discussion with the defense and foreign ministers to start a dialogue that could result in a diplomatic and political effort to prevent the flotilla from leaving or prevent it from getting as far as it did.&lt;ref name="Druckman-2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Druckman |first=Yaron |date=13 June 2012 |title=Comptroller slams PM in flotilla report |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4241882,00.html |work=Ynetnews |location=Tel Aviv |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found fault with Netanyahu's failure to allow the [[National Security Council (Israel)|National Security Council]] to deal with the matter. The NSC held its first meeting on 12 May, and its requests to be involved in discussions on the strategy used to deal with the raid were denied. The report claimed that this conduct was illegal and damaging to the NSC's ability to aid leaders in making decisions.&lt;ref name="Druckman-2012"/&gt;

Overall, Lindenstrauss found that the strategy for dealing with the flotilla was hastily put together and did not follow the recommendations of the [[Winograd Commission|Winograd]] and Lipkin-Shahak Commissions, which had examined the government's decision-making process following the [[2006 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref name="Druckman-2012"/&gt;

====Other investigations====
The Foreign Press Association, which represents hundreds of journalists in Israel and the Palestinian territories, complained that Israel is validating its own account by selectively using the seized video and equipment from reporters on board. FPA also criticized Israel's use of captured material without permission.&lt;ref name="FPA"/&gt; Journalist Paul McGeough told his consul-general "we were robbed of any electronic equipment that we had" and "Fairfax will fight this ...

A spokesman for the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] said, "We will look into the circumstances of the death of an American citizen, as we would do anywhere in the world at all times", noting that the [[FBI]] could get involved, "working with the host government", "if we think a crime has been committed".&lt;ref name=Investigate&gt;{{Cite news |title=Gaza flotilla attack: US to investigate death of citizen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/7801935/Gaza-flotilla-attack-US-to-investigate-death-of-citizen.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to governmental investigation, relatives of the Turkish citizens killed in the raid had conducted an unceasing campaign to find Israeli officials guilty of these fatalities. Even following the Israeli official apology and Turkish agreement to refrain from legal action against Israeli officials, the families of IHH activists kept pursuing their case and even managed to get the support of the government of the Comoros in referring the case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/otp-statement-14-05-2013.aspx|title=ICC Prosecutor statement of 14 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107224730/http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/otp-statement-14-05-2013.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an arrest warrant was issued in [[Spain]] for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defense Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]], former IDF Chief of Staff [[Moshe Ya'alon]], former [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Interior Minister]] [[Eli Yishai]], [[Minister without Portfolio]] [[Benny Begin]] and [[Aluf|Vice Admiral]] [[Eli Marom]]. The warrant was issued by federal judge José de la Mata of the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|National Court]]. The police and [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] were ordered to inform the court if any of the indicted entered Spain. In accordance to a [[Supreme Court of Spain|Spanish Supreme Court]] decision, legal procedures shall only be initiated when one of the seven indicted set foot in Spanish soil. Judge de la Mata noted that all signatory states to the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] have a duty to seek any accused of serious infractions to the Convention, “as in the present case”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vázquez |first=Ángeles |date=11 June 2015 |title=El juez invita al Gobierno a denunciar a Netanyahu por el asalto a la 'Flotilla de la Libertad' |trans-title=Judge invites the Government to denounce Netanyahu for the assault on the 'Freedom Flotilla' |language=es |location=Madrid |work=El Mundo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/06/11/5579920de2704e9e238b4581.html |accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eleftheriou-Smith |first=Loulla-Mae |date=17 November 2015 |title=Spain 'issues arrest warrant' for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over 2010 Gaza flotilla attack |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-over-2010-gaza-flotilla-a6736436.html |accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arrest warrant issued in Spain for Netanyahu, other Israeli officials |date=17 November 2015 |work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]] |url=http://www.jta.org/2015/11/17/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/arrest-warrant-issued-in-spain-for-netanyahu-other-israeli-officials |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 dismissing of the case====

In December 2016, Turkish courts finally dismissed the cases brought before them, under extraordinary security measures due to the "angry and disappointed [[Islamism|Islamists]]" involved.&lt;ref name="dismissed"/&gt;

===Legal assessments===
{{Main article|Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid}}

International law experts differed over the legality of the Israeli action in published assessments following the raid. Legal commentators generally agreed that Israel was required to respond with a proportional use of force in the face of violent resistance, but the degree of proportionality was disputed.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jun/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-international-law |title=Was the Gaza Flotilla Raid Illegal? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2 June 2010 | location=London | date=1 June 2010 | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fact-finding mission of the UNHRC claimed that Israel had broken international law.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]] condemned the Israeli raid, saying it involved disproportionate use of force and that the Gaza blockade was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/BBACA8683074703C85257735004D674F |title=UN human rights chief condemns violent interception of Gaza aid flotilla (31 May 2010) |publisher=United Nations |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512113508/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/BBACA8683074703C85257735004D674F |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Falk]], professor emeritus of international law at [[Princeton University]] said that the "ships that were situated in the high seas where freedom of navigation exists, according to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|law of the sea]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34863&amp;Cr=gaza&amp;Cr1 |title=United Nations: Secretary-General 'shocked' by deadly raid on Gaza aid flotilla |publisher=United Nations |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony D'Amato, a professor of international law at [[Northwestern University]] School of Law, said the raid was illegal and that a legitimate blockade would have required a state of war between Israel and [[Hamas]], which he said was not the case.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june10/gaza2_06-02.html |title=As Flotilla Inquiry Calls Grow Louder, Legality of Gaza Blockade Examined |publisher=PBS |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618074013/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june10/gaza2_06-02.html |archivedate=18 June 2011 }}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite web |author=Karoline Hoppe |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/folkrattsprofessorn-israel-har-brutit-mot-internationell-ratt-1.1115594 |title=Folkrättsprofessorn: Israel har brutit mot internationell rätt |language=Swedish |publisher=DN |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, a [[#UN Palmer Report|United Nations report]] concluded that the Israeli naval blockade was legal, but that the Israeli action was "excessive".{{sfn|UN Palmer Report|2011|p=53}} The finding declaring the naval blockade legal was rejected by a [[UNHRC]] panel of five independent human rights experts, stating that it amounted to collective punishment and was unlawful.&lt;ref name=UNpanel5experts /&gt;

Harvard Law School Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], Chicago Law School Professor [[Eric Posner]], and Johns Hopkins international law Professor [[Ruth Wedgwood]], said that the naval [[blockade]] and the boarding in international waters were in accord with long-standing [[international law]], and comparable to other blockades in unrelated, historical conflicts.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/06/02/2010-06-02_israel_obeyed_international_law_legally_the_gaza_flotilla_conflict_is_an_openand.html |title=Israel obeyed international law: Legally, the Gaza flotilla conflict is an open-and-shut case |work=New York Daily news |date= 1 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{Cite news |last=Posner |first=Eric |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704025304575284210429984110|title= The Gaza Blockade and International Law: Israel's position is reasonable and backed by precedent|work=Opinion|subscription=yes |date= 4 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/jan-june10/gaza2_06-02.html |title=As Flotilla Inquiry Calls Grow Louder, Legality of Gaza Blockade Examined |publisher=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz and Posner also defended the specific use of force as legal.

In November 2014, [[Fatou Bensouda]], Prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), stated that there "is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court were committed on one of the vessels, the Mavi Marmara, when Israeli Defence Forces intercepted the 'Gaza Freedom Flotilla' on 31 May 2010". However, she declined to further pursue the case as it "would not be of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the ICC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simons |first=Marlise |date=6 November 2014 |title=Hague Prosecutor Cites Possible Israeli War Crimes in Gaza Flotilla Raid |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/world/europe/hague-prosecutor-cites-possible-israeli-war-crimes-but-declines-to-seek-inquiry-in-gaza-flotilla-raid.html |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Representatives of the Comoros, on whose behalf the case was referred to the ICC, appealed the prosecutor's decision, and in July 2015 a pre-trial chamber ruled that Bensouda had made errors in her decision to dismiss the case. 
Bensouda appealed, but in November 2015 the appeals chamber of the International Criminal Court upheld the decision of the pre-trial chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Silver |first=Charlotte |date=8 November 2015 |title=ICC prosecutor ordered to investigate Israeli attack on Mavi Marmara |work=The Electronic Intifada |url=http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/charlotte-silver/icc-prosecutor-ordered-investigate-israeli-attack-mavi-marmara |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comoros situation: Dismissal of the Prosecutor’s appeal against decision requesting reconsideration of the decision not to initiate an investigation |publisher=International Criminal Court |url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1170.aspx |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bensouda then launched another preliminary investigation, reviewing more than 5,000 pages of documents and more than 300 statements from passengers. In November 2017, she reaffirmed her previous decision not to investigate, concluding that while war crimes may have been committed on the Mavi Marmara ship and her conclusion does not excuse any crimes which may have been perpetrated, the incident wasn't serious enough to merit ICC involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5050334,00.html|title=ICC prosecutor reaffirms she won't open Gaza flotilla probe|date=30 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
Following upon the event and the various video clips presented by both Turkey and Israel, Iranian filmmaker Saeed Faraji created ''Freedom Flotilla'', a 56-minute documentary film about the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=کاروان آزادي |trans-title=Freedom Flotilla |publisher=misagh.tv |language=fa |url=http://www.misagh.tv/Docs/Detail/?Doc=1 |accessdate=6 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107122731/http://www.misagh.tv/Docs/Detail/?Doc=1 |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as his first [[feature length]] film project.

It is a planning document that ensures that the anticipated take of a listed species will be minimized or mitigated by conserving the habitat upon which the species depend, thereby contributing to the recovery of the species as a whole.&lt;ref name="HCP" /&gt;

==Background==
The importance of preserving rare species was legally recognized in 1973 when the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) was signed into federal law. The purpose of the ESA is not only to protect species that have been listed as threatened or endangered, but also to conserve the ecosystems upon which those species depend.  In aiming to protect species in danger of becoming extinct, the ESA prohibits actions that have the potential to result in a "taking" of any listed species.  The term "take" under the ESA refers to any attempt or action involving the harassment, harm, pursuit, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting of any listed species. Under this definition, the alteration of habitat that results in injury to, or death of, any listed species by preventing essential behavior (such as breeding, feeding or sheltering) is considered unlawful "harm". The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) and the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) are the lead agencies tasked with the implementation of the ESA and are therefore responsible for regulating prohibited and allowable activities.&lt;ref name="ESA 1973"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/ESAall.pdf |title=Endangered Species Act of 1973. |date= |accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the primary objective of the ESA is the protection of endangered species, and the take of such species is considered unlawful, the ESA is not absolute.  In 1982, amendments were made to the 1973 ESA which authorize the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] to allow the take of federally listed species (Endangered Species Act, Section 10a(1)(B)).  When non-federal activities that would otherwise be legal have the potential to result in the take of a listed species for example, they may be allowed under an Incidental Take Permit, obtained through the USFWS.&lt;ref name="HCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/hcp.pdf |title=Habitat Conservation Plans Under the Endangered Species Act. |date= |accessdate=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To mitigate the take of listed species, Section 10 of the ESA requires that parties wishing to obtain an Incidental Take Permit must submit a conservation plan, hereafter referred to as a "Habitat Conservation Plan" or "HCP," with their application.&lt;ref name="ESA 1973" /&gt;

==Phases of Developing a HCP==

===I. Pre-application process===

====Determine permit applicant(s)/HCP preparer(s)====
In determining the party to prepare a HCP and application for an Incidental Take Permit, two primary factors must be considered; first, the party must be capable of overseeing the implementation of the HCP once approved and second, the party must be capable of funding the implementation of the HCP. Beyond these requirements, parties can vary based on the scope of the proposed action. For example, a single landowner may be the sole preparer of a HCP if they intend to obtain an Incidental Take Permit for an action on their own property and they are the only interested party. For large-scale projects such as those covering a region of land rather than a single property, or those with multiple interested parties rather than a single landowner, the permittee may be a group such as a local or governmental agency.&lt;ref name="HCP ITP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/HCPBKTOC.PDF |title=Habitat Conservation Planning and Incidental Take Permit Processing Handbook. |date= |accessdate=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Determine the members of the steering committee (optional)====
For large-scale projects, applicants have the option of forming a steering committee composed of persons, such as stakeholders, with an interest in the HCP planning area or affected species.  The purpose of a steering committee is to provide the applicant with direction, guidance, advice, and assistance in developing the HCP.&lt;ref name="HCP ITP" /&gt;  Although the development and participation of a steering committee is not a requirement in preparing a HCP, it can be found valuable in facilitating the HCP process when multiple groups with differing interests and opinions regarding the project are involved.

====Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service====
After the applicant and steering committee members have been determined, consultation with USFWS and NMFS is recommended to ensure that responsible parties have a thorough understanding of requirements and resources available for the development phase of the HCP.

===II. Development process===

====Generate a species list====
Once the applicant has decided to initiate the development of a HCP, they must identify the species of concern that the HCP will be developed for.  All federally listed animal species that have the potential to be impacted by the proposed action/project must be included in this list. Additional unlisted species may also be considered in the HCP.  Including these additional species may be beneficial in some cases, if the proposed action has the potential to impact species that are not federally listed at the time the HCP is being developed but are anticipated to be listed within the active duration of the permit; in which case, the HCP would need to be revised to include the newly listed species and may further delay the proposed action.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Incidental take permits and HCPs are not required for the incidental take of listed plant species; however, applicants are encouraged to incorporate federally listed plants in the HCP or planning process.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HCP ITP" /&gt;

'''Habitat-based approach'''

An alternative method to developing a HCP for target species of concern is to develop a HCP for a particular habitat type.  Under this approach, a specific habitat type found within the HCP area is selected as the focus of the HCP by the permittee and USFWS/NMFS based on the species known to use the habitat.  The habitat-based HCP must consider all sensitive species known to use the particular habitat type and all of their habitat-related needs.  All species considered within the habitat-based HCP may be included under the Incidental Take Permit.  The benefit of developing a habitat-based HCP rather than a species-based HCP is that, if prepared properly, a single HCP would theoretically benefit multiple species or an entire ecosystem rather than only protecting the species listed under the ESA.

====Define geographic boundaries====
Once the target species or habitat type to be considered in the HCP have been identified, the geographic boundaries of the planning area need to be established.  It is important to be precise when defining the land area to which the HCP will apply, with regards to impacts associated with the proposed action, to circumvent potential problems in later phases of the development process.  The geographic boundaries of the HCP should encompass all areas that will be directly impacted by the proposed action and any areas where an incidental take has the potential to occur as a result of the proposed action.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For projects covering a large amount of land, the project area may be divided into separate entities with their own set of requirements, rather than applying a single plan's criteria to a diverse region.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gather biological data====
After delineating the boundaries of the HCP area and the species within that area to be included in the HCP, current biological information for each of those species must be obtained.  Data pertaining to the species' ecology, geographical distribution, and occurrence is required and may be available from existing sources.  Guidance for locating this information is provided by USFWS and NMFS.  If existing information is not available or sufficient for the requirements of the HCP, biological studies must be completed to supplement this requirement.  If a biological study is determined necessary, USFWS and NMFS can suggest appropriate methods based on the species of concern.

====Discuss proposed activities====
After sufficient biological information has been collected for each of the species included in the HCP, the applicant must provide a discussion of all proposed activities that have a potential to result in an incidental take of said species.  This portion of the HCP is where the applicant provides a detailed comprehensive description of the proposed action/project, which can vary in depth based on the scale of the project and HCP area.  For the purpose of long-term planning, applicants are encouraged to include any actions that they have control over that are reasonably foreseeable to occur during the active permit period.

'''Low-Effect HCP'''

Due to the varying degrees by which a species may be impacted from a project, the Low-Effect HCP category is established to distinguish projects that are expected to have "minor or negligible effects on federally listed, proposed, or candidate species and their habitats or environmental values or resources".&lt;ref name="HCP ITP" /&gt;  Low-Effect HCPs have a simplified and shortened application/approval process compared to a regular HCP.  USFWS and NMFS will review the HCP and determine if it may be considered within the low-effect category or not.

====Determine significance of anticipated incidental take====
In requesting a permit that will authorize the incidental take of a listed species, the applicant must determine the extent of the potential take.  To do this, the methods for calculating incidental take must be established.  First, the number of individuals of each species, or number of acres of specific habitat, of concern that occur within the geographic boundaries of the HCP area must be determined.  Subsequently, incidental take may be calculated based on the number of animals expected to be "killed, harmed, or harassed" as a result of the proposed action/project.  If the applicant is incapable of determining the number of individuals/acres that occur in the area or the number that are expected to be impacted, incidental take may be calculated based on the acres of habitat anticipated to be affected by the proposed project.  Once the number of individual species or acres of habitat are confirmed, the probability that proposed activities will result in the take of a species must be evaluated.

====Develop a mitigation program====
After an allowable level of take is determined, the applicant may begin to prepare the mitigation program.  Because projects requiring an Incidental Take Permit are so diverse, applicable mitigation measures should be equally diverse; therefore, limits and rules are not established for this process.

Common mitigation measures often include the following:&lt;ref name="HCP ITP" /&gt; 
# Avoid the impact
# Minimize the impact
# Rectify the impact
# Reduce/eliminate the impact over time
# Compensate for the impact

The general goals of a mitigation program are to offset the immediate incidental take by either positively contributing to the species as a whole or to the objectives of the recovery plan designed for that species by USFWS.

'''Mitigating for habitat loss'''

Most projects requiring an Incidental Take Permit involve impacts to, or losses of, habitat.  Mitigating for habitat loss requires either the replacement or protection of habitat within the HCP area or at another location.  This may be accomplished through a variety of methods including:
# Acquiring existing habitat;
# Employing conservation easements to protect existing habitat;
# Improving or restoring degraded habitat;
# Management of habitats to achieve specific conditions; or
# Creating new habitat.

'''Examples of habitat mitigation programs'''

* Habitat Banking- used to mitigate for habitat loss by designating and protecting land through conservation easements within the HCP area during the design phase of the project.
* [[Mitigation banking|Mitigation Credit System]]- uses protected (banked) lands as credits available for purchase.  This system enables parties capable of protecting large areas to receive monetary gain from other parties requiring habitat mitigation.  Likewise, this system is beneficial for parties not capable of protecting sufficient habitat within their HCP area by enabling them to quickly purchase credits that satisfy their mitigation requirements.
* Mitigation Fund- involves making monetary contributions of an established amount to an account that is used as a habitat acquisition fund.

In general, it is recommended that habitat mitigation be located reasonably close to the location of habitat impacted by the proposed action/project, provide similar habitat types, and support the same species expected to be impacted by the proposed action/project; however, these attributes vary from project to project.  It is typically expected that the extent of mitigation should mirror the proposed impact.  For example, if a project will result in permanent destruction of habitat, mitigation measures will likely require either the creation of new habitat or the protection of habitat, and mitigated habitat should be permanently protected.  Similarly, mitigation for Low-Effect HCPs and small projects may involve a payment to a fund or purchasing mitigation credits.

====Develop a monitoring program====
To ensure the effectiveness of the HCP, it is essential for monitoring to be implemented throughout the development of the action/project and following its completion.  HCP monitoring programs are recommended to incorporate the following features:&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Monitoring programs should be designed in a way that will adequately identify trends in species populations in an economically efficient manner.  The permittee may identify and assign an outside party for implementing the monitoring program, but the permittee is ultimately responsible for its funding, adequacy, and completion.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Establish specific objectives for monitoring;
# Clarify the focus of the monitoring program (specific species, specific habitat types, etc.);
# Specify the characteristics to be monitored and methods to be employed for data collection;
# Establish a monitoring schedule that determines the frequency and duration by which monitoring will take place; and
# Discuss the process by which data will be analyzed (who will perform the analysis, how will data be evaluated etc.)

====Identify/provide funding====
Every HCP is required to identify the funding that will be provided for its implementation.  Sufficient funding must be provided for all proposed activities, including those relating to any necessary surveys, monitoring programs, mitigation programs, and construction of the proposed project.  Funding amounts and contributors will vary based on the scale of the proposed project.  Projects impacting large areas of land, for example, typically require funding from multiple sources.  The HCP must identify all financial contributors and planned allocation of funds.

====Analyze alternatives====
Permittees are required to include a discussion of other options, besides the proposed action/project, that would not result in the proposed taking.  It is common for this discussion to include two alternatives; one being a "no action" alternative under which a permit would not be issued and the proposed project would not be developed, the other being a specific project alternative that would result in a reduced impact/take than the proposed project.  All alternatives considered during the permit application and HCP development process must be included. Following the discussion of possible alternatives, the permittee must explain why each of the alternatives was deemed unsuitable and not chosen as the proposed project.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The number of alternatives required of an HCP may vary based on the scale of the proposed project.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consider unforeseen circumstances====
In the development phase of the HCP process, applicants are encouraged to consider elements that have the potential to change over time.  Given the unpredictable nature of the future, it would be impossible to prepare for every situation that has the potential to arise.  For this reason, an assurance policy is incorporated in the HCP process.

'''No Surprises Policy'''

The [[Endangered Species Act#.22No Surprises.22 rule|No Surprises Policy]] is designed to protect Incidental Take Permit-holders from having to make future revisions to their approved plan due to unforeseen circumstances.  This means that once a permittee has prepared a HCP deemed adequate by USFWS/NMFS, has been issued an Incidental Take Permit, and is successfully implementing the approved HCP, USFWS and NMFS will not require revisions be made to the accepted plan (such as additional mitigation) if unexpected circumstances arise.

===III. Approval/Implementation Process===

====Review of HCP required content====
Habitat conservation plans may vary to some degree in content; however, there are certain elements that are universally required.  Inclusion of the following is required of every HCP:
# Analysis of impacts that have the potential to occur as a result of the proposed taking of a threatened or endangered species;
# Steps to be taken by the permit-holder to "…monitor, minimize, and mitigate for such impacts;"
# Sufficient funding for implementing these steps;
# A plan of action for handling any unanticipated circumstances;
# A discussion of potential alternative actions taken into consideration by the permittee that would not result in the take of a listed species, and basis for not choosing these alternatives&lt;ref name="HCP" /&gt;

====Interpret significance of anticipated incidental take====
Once the degree of incidental take is calculated based on the factors discussed above, it is up to UFSWS and NMFS to determine if the proposed incidental take should be authorized.  When evaluating the estimated level of take, the following criteria (outlined in ESA section 10(a)(2)(B)) are employed to determine if the incidental take is acceptable:

# The proposed "take" of a species would be incidental (it would be the result of, rather than the purpose for, an otherwise legal action).
# The party applying for the Incidental Take Permit would develop a mitigation program capable of minimizing and mitigating the impacts of the proposed take to the maximum extent practicable.
# The party applying for the Incidental Take Permit would ensure that sufficient funding for the HCP will be provided.
# The proposed take would not substantially diminish the ability of the species to recover and survive in the wild.

The HCP must be consistent with these criteria before being approved for an Incidental Take Permit.  If the estimated level of take is determined to exceed allowable amounts by USFWS and NMFS, the HCP must be revised to further reduce the potential for take.  This is often most easily achieved by increasing the amount of land that will remain undisturbed.

====Implementing agreement====
Implementing Agreements are made between the permittee and USFWS/NMFS to assure that the permittee will follow through on their obligation to implement the mitigation program identified by the HCP.  They are individually tailored for HCPs and include all applicable permit conditions and requirements of the parties involved.  They are signed by all parties, thereby establishing the intent of adhering to the terms identified by the HCP.  Implementing Agreements are not required of every HCP; they are most often utilized for large-scale projects involving multiple parties and are rarely used for Low-Effect HCPs.

==Progress and momentum of the Habitat Conservation Plan==
Since its inclusion in the ESA in 1982, the process of habitat conservation planning has been steadily gaining momentum.  Between 1982 and 1992, the USFWS had approved a total of 14 HCPs and had issued 14 incidental take permits.&lt;ref name="HCP ITP" /&gt;  As of December 2005, over 430 HCPs had been officially approved, varying in size and scope, with many more in the development phase.&lt;ref name="HCP" /&gt;

==Additional conservation agreements==
Congress addressed taking restrictions in the 1990s by creating additional agreements to assist in species recovery.  Instituted by USFWS and NMFS, [[Endangered Species Act#.22Safe Harbor.22 agreements|safe harbor agreements]] and [[Endangered Species Act#Candidate Conservation Agreements|candidate conservation agreements]] are incentive-driven and voluntary.  Because of their greater flexibility for property owners, these agreements are likely to become more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web4.audubon.org/campaign/esa/hcp-guide.html#other/ |title=A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans. |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe Harbor Agreement (SHA)===
Similar to HCPs, Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs) are voluntary agreements between non-federal landowners and USFWS or NMFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/Pubs9/safe_harbor_agree.pdf |title=Safe Harbor Agreements for Private Property Owners |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SHAs encourage landowners to create, enhance, or maintain habitat for threatened or endangered species on their property.  Prior to the agreement, landowners and agencies establish baseline conditions for the habitat to be capable of supporting the species.  The agency provides assurances to the landowners and guarantees that, if the conditions of the SHA are met, the landowners will not be subject to any additional requirements than previously agreed upon.  Incidental take by the landowner is authorized as long as the species does not fall below the agreed-upon baseline conditions.  Landowners are not bound indefinitely to SHAs and can either renew or let the agreements expire.  This allows landowners to freely manage their property, including development, as long as they maintain baseline conditions.  As of 2009, USFWS had entered into over 70 SHAs.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, J., Thompson, B. 2010. ''Environmental Law and Policy''. Thomson Reuters, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate Conservation Agreement (CCA)===
Similar to SHAs, Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCAs) are voluntary agreements between private or public parties (including landowners, state, local, and federal agencies) and USFWS or NMFS.  CCAs aim to protect candidate species that are in decline and vulnerable to becoming endangered if measures are not taken to protect their habitat.  CCAs encourage landowners to create, enhance, or maintain habitat for these species on their property. CCAs do not provide assurances for landowners or authorize incidental take.&lt;ref name="CCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/CCAs.pdf |title=Candidate Conservation Agreements |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA)===
Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAAs) are voluntary agreements between non-federal landowners and USFWS or NMFS.  CCAAs provide assurances and authorize a specific allotment of incidental take by the landowner.&lt;ref name="CCA" /&gt;

==Flexible scope of Habitat Conservation Plans==

===Example: Small-scale HCP===
HCPs are designed to be flexible to accommodate a range of projects that vary greatly in size and scope, from single-property developments to hundreds of thousands of acres involving multiple parties.  An HCP created for construction of a single-family home on a 0.44-acre lot in [[Scotts Valley, California]] proposed mitigation and minimization measures aimed at the endangered [[Polyphylla barbata|Mount Hermon June beetle]] (Polyphylla barbata) and [[Chorizanthe pungens#Varieties|Ben Lomond spineflower]] (Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana).&lt;ref name="Tinkless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/ventura/endangered/habitat_conservation_planning/hcp/docs/final/TinkessParcel_HCP.pdf |title=Low-Effect Habitat Conservation Plan for the Mount Hermon June Beetle and Ben Lomond Spineflower at the Tinkess Parcel  (APN:  067-411-39) near Scotts Valley, Santa Cruz County, California |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measures for the 5,856&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; project included no development on the land where the spineflower is located and elimination of non-native plants growth on the land to prevent competition.  Measures to protect the beetle took into account breeding and flight activities and proposed landscaping to promote the beetle's habitat.&lt;ref name="ITP SCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2008/E8-23403.html |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Incidental Take Permits in Santa Cruz County, CA |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example: Large-scale HCP===
[[File:WO 2087 Marbled Murrelet.jpg|thumb|Threatened marbled murrelet (''Brachyramphus marmoratus'')]]
[[File:Northern Spotted Owl.USFWS.jpg|thumb|Threatened [[northern spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis caurina''). A project, such as planned logging, that might lead to habitat destruction of the northern spotted owl would require submitting a Habitat Conservation Plan as part of its Incidental Take Permit.]]
Alternatively, the large-scale HCP created for 211,700 acres of the [[Headwaters Forest]] in [[Northern California]] near [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] dealt with the largest [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[redwood]] ecosystem in the United States.  The threatened [[northern spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis caurina'') and [[marbled murrelet]] (''Brachyramphus marmoratus'') rely on the large redwoods for [[nest]]ing as well as the threatened [[coho salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus kisutch''), who are dependent on the habitat's stream for [[spawning]].&lt;ref name="Headwaters EIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib//blm/ca/pdf/pdfs/arcata_pdfs/headwaters_final_eis.Par.0f9598a2.File.pdf/Chapter_1.pdf  |title=Final Headwaters Forest Reserve Resource Management Plan/EIS/EIR |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pacific Lumber Company]], Scotia Pacific Holding Company, and Salmon Creek Company (collectively known as PALCO) created an HCP in 1998 that addressed road building and timber harvest as the greatest threats to the species.  The resulting extensive mitigation and monitoring measures provided strict restrictions for land use, including buffers and operational limitations in [[riparian area]]s with active murrelet nests.  The HCP also maintained that northern spotted owl nesting, [[Roosting#Resting and roosting|roosting]], and [[foraging]] habitat be provided and maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resources.ca.gov/headwaters/hcp/index.html |title=Headwaters Habitat Conservation Plan/Sustained Yield Plan |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114125723/http://resources.ca.gov/headwaters/hcp/index.html |archivedate=2010-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses of HCPs==
The environmental community and landowners take different stands on HCPs.

'''Strengths:'''
* Flexible to accommodate a wide range of projects that vary greatly in size and scope.
* Forces consideration of species by all parties.
* Reduced uncertainty for landowners.&lt;ref name="UMich"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/hcp.html |title=Introduction to Habitat Conservation Planning |date= |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weaknesses:'''
* Inflexible with regards to changing knowledge relating to species and habitat.
* The "No Surprises Policy" has been highly controversial with critics arguing that it burdens the agencies, rather than landowners, with additional financial and mitigation responsibilities if unforeseen circumstances arise.
* HCPs are viewed as having weak and insufficient monitoring plans.  Additionally, the parties responsible for monitoring HCPs are not regulated in a systematic manner due to private funding.
* Criticism over scientific standards and limited credible scientific data.
* Agencies have interpreted the role of HCPs under section 10(a) of the ESA as a means to contribute to survival of species but not as a recovery tool.  The Habitat Conservation Planning Handbook is inconsistent with this stand and states that "…contribution to recovery is often an integral product of an HCP…" and in general, conservation plans that are not consistent with recovery plan objectives should be discouraged".&lt;ref name="UMich" /&gt;

==The role of HCPs in court (previous cases/standing)==
[[File:Icaricia icarioides missionensis 3.jpg|thumb|Endangered mission blue butterfly (''Icaricia icarioides missionensis''), protected by the San Bruno Mountain HCP.]]
[[File:Alabama Beach Mouse.jpg|thumb|Endangered [[Alabama beach mouse]] (''Peromyscus polionotus ammobates'') at issue in ''Sierra Club v. Babbitt'', in which it was threatened by beachfront condominium development.]]
The number of approved HCPs has grown since the first HCP was created in 1983 for [[San Bruno Mountain]] in [[San Mateo County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=5446ABBC-98D5-18CC-41C440502A36C91B |title=Amendments Proposed for Nation's First Habitat Conservation Plan to Improve Protection of Rare Species on San Bruno Mountain|date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress wanted the San Bruno Mountain HCP to serve as a model for future HCPs in that it was created from "an independent exhaustive biological study" and that it considered the habitat of the [[mission blue butterfly]] (Aricia icarioides missionensis) "to allow for enhancement of the survival of the species".&lt;ref name="UMich" /&gt;
This model has drawn concern because it focuses more on species survival, while the intent of HCPs is to aid species recovery;&lt;ref name="HCP" /&gt; and has resulted in HCPs being frequently challenged in court.  In ''Sierra Club v. Babbitt, 15 F. Supp. 2D 1274 (S.D.Ala.1998)'', the Plaintiff challenged the USFWS issuance of Incidental Take Permits to the developers of two beachfront condominium projects based on the HCPs submitted as part of the application process.  The Plaintiffs argued that the HCPs created for the endangered [[Alabama beach mouse]] (''Peromyscus polionotus ammobates'') did not fulfill the requirements of ESA section 10(a)(2)(B) requiring the development of "a mitigation program that will minimize and mitigate the impacts of the proposed taking to the maximum extent practicable".&lt;ref name="Alabama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/ealr/vol26/iss1/4/ |title=Habitat Conservation Plans Under Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act: The Alabama Beach Mouse and the Unfulfilled Mandate of Species Recovery |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Plaintiff argued that there was insufficient biological data for the Alabama beach mouse species in the HCP, including population abundance, to determine allowable levels of take.  The Court found for the Plaintiffs and remanded the decision to issue the Incidental Take Permits to USFWS.

'''House of Assembly''' is a name given to the [[legislature]] or [[lower house]] of a [[bicameral]] parliament. In some countries this may be at a [[subnational]] level.

Historically, in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colonies]] as the colony gained more internal [[responsible government]], the House of Assembly superseded the (usually unelected) [[Legislative Council]] as the [[Colonialism|colonial]] legislature, often becoming the lower house.

'''Infomaniak''' is [[Switzerland]]'s largest [[Web hosting service|web-hosting]] company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.letemps.ch/economie/2016/02/11/infomaniak-accelere-diversification|title=Infomaniak accélère sa diversification|last=Seydtaghia|first=Anouch|date=11 February 2016|website=|publisher=[[Le Temps]]|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; also offering [[Streaming media|live-streaming]] and [[video on demand]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.migrosmagazine.ch/societe/reportage/article/chefs-d-entreprise-entre-travail-et-sommeil-un-equilibre-difficile-a-trouver|title=Chefs d'entreprise: entre travail et sommeil, un équilibre difficile à trouver|last=Willemin|first=Alexandre|date=10 June 2013|website=|publisher=MM|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company started as a [[Users' group|user group]] founded in 1990 by Boris Siegenthaler in the [[Canton of Geneva]], offering a [[bulletin board system]] to its members. In 1994, Siegenthaler and fellow developer Fabian Lucchi opened the Siegenthlaer &amp; Lucchi computer store in the Genevan suburb of [[Vernier, Switzerland|Châtelaine]]. They offered low-cost, custom-built computers – acting as an alternative to the larger distributors available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/ineditpublications/docs/focus_pme_03_2014_light|title=Dans l'antre romand des geeks|last=Praz|first=Nathalie|date=March 2014|work=Focus PME|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the pair purchased a [[modem]] and [[Digital subscriber line|64 kbs line]], becoming the first privately owned [[Internet service provider]] in the canton (after [[CERN]] and the [[University of Geneva]]). From 1995 on and for a few months, the store offered complimentary internet access to all customers who purchased a computer with them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infomaniak.com/documents/Historique_Infomaniak.pdf|title=Historique d'Infomaniak|last=Boris|first=Siegenthaler|year=2013|website=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 1997, Infomaniak became a fully-fledged ISP with the creation of TWS Infomaniak SA – the company developed its offer based on low-cost [[internet access]] and web-hosting services alongside its staple of computer equipment retail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 1 January 1998, the Swiss [[state monopoly]] on [[Telecommunications in Switzerland|telecom services]] came to an end and new providers were allowed onto the Swiss market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beta.letempsarchives.ch/page/JDG_1997_11_06/13/article/9600387/monopole%20swisscom|title=Swisscom et Sunrise concluent un premier accord tarifaire|date=6 November 1997|website=|publisher=[[Le Temps]]|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunrise Communications AG|Sunrise]], a joint-venture between [[TDC A/S|Tele Danmark]] and [[BT Group|BT]], started offering free internet access services, forcing the company to revise its strategy: in 1999, TWS Infomaniak was reincorporated to create Infomaniak Network. They specialised in web-hosting services for private users and [[small and medium-sized enterprises]], including basic.ch, the first Swiss [[Internet radio|web radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.letemps.ch/no-section/1998/05/22/radio-basic-diffuse-net-meilleur-musiques-electroniques|title=Basic diffuse sur le net le meilleur des musiques électroniques|date=22 May 1998|website=|publisher=[[Le Temps]]|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, Infomaniak was the largest web-host in [[Romandy|Western Switzerland]], and by July 2005, it was the largest web-radio broadcaster in Western Switzerland and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://remixjobs.com/|title=Infomaniak Network|year=2015|website=|publisher=Remix Jobs|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company created and launched their [[Sustainability organizations|sustainability charter]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pages.rts.ch/emissions/ttc/6367960-le-cout-du-terrorisme-tsunami-monetaire.html#6367962|title=T.T.C.

In 2010, the company created a subsidiary – Infomaniak Entertainment – marking the company's expansion into the ticketing, staff, and accreditation-management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/fr/u/infomaniak_entertainment_sa_CH-660.2.138.010-1.htm|title=Infomaniak Entertainment SA Carouge GE – Moneyhouse|website=moneyhouse.ch|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infomaniak's main business remains as a webhost and registrar. In 2011, the company announced that they managed more than 100,000 [[domain name]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/ineditpublications/docs/focus_pme_03_2014_light|title=La success-story d'un geek romand|last=Praz|first=Nathalie|year=2014|newspaper=Focus PME|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They opened their third [[data centre]] in 2014. As with all their facilities, the new data centre was fully sustainable – using 100% [[renewable energy]] and low-voltage technologies. The centre was heralded as the "greenest there is in Switzerland" with a [[Power usage effectiveness|PUE]] under 1.1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cominmag.ch/infomaniak-14-daugmentation-du-chiffre-daffaires-en-2014/|title=Infomaniak : 14% d'augmentation du chiffre d'affaires en 2014|date=14 April 2015|work=Cominmag|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the company the Geneva sustainability prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ge.ch/agenda21/actualites/bourse-prix-distinction-laureats-2015|title=Bourse, prix et distinction : lauréats 2015 {{!}} Agenda 21 – République et canton de Genève (Suisse) – ge.ch|date=2015|website=ge.ch|publisher=Canton of Geneva|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Infomaniak obtains its [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001]] and [[ISO 50001]] certifications for environmental and energy management systems.

Infomaniak fully switched to [[Solid-state drive|SSD technology]] at the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.presseportal.ch/fr/pm/100057093/100780861|title=Première suisse: Infomaniak équipe ses Datacenters avec des disques durs SSD / Amélioration significative des performances|date=23 November 2015|newspaper=presseportal.ch|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest figures from the company suggest that it managed more than 200,000 domain names, 150,000 site, and 350 radio/TV stations in 2016. It has also become one of the first web companies to implement the new [[Let's Encrypt]] [[SSL Certificates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nextinpact.com/news/97897-lets-encrypt-disponible-chez-infomaniak-comment-activer-certificat-ssltls-gratuit.htm|title=Let's Encrypt disponible chez Infomaniak : comment activer un certificat SSL/TLS gratuit|last=Legrand|first=David|date=1 February 2016|work=Next INpact|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to CEO Boris Siegenthaler, Infomaniak's customer base is composed of businesses (70%) and individuals (30%), small to mid-sized businesses representing a significant portion of sales. Around 30% of customers come from France and Belgium, and as of 2016, the company had 60 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hostadvice.com/blog/infomaniak-interview/|title=Infomaniak is top of mind in Switzerland, emerged from unconventional roots – Interview with Boris Siegenthaler, CEO of Infomaniak|date=28 March 2016|website=HostAdvice|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Journal of Things We Like (Lots)''''', better known as '''Jotwell''', is an online legal journal specializing in short reviews of recent scholarship relevant to the law.  It is run from the [[University of Miami School of Law]] and appears at [http://www.jotwell.com jotwell.com].   Unlike many typical law journals, most of which are edited by students, ''Jotwell'' is primarily edited by the faculty editors of each section.

== Overview ==

Founded in 2008, ''Jotwell'' publishes short reviews (or “jots”) by law professors of what they believe to be the best recent scholarship relevant to their field. These jots are typically 500–1,000 words.

''Jotwell'' is organized into [[#Sections|sections]], each reflecting a subject area of legal specialization, such as constitutional law, corporate law, and intellectual property law.  Each section is managed by section editors with independent editorial control. The section editors select 10-20 contributing editors, each of whom commits to writing once a year, ensuring that every section publishes an article once or twice per month.

The main site, jotwell.com, aggregates the content from all the sections.  New articles appear between three and five times per week.  All content is available for free and open to reader comment. ''Jotwell'' carries no advertising and is supported by the [[University of Miami School of Law]].

''Jotwell''{{'s}} editor-in-chief is [[A. Michael Froomkin]], the Laurie Silvers &amp; Mitchell Rubenstein Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Miami School of Law. ''Jotwell'' is published using [[WordPress]] and a custom theme.

All ''Jotwell'' articles are available under a [[Creative Commons license]], the Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 License.

''Jotwell'' states that its objective is to help academics and others identify the best recent legal scholarship, a task made necessary by the proliferation of [[law review]]s – more than 350 in North America alone.  The journal’s mission statement also argues that new scholarly intermediaries are needed now that major journals such as the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' no longer function as “gatekeepers of legitimacy”.&lt;ref name="Jotwell Mission Statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jotwell Mission Statement|url=http://jotwell.com/mission-statement/|publisher=Jotwell|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies, a professor at [[George Mason University School of Law]] and the editor-in-chief of ''[[The Green Bag]]'' suggested that if ''Jotwell'' were to expand "its coverage to include the best old (as well as new) legal scholarship, and occasionally narrowing its focus to the questions presented in a Supreme Court case, it could produce first rate amicus briefs of scholarship" which would help the Supreme Court find scholarship relevant to its decisions.&lt;ref name="In Search of Helpful Legal Scholarship, Part 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ross A.|title=In Search of Helpful Legal Scholarship, Part 1|url=http://journaloflaw.us/00%20Opening%20Remarks/JoL2-1,%20OR2-1,%20Davies.pdf|journal=The Journal of Law|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–10|year=2012|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[ABA Journal]] selected Jotwell as one of its 'Blawg 100' - the top legal blogs of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABA Blawg 100|url=http://www.abajournal.com/blawg100|website=abajournal.com|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jotwell'' has also been called an example of a trend towards web-only law journals.&lt;ref name="Three Invitations to Law and Commentary"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ross A.|journal=Law and Commentary|volume=1|issue=1|year=2011|pages=87–94|title=Three Invitations to Law and Commentary|url=http://journaloflaw.us/2%20Law%20and%20Commentary/1-1/JoL1-1,%20LC1-1,%20Davies.pdf|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized as "highly US-centric" even if "really neat".&lt;ref name="Law firms, the ideology of hypercompetitiveness, and gender, PLUS Jotwell.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sonia|last=Lawrence|title=Law firms, the ideology of hypercompetitiveness, and gender, PLUS Jotwell.com|url=http://ifls.osgoode.yorku.ca/2010/08/law-firms-the-ideology-of-hypercompetitiveness-and-gender-plus-jotwell-com/|publisher=Institute for Feminist Legal Studies at Osgoode|date=8 August 2010|accessdate=30 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109064248/http://ifls.osgoode.yorku.ca/2010/08/law-firms-the-ideology-of-hypercompetitiveness-and-gender-plus-jotwell-com/|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jotwell'' has also been criticized for focusing too much on "articles placed in top law journals."&lt;ref name="Something I Do Not Like Lots"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sergio|last=Campos|title=Something I Do Not Like Lots|url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2012/10/something-i-do-not-like-lots.html|publisher=PrawfsBlawg|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holocaust denial]], the denial of the systematic [[Genocide|genocidal]] killing of approximately six million Jews in Europe by [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s and 1940s, is illegal in 16 European countries and [[Israel]]. Many countries also have broader laws that criminalize [[genocide denial]]. Of the countries that ban Holocaust denial, some, such as [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]], were among the perpetrators of [[the Holocaust]], and many of these also ban other elements associated with [[Nazism]], such as the expression of [[Nazi symbols]].

'''Laws against Holocaust denial''' have been proposed in many nations (in addition to those nations that have criminalized such acts) including the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Such proposals for laws have received criticism and faced opposition, most significantly, from [[Civil Rights]] and [[Human Rights]] advocates who contend that the such laws would violate people's established rights of [[Freedom of Speech]] and [[Freedom of Expression]]. Organizations representing Jews and other groups victimized during the Holocaust have generally been split, in opinion, about such laws. 

== Overview and commentary ==
Scholars have pointed out that countries that specifically ban Holocaust denial generally have legal systems that limit speech in other ways, such as banning "[[hate speech]]". According to [[D. D. Guttenplan]], this is a split between the "''[[common law]] countries'' of the United States, Ireland and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries from the ''civil law countries'' of continental Europe and Scotland. In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries the law is generally more proscriptive. Also, under the civil law regime, the judge acts more as an inquisitor, gathering and presenting evidence as well as interpreting it".&lt;ref&gt;D D Guttenplan, [http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/europe-should-freedom-of-speech-stop-at-holo.shtml Should Freedom of Speech Stop at Holocaust Denial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115074249/http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2005/1/europe-should-freedom-of-speech-stop-at-holo.shtml |date=January 15, 2008 }}, ''Index of Free Expression, 2005''.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Whine argues that Holocaust denial can inspire violence against Jews; he states, "Jews' experience in the post-World War II era suggests that their rights are best protected in open and tolerant democracies that actively prosecute all forms of racial and religious hatred".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Whine, Michael|title=Expanding Holocaust Denial and Legislation Against It|publisher=Jewish Political Studies Review|date=Spring 2008|url=http://jcpa.org/article/expanding-holocaust-denial-and-legislation-against-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[János Kis]]&lt;ref&gt;János Kis: Szólássabadság és náci beszéd, Népszabadság, March 30, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular [[András Schiffer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mancs.hu/index.php?gcPage=/public/hirek/hir.php&amp;id=19439 Fogadatlan prókátorok – A gárdaítélet félreértelmezéseiről], [[Magyar Narancs]], July 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; feel the work of Holocaust deniers should be protected by a universal right to [[Freedom of Speech|free speech]]. 
An identical argument was used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkab.hu/content/en/en3/30_1992.pdf|title=Alkotmánybíróság - Kezdőlap|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421010839/http://www.mkab.hu/content/en/en3/30_1992.pdf|archive-date=21 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Hungarian Constitutional Court (Alkotmánybíróság) led by [[László Sólyom]] when it struck down a law against Holocaust denial in 1992.

The argument that laws punishing Holocaust denial are incompatible with the [[ECHR|European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] have been rejected by institutions of the [[Council of Europe]] (the [[European Commission of Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=X. v.

Historians who oppose such laws include [[Raul Hilberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Is There a New Anti-Semitism?

Evans]], and [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]]. Other prominent opponents of the laws are [[Timothy Garton Ash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Garton Ash |first= Timothy |date= 19 October 2006 |title= This is the moment for Europe to dismantle taboos, not erect them |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/19/comment.france |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 30 July 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Peter Singer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Singer |first= Peter |date= 1 March 2006 |title= David Irving has a right to free speech, too |url= http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=14791 |publisher= [[Jerusalem Post|JPost.com]] |accessdate= 30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chomsky |first= Noam |date= 28 February 1981 |title= His Right to Say It |url= http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19810228.htm |journal= [[The Nation]] |accessdate= 30 July 2012 |quote= [I]t is elementary that freedom of expression (including academic freedom) is not to be restricted to views of which one approves, and that it is precisely in the case of views that are almost universally despised and condemned that this right must be most vigorously defended. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An uproar resulted when [[Serge Thion]] used one of Chomsky's essays without explicit permission as a foreword to a book of Holocaust denial essays (see [[Faurisson affair]]). These laws have also been criticized on the grounds that education is more effective than legislation at combating Holocaust denial and that the laws will make martyrs out of those imprisoned for their violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/29844/a-bad-law-against-holocaust-denial|title=A bad law against Holocaust denial|author=Adam Lebor|date=March 25, 2010|publisher=Jewish Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By country ==
=== Australia ===
While [[Australia]] lacks a specific law against Holocaust denial, Holocaust denial is prosecuted in Australia under various laws against "[[hate speech]]" and "[[racial vilification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/george-brandis-holocaust-denial-would-not-become-legal-under-my-new-laws-2014-3|title=George Brandis: Holocaust Denial Would Not Become Legal Under My New Laws|author=Ben Collins|work=Business Insider Australia|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/act-news/racial-discrimination-act-changes-would-allow-holocaust-denial-says-shane-rattenbury-20140505-zr4vk.html|title=Racial Discrimination Act changes would allow Holocaust denial, says Shane Rattenbury|work=The Age|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Fredrick Töben]] and his [[Adelaide Institute]] are the best-known case of someone being prosecuted in Australia for Holocaust denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/hreoc.html|title=Letter to HREOC, Oct 1998|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
In [[Austria]], the [[Verbotsgesetz 1947]] provided the legal framework for the process of [[denazification]] in Austria and suppression of any potential [[Neo-Nazism|revival of Nazism]]. In 1992, it was amended to prohibit the denial or gross minimisation of the Holocaust.

{{Quotation|'''National Socialism Prohibition Law (1947, amendments of 1992)'''

§ 3g. He who operates in a manner characterized other than that in § § 3a – 3f will be punished (revitalising of the NSDAP or identification with), with imprisonment from one to up to ten years, and in cases of particularly dangerous suspects or activity, be punished with up to twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="austria47"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachkriegsjustiz.at/service/gesetze/gs_vg_3_1947.php|title=Verbotsgesetz 1945 in der Fassung des NSG 1947|publisher=Austrian Research Centre for Post-War Trials|language=German|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

§ 3h. As an amendment to § 3 g., whoever denies, grossly plays down, approves or tries to excuse the National Socialist genocide or other National Socialist crimes against humanity in a print publication, in broadcast or other media.&lt;ref name="austria92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachkriegsjustiz.at/service/gesetze/gs_vg_3_1992.php|title=Verfassungsgesetz vom 8.

=== Belgium ===
In [[Belgium]], Holocaust denial was made illegal in 1995.

{{Quotation|'''Negationism Law (1995, amendments of 1999)'''

Article 1 Whoever, in the circumstances given in article 444 of the Penal Code denies, grossly minimises, attempts to justify, or approves the genocide committed by the German National Socialist Regime during the Second World War shall be punished by a prison sentence of eight days to one year, and by a fine of twenty six francs to five thousand francs. For the application of the previous paragraph, the term genocide is meant in the sense of article 2 of the International Treaty of 9 December 1948 on preventing and combating genocide. In the event of repetitions, the guilty party may in addition have his civic rights suspended in accordance with article 33 of the Penal Code.

Art.2 In the event of a conviction on account of a violation under this Act, it may be ordered that the judgement, in its entity or an excerpt of it, is published in one of more newspapers, and is displayed, to the charge of the guilty party.

Art.3. Chapter VII of the First Book of the Penal Code and Article 85 of the same Code are also applicable to this Act.

Art. 4. The [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism]], as well as any association that at the time of the facts had a legal personality for at least five years, and which, on the grounds of its statutes, has the objective of defending moral interests and the honour of the resistance or the deported, may act in law in all legal disputes arising from the application of this Act.&lt;ref name="belgium"&gt;{{cite web|url=

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
In May 2007 Ekrem Ajanovic, a [[Bosniak]] MP in the Bosnian Parliament proposed a legislation on criminalizing the denial of Holocaust, genocide and crimes against humanity. This was the first time that somebody in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s Parliament proposed such a legislation. Bosnian Serb MPs voted against this legislation and proposed that such an issue should be resolved within the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preporod.com/aktuelnosti-rubrike-33/502-poricanje-genocida-proglasiti-kriviim-djelom.html PORICANJE GENOCIDA PROGLASITI KRIVIČNIM DJELOM, Prof. dr.

=== Czech Republic ===
In the [[Czech Republic]], Holocaust denial and denial of [[Mass killings under Communist regimes|communist-perpetrated atrocities]] is illegal.

{{Quotation|'''Law Against Support and Dissemination of Movements Oppressing Human Rights and Freedoms (2001)'''

§ 260 (1) The person who supports or spreads movements oppressing human rights and freedoms or declares national, race, religious or class hatred or hatred against other group of persons will be punished by prison from 1 to 5 years. (2) The person will be imprisoned from 3 to 8 years if: a) he/she commits the crime mentioned in paragraph (1) in print, film, radio, television or other similarly effective manner, b) he/she commits the crime as a member of an organized group c) he/she commits the crime in a state of national emergency or state of war.

§ 261 The person who publicly declares sympathies with such a movement mentioned in § 260, will be punished by prison from 6 months to 3 years.

§ 261a The person who publicly denies, puts in doubt, approves or tries to justify Nazi or communist genocide or other crimes of Nazis or communists will be punished by prison of 6 months to 3 years.&lt;ref name="czech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzv.cz/wwwo/default.asp?id=46561&amp;ido=13925&amp;idj=2&amp;amb=3|title=Punishment for Holocaust Denial Incorporated in Czech Law|publisher=Permanent Representation of the Czech Republic to the European Union|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== France ===
In [[France]], the [[Gayssot Act]], voted for on July 13, 1990, makes it illegal to question the existence of crimes that fall in the category of [[crimes against humanity]] as defined in the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter of 1945]], on the basis of which [[List of Nazi leaders|Nazi leaders]] were convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal]] at [[Nuremberg]] in 1945–46. When the act was challenged by [[Robert Faurisson]], the [[Human Rights Committee]] upheld it as a necessary means to counter possible [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=hrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/385c2add1632f4a8c12565a9004dc311/4c47b59ea48f7343802566f200352fea?OpenDocument|title=Communication No 550/1993 : France. 16/12/96.

=== Greece ===
In September 2014, with a vote of 54 out of 99 present of the 300-member [[Hellenic Parliament]] (the body was in summer session at the time), Greece amended its 1979 law 'On the penalization of actions or activities intending unto racial discrimination' (N.927/1979) to make malicious denial of the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity for the purposes of inciting violence, discrimination or hatred or by way of threat or insult, a criminal offense. &lt;ref name="ForwardGreece"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/205395/greece-passes-bill-making-holocaust-denial-illegal/#ixzz4C87JILbn | title=Greece Passes Bill Making Holocaust-Denial Illegal, Tougher Anti-Racism Laws | publisher=Reuters | work=Website | date=9 September 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other European countries, the Greek law is not a blanket ban on expressing the opinion that a genocide did not take place, but rather requires an additional condition of intending to cause violence, incite hatred or threaten or insult a protected group.

{{Quotation|'''LAW 927/1979 (as amended by Law 4285/2014)'''

''Article 1 – Public incitement of violence or hatred''

1. Whoever intentionally, publicly, verbally or in print, over the internet or through any other medium or means, incites, causes, arouses or solicits acts or activities which are capable of causing discrimination, hatred or violence against a person or group of persons, who are identified on the bases of race, colour, religion, genealogical background, national or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability, in a way that endagers public order or poses a threat to the life, liberty or bodily integrity of such persons, shall be imprisoned for between three (3) months and (3) years and fined between five and twenty thousand (5.000 - 20.000) euros.

[…]

''Article 2 – Public approval or denial or crimes''

1. Whoever intentionally, publicly, verbally or in print, over the internet or through any other medium or means, approves, ridicules or maliciously denies the existence or seriousness of crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, the Holocaust and other crimes of Nazism which have been recognised by decisions of international courts or the Hellenic Parliament and this behaviour is targeted against a group of people, or member thereof, which is identified on the basis of race, colour, religion, genealogical background, national or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability, when this behaviour is expressed in a way that is capable of inciting violence or hatred or is of a threatening or insulting character against such a group or a member thereof, is subject to the penalties of paragraph 1 of the previous article.&lt;ref name="LawSpot"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lawspot.gr/nomikes-plirofories/nomothesia/n-927-1979/arthro-2-nomos-927-1979-dimosia-epidokimasia-i-arnisi | title=Article 2 Law 927/1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This law was harshly criticised at the time of its passage for its vague language and alleged infringement of freedom of expression. In a letter signed by 139 Greek historians, they argued that "as international experience has shown, such provisions lead down dangerous paths: they critically wound the democratic and inalienable right to freedom of speech, while simultaneously not being at all effective in terms of fighting racism and nazism. Indeed, they often lead to the opposite result, allowing the enemies of democracy to present themselves to public opinion as "victims" of censorship and authoritarianism. The conditions set forth in the bill, being highly vague and fluid, are unfortunately not a guarantee." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=627759 | title=Historians against Article 2 of anti-racist law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prosecution under Article 2 of the law was brought against German historian [[Heinz A. Richter]], who was tried [[in absentia]] for denying Nazi atrocities in Crete during World War II. The court found Richter not guilty on the grounds that, while his work was proven to contain historical inaccuracies, there was no evidence he intended to incite hatred against the people of Crete &lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.gr/news/ellada/story/21175/athoothike-o-germanos-istorikos-xaints-rixter-gia-to-vivlio-toy-gia-tin-maxi-tis-kritis | title='German historian Heinz Richter aquited regarding his book on the battle of Crete'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the 2014 law was [[Constitution of Greece | unconstitutional]], as it violated the principle of [[freedom of speech]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rethemnosnews.gr/2016/02/%CE%B1%CE%B8%CF%8E%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%82-%CF%81%CE%AF%CF%87%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81/ | title=Professor Richter not guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Though the finding of unconstitutionality is not finally binding, as it was issued by a court of first instance, as of March 2018, no one has been successfully convicted in Greece for genocide denial under this law &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lifo.gr/articles/casus_belli/143316/ritoriki-misoys-kai-ratsistikos-logos-stin-ellada-ena-mikro-xroniko| title=Rhetoric of hate and racist speech in Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Hungary ===
The [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] of [[Hungary]] declared the denial or trivialization of the Holocaust a crime punishable by up to three years' imprisonment on February 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-criminalises-holocaust-denial-1907713.html|title=Hungary criminalises holocaust denial|agency=Associated Press|date=23 February 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was signed by [[President of Hungary|President]] [[László Sólyom]] in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20100311/president-solyom-signs-holocaust-denial-bill President Sólyom signs Holocaust denial bill], politics.hu&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 2010, the newly elected [[Fidesz]]-dominated parliament changed the formulation of the law to "punish those, who deny the genocides committed by national socialist or communist systems, or deny other facts of deeds against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/politics/nazism-communism-hungary-equate/ Hungary equates Communism to Nazism], rt.com&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Holocaust" is no longer in the law.

In 2011, the first man was charged with Holocaust denial in [[Budapest]]. The Court sentenced the man to 18 months in prison, suspended for three years, and probation. He also had to visit either Budapest's memorial museum, Auschwitz or Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. He chose his local Holocaust Memorial Center and had to make three visits in total and record his observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/02/hungarian-holocaust-denier-sentenced-visit-memorial-journal-experience_n_2602773.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Meredith | last=Bennettsmith | title=Hungary Criminalizes Holocaust Denial, Orders Man To Visit Memorial | date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the court ordered far-right on-line newspaper ''Kuruc.info'' to delete its article denying the Holocaust published in July 2013, which was the first ruling in Hungary of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20150114-a-kuruc-info-cikke-az-elso-amit-betiltottak-magyarorszagon.html|title=A Kuruc.info cikke az első, amit betiltottak Magyarországon|work=ORIGO|date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Civil Liberties (TASZ) offered free legal aid to the website as a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20150115-jogsegelyt-kinal-a-tasz-a-kuruc-infonak.html|title=Jogsegélyt kínál a TASZ a Kuruc.info-nak|work=ORIGO|date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the site refused citing the liberal views of the association, and also refused to delete the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kuruc.info/r/6/138271/|title="Jogsegélyt ajánl a Kuruc.infónak a TASZ" – nem kérünk belőle|work=Kuruc.info|date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==
The [[European Commission|European Union's Executive Commission]] proposed a European Union-wide anti-racism xenophobia law in 2001, which included the criminalization of Holocaust denial. On July 15, 1996, the [[Council of the European Union]] adopted the Joint action/96/443/JHA concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33058.htm Joint action to combat racism and xenophobia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311071238/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33058.htm |date=2009-03-11 }}.

As there is no specific crime of Holocaust denial in the UK, the German government had applied for Toben's extradition for racial and xenophobic crimes. Toben's extradition was refused by the [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]], and the German government withdrew its appeal to the High Court.

{{Quotation|'''European Union Framework Decision for Combating Racism and Xenophobia (2007)'''

The text establishes that the following intentional conduct will be punishable in all EU Member States:
&lt;br&gt;
:- Publicly inciting to violence or hatred, even by dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material, directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin.

:- '''Publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising'''
::- '''crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court''' (Articles 6, 7 and 8) directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin, and

::- '''crimes defined by the Tribunal of Nuremberg (Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, London Agreement of 1945)''' directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin.
Member States may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening, abusive or insulting.

The reference to religion is intended to cover, at least, conduct which is a pretext for directing acts against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.

Member States will ensure that these conducts are punishable by criminal penalties of a maximum of at least between 1 and 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-un.europa.eu/articles/fr/article_6960_fr.htm |title=EU Justice Ministers agree on racism and xenophobia proposal |date=April 19, 2007 |publisher=European Union @ United Nations |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720162517/http://www.eu-un.europa.eu/articles/fr/article_6960_fr.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The layered model of telecommunication regulation is a proposal for nascent US telecommunication public policies that mimic the horizontal characteristics of [[Internet Protocol]] communication and the [[OSI model]].  Advocates of layered telecommunication policies argue that current US regulations are not longer appropriate for new information technologies as functionally similar services (such as [[DSL]] and [[cable modems]]) are not governed by a common set of rules but instead subject to separate regulatory systems written for each distinct media type such as the [[Telephone network|telephone]] or [[cable television system]]s.&lt;ref name="Richard S. Whitt"&gt;{{cite paper|author=Richard S. Whitt|title=A horizontal leap forward: Formulating a new communications public policy framework based on the network layers  model|date=2004-05-20|publisher=MCI|url=http://law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v56/no3/Whitt%20Final%202.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layered policy model proposes a regulatory system that classifies technologies based on their common layered characteristics instead of regulating each communication technology with a disparate set of rules.  Horizontal policy advocates argue that this modular approach to regulation promotes competition by forcing all telecommunication services to adhere to a uniform set of characteristic-based rules, thereby enhancing the competitive characteristics of an open marketplace.&lt;ref name="Douglas C. Sicker"&gt;{{cite paper|author=Douglas C. Sicker|title=Further Defining a Layered Model for Telecommunications Policy|date=2002-09-01|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|url=http://tprc.org/papers/2002/95/TPRC_Layered_model.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Layered policy advocates argue that horizontal policies will provide regulatory clarity for current technologies and they will also be adaptable to future technologies.  Layered policies could also provide an equal framework for local governments to provide [[municipal broadband]] services in a fair and competitive manner alongside private telecommunication providers.&lt;ref name="Lawler, M."&gt;{{cite paper|author=Maxwell J.

'''''Mangold v Helm''''' (2005) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62004CJ0144&amp;from=EN C-144/04] was a case before the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ).

==Facts==
Mangold was a 56-year-old [[Germany|German]] man employed on a fixed term contract in a permanent [[full-time job]]. The German government introduced the so-called Employment Promotion Act 1996 (''Beschäftigungsförderungsgesetz'') which allowed fixed term contracts for a two-year maximum, and otherwise were unlawful unless they could be objectively justified. But even this protection was removed (apparently to "promote employment") if the employee was over 60. Further amendments then changed the age to 52. Mr Mangold claimed that the lack of protection, over age 52, was unjustified age discrimination.

==Judgment==
The ECJ held in its judgment the German law contravened the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]], even though it did not have to be implemented until the end of 2006. It said that, in general terms, legislation that lets employers treat people differently because of their age “offends the principle” in international law of eliminating discrimination on the basis of age. The ECJ ruled that national courts must set aside any provision of national law which conflicts with the directive even before the period for implementation has expired.

{{Cquote|64. ... application of national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings leads to a situation in which all workers who have reached the age of 52, without distinction, whether or not they were unemployed before the contract was concluded and whatever the duration of any period of unemployment, may lawfully, until the age at which they may claim their entitlement to a retirement pension, be offered fixed-term contracts of employment which may be renewed an indefinite number of times. This significant body of workers, determined solely on the basis of age, is thus in danger, during a substantial part of its members’ working life, of being excluded from the benefit of stable employment which, however, as the Framework Agreement makes clear, constitutes a major element in the protection of workers.

65. In so far as such legislation takes the age of the worker concerned as the only criterion for the application of a fixed-term contract of employment, when it has not been shown that fixing an age threshold, as such, regardless of any other consideration linked to the structure of the labour market in question or the personal situation of the person concerned, is objectively necessary to the attainment of the objective which is the vocational integration of unemployed older workers, it must be considered to go beyond what is appropriate and necessary in order to attain the objective pursued. Observance of the principle of proportionality requires every derogation from an individual right to reconcile, so far as is possible, the requirements of the principle of equal treatment with those of the aim pursued (see, to that effect, Case C-476/99 ''[[Lommers]]'' [2002] ECR I‑2891, paragraph 39). Such national legislation cannot, therefore, be justified under Article 6(1) of [[Directive 2000/78]].

[...]

75. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of age must thus be regarded as a general principle of Community law. Where national rules fall within the scope of Community law, which is the case with Paragraph 14(3) of the TzBfG, as amended by the Law of 2002, as being a measure implementing Directive 1999/70 (see also, in this respect, paragraphs 51 and 64 above), and reference is made to the Court for a preliminary ruling, the Court must provide all the criteria of interpretation needed by the national court to determine whether those rules are compatible with such a principle (Case C-442/00 ''Rodríguez Caballero'' [2002] ECR I-11915, paragraphs 30 to 32).

76. Consequently, observance of the general principle of equal treatment, in particular in respect of age, cannot as such be conditional upon the expiry of the period allowed the Member States for the transposition of a directive intended to lay down a general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of age, in particular so far as the organisation of appropriate legal remedies, the burden of proof, protection against victimisation, social dialogue, affirmative action and other specific measures to implement such a directive are concerned.}}

==Significance==
Because it recognised that equal treatment is a general principle of EU law, ''Mangold v Helm'' is significant for three critical reasons. First, it means that a claim for equal treatment is available for private citizens on a horizontal direct effect basis. It is unnecessary to wait for a Directive to have been implemented before making a claim to have caused discrimination. Second, it means that member state and EU legislation, like Directives, may be challenged on the ground that they fail to comply with the general principle of equal treatment. Third, because the court did not limit its remarks to the particular grounds of discrimination presently found in the equal treatment Directives (on sex, race, and disability, belief, sexual orientation and age) it follows that claims against unjustified discrimination on the basis of other characteristics may be possible (such as [[caste]], [[education]], property or military service). It would be likely to reflect the jurisprudence from the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], where [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 14 - discrimination|Article 14]] which lists similar grounds to those already in the EU Directives but also adds "or other status".

The '''Marine Insurance Act 1906''' (8 Edw. 7 c.41) is a UK Act of Parliament regulating [[marine insurance]]. The Act applies both to "ship &amp; cargo" marine insurance, and to [[protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I cover]]. 

The Act was drafted by Sir [[Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers]], who had earlier drafted the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]]. The Act is a codifying act, that is to say, it attempts to collate existing common law and present it in a statutory (i.e. “codified”) form.  In the event, the Act did more than merely codify the law, and some new elements were introduced in 1906. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 has been highly influential, as it  governs not merely English Law, but it also dominates marine insurance worldwide through its wholesale adoption by other jurisdictions.

Two modern statutes, the [[Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012]] (“CIDRA”) and the [[Insurance Act 2015]] have made amendments to the law of insurance.

==Overview==
The most important sections of this Act include:

:s.4: a policy without [[insurable interest]] is void.

:s.17: imposes a duty on the insured of ''[[Uberrima fides|uberrimae fides]]'' (as opposed to ''[[caveat emptor]]''); ie. that questions must be answered honestly and the risk not misrepresented.

:s.18: the proposer of the insurer has a duty to disclose all material facts relevant to the acceptance and rating of the risk. Failure to do so is known as ''non-disclosure'' or ''concealment'' (there are minor differences in the two terms) and renders the insurance voidable by the insurer.

:s.33(3): ''If [a warranty] be not [exactly] complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.''

:s.34(2): where a warranty has been broken, it is no defence to the insured that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, prior to the loss.

:s.34(3): a breach of warranty may be ''[[Waiver|waived]]'' by the insurer.

:s.50: a policy may be [[Assignment (law)|assigned]]. Typically, a shipowner might assign the benefit of a policy to the ship-mortgagor.

:ss.60-63: deals with the issues of a constructive total loss. The insured can, by notice, claim for a constructive total loss with the insurer becoming entitled to the ship or cargo if it should later turn up. (By contrast an ''actual total loss'' describes the physical destruction of a vessel or cargo.)

:s.79: deals with [[subrogation]]; ie. the rights of the insurer to stand in the shoes of an [[indemnity|indemnified]] insured and recover [[marine salvage|salvage]] for his own benefit.

Schedule 1 of the Act contains a list of definitions; schedule 2 contains the model policy wording.

==Reform==
The Marine Insurance Act 1906 was beginning to show its age, and a consultative process has been underway to reform the Act. During the review. the [[Law Commission]] examined ''inter alia'' the issues of [[uberrimae fidei]], disclosure and insurable interest. Insurance involves the transference of risk in return for payment of a premium, and it is necessary for the assured to make to the insurer a full disclosure of all material risks.

It had been expected that both the 1906 and 1909 Act might be repealed and replaced by a single new statute, closely resembling its  predecessor, with similar phraseology and section numbering. Perhaps disappointingly, the reforms have taken a different course: two new statutes, the [[Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012]] (“CIDRA”) and the [[Insurance Act 2015]] have addressed insurance in general, and have amended the law in several ways.

Part 5 of the  Insurance Act 2015 addresses  "Good faith" as follows:
* Section 14 provides that "any rule of law permitting a party to a contract of insurance to avoid the contract on the ground that [[uberrimae fides|utmost good faith]] has not been observed by the other party is abolished.
* Accordingly, s,14(3) amends s.17 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 to read: "A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith"  and that section's subsequent words: "and, if the utmost good faith be not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided by the other party" are now omitted.

In the [[United States]], a '''Minor in Possession''', or a '''MIP''', (also referred to as a PAULA, Possession of Alcohol Under the Legal Age) is illegal, typically a [[misdemeanor]]. In California, depending on the county in which the person is charged, the crime may also be charged as an infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcohol and the Law: Minor in Possession (MIP) and Fake ID|url=http://sa.berkeley.edu/legal/tipsheet/alcohol|website=Division of Student Affairs|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who is under the age of 21 and possesses [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in the United States, with the exception of special circumstances, is violating the law of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underage Drinking: Possession/Consumption/Internal Possession of Alcohol|url=https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/Underage_Possession_Consumption_Internal_Possession_of_Alcohol.html|website=Alcohol Policy Information System|publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Minor in Possession" is a [[misnomer]], because Americans between 18 and 20 years old are not [[minor (law)|minors]] but legal adults, except for residents of [[Mississippi]] and 18-year-old residents of [[Alabama]] and [[Nebraska]].

==Punishments==
Punishments for minors in possession vary greatly from state-to-state. Since alcohol enforcement (and the establishment of drinking ages) is the responsibility of the individual states, only local and state agencies can legally write a minors in possession citation. As such, each state levies its own fines and punishments for a minors in possession.

In some states, a simple first-time minors in possession without any other circumstances (such as driving or public intoxication) may only involve a fine of $100–200. Often fines are reduced or eliminated provided the person convicted completes a program such as alcohol education, [[probation]], or [[community service]]. In some states, a fine is eliminated, supplemented or accompanied with a loss of the accused driver license for a period of time ranging from 30 days to 12 months.  For example, violation of California's Business &amp; Professions Code Section 25662, regarding persons under 21 in possession of alcohol, carries a punishment of $250 and a mandatory revocation of driving privileges for one year in accordance with Vehicle Code Section 13202.5.

Subsequent offenses or a person with a preexisting criminal record may frequently receive a full fine, or in some extreme cases, several days in jail. In many cases a third MIP may result in a loss of the accused driver's license until the age of 21.

In [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]], the statutes impose that: providing to and possession of alcohol by minors (persons under 21) is a gross misdemeanor with a potential of $5,000 and a year in jail.  Washington State's law does not apply to liquor given or permitted to be given to a person under the age of twenty-one years by a parent or guardian and consumed in the presence of the parent or guardian.  Additionally, this RCW does not authorize consumption or possession of liquor by a person under the age of twenty-one years on any premises licensed by the state, such as a bar or restaurant.  Also, A person under the age of twenty-one years who experiences alcohol poisoning and is in need of medical assistance shall not be charged or prosecuted under subsection (2)(a) of this section, if the evidence for the charge was obtained as a result of the poisoning and need for medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=66.44.270&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force''', also known as the '''monopoly on violence''' ({{lang-de|Gewaltmonopol des Staates}}), is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to [[Jean Bodin]]'s 1576 work ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six livres de la République]]'' and [[Thomas Hobbes]]' 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=If first described by Weber, how does it date to Bodin and Hobbes?|date=February 2016}} As the defining conception of the [[state (polity)|state]], it was first described in sociology by [[Max Weber]] in his essay ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Books, 2015, pp. 129-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber claims that the state is the "only human [[Gemeinschaft]] which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated [[use of force|use of physical force]]. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state."&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. Palgrave Books 2015, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize  physical force against residents of its territory. Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of [[Legitimation#Power and influence|legitimation]].

==Max Weber's theory==
[[Max Weber]] wrote in ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' that a fundamental characteristic of statehood is the claim of such a monopoly.  His expanded definition was that something is "a 'state' if and insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim on the 'monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force' ({{lang-de|das Monopol legitimen physischen Zwanges}}) in the enforcement of its order."&lt;ref name=weber64&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|title=The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization|year=1964|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0684836409|pages=154|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-WaBpsJxaOkC&amp;dq=The+Theory+of+Social+and+Economic+Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber1921&gt;Weber, Max. Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (1921). p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's concept has been formalized to show that the exclusive policing power of the state benefits social welfare via private property, provided the state acts benevolently in the interest of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;K. Grechenig, M. Kolmar, The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2404617 Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) 2014, vol. 170 (1), 5-23].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Weber, the state is that "human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence within a given territory."  The public [[police]] and [[military]] are its main instruments, but [[private security]] might also be considered to have "the 'right' to use violence" so long as the sole source of this perceived right is state sanction.  Weber applied several caveats to his discussion of the state's monopoly of violence:
* He intended the statement as a contemporary observation, noting that the connection between the state and the use of physical force has not always been so close. He uses the examples of [[feudalism]], where [[feud|private warfare]] was permitted under certain conditions, and of [[Church courts|religious courts]], which had sole jurisdiction over some types of offenses, especially [[heresy]] and sex crimes (thus the nickname "bawdy courts"). Regardless, the state exists wherever a single authority can legitimately authorize violence.
* For the same reasons, the "monopoly" does not mean that only the government may use physical force, but that the state is that human community that successfully claims for itself to be the only source of legitimacy for all physical coercion or adjudication of coercion. For example, the law might permit individuals to use force in defense of one's [[Self-defense|self]] or [[Defence of property|property]], but this right derives from the state's authority. This conflicts directly with enlightenment principles of individual sovereignty that delegates power to the state by consent, and concepts of [[natural law]] that hold that individual rights deriving from sapient [[self-ownership]] preexist the state and are only recognised and guaranteed by the state which may be restricted from limiting them by [[constitutional law]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Criticisms of Weber ===
[[Robert Bates (political scientist)|Robert Hinrichs Bates]] argues that the state itself has no violent power; rather, the people hold all the power of coercion to ensure that order and other equilibriums hold up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BATES|first=R.|last2=GREIF|first2=A.|last3=SINGH|first3=S.|title=Organizing Violence|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=46|issue=5|pages=599–628|doi=10.1177/002200202236166|year=2002|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3707095}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this is that there is a frontier of well-being in stateless societies, that can only be surpassed if some level of coercion or violence is used to elevate the complexity of the state. In other words, without investing in troops, police, or some sort of enforcement mechanism, early states cannot enjoy the law and order (or prosperity) of more developed states.

==Relation to state capacity ==
The capacity of a state is often measured in terms of its [[Fiscal capacity|fiscal]] and [[Capacity (law)|legal capacity]]. Fiscal capacity meaning the state's ability to recover taxation to provide public goods, and legal capacity meaning the state's supremacy as sole arbiter of conflict resolution and contract enforcement. Without some sort of [[coercion]], the state would not otherwise be able to enforce its legitimacy in its desired sphere of influence.  In early and developing states, this role was often played by the "stationary bandit" who defended villagers from roving bandits, in the hope that the protection would incentivize villagers to invest in economic production, and the stationary bandit could eventually use its coercive power to expropriate some of that wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=September 1993|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where state presence is minimally felt, non-state actors can use their monopoly of violence to establish legitimacy and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sicilian Mafia: the business of private protection|last=Gambetta|first=Diego|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Sicilian Mafia originated as a [[protection racket]] providing buyers and sellers in the black market with protection. Without this type of enforcement, market participants would not be otherwise confident enough to trust their counter-parties for valid contract enforcement and the market would collapse.

Even in illicit and underground markets (somewhat akin to stateless societies), violence is used to enforce contracts in the absence of accessible legal conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owens|first=Emily Greene|date=2011|title=Are Underground Markets Really More Violent?

The '''Montana Justice Foundation (MJF)''', founded in 1979, is a charitable, non-profit organization that purports to make justice accessible to all Montanans.&lt;ref name="mtjustice"&gt;{{cite web|author=Montana Justice Foundation |url=http://www.mtjustice.org/ |title=Montana Justice Foundation |publisher=Mtjustice.org |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The MJF is the charitable arm of the [[State Bar of Montana]]. It funds and supports organizations committed to ensuring that all Montanans, especially the vulnerable and under served, have meaningful access to the civil justice system. [[IOLTA]] (Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts) funds are collected by the MJF and distributed through a comprehensive grants program. The MJF strategically and objectively allocates its resources to dozens of outstanding legal aid organizations and access to justice initiatives in the state of Montana. Its primary focus is the funding of the [[Montana Legal Services Association]].  However, as IOLTA funds permit, other grants are awarded.  Past grantee organizations have included Domestic Violence Education &amp; Services (DOVES), CASA of Missoula, Eastern Montana CASA/GAL, Community Mediation Center of Bozeman, The Nurturing Center, Community Dispute Resolution Center of Missoula, and Cascade County Law Clinic.&lt;ref name="mtjustice" /&gt;

Clients who receive assistance through guarantee organizations are primarily at 125% of the Federal poverty rate or lower. The legal services provided focus on clients’ most basic human needs: preserving housing, protecting subsistence income, obtaining access to health care, providing food and clothing for families and maintaining their safety, independence, and dignity.&lt;ref name="mtjustice" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1026">The [[American Federation of Labor]]'s '''National Committee for Moderation of the [[Volstead Act]]''' was created in January 1931. It was headed by Matthew Woll, who testified before a Congressional committee that workers and [[organized labor]] opposed [[prohibition]]. Labor leadership argued that the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] establishing prohibition was the first instance in American history when an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] denied rights instead of creating or expanding them. The Committee's activities helped lead to the [[repeal of prohibition]].

Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', 160 Delhi Law Times 277 (Delhi High Court 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826035913/http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/APS/judgement/02-07-2009/APS02072009CW74552001.pdf |date=26 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a landmark Indian case decided by a two-judge bench of the [[Delhi High Court]], which held that treating consensual [[homosexual]] sex between adults as a crime is a violation of [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] protected by [[India|India's]] [[Constitution of India|Constitution]]. The verdict resulted in the decriminalization of homosexual acts involving consenting adults throughout India. This was later overturned by the Supreme Court of India in [[Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz Foundation]], in which a 2 judge bench reinstated [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]]. However, even that was overturned by a 5 judge bench in [[Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India]] in 2018, decriminalizing homosexuality once again. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/indian-supreme-court-decriminalises-homosexuality|title=Campaigners celebrate as India decriminalises homosexuality|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2018-09-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
[[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code|Section 377]] of the [[Indian Penal Code]], introduced during [[British rule of India]], criminalizes "carnal intercourse against the order of nature". This phrase was interpreted to mean all forms of sexual activity other than heterosexual penile-vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 2] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement to repeal Section 377 was led by the [[Naz Foundation (India) Trust]], a non-governmental organization, which filed a [[public interest litigation|lawsuit]] in the [[Delhi High Court]] in 2001, seeking legalisation of homosexual intercourse between consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/chronology-8yearlong-legal-battle-for-gay-rights/96152-3.html|title=Chronology: 8-year-long legal battle for gay rights|publisher=CNN-IBN|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second such petition, the first filed in 1994 by [[AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan]].&lt;ref name=humjinsi&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fernandez|editor1-first=Bina|title=Humjinsi: A Resource Book on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Rights in India|date=1999|publisher=India Centre for Human Rights and Law|location=Mumbai|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Delhi High Court refused to consider a petition regarding the legality of the law, saying that the petitioners had no ''[[locus standi]]'' in the matter. Naz Foundation appealed to the [[Supreme Court of India]] against the decision of the High Court to dismiss the petition on technical grounds. The Supreme Court decided that Naz Foundation had the standing to file a public interest lawsuit in this case, and sent the case back to the Delhi High Court to reconsider it on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/03gay.htm?q=tp&amp;file=.htm|title=Gay Rights is matter of Public Interest: SC|publisher=Rediff News|date=2006-02-03|author=Sheela Bhatt|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[National AIDS Control Organisation]] filed an affidavit stating that the enforcement of Section 377 violates [[LGBT]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-07-20/delhi/27802911_1_naco-affidavit-naz-foundation|title=Govt's AIDS cell pushes to legalise homosexuality|publisher=The Times of India|date=2006-07-20|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, there was a significant intervention in the case by a Delhi-based coalition of LGBT, women's and human rights activists called "Voices Against 377", which supported the demand to "read down" section 377 to exclude adult consensual sex from within its purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-05-20/india/27743991_1_decriminalise-homosexuality-gay-couple-pil-on-gay-rights|title=Delhi HC to take up PIL on LGBT rights|publisher=The Times of India|date=2008-05-20|author=Shibu Thomas|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement==
The case came up for hearing before a bench comprising Chief Justice [[Ajit Prakash Shah]] and Justice S. Muralidhar, and the judgment was delivered on 2 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/delhi-high-court-legalises-consensual-gay-sex/96148-3.html|title=Delhi High Court legalises consensual gay sex|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court located the rights to dignity and privacy within the right to life and liberty guaranteed by Article 21 (under the [[Fundamental_Rights_in_India#Right_to_equality|fundamental Right to Freedom]] charter) of the Constitution, and held that criminalization of consensual gay sex violated these rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 48] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court also held that Section 377 offends the guarantee of equality enshrined in Article 14 (under the [[Fundamental_Rights_in_India#Right_to_equality|fundamental Right to Equality]] charter) of the Constitution, because it creates an unreasonable classification and targets homosexuals as a class.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 91] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Public ''animus'' and disgust towards a particular social group or vulnerable minority, it held, is not a valid ground for classification under Article 14. Article 15 of the Constitution forbids discrimination based on certain characteristics, including sex. The Court held that the word "sex" includes not only biological sex but also sexual orientation, and therefore discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation is not permissible under Article 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 104] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also noted that the right to life under Article 21 includes the right to health, and concluded that Section 377 is an impediment to public health because it hinders [[HIV]]-prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 72] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court did not strike down Section 377 as a whole. The section was declared unconstitutional insofar it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private. The judgement keeps intact the provision insofar as it applies to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse and intercourse with minors. The court stated that the judgement would hold until [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] chose to amend the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi'', [http://www.ilga.org/news-upload/Delhi_high_court_decision.pdf 160 Delhi Law Times 277, p. 132] (Delhi High Court 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
According to an eyewitness account, as the Chief Justice read out the conclusion, "an audible gasp went around the room. By the time the Chief Justice had finished reading the conclusion of the judgment, people were openly weeping and there were handshakes and hugs all around."&lt;ref name="Deccan Chronicle 2009-05-07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/node/43776/print|title=Reforming Macaulay|last=Bhardwaj|first=Kajal|date=2009-05-07|work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours, news of the judgment was being carried by international news sites. Lawrence Liang called it India's ''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawandotherthings.blogspot.com/2009/07/navigating-noteworthy-and-nebulous-in.html|title=Navigating the Noteworthy and Nebulous in Naz Foundation|author=Raghavan, Vikram|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists,&lt;ref name="The Hindu 2009-07-04"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/04/stories/2009070451260300.htm|title=Gay sex judgment greeted with delight and jubilation|date=2009-07-04|work=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=2009-11-27|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; commentators and organizations like [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]]&lt;ref name="The Hindu UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/03/stories/2009070361381800.htm|title=Judgment on Section 377 welcomed|last=Aarti|first=Dhar|work=''The Hindu''|accessdate=2009-11-27|location=Chennai, India|date=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; lauded the decision, while some religious leaders&lt;ref name="The Hindu Clerics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/03/stories/2009070361341800.htm|title=Muslim clerics feel family system will be destroyed|last=Khan|first=Atiq|date=2009-07-03|work=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-11-27|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and politicians&lt;ref name="DNA 2009-08-07  "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/interview_decriminalising-homosexuality-will-send-wrong-signals_1272161|title=Decriminalising homosexuality will send wrong signals|last=Hunasavadi|first=Srikanth|date=2009-08-07|work=[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced displeasure over the judgment.

Some special leave petitions were filed in the Supreme Court requesting an interim stay of the judgment, pending an appeal. However, the Supreme Court rejected those requests.&lt;ref name="Indian Express 2009-20-07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sc-declines-to-stay-hc-verdict-on-homosexuality/491686/0|title=SC declines to stay HC verdict on homosexuality|date=2009-07-20|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A batch of appeals were filed with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], challenging the Delhi High Court judgment. On 27 March 2012, the Supreme Court reserved verdict on these.&lt;ref name='The Hindu 2012'&gt;{{cite news|title=Verdict reserved on appeals in gay sex case|work=''The Hindu''|date=27 March 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012|location=New Delhi, India|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3250607.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially opposing the judgment, the [[Attorney General of India|Attorney General]] [[G. E. Vahanvati]] decided not to file any appeal against the Delhi High Court's verdict, stating, "insofar as [Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code] criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private [before it was struck down by the High Court] was imposed upon Indian society due to the moral views of the [[British Raj|British rulers]]."&lt;ref name='The Hindu 2012' /&gt;

On December 11, 2013, the Supreme Court's two member bench (Justices [[G. S. Singhvi]] and S. J. Mukhopadhaya) overturned the decision of the Delhi High Court. It said that the 2009 order of the High Court is "constitutionally unsustainable as only Parliament can change a law, not courts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/supreme-court-says-gay-sex-is-a-criminal-offence-activists-to-seek-review-457216|title=Supreme Court says gay sex is a criminal offence, activists to seek review|date=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, on 6 September 2018, a five judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgement, decriminalized homosexuality and banned discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/indian-supreme-court-decriminalises-homosexuality#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251$s|title=Campaigners celebrate as India decriminalises homosexuality|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2018-09-06|work=the Guardian|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the new construction must be [[Building inspection|inspected]] during construction and after completion to ensure compliance with national, regional, and local [[building code]]s. Planning is also dependent on the site's zone – for example, one cannot obtain permission to build a nightclub in an area where it is inappropriate such as a high-density suburb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do I Get Planning Permission in NSW? - The Design Partnership|url=http://thedesignpartnership.com.au/planning-permission-nsw/|website=thedesignpartnership.com.au|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning permissions and liquor licences|url=http://www.vcglr.vic.gov.au/home/liquor/new+applicants/licence+application+requirements/planning+permissions+and+liquor+licences/|website=www.vcglr.vic.gov.au|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to obtain a permit can result in [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Sanctions (law)|penalties]], and [[demolition]] of unauthorized construction if it cannot be made to meet code.

==In specific industries==
===Broadcasting===
As part of [[broadcast law]], the term is also used in [[broadcasting]], where individual [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station]]s typically must apply for and receive permission to construct [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]]s and [[radio antenna]]s.  This type of permit is issued by a national broadcasting authority, but does ''not'' imply [[zoning]] any other permission that must be given by [[local government]].  The permit itself also does not necessarily imply permission to operate the station once constructed. In the U.S., a construction permit is valid for three years. Afterwards, the station must receive a full license to operate, which is good for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/help?topic=cp Construction Permits] Radio-Locator.com&lt;/ref&gt;  This is provided by a separate [[broadcast license]], also called a "license to cover" by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the United States.  Further permission or registration for [[tower]]s may be needed from [[aviation]] authorities.

In the U.S., construction permits for commercial stations are now assigned by auction, rather than the former process of determining who would serve the [[community of license]] best.  If the given [[frequency allocation]] is sought by at least one [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) applicant, or is on an NCE-reserved TV channel or in the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] reserved band, the comparative process still takes place, though the FCC refuses to consider which [[radio format]] the applicants propose.

In Canada, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] maintains a comparative process in issuing permits, ensuring that a variety of programming is available in each area, and that as many groups as possible have access to [[free speech]] over [[radio waves]].

{{Main|Privacy}}
'''Privacy law''' refers to the laws that deal with the regulating, storing, and using of [[personally identifiable information]] of individuals, which can be [[Personally identifiable information (PII) gathering|collected]] by governments, public or private organizations, or other individuals.

Privacy laws are considered within the context of an individual's [[privacy]] rights or within reasonable [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Classification of privacy laws ==
Privacy laws can be broadly classified into:
* General privacy laws that have an overall bearing on the personal information of individuals and affect the policies that govern many different areas of information.
* Specific privacy laws that are designed to regulate specific types of information. Some examples include:
** Communication privacy laws
** Financial privacy laws
** Health privacy laws
** [[Information privacy law]]s
** Online privacy laws
** Privacy in one's home

== International legal standards on privacy ==

=== Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ===
[[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] created a voluntary Privacy Framework that was adopted by all 21 member economies in 2004 in an attempt to improve general information privacy and the cross-border transfer of information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2009|title=Five years of the APEC Privacy Framework: Failure or promise?|ssrn=2022907|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Report|volume=25|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework consists of nine Privacy Principles that act as minimum standards for privacy protection: Preventing harm, Notice, Collection limitation, Use of personal information, Choice, Integrity of personal information, Security safeguards, Access and correction, and Accountability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2011, APEC implemented the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System with the goal of balancing "the flow of information and data across borders ... essential to trust and confidence in the online marketplace."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marvin, et al.|first=Lynn M.|date=2015|title=Conducting U.S. Discovery in Asia: An Overview of E-Discovery and Asian Data Privacy Laws|url=https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&amp;context=jolt|journal=Richmond Journal of Law &amp; Technology|volume=21|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four agreed-upon rules of the System are based upon the APEC Privacy Framework and include self-assessment, compliance review, recognition/acceptance, and dispute resolution and enforcement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Council of Europe ===
Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was drafted and adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] in 1950 and currently covers the whole European continent except for Belarus and Kosovo, protects the right to respect for private life: "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Through the huge case-law of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], privacy has been defined and its protection has been established as a positive right of everyone.

The Council of Europe also addressed privacy protection in regards to the Internet in 1998 when it published "Draft Guidelines for the protection of individuals with regard to the collection and processing of personal data on the information highway, which may be incorporated in or annexed to Code of Conduct."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reidenberg|first=Joel R.|date=2000|title=Resolving Conflicting International Data Privacy Rules in Cyberspace|jstor=1229516|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=52|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council developed these guidelines in conjunction with the [[European Commission]], and they were adopted in 1999.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== European Union (EU) ===
The 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] (officially Directive 95/46/EC) recognized the authority of [[National data protection authority|National data protection authorities]] and required that all [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] adhere to universal privacy protection standards.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Member States must adopt strict privacy laws that are no more relaxed than the framework provided by the directive.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhasin|first=Madan Lal|date=2016|title=Challenge of guarding online privacy: role of privacy seals, government regulations and technological solutions|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ijfa.20120106.03.html|journal=Socio-Economic Problems &amp; the State|volume=15|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Directive outlines that non-EU countries must adopt privacy legislation of equal restriction in order to be allowed to exchange personal data with EU countries. Furthermore, companies in non-EU countries must also adopt privacy standards of at least equal restriction as provided in the Directive in order to do business with companies located in EU countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, the Directive has also influenced the development of privacy legislation in non-European countries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The proposed [[EPrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation]], which would replace the [[Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002]], also contributes to EU privacy regulations.

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] will replace the Data Protection Directive of 1995 when it takes effect on 25 May 2018. A notable contribution that will come from the General Data Protection Regulation is its recognition of a "right to be forgotten", which requires any group that collects data on individuals to delete the data related to an individual upon that individual's request.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victor|first=Jacob M.|date=November 2013|title=The EU General Data Protection Regulation: Toward a Property Regime for Protecting Data Privacy|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/pdf/23744289.pdf|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=123|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulation was influenced by the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ===
In 1980, the [[OECD]] adopted the voluntary OECD Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in response to growing concerns about information privacy and data protection in an increasingly technological and connected world.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tene|first=Omar|date=2013|title=Privacy Law's Midlife Crisis: A Critical Assessment of the Second Wave of Global Privacy Laws|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ohslj74&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1255&amp;startid=&amp;endid=1300|journal=Ohio State Law Journal|volume=74|pages=|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD Guidelines helped establish an international standard for privacy legislation by defining the term "personal data" and outlining fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that other countries have adopted in their national privacy legislation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2007, the OECD adopted the Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy. This framework is based on the OECD Guidelines and includes two cooperation based model forms to encourage the enforcement of privacy laws among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdrecommendationoncross-borderco-operationintheenforcementoflawsprotectingprivacy.htm|title=OECD Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recommendation is also notable for coining the term "Privacy Enforcement Authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 1): International standards|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364911001889|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations (UN) ===
Article 17 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] of the United Nations of 1966 also protects privacy: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

On 18 December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 on the right to privacy in the digital age. The resolution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirms the fundamental and protected human right of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=III.V.7 UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 68/167 (ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE)|url=https://dx.doi.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_COM_033375|journal=International Law &amp; World Order: Weston's &amp; Carlson's Basic Documents|doi=10.1163/2211-4394_rwilwo_com_033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Privacy in Australian law}}
The current state of privacy law in Australia includes Federal and state information privacy legislation, some sector-specific privacy legislation at state level, regulation of the media and some criminal sanctions. The current position concerning civil causes of action for invasion of privacy is unclear: some courts have indicated that a tort of invasion of privacy may exist in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|QDC|151|2003|litigants=Grosse v Purvis |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|236|2008|litigants=Giller v Procopets |date=10 December 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jane Doe v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCC/2007/281.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[2007]&lt;/nowiki&gt; VCC 281], County Court of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; However this has not been upheld by the higher courts, which have been content to develop the equitable doctrine of Breach of Confidence to protect privacy, following the example set by the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 2008, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the enactment of a statutory cause of action for invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name=NZLCIP14&gt;"Invasion of privacy: penalties and remedies: review of the law of privacy: stage 3" (2009) (Issues paper 14), New Zealand Law Commission, {{ISBN|978-1-877316-67-8}}, 2009 NZIP 14 accessed 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahamas===
The Bahamas has an official data protection law that protects the personal information of its citizens in both the private and public sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a data protection officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Bahamas Law. http:// laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/ 2003/2003-0003/ DataProtectionPrivacyofPersonalInformationAct_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamas is also a member of [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]], the Caribbean Community.

===Belize===
Belize is currently part of the minority of countries that do not have any official data privacy laws.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Freedom of Information Act (2000) currently protects the personal information of the citizens of Belize, but there is no current documentation that distinguishes if this act includes electronic data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

As a consequence of the lack of official data privacy laws, there was a breach of personal data in 2009 when an employee's laptop from Belize's Vital Statistics Unit was stolen, containing birth certification information for all citizens residing in Belize. Even though the robbery was not intentionally targeting the laptop - the robber did not predict the severity of the theft - Belize was put in a vulnerable position which could have been avoided if regulations were in order.

===Brazil===
A Brazilian citizen's privacy is protected by the country's constitution, which states:

:''The intimacy, private life, honor and image of the people are inviolable, with assured right to indenization by material or moral damage resulting from its violation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988 / Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 14th, 2018 Brazil enacted a full-fledged data protection bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015-2018/2018/Lei/L13709.htm Lei 13709 Dispõe sobre a proteção de dados pessoais e altera a Lei nº 12.965, de 23 de abril de 2014 (Marco Civil da Internet) / Law 13709 Provides for the protection of personal data and amends Law no. 12.965, of April 23, 2014 ([[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet]])]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has 65 articles and has many similarities to the GDPR. The first translation into English of the new data protection law was published by [[Ronaldo Lemos]], a Brazilian lawyer specialized in technology, on that same date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pnm.adv.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Brazilian-General-Data-Protection-Law.pdf Translation of Brazil's Data Protection Law by Ronaldo Lemos]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian privacy law}}
In Canada, the federal ''[[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]]'' (PIPEDA) governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with commercial activities and personal information about employees of federal works, undertakings and businesses. It generally does not apply to non-commercial organizations or provincial governments. Personal information collected, used and disclosed by the federal government and many crown corporations is governed by the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''. Many provinces have enacted similar provincial legislation such as the Ontario ''Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act'' which applies to public bodies in that province.

There remains some debate whether there exists a common law tort for breach of privacy. There have been a number of cases identifying a common law right to privacy but the requirements have not been articulated.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Somwar v. McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd'', [2006] O.J. No. 64 for a discussion on this&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Eastmond v. Canadian Pacific Railway &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Canada''&lt;ref name=Eastmond&gt;''Eastmond v.

===France===
France adopted a data privacy law in 1978. It applies to public and private organizations and forbids gathering sensitive data about physical persons (sexuality, ethnic, political or religious opinions&amp;nbsp;...). The law is administered by the [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés]] (CNIL), a dedicated national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|title=Online Privacy Law: France {{!}} Law Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=2016-06-05|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Atwill, Nicole|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123115319/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/france.php|archive-date=2014-11-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany is known to be one of the first countries (in 1970) with the strictest and most detailed data privacy laws in the world. The citizens' right to protection is stated in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution of Germany]], in Art. 2 para. 1, and Art. 1 para. 1.&lt;ref&gt;Tschentscher, Axel, The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) 2016: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) — Introduction and Translation (Fourth Edition) (6 July 2016). {{SSRN|1501131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens' data of Germany is mainly protected under the [[Bundesdatenschutzgesetz|Federal Data Protection Act]] (1977) from corporations, which has been amended the most recently in 2009. This act specifically targets all businesses that collect information for its use. The major regulation protects the data within the private and personal sector, and as a member of the European Union (EU), Germany has additionally ratified its act, convention, and additional protocol with the EU according to the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.

In Germany, there are two kinds of restrictions on a transfer of personal data. Since Germany is part of the EU Member States, the transfer of personal data of its citizens to a nation outside the EEA is always subject to a decent level of data protection in the offshore country. Secondly, according to German data policy rules, any transfer of personal data outside the EEA symbolizes a connection to a third party which requires a reason. That reason may be for emergency reasons and a provision must be met with consent by the receiver and the subject of the data. Keep in mind that in Germany, data transfers within a group of companies are subject to same treatment as transfer to third-parties if the location is outside the EEA.

Specifically the Federal Data Protection Commission is in charge of regulating the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Germany. In addition, Germany is part of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Western Hemisphere Data Protection Laws. 2012. U.S. Department of Commerce. http://web.ita.doc.gov/ITI/itiHome.nsf/9b2cb14bda00318585256cc40068ca69/a54f62c93fd1572985257623006e32d5/$FILE/Western%20Hemisphere%20Data%20Protection%20Laws%205-12%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Data Protection Commission of Ireland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the [[Global Privacy Enforcement Network]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Regarding the protection of children, Germany is potentially the first nation that has played an active role in banning the share of data within toys connected to Wifi and the Internet, like for instance, "My Friend Cayla". The group in charge of protecting the data of children is the Federal Network Agency (the Bundessnetzagentur).&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Donell|date=16 August 2016|title=The Internet of Toys|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22041451.2016.1266124?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Communication Research and Practice|volume=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
During the military dictatorship era the 57 AK law prohibited taking photos of people without their permission but the law has since been superseded. The 2472/1997 law protects personal data of citizens but consent for taking photos of people is not required as long as they aren't used commercially or are used only for personal archiving ("οικιακή χρήση" / "home use"), for publication in editorial, educational, cultural, scientific or news publications, and for fine art purposes (e.g. [[street photography]] which has been uphold as legal by the courts whether done by professional or amateur photographers). However, photographing people or collecting their personal data for commercial (advertising) purposes requires their consent. The law gives photographers the right to commercially use photos of people who have not consented to the use of the images in which they appear if the depicted people have either been paid for the photo session as models (so there is no separation between editorial and commercial models in Greek law) or they have paid the photographer for obtaining the photo (this, for example, gives the right to wedding photographers to advertise their work using their photos of newly-wed couples they photographed in a professional capacity). In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the [[Constitution of Greece]] (Article 14&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/Vouli-ton-Ellinon/To-Politevma/Syntagma/article-14/ Article 14 of the Constitution of Hellas]&lt;/ref&gt; and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by [[Precedent|case law]] and legal cases. Photographing the police or children and publishing the photographs in a non-commercial capacity is also legal.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the law governing the protection of personal data is principally found in the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) which came into force on 20 December 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/B4DF8B4125C4214D482575EF000EC5FF/$FILE/CAP_486_e_b5.pdf Hong Kong Ordinances — Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap.486)]&lt;/ref&gt; Various amendments were made to enhance the protection of personal data privacy of individuals through the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20121627/es12012162718.pdf Hong Kong Government Gazette Ord No.18 of 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of personal data protected include names, phone numbers, addresses, identity card numbers, photos, medical records and employment records. As Hong Kong remains a common law jurisdiction, judicial cases are also a source of privacy law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/legal/ Hong Kong Department of Justice — Legal System in Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The power of enforcement is vested with the Privacy Commissioner (the "Commissioner") for Personal Data. Non-compliance with data protection principles set out in the ordinances does not constitute a criminal offense directly. The Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/or instigate the prosecution action. Contravention of an enforcement notice may result in a fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/ordinance_at_a_Glance/ordinance.html The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Right to Privacy is a [[fundamental rights in India|fundamental right]] and an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. In June 2011, India passed a new privacy package that included various new rules that apply to companies and consumers. A key aspect of the new rules requires that any organization that processes personal information must obtain written consent from the data subjects before undertaking certain activities. Application of the rule is still uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941494 Regulation of the Cloud in India], Ryan, Falvey &amp; Merchant, Journal of Internet Law, Vol 15, No. 4 (October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Aadhar Card privacy issue became controversial when the case reached the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2017/07/19/supreme-court-right-to-privacy-fundamental-right.html Aadhaar Card Privacy issue]&lt;/ref&gt;.

On August 24, 2017, a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court in [[Justice K. S.

===Ireland===
The island of Ireland is under the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] and amended by the Data Protection Act 2003 along with the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC, which regulates the utilization of personal data. [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act 1988]] along with 2003 is known as the DPA and protects data within the private and personal sector. The DPA ensures that when data is transported, the location must be safe and in acknowledgement of the legislation to maintain [[Information privacy|data privacy]]When collecting and processing data, some of the requirements are listed below:
* the subject of personal data must have given [[consent]]
* the data is in the subject's interest
* the reason for the processing of data is for a contract
* the reason for the processing of data is the prevention of injury
Specifically the [[Data Protection Commissioner]] oversees the entirety of the enforcement of data privacy regulations for Ireland. All persons that collect and process data must register with the Data Protection Commissioner unless they are exempt (non-profit organizations etc.) and renew their registration annually.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

;Electronic Privacy Protection
Considering the protection of internet property and online data, the ePrivacy Regulations 2011 protects the communications and higher-advanced technical property and data such as social media and the telephone.

In relation to international data privacy law that Ireland is involved in, the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 Section 51 extensively states the relationship between data security between the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kuner, Christopher. 2007.

In New Zealand, the Privacy Act 1993 sets out principles in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, security and access to personal information.

The introduction into the New Zealand common law of a tort covering invasion of personal privacy at least by public disclosure of private facts was at issue in ''Hosking v Runting'' and was accepted by the Court of Appeal. In ''Rogers v TVNZ Ltd'' the Supreme Court indicated it had some misgivings with how the tort was introduced, but chose not to interfere with it at that stage.

This bill is responsible for the creation of the Cybersecurity and Information Protection Agency.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; This agency is tasked with the job of preventing [[cyberattack]]s and regulating the Nigerian information technology industry.&lt;ref name="Anon 2017" /&gt; Additional laws have been passed that are meant to prevent the disclosure of information without permission and the intercepting of some form of transaction with or without evil intent.

=== Philippines ===
In Article III, Section 3, paragraph 1 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] lets its audience know that "The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law".&lt;ref&gt;"Article III, Bill of Rights. The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines." http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-iii//&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does this country grant the [[Filipinos]] the right to privacy, but it also protects its people's right to privacy by attaching consequences to the violation of it thereof. In the year 2012, the Philippines passed the Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the "Data Privacy Act of 2012". &lt;ref&gt;"Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines." http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/08/15/republic-act-no-10173/&lt;/ref&gt; This act extended [[privacy]] regulations and laws to apply to more than just individual industries. This act also offered protection of data belonging to the people regardless of where it is stored, be it in private spheres or not. In that very same year, the cybercrime prevention law was passed. This law was "intended to protect and safeguard the integrity of computer and [[communications system]]s" and prevent them from being misused.&lt;ref name="nortonrosefulbright.com" /&gt; Not only does the Philippines have these laws, but it has also set aside agents that are tasked with regulating these privacy rules and due ensure the punishment of the violators. Additionally, with the constitution, previous laws that have been passed but that are in violation of the laws above have been said to be void and nullified. Another way this country has shown their dedication in executing this law is extending it to the government sphere as well. Additionally, as a member of the United Nations, the Philippines is bound by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which states in article two "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks".&lt;ref name="un.org" /&gt;

===Russia===
{{Main|Data protection (privacy) laws in Russia}}
Applicable legislation:
# Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, signed and ratified by the Russian Federation on December 19.2005;
# the Law of the Russian Federation "On Personal Data" as of 27 July 2006 No. 152-FZ, regulating the processing of personal data by means of automation equipment. It is the operator who is required to comply with that Act.

As a general rule, consent of the individual is required for processing, i.e. obtaining, organizing, accumulating, holding, adjusting (updating, modifying), using, disclosing (including transfer), impersonating, blocking or destroying of his personal data. This rule doesn't apply where such processing is necessary for performance of the contract, to which an individual is a party.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore, like other Commonwealth jurisdictions, relies primarily on common law, and the law of confidence is employed for privacy protection cases.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=Simon|date=2012|title=After Privacy: the Rise of Facebook, the Fall of Wikileaks, and Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012|ssrn=2255274|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=|pages=391–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, privacy can be protected indirectly through various common law torts: defamation, trespass, nuisance, negligence, and breach of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=Ravi|date=2000|title=Privacy in Employment|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/24868246|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|volume=2000|pages=263–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, however, the Singaporean government decided that the common law approach was inadequate for their emerging globalized technological economy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus, the National Internet Advisory Committee published the Model Data Protection Code for the Private Sector, which set standards for personal data protection and was influenced by the EU Data Protection Directive and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In the private sector, businesses can still choose to adopt the Model Code, but in 2005 Parliament decided that Singapore needed a more comprehensive legislative privacy framework.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

In January 2013, Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 came into effect in three separate but related phases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The phases continued through July 2014 and dealt with the creation of the Personal Data Protection Commission, the national Do Not Call Registry, and general data protection Rules.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Act's general purpose "is to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations" while acknowledging the individual's right to control their personal data and the organizations' legal needs to collect this data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It imposes eight obligations on those organizations that use personal data: consent, purpose limitation, notification, access, correction, accuracy, protection/security, and retention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Act prohibits transfer of personal data to countries with privacy protection standards that are lower than those outlined in the general data protection rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The Personal Data Protection Commission is responsible for enforcing the Act, which is based primarily on a complaints-based system.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The punishments for violating the Act can include being ordered by the Commission to stop collecting and using personal data, to destroy the data, or to pay a penalty of up to $1 million.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Singapore has also passed various sector-specific statutes that more indirectly deal with privacy and personal information, including:
* Banking Act
* Statistics Act
* [[Official Secrets Act]]
* Statutory Bodies and Government Companies Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;
* [[Central Provident Fund]] Act
* Telecommunications Act&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are also more specific acts for electronically stored information:
* Spam Control Act 2007
* Electronic Transactions Act
* National Computer Board Act
* Computer Misuse Act&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===South Africa===
The [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] of South Africa guarantees the most general right to privacy for all its citizens. This provides the main protection for [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] privacy so far.

The Protection of Personal Act 2013 (POPI) was signed into act, focusing on data privacy and is inspired by other foreign national treaties like the United Kingdom. Minimum requirements are presented in POPI for the act of processing personal data, like the fact that the data subject must provide consent and that the data will be beneficial, and POPI will be harsher when related to cross-border international data transfers, specifically with personal information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, POPI won't be in full effective until an estimated date of 2018 as it is still being deliberated by the [[National Council of Provinces]].

The recording of conversations over phone and internet is not allowed without the permission of both parties with the [[Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act, 2002|Regulation of Interception of Communications]] and [[Provision of Communications Related Act]] (2002).

In addition, South Africa is part of the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[African Union]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Sweden===
{{See also|Internet privacy#Internet privacy in Sweden}}
The [[Data Act (Sweden)|Data Act]] is the world's first national data protection law and was enacted in Sweden on 11 May 1973.&lt;ref name=impl&gt;{{cite web|last1=Öman|first1=Sören|title=Implementing Data Protection in Law|url=http://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/47-18.pdf|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Colin J.|title=Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801480108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D17pcdORb9UC&amp;pg=PA63|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Privacy Law: Sweden|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/online-privacy-law/sweden.php|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Law Library of Congress|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw. ''Personuppgiftslagen'') that implemented the 1995 EU [[Data Protection Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law in Sweden — DLA Piper Global Data Protection Laws of the World|url=https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=law&amp;c=SE|website=www.dlapiperdataprotection.com|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Data Act (1998:204);|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/documents/sweden%20personal%20data%20act-eng.pdf|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Personal Data Act — Datainspektionen|url=http://www.datainspektionen.se/in-english/legislation/the-personal-data-act/|website=www.datainspektionen.se|access-date=10 May 2017|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castro|first1=Catarina|title=Employment Privacy Law in the European Union: Surveillance and Monitoring|publisher=Intersentia nv|isbn=9789050952392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaDofM_GTWMC&amp;pg=PA249|access-date=10 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The main legislation over personal data privacy for the personal and private sector in Switzerland is the [[Swiss Federal Protection Act,]] specifically the Data Protection Act, a specific section under the Swiss Federal Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has been enacted since 1992 and is in charge of measuring the consent of sharing of personal data, along with other legislation like the Telecommunication Act and the Unfair Competition Act. The Act generally guides on how to collect, process, store, data, use, disclose, and destruct data. The Data Inspection Board is in charge of overseeing data breaches and privacy enforcement.

Personal data must be protected against illegal use by "being processed in good faith and must be proportionate".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the reason for the transfer of personal data must be known by the time of data transfer. Data not associated with people (not personal data) is not protected by the Data Protection Act.

In the case of data transfer to unsafe data protection countries, these are the major regulations required by the Data Protection Act:
* Need of direct channels for data transfer
* Individual case must have consent from receivers of data
* Disclosure is accessible to public

Switzerland is a white-listed country, meaning that it is a nation that has proper levels of data protection under the surveillance by the [[European Commission]] (EU Commission). Switzerland is not under the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46 EC.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, Graham. 2015. "Global Data Privacy Laws 2015: 109 Countries, with European Laws Now a Minority"''.'' ''Privacy Laws &amp; Business International Report.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data protection regulations are sufficient enough under European Union (EU) regulations without being a member of the EU.

In addition, Switzerland is part of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The Data Inspection Board of Switzerland is a member of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, European Data Protection Authorities, the EU Article 29 Working Party, and the Nordic Data Protection Authorities.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Republic of China ===
The right to privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the Republic of China Constitution, but it can be protected indirectly through [[judicial interpretation]]. For example, article 12 of the Constitution states "the people shall have freedom of confidentiality of correspondence" while article 10 states "the people shall have freedom of residence and of change of residence."&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt; Along with several other articles that assert the Constitution's protection of freedoms and rights of the people, the Grand Justices are able to decide how privacy protection fits into the legal system.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Shin-Yi|date=2003|title=Privacy and the Construction of Legal Meaning in Taiwan|jstor=40707869|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=37|pages=1037–1054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justices first made reference to privacy being a protected right in the 1992 "Interpretation of Council of Grand Justices No. 293 on Disputes Concerning Debtors' Rights," but it was not directly or explicitly declared to be a right.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

In 1995, Taiwan passed the Computer-Processed Personal Data Protection Act which was influenced by the OECD Guidelines and enforced by each separate Ministry depending on their industry sector responsibility.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenleaf|first=Graham|date=2012|title=Independence of data privacy authorities (Part 2): Asia-Pacific experience|ssrn=1971627|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=28|pages=121–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only protected personal information managed by government agencies and certain industries.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2010, Taiwan enacted the Personal Data Protection Act that laid out more comprehensive guidelines for the public and private sectors and was still enforced by individual Ministries.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the 2010 Act, personal data is protected and defined as any "data which is sufficient to, directly or indirectly, identify that person", and includes data such as name, date of birth, fingerprints, occupation, medical records, and financial status, among many others.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

A few other administrative laws also deal with communication-specific personal privacy protection:
* Telecommunications Act
* Communications Protection and Surveillance Act

Additionally, chapter 28 of the [[Law of Taiwan|Criminal Code]] outlines punishments for privacy violations in article 315, sections 315-1 and 315-2. The sections primarily address issues of search and seizure and criminal punishment for wrongful invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name=":112"/&gt;

Finally, articles 18(I),184(I), and 195(I) of the Taiwanese [[s:Portal:Law of the Republic of China|Civil Code]] address the "personality right" to privacy and the right to compensation when one injures the "rights" of another, such as when someone uses another's name illegally.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

=== Thailand ===
Thailand's unique history of being an authoritarian buffer state during the Cold War and being under the constant threat of a [[coup d'état]] means that privacy laws have so far been limited in order to preserve national security and public safety.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramasoota|first=Pirongrong, et al.|date=2014|title=Online Privacy in Thailand: Public and Strategic Awareness|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jlinfos23&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|journal=Journal of Law, Information &amp; Science|volume=23|pages=97–136|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand uses bureaucratic surveillance to maintain national security and public safety, which explains the 1991 Civil Registration Act that was passed to protect personal data in computerized record-keeping and data-processing done by the government.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The legislature passed the Official Information Act 1997 to provide basic data protection by limiting personal data collection and retention in the public sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It defines personal information in a national context in relation to state agencies.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Two communication technology related laws, the Electronic Transactions Act 2001 and the Computer Crime Act 2007, provide some data privacy protection and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Nevertheless, Thailand still lacks legislation that explicitly addresses privacy security.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Thus, with the need for a more general and all-encompassing data protection law, the legislature proposed the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2013, which is heavily influenced by the OECD Guidelines and the EU Directive.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The draft law is still under evaluation and its enactment date is not yet finalized.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Privacy in English law}}
As a member of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the United Kingdom adheres to [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees a "right to respect for privacy and family life" from state parties, subject to restrictions as prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society towards a legitimate aim.

However, there is no independent tort law doctrine which recognises a right to privacy. This has been confirmed on a number of occasions.
* ''[[Kaye v Robertson]]''
* ''[[Wainwright v Home Office]]''

===United States===
{{Main|Privacy laws of the United States}}
The right to privacy is not explicitly stated anywhere in the Bill of Rights.
The idea of a right to privacy was first addressed within a legal context in the United States. [[Louis Brandeis]] (later a Supreme Court justice) and another young lawyer, [[Samuel D. Warren]], published an article called "The Right to Privacy" in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1890 arguing that the [[United States Constitution]] and [[common law]] allowed for the deduction of a general "right to privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 | title = The Right to Privacy| author = Warren and Brandeis | journal = Harvard Law Review | volume = IV | date = 15 December 1890 | issue = 5 | page = 193 | doi=10.2307/1321160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their project was never entirely successful, and the renowned tort expert and Dean of the College of Law at University of California, Berkeley, [[William Lloyd Prosser]] argued that "privacy" was composed of four separate torts, the only unifying element of which was a (vague) "right to be left alone".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lloyd Prosser]], "Privacy" (1960) 48 ''[[California Law Review]]'', 383&lt;/ref&gt; The four torts were:
* Appropriating the plaintiff's identity for the defendant's benefit
* Placing the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye
* Publicly disclosing private facts about the plaintiff
* Unreasonably intruding upon the seclusion or solitude of the plaintiff
One of the central privacy policies concerning minors is the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA), which requires children under the age of thirteen to gain parental consent before putting any personal information online.&lt;ref&gt;BOYD, danah et al. [http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3850/3075 Why parents help their children lie to Facebook about age: Unintended consequences of the 'Children's Online Privacy Protection Act'].&amp;nbsp;'''First Monday''', [S.l.], oct. 2011. {{ISSN|1396-0466}}. {{doi|10.5210/fm.v16i11.3850}}.

===Uzbekistan===
Though the right to privacy exists in several regulations, the most effective privacy protections come in the form of constitutional articles of Uzbekistan. Varying aspects of the right to privacy are protected in different ways by different situations.{{Vague|date=March 2016}}

=== Vietnam ===
Vietnam, lacking a general data protection law, relies on Civil Code regulations relating to personal data protection. Specifically, the Code "protects information relating to the private life of a person."&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2006 Law on Information Technology protects personal information, such as name, profession, phone number, and email address, and declares that organizations may only use this information for a "proper purpose". The legislation, however, does not define what qualifies as proper.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; The 2005 Law on Electronic Transactions protects personal information during electronic transactions by prohibiting organizations and individuals from disclosing "part or all of information related to private and personal affairs ... without prior agreement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. (2005). "Legislature XI, Session 8: Law on E-Transactions." https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/vnm_e/WTACCVNM43_LEG_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights provides further protection for consumer information, but it does not define the scope of that information or create a data protection authority; additionally, it is only applicable in the private sector.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

In 2015, the Vietnam legislature introduced the Law on Information Security, which ensures better information safety and protection online and in user's computer software. It took effect on 1 July 2016 and is Vietnam's first overarching data protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treutler, et al.|first=Thomas J.|date=March 2016|title=Legal Update: New Regulations in the ICT Sector in Vietnam|url=http://www.tilleke.com/sites/default/files/2016_Mar_New_Regulations_ICT_Sector_Vietnam.pdf|journal=Tilleke &amp; Gibbins|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders''' ({{lang-fi|Työväen ja Pienviljelijäin Sosialidemokraattinen Liitto}}, TPSL) was a political party in [[Finland]]. TPSL originated as a fraction of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]], headed by [[Emil Skog]] and [[Aarre Simonen]]. Skog was the former chairman of SDP and was in dispute with the incumbent chairman, Väinö Leskinen. The party was founded in 1959, had seats in the parliament in 1959–1970 and was dissolved in 1973. It was generally identified as being politically between SDP and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SKDL]] (a Communist-dominated organization).
==History==
The fraction split from SDP in 1959 after few years of infighting, and retained SDP's party platform until 1967, opining that SDP didn't follow its own platform. The main cause for the rift was that SDP's party leadership, particularly [[Väinö Tanner]] and [[Väinö Leskinen]] wanted to develop the party towards a "general party" appealing to the entire public. TPSL in contrast, as the name suggests, wanted SDP to be a special interest party for the workers and small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Rauli Mickelsson. Suomen puolueet - Historia, muutos ja nykypäivä. Vastapaino 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Leskinen wanted to co-operate with the right wing, based SDP politics on the general population, and his economic policy was conservative and deflatory, and he criticised [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]. In contrast, Skog's fraction wanted to co-operate with the agrarians and other leftists in [[popular front]] governments (''kansanrintamahallitus''), and base their politics exclusively on the trade unions. For example, Heikki Laavola has written that the disagreement was not over left vs. right ideology; all of Tanner, Leskinen, Skog and Simonen had been formerly active in anti-Communist pursuits. Disagreements between and about individuals played a role; Tanner had actually been convicted (under Soviet pressure) for being responsible to the [[Continuation War]], and as such, he being the leader of SDP was a problem to the Soviets.

The rift was accompanied by a division in associated societies and the trade unions. The main trade union, [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]], was controlled mostly by Skog's men, as was [[Socialist Youth League of Finland|the youth league]], [[Finnish Workers' Sports Federation|sports federation]] and [[Social Democratic Women's League (Finland)|women's league]]. The first example was that SDP's leadership wanted the worker's sports federation to associate with the right-wing sports federation in order to qualify for entry to [[Olympics]], which Skog's fraction disputed as bourgeoise.

TPSL had 13-15 representatives of 200 in the [[Eduskunta|parliament]] after the split in 1959, gained only two in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1962|1962 elections]], got seven representatives in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1966|1966]] and permanently dropped out of the parliament in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1970|1970]]. Significantly, TPSL co-operated with the especially powerful President [[Urho Kekkonen]], and was a partner in coalition cabinets (Karjalainen I, Paasio I, Koivisto I). In 1963, SDP changed its policy such that good relations with Kekkonen and Soviet Union were a new priority, thus removing a significant cause for disagreement. Skog himself returned to SDP in 1965. TPSL radicalized and became more Soviet-friendly, but lost its popular support, and was dissolved in 1973. The decision was made in December 1972 as TPSL board voted 10–3 for the return to the SDP.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Devlin: [http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml Death of a Splinter Party: Finland's Left-Socialists Give Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108085222/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml |date=2012-01-08 }} (Radio Free Europe 5.12.1972)&lt;/ref&gt; A minority faction, including Simonen and some other former MPs, formed the [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]].

'''''Soering v United Kingdom''''' 161 Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser. A) (1989) is a [[landmark decision|landmark]] judgment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) which established that [[extradition]] of a young German national to the United States to face charges of [[Capital punishment|capital murder]] violated [[Article 3 ECHR|Article 3]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) guaranteeing the right against inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;ref name="albany"&gt;{{cite news|title=Juvenile execution, terrorist extradition, and supreme court discretion to consider international death penalty jurisprudence.|publisher=Albany Law Review|date=23 September 2005|author=Burleson, Elizabeth|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9574233_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The applicant, [[Jens Soering]], is a German national, born in 1966, who was brought by his parents to the United States at 11. In 1984, he was an 18-year-old [[honour student]] at the [[University of Virginia]], where he became good friends with [[Elizabeth Haysom]], a Canadian national two years his elder.

Haysom's parents, William Reginald Haysom and Nancy Astor Haysom, lived 65 miles from the university, in Boonsboro (a suburb of Lynchburg). According to the account provided later to local police, Soering and Elizabeth Haysom decided to kill Haysom's parents; and, to divert suspicion, they rented a car in [[Charlottesville]] and drove to Washington D.C. On 30 March 1985, Soering drove to the Haysom residence and dined with the unsuspecting couple. During or after dinner, he picked a quarrel and viciously attacked them with a knife. Both were found with their throats slit and with stab and slash wounds to the neck and body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Sachs| first =Andrea| title =A Fate Better Than Death| journal =Time| location =United States of America| date =4 March 1991| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972429,00.html| accessdate =5 January 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Conley| first =Jay| title = Haysom murders, 20 years ago today: blood sweat and convictions: Starting in 1985, the Haysom double murder case ranged from Virginia to England and ignited a three-year legal battle.| work =The Roanoke Times| date =3 April 2005| url =http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/xp-21202| accessdate =5 January 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1985, Soering and Elizabeth Haysom fled to Europe; and, on 30 April 1986, they were arrested in England, United Kingdom on charges of [[cheque fraud]]. Six weeks later, a [[grand jury]] of the Circuit Court of [[Bedford County, Virginia]], indicted Soering with the [[capital murder]] of the Haysoms, as well as their separate non-capital murders. On 11 August 1986, the United States requested extradition for the pair, based on the 1972 extradition treaty. A warrant was issued under section 8 of the Extradition Act 1870 for the arrest of Soering, and he was [[committal procedure|committed]] to await the [[Home Secretary]]'s order to extradite him to the United States.

Soering filed a petition for ''[[habeas corpus]]'' with the [[Divisional Court]] and requested permission for [[Judicial Review in English Law|judicial review]] of the decision to commit him, arguing that the Extradition Act 1870 did not authorise extradition for a capital charge. He also cited article IV of the US-UK extradition treaty, which provides that an extradition request for an offence carrying the death penalty can be refused if the requesting country has not given "assurances [...] that the death penalty will not be carried out". No specific assurance was given by the United States, or the State of Virginia, that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty or that Soering would not be executed. The UK government received only an undertaking from the [[Commonwealth Attorney]] of [[Bedford County, Virginia|Bedford County]] to the effect that:-

{{quotation|should Jens Soering be convicted of the offence of capital murder as charged in Bedford County, Virginia ... a representation will be made in the name of the United Kingdom to the judge at the time of sentencing that it is the wish of the United Kingdom that the death penalty should not be imposed or carried out.}}

Soering contended that this assurance was worthless. The Virginia authorities later communicated to the UK government that they would not offer further assurances, as they intended to seek the death penalty against Soering.

On 11 December 1987, [[Timothy Lloyd|Lord Justice Lloyd]] in the Divisional Court admitted that the assurance "leaves something to be desired" but refused the request for judicial review, stating that Soering's request was premature, as the Home Secretary had not yet accepted the assurance.

Soering appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]], which rejected his claim on 30 June 1988. He, then, petitioned the Home Secretary without success, the latter authorising extradition on 3 August 1988.

Anticipating this outcome, Soering had filed a claim with the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] (ECHR) on 9 July 1988, asserting that he would face inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("the Convention") were he to be extradited to the USA, it being likely that the death penalty would be applied.

Soering's arguments that the use by a non-Convention State of the death penalty would engage the right to life were novel, in that Article 2(1) of the Convention expressly permits the use of the death penalty, and Article 3 had never been interpreted to bring the death penalty, per se, within the prohibition of "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". The applicant, therefore, sought to make it clear that this was not the simple application of a punishment prescribed by law, but rather his exposure to the [[death row phenomenon]], where he would be kept in detention for an unknown period, awaiting execution. The ECHR requested that no extradition take place pending the deliverance of its judgment.

==Judgment==

===European Commission of Human Rights===
Soering's application was declared admissible on 10 November 1988, and the European Commission of Human Rights gave its judgment on 19 January 1989. It decided, by six votes to five, that in this particular case the extradition would not constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. It did, however, accept that the extradition of a person to a country "where it is certain or where there is a serious risk that the person will be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment the deportation or extradition would, in itself, under such circumstances constitute inhuman treatment."

===European Court of Human Rights===

On 7 July 1989, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) handed down a unanimous judgment affirming the Commission's conclusion that Article 3 could be engaged by the extradition process and that the extraditing state could be responsible for the breach where it is aware of a real risk that the person may be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Collyer| first =Michael| title = Forced Migration and Global Processes: A View from Forced Migration Studies (Program in Migration and Refugee Studies)| publisher =Lexington books| date =2005| location =| pages =| url =| doi =| id =| isbn = 0-7391-1276-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] intervened in the case and submitted that, in the light of "evolving standards in Western Europe regarding the existence and use of the death penalty", this punishment should be considered as inhuman and degrading and was therefore effectively prohibited by Article 3. This was not accepted by the ECHR, as the Convention does allow for the death penalty's use in certain circumstances. It followed that Article 3 could not stand in the way of the extradition of a suspect simply because they might be subject to the death penalty.

However, even if the extradition itself would not constitute a breach of Article 3, such factors as the execution method, the detainee's personal circumstances, the sentence's disproportionality to the gravity of the crime, and conditions of detention could all violate Article 3. To answer this question, the Court had to determine whether there was a "real risk" of Soering's being executed. The Court found that 

{{quotation|it cannot be said that the undertaking to inform the judge at the sentencing stage of the wishes of the United Kingdom eliminates the risk of the death penalty being imposed. [...] the Commonwealth’s Attorney has himself decided to seek and to persist in seeking the death penalty because the evidence, in his determination, supports such action [...] If the national authority with responsibility for prosecuting the offence takes such a firm stance, it is hardly open to the Court to hold that there are no substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being sentenced to death}}

Departing from the Commission's ruling, the ECHR concluded that the "death row phenomenon" did breach Article 3. They highlighted four factors that contributed to the violation: 
* The length of detention prior to execution
* Conditions on death row
* Soering's age and mental condition
* The possibility of his extradition to Germany

As the ECtHR concluded:
{{Quotation|[H]aving regard to the very long period of time spent on death row in such extreme conditions, with the ever present and mounting anguish of awaiting execution of the death penalty, and to the personal circumstances of the applicant, especially his age and mental state at the time of the offence, the applicant's extradition to the United States would expose him to a real risk of treatment going beyond the threshold set by Article 3. A further consideration of relevance is that in the particular instance the legitimate purpose of extradition could be achieved by another means [extradition or deportation to Germany], which would not involve suffering of such exceptional intensity or duration.}}

==Aftermath==
The UK government obtained further assurances from the US regarding the death penalty before extraditing Soering to Virginia. He was tried and convicted of the [[first degree murder]]s of the Haysoms and, on 4 September 1990, sentenced to two consecutive life terms. He is serving his sentence at the Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Sizemore | title=No Hope for Jens Soering | date=18 February 2007 | work =The Virginian-Pilot | url =http://www.jenssoering.com/no_hope | accessdate = 5 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Haysom did not contest her extradition from the UK and pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill her parents. On 6 October 1987, the court sentenced her to 45-years-per-count to be served consecutively. She is serving her sentence at the [[Fluvanna County, Virginia|Fluvanna]] Correctional Center for Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Signs of the Times | title=Glimpses from Inside | date=September 2003 | url =http://george.loper.org/trends/2003/Sep/925.html | accessdate = 5 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229081043/http://george.loper.org/trends/2003/Sep/925.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

''Soering v. United Kingdom'' is important in four respects:

* It enlarges the scope of a state's responsibility for breaches of the Convention. A signatory State must now consider consequences of returning an individual to a third country where he might face treatment that breaches the Convention. This is notwithstanding that the ill-treatment may be beyond its control, or even that general assurances have been provided that no ill-treatment will take place.
* By finding a breach of the Convention on the territory of a non-signatory State, the Court considerably expanded the obligation to its signatory States. Not only are signatories responsible for consequences of extradition suffered outside their jurisdiction, but this jurisdiction implicitly extends to actions in non-signatory States. The Convention also overrides agreements concluded with such States.
* The rationale of the Court's judgment applies equally to [[deportation]] cases, where other articles of the Convention may apply, such as Article 6 ([[right to a fair trial]]), as seen in ''[[Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom]]'' (2012).
* The Court's approach to the death penalty, itself permitted by the text of the original Convention, may reduce its use by non-signatory States that seek to extradite suspects from signatory States. The decision makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the US and other capital punishment countries to extradite suspects on capital charges from signatory States, without giving assurances that the death penalty will not be executed.

TALI manages the public performance rights, leasing rights, broadcast rights and public access rights, as well as the rights to collect blank media levies with regard to the screenplays and directed works of its members. 
TALI collects [[royalties]] for the use of its members' works within the State of Israel and distributes them among its members in accordance with a formula whose parameters are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Tali|url=http://www.tali-rights.org.il/pages.php?id=1|publisher=Tali Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has established a database about its members' works, through which it manages the reporting, the use of the works and the distribution of royalties. 
Membership in TALI does not require a membership fee; its overhead costs are deducted from the royalties paid by the users. Each TALI member has full control over the number of screenplays and/or directed works, or rights to them, that he turns over to TALI's management, and he can exclude any works or rights at any stage.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.tali-rights.org.il/pages.php?id=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TALI’s repertoire includes, among other items:
* Dramatic works, including feature films, TV drama specials and dramatic series;
* Documentary works at least 25 minutes long, including documentary films and news documentaries;
* Entertaining documentary works at least 25 minutes long, including [[reality film]]s and those made via [[hidden camera]];
* Entertainment works with dramatic elements, including [[sketch comedy]] and comedy;
* [[child]]ren's programs with dramatic elements;
* Music videos (video clips), produced especially for a song and which include performance of the song, or a film of a song made during a [[Concert|live performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information|url=http://www.tali-rights.org.il/pages.php?id=5|publisher=Tali Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TALI has licensing agreements with various users, including broadcasters, internet sites, cellular providers and other companies that use audiovisual works. In this context TALI has licensing agreements with: Channel 10, Keshet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tali-Keshet agreement|url=http://b.walla.co.il/?w=/3050/1172984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reshet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tali-Reshet agreement|url=http://bidur.index.co.il/Article_page_for_Gate.asp?info_id=304516|newspaper=Bidur Ubama}}&lt;/ref&gt; YES,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tali-Yes agreement|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000066227|newspaper=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt; HOT, the Israel Broadcasting Authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tali-IBA agreement|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/814/026.html|newspaper=NRG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational Television, Walla, Mako, Partner (Orange), Cellcom, Pelephone, and others

== Organizational structure ==
TALI is headed by a 10-member board of directors. Avi Shemesh, one of the organization]s founders, is chairman of the board. The board is meant to include five screenwriters and five directors (though today it actually numbers five screenwriters and three directors).
Under the board is the CEO, who is responsible for implementing the policy of the board, and under the CEO there are two departments: the Membership and Documentation Department and the Finance and Disbursal Department. The company has eight employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information|url=http://www.tali-rights.org.il/pages.php?id=1|publisher=Tali Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaty of Nürtingen''' was a treaty in German history, signed on 25 January 1442. It divided the [[county of Württemberg]] between count [[Ludwig I, Count of Württemberg-Urach|Ludwig I]] and his brother count [[Ulrich V, Count of Württemberg|Ulrich V]]. The Stuttgart half went to Ulrich and included (among others) the cities of [[Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt|Cannstatt]], [[Göppingen]], [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]], [[Neuffen]], [[Nürtingen]], [[Schorndorf]] and [[Waiblingen]]. The [[Bad Urach|Urach]] half went to Ludwig and included (among others) the cities of [[Balingen]], [[Calw]], [[Herrenberg]], [[Münsingen (Württemberg)|Münsingen]], [[Tuttlingen]] and [[Tübingen]]. It had been preceded by a division of Württemberg on different lines one year earlier for the marriage of Ulrich V to Margarethe von Cleve, intended to last four years. This division was rescinded by the [[Treaty of Münsingen]] on 14 December 1482 and reinstated by the Treaty of Esslingen in 1492.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4162">'''Wireless Telegraphy Act''' is (with its variations) a stock [[short title]] used for legislation in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] relating to [[wireless telegraphy]].

The '''Wireless Telegraphy Acts''' are laws regulating radio communications in the [[United Kingdom]].

Wireless telegraphy as a concept is defined in British law as "the sending of electro-magnetic energy over paths not provided by a material substance."

The term [[telegraphy]], although best known in relation to the [[electric telegraph]], relates to the sending of messages over long-distances. [[Wireless telegraphy]] is differentiated from electrical telegraphy in that the messages are transmitted via electromagnetic means (light or radio) rather than via a physical electrical cable connection.

The current (2018) supervisor of the UK's [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is the communications regulator, [[Ofcom]].

[[File:Wood plastic composite.JPG|right|thumb|Wood plastic composite]]
'''Wood-plastic composites''' (WPCs) are [[composite material]]s made of [[Wood fibre|wood fiber]]/[[wood flour]] and thermoplastic(s) (includes [[Polythene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[PVC]], [[Polylactic acid|PLA]] etc.).

In addition to wood fiber and plastic, WPCs can also contain other ligno-cellulosic and/or inorganic filler materials. WPCs are a subset of a larger category of materials called natural fiber plastic composites (NFPCs), which may contain no [[cellulose]]-based fiber fillers such as pulp fibers, [[peanut]] hulls, [[bamboo]], [[straw]], [[digestate]], etc.

Chemical additives seem practically "invisible" (except mineral fillers and pigments, if added) in the composite structure. They provide for integration of polymer and wood flour (powder) while facilitating optimal processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com/p/what-is-wood-plastic-composite-wpc.html|title=WPC machines &amp; equipment. WPC pellets and additives. Composite decking lumber.|work=wpc-composite-decking.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, people in the flooring industry starts referring to '''WPC''' as a type of floor that has a basic structure of top vinyl veneer plus a rigid extruded core (the core can be made without any wood fiber). WPC is now an established product category within LVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruise|first1=Mallory|title=WPC gains ground at Domotex Hannover 2016|url=http://www.dgmfloors.com/new_detail/nid/2992.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|agency=Floor Covering Weekly|issue=FCW Global February 2016|publisher=Floor Covering Weekly|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of WPC is different than the WPC decking and is not intended for outdoor usage.

== Uses ==
Wood-plastic composites are still new materials relative to the long history of natural lumber as a building material. The most widespread use of WPCs in North America is in outdoor [[Deck (building)|deck]] floors, but it is also used for railings, fences, landscaping timbers, [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] and siding, park [[Bench (furniture)|benches]], [[moulding (decorative)|molding and trim]], [[window]] and [[door]] frames, and indoor [[furniture]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemons, C. (2002) "Wood-plastic Composites in the United States: The interfacing of two Industries" '' Forest Products Journal '' 52(6)&lt;/ref&gt; Wood-plastic composites were first introduced into the decking market in the early 1990s.

These materials can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpcextruder.com/news_show-13.html Introduction of WPC Wood Plastic Composite Products&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Wood-plastic composites (WPCs) are produced by thoroughly mixing ground wood particles and heated [[thermoplastic]] resin. The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though [[injection molding]] is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including [[high-density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Polystyrene|PS]], and [[Polylactic acid|PLA]]. Polyethylene-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as [[plastic colorant|colorants]], [[coupling agent]]s, [[UV stabilizer]]s, [[blowing agent]]s, [[foaming agent]]s, and [[lubricant]]s help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.

In some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktron.com/industries_served/plastics/woodplastic.cfm|title=Wood-Plastic Composites production requires high formulation quality the feeding system|work=ktron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about 50&amp;nbsp;°F (28&amp;nbsp;°C) lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around 400&amp;nbsp;°F (204&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greendotpure.com/materials/wood-composites/|title = Wood Plastic Composites – Green Dot|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that’s too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
[[File:Trex Transcend Decking and Railing stairs.png|thumb|right|[[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Composite Decking]]]]
WPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and [[Gribble|Marine Borer]] attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, N. (2001) “Influence of Moisture Absorption on Mechanical Properties of Wood Flour-Polypropylene Composites.” '' Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials'' 14&lt;/ref&gt; Water absorption is more pronounced in WFCs with a hydrophilic matrix such as PLA and also leads to decreased mechanical stiffness and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joffre|first=Thomas|last2=Segerholm|first2=Kristoffer|last3=Persson|first3=Cecilia|last4=Bardage|first4=Stig L.|last5=Luengo Hendriks|first5=Cris L.|last6=Isaksson|first6=Per|date=2017-01|title=Characterization of interfacial stress transfer ability in acetylation-treated wood fibre composites using X-ray microtomography|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|journal=Industrial Crops and Products|volume=95|pages=43–49|doi=10.1016/j.indcrop.2016.10.009|issn=0926-6690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical performance in a wet environment can be enhanced by an acetylation treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsson|first=P.|last2=Simonson|first2=R.|date=1994-04-01|title=A study of strength, hardness and deformation of acetylated Scandinavian softwoods|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02615470|journal=Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=83–86|doi=10.1007/BF02615470|issn=0018-3768}}&lt;/ref&gt; WFCs have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using [[recycled plastic]]s and the waste products of the [[wood industry]]. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make wood-plastic composite difficult to recycle again after use.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Scott (2008). “Synthetic Decking” [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/remodeling/synthetic-decking.aspx]. Remodeling Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; They can however be recycled easily in a new wood-plastic composite, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Ultra Polymers? |publisher=Solvay |date=2014
|url=http://www.solvayultrapolymers.com/en/products/index.tcm |accessdate=2014-04-17

(2011) '' Modeling the Time-dependent Flexural Response of Wood-plastic Composite Materials '' Dissertation, University of Wisconsin–Madison&lt;/ref&gt; The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, J et al.(2006) “Durability of wood-plastic composites.” ''Wood Design Focus'' 16(3)&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.

== WPC sandwich boards ==
WPC boards show good set of performance but monolithic composite sheets are relatively heavy (most often heavier than pure plastics) which limits their use to applications where low weight is not essential. WPC in a [[sandwich-structured composite]] form allow for combination of the benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology. WPC sandwich boards consist of wood polymer composite skins and usually low density polymer core which leads to a very effective increase of panel's rigidity. WPC sandwich boards are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renolit.com/composites/en/products/automotive/honeycomb-structure/|title=WPC honeycomb panels|publisher=Renolit.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC sandwich boards at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econcore.com/en/technology/thermhex|title=Sandwich Panel Technology |publisher=EconCore.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Environmental impact===
The [[environmental impact]] of WPCs is directly affected by the ratio of renewable to [[non-renewable]] materials. The commonly used [[petroleum]]-based polymers have a negative environmental impact because they rely on non-renewable raw materials and the non-[[biodegradability]] of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=A. Kutnar and S.S. Muthu|title=Environmental Impacts of Traditional and Innovative Forest-based Bioproducts, Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-0655-5_2|chapter=Wood-Plastic Composites—Performance and Environmental Impacts|url=https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789811006531-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1554323-p179867938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire hazards ===
The types of plastic normally used in WPC formulations have higher [[fire hazard]] properties than wood alone, as plastic has a higher chemical [[heat content]] and can melt. The inclusion of plastic as a portion of the composite results in the potential for higher fire hazards in WPCs as compared with wood. Some code officials are becoming increasingly concerned with the fire performance of WPCs.&lt;ref&gt;http://wpcinfo.org/techinfo/Fire_Studies.html Washington State University Wood Plastic Composites Information Center, "Fire Issues in Engineered Wood Composites for Naval Waterfront Facilities", 46th International SAMPE Symposium and Exhibition, Long Beach, California, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enn.com/business/article/24261 Environmental News Network, "California Fire Codes Put Focus on Plastic Decking Concerns" 5 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
