The '''Abortion Support Network''' is a [[UK]] based charity which provides financial assistance, accommodation and consultation to women from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] who are seeking an abortion in the UK.

The charity was founded in 2009 by Mara Clarke.&lt;ref name="cosmo"&gt;{{cite web|title=How This Woman Helps Hundreds of Pregnant Women in Ireland Access Safe, Legal Abortions|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a40652/mara-clarke-abortion-support-network-ireland/|website=Cosmopolitan|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the work of the (now defunct) [[London]] based 1980's [[Irish Women's Abortion Support Group]].

In 2015 they received widespread attention in the UK due to the popular parenting site [[Mumsnet]] using their annual charity fundraising appeal to raise money for the ASN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11666308/Mumsnet-backs-illegal-DIY-abortions.html|title =Mumsnet backs ‘illegal’ DIY abortions|date = 11 June 2015|last = Bingham|first = John|newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 as part of a coalition, ASN made a submission to the [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Submissions/Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Advocacy-Groups-and-Personal-Stories/Advocacy-Groups-May-2017.pdf|title=List of Advocacy Groups, Interest Groups, other Representative Organisations and Political Parties Submissions to the Citizens’ Assembly on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ASN fund-raised and provided over £73,000 (€84,000) worth of grants for all associated expenses of obtaining an abortion, including travel. The team of volunteers fielded 1,009 phone calls (685 from Ireland) providing free advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abortion-support-network-in-a-perfect-world-our-phone-would-never-ring-1.3504703|title=Abortion Support Network: ‘In a perfect world, our phone would never ring’|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">'''Alethiology''' (or '''alethology''', "the study of [[aletheia]]") literally means the ''study of [[truth]]'', but can more accurately be translated as ''the study of the nature of truth''.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alethiology |title=Alethiology |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries (online) |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It could be argued that ''alethiology'' synonymous with ''[[epistemology]]'', the study of knowledge, and that dividing the two is mere [[semantics]], but sometimes a distinction is made between the two. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and its acquisition. Alethiology is specifically concerned with the ''nature'' of truth, which is only one of the areas studied by epistemologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term ''alethiology'' is rare. The ten-volume ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' mentions it only once, in the article "Lambert, Johann Heinrich (1728–77)":
{{quote|Part Two of the ''Neues Organon'' is the 'Alethiology or Doctrine of Truth'. Lambert’s key concern here is with the nature and function of the simple concepts that serve as the building blocks for the logical construction of true propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Lambert, Johann Heinrich (1728–77)|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=1.0 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-0415073103}} {{full|date=September 2018|reason=year, volume, page}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] describes the discipline as "…an uncommon expression for the doctrine of truth, used by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] in his philosophic writings when treating of the rules for the discrimination of truth and error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alethiology |volume=1 |page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in ''The Banalization of Nihilism'' (pp. 17–18) in contrast to several other types of nihilism, especially epistemological nihilism. The views of several philosophers are then distinguished by reference to 'alethiological nihilism', 'epistemological nihilism' and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karr |first=Karen L. |title=The Banalization of Nihilism |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7914-0833-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5985">'''Autonomation''' describes a feature of machine design to effect the principle of {{nihongo|'''jidoka'''|自働化}} used in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) and [[Lean manufacturing]]. It may be described as "intelligent automation" or "automation with a human touch".&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of automation implements some supervisory functions rather than production functions. At Toyota this usually means that if an abnormal situation arises the machine stops and the worker will stop the production line.  It is a quality control process that applies the following four principles:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222919/http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-newsletter.pl?LEAN&amp;20021209&amp;1&amp; The Essence of Jidoka], Mark Rosenthal, SME Lean Directions Newsletter, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
# Detect the abnormality.
# Stop.
# Fix or correct the immediate condition.
# Investigate the root cause and install a countermeasure.
Autonomation aims to prevent the production of defective products, eliminate [[overproduction]] and focus attention on understanding the problems and ensuring that they do not reoccur.

== Purpose and implementation ==
Autonomation is called by [[Shigeo Shingo]] pre-automation.&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; It separates workers from machines through mechanisms that detect production abnormalities (many machines in Toyota have these). He says there are twenty-three stages between purely manual and fully automated work. To be fully automated machines must be able to detect ''and'' correct their own operating problems which is currently not cost-effective. However, ninety percent of the benefits of full automation can be gained by autonomation.

The purpose of autonomation is that it makes possible the rapid or immediate address, identification and correction of mistakes that occur in a process. Autonomation relieves the worker of the need to continuously judge whether the operation of the machine is normal; their efforts are now only engaged when there is a problem alerted by the machine. As well as making the work more interesting this is a necessary step if the worker is to be asked later to supervise several machines. The first example of this at Toyota was the auto-activated loom of [[Sakichi Toyoda]] that automatically and immediately stopped the loom if the vertical or lateral threads broke or ran out.

For instance rather than waiting until the end of a production line to inspect a finished product, autonomation may be employed at early steps in the process to reduce the amount of work that is added to a defective product. A worker who is self-inspecting their own work, or source-inspecting the work produced immediately before their work station is encouraged to stop the line when a defect is found. This detection is the first step in Jidoka. A machine performing the same defect detection process is engaged in autonomation.

Once the line is stopped a supervisor or person designated to help correct problems gives immediate attention to the problem the worker or machine has discovered. To complete Jidoka, not only is the defect corrected in the product where discovered, but the process is evaluated and changed to remove the possibility of making the same mistake again. One solution to the problems can be to insert a "mistake-proofing" device somewhere in the production line. Such a device is known as [[poka-yoke]].

== Relationship with just-in-time ==
[[Taiichi Ohno]] and [[Sakichi Toyoda]], originators of the TPS and practices in the manufacturing of textiles, machinery and automobiles considered [[Just In Time (business)|JIT]] &amp; Autonomation the pillars&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, Productivity Press, 1988, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; upon which TPS is built. Jeffrey Liker and David Meier&lt;ref&gt;the first paragraph of Chapter 8 in their book, ''The Toyota Way Fieldbook'', Jeffrey Liker and David Meier&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that Jidoka or "the decision to stop and fix problems as they occur rather than pushing them down the line to be resolved later" is a large part of the difference between the effectiveness of Toyota and other companies who have tried to adopt [[Lean Manufacturing]]. Autonomation, therefore can be said to be a key element in successful Lean Manufacturing implementations.

For just-in-time (JIT) systems, it is absolutely vital to produce with zero defects, or else these defects can disrupt the production process - or the orderly flow of work.

JIT and Lean Manufacturing are always searching for targets for continuous improvement in its quest for quality improvements, finding and eliminating the causes of problems so they do not continually crop up.

Jidoka involves the automatic detection of errors or defects during production. When a defect is detected the halting of the production forces immediate attention to the problem.

The halting causes slowed production but it is believed that this helps to detect a problem earlier and avoids the spread of bad practices.
(JBLL, Jun18, 2006)

== Etymology ==

The word "autonomation" 自働化, a [[loan word]] from the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]], is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[autonomous]]" and "[[automation]]" 自動化, which is written using three [[kanji]] characters: 自 "self", "動" "movement", and 化 "-ization". In the Toyota Production System, the second character is replaced with 働 "work", which is a [[Kanji#Local developments|character derived]] by adding a [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] representing "human" to the original 動.

Related concepts from the [[Toyota Production System]]:
* [[Andon (manufacturing)|Andon]]: A method of signalling a problem in order to get help immediately, typically in the form of a "andon team", to avoid halting the production line.
* [[Kaizen]]: Continuous improvement.

The '''Cascade red fox''' (''Vulpes vulpes cascadensis'') is a subspecies of [[Red Fox|red fox]] native to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the United States.

==Range==
The range of the Cascade red fox is estimated to be 4500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but may be as large as 40000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="NatureServe"&gt;Fleckenstein, J.W. [http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Vulpes+vulpes+cascadensis "Vulpes vulpes cascadensis - Merriam, 1900"], ''[[NatureServe]]'', 20 September 2011. Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It lives in the subalpine meadows and parklands of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], as well as the open forests on the eastern slope. It does not however inhabit the densely forested western slope.&lt;ref&gt;Aubry, Keith Baker. [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/5517 "The Cascade red fox: distribution, morphology, zoogeoraphy and ecology"], ''[[University of Washington]]'', 26 May 1983. Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It may inhabit the very southern parts of [[British Columbia]].

==North American colonization==
The ancestors of the Cascade red fox colonized [[North America]] after crossing the [[Beringia|Bering landbridge]] during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian glacation]] over 300,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;Akins, Jocelyn. [https://www.nps.gov/articles/cascade-fox.htm "Conservation Status of the Cascade Red Fox"] ''[[National Park Service]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], they were pushed south to escape to ice free forests.  From that point, they adapted to the colder climate and became distinct. After the glaciation, they moved up into the mountains where conditions were similar.

==Current status==
The Cascade red fox is a Natural Heritage Critically Imperiled Species, as well as a Washington Candidate Species for protection.&lt;ref name="NatureServe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/cascade_red_fox.pdf "Cascade Red Fox"] ''[[Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have suggested that there has been widespread population loss.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The number of populations seems to be less than 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eol.org/pages/1270427/details "Vulpes vulpes cascadensis"] ''[[Encyclopedia of Life]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Population trends may be because of habitat loss, timber removal, and increased winter recreation that provides pathways for other less adapted predators to enter alpine areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Lack of information has made conservation efforts much harder.

The '''centimetre–gram–second system of units''' (abbreviated '''CGS''' or '''cgs''') is a variant of the [[metric system]] based on the [[centimetre]] as the unit of [[length]], the [[gram]] as the unit of [[mass]], and the [[second]] as the unit of [[time]]. All CGS [[mechanics|mechanical]] units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/centimetre-gram-second-system|title=Centimetre-gram-second system {{!}} physics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=article is about viscosity, not electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=Units/CGS|title=The Centimeter-Gram-Second (CGS) System of Units - Maple Programming Help|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1506/1506.01951.pdf | title = Babel of units: The evolution of units systems in classical electromagnetism | access-date = 31 March 2018 | last = Carron | first = Neal J.| date = 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the [[MKS system of units|MKS system]] based on the [[metre]], [[kilogram]], and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the [[International System of Units]] (SI). In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent.

In measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, [[force]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the [[Unit conversion|unit-conversion factors]] are all [[Exponentiation#Powers of ten|powers of 10]] as {{nowrap|1=100 cm = 1 m}} and {{nowrap|1=1000 g = 1 kg}}. For example, the CGS unit of force is the [[dyne]] which is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]] ({{nowrap|1=1 kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), is equal to 100,000 dynes.

On the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units of [[charge (physics)|charge]], electric and magnetic fields, [[voltage]], and so on), converting between CGS and SI is more subtle. Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on which system of units one uses. This is because there is no [[one-to-one correspondence]] between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including [[Gaussian units]], "ESU", "EMU", and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]. Among these choices, Gaussian units are the most common today, and  "CGS units" often used   specifically refers to CGS-Gaussian units.

==History==
The CGS system goes back to a proposal in 1832 by the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to base a system of absolute units on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = C.

[http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf English translation].&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauss chose the units of millimetre, milligram and second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including British physicists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] recommended the general adoption of centimetre, gram and second as fundamental units, and to express all derived electromagnetic units in these fundamental units, using the prefix "C.G.S. unit of ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The sizes of many CGS units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday objects are hundreds or thousands of centimetres long, such as humans, rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide general use outside the field of science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally for scientific purposes by the MKS (metre–kilogram–second) system, which in turn developed into the modern [[SI]] standard.

Since the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide, in the United States more slowly than elsewhere. CGS units are today no longer accepted by the house styles of most scientific journals, textbook publishers, or standards bodies, although they are commonly used in astronomical journals such as ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''. CGS units are still occasionally encountered in technical literature, especially in the United States in the fields of [[material science]], [[electrodynamics]] and [[astronomy]]. The continued usage of CGS units is most prevalent in magnetism and related fields because the B and H fields have the same units in free space and there is a lot of potential for confusion when converting published measurements from cgs to MKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=L.

The units [[gram]] and [[centimetre]] remain useful ''as [[Metric prefix|prefix]]ed units'' within the SI system, especially for instructional physics and chemistry experiments, where they match the small scale of table-top setups. However, where [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s are needed, the SI ones are generally used and taught instead of the CGS ones today. For example, a physics lab course might ask students to record lengths in centimetres, and masses in grams, but force (a derived unit) in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, a usage consistent with the SI system.

==Definition of CGS units in mechanics==
In mechanics, the CGS and SI systems of units are built in an identical way. The two systems differ only in the scale of two out of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), while the third unit (second as the unit of time) is the same in both systems.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI, and the laws of mechanics are not affected by the choice of units. The definitions of all [[derived unit]]s in terms of the three base units are therefore the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous one-to-one correspondence of derived units:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (definition of [[velocity]])
:&lt;math&gt;F=m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]])
:&lt;math&gt;E = \int \vec{F}\cdot \mathrm{d\,}\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[energy]] defined in terms of [[Mechanical work|work]])
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{F}{L^2} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; ([[pressure]] defined as force per unit area)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \tau/\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (dynamic [[viscosity]] defined as [[shear stress]] per unit velocity [[gradient]]).

Thus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, [[barye]], is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:

:1&amp;nbsp;unit of pressure = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of force/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;unit of mass/(1&amp;nbsp;unit of length⋅(1&amp;nbsp;unit of time)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:1 Pa = 1&amp;nbsp;kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Expressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:

:1 Ba = 1 g/(cm⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(10&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

==Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism==

===CGS approach to electromagnetic units===
The conversion factors relating [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] units in the CGS and SI systems are made more complex by the differences in the formulae expressing physical laws of electromagnetism as assumed by each system of units, specifically in the nature of the constants that appear in these formulae. This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: 
* In SI, the unit of [[electric current]], the ampere (A), was historically defined such that the [[magnetism|magnetic]] force exerted by two infinitely long, thin, parallel wires 1 [[metre]] apart and carrying a current of 1 [[ampere]] is exactly 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[newton (unit)|N]]/[[metre|m]]. This definition results in all [[International System of Units#Derived units|SI electromagnetic units]] being consistent (subject to factors of some [[integer]] powers of 10) with the EMU CGS system described in further sections. The ampere is a base unit of the SI system, with the same status as the metre, kilogram, and second. Thus the relationship in the definition of the ampere with the metre and newton is disregarded, and the ampere is not treated as dimensionally equivalent to any combination of other base units. As a result, electromagnetic laws in SI require an additional constant of proportionality (see [[Vacuum permittivity]]) to relate electromagnetic units to kinematic units. (This constant of proportionality is derivable directly from the above definition of the ampere.) All other electric and magnetic units are derived from these four base units using the most basic common definitions: for example, [[charge (physics)|electric charge]] ''q'' is defined as current ''I'' multiplied by time ''t'',
::&lt;math&gt;q=I\cdot t&lt;/math&gt;,
:therefore the unit of electric charge, the [[coulomb]] (C), is defined as 1&amp;nbsp;C = 1&amp;nbsp;A⋅s.
* The CGS system avoids introducing new base quantities and units, and instead ''derives'' all electric and magnetic units directly from the centimetre, gram, and second by specifying the form of the expression of physical laws that relate electromagnetic phenomena to mechanics.

===Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism===
Electromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its [[derivative|rate of change]] (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite book 
| author=Jackson, John David 
| title=Classical Electrodynamics

| pages=775–784
| location=New York 
| publisher=Wiley 
| year=1999 
| isbn=0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in system-independent form as follows:

*The first is [[Coulomb's law]], &lt;math&gt;F = k_{\rm C} \frac{q \cdot q^\prime}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the electrostatic force ''F'' between electric charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, separated by distance ''d''. Here &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the base units.
*The second is [[Ampère's force law]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dL} = 2 k_{\rm A}\frac{I \, I^\prime}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the magnetic force ''F'' per unit length ''L'' between currents ''I'' and ''I&amp;prime;'' flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance ''d'' that is much greater than the wire diameters. Since &lt;math&gt;I=q/t\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I^\prime=q^\prime/t&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the base units.

[[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; must obey &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]]. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=1&lt;/math&gt; then Ampère's force law will contain a prefactor &lt;math&gt;2/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Ampère's force law by setting &lt;math&gt; k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.

Indeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:
* The first law describes the [[Lorentz force]] produced by a magnetic field '''B''' on a charge '''q''' moving with velocity '''v''':
:: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} =  \alpha_{\rm L} q\;\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\;. &lt;/math&gt;
* The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field '''B''' by an electric current ''I'' of finite length d'''l''' at a point displaced by a vector '''r''', known as [[Biot–Savart law]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{B} =  \alpha_{\rm B}\frac{I d\mathbf{l} \times \mathbf{\hat r}}{r^2}\;,&lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r}&lt;/math&gt; are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector '''r''' respectively.
These two laws can be used to derive [[Ampère's force law]] above, resulting in the relationship: &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = \alpha_{\rm L} \cdot \alpha_{\rm B}\;&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the [[Ampère's force law]] such that &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L} = \alpha_{\rm B}=1\;&lt;/math&gt;. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.

Furthermore, if we wish to describe the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''' and the [[magnetic field]] '''H''' in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the [[vacuum permittivity]] and [[magnetic constant|permeability]], respectively. &lt;!-- These two values are related by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}=\alpha_{\rm B} / c&lt;/math&gt;. // removed this statement - seems impossible to prove! --&gt; Then we have&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; (generally) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \lambda \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B} / \mu_0 - \lambda^\prime \mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, where '''P''' and '''M''' are [[polarization density]] and [[magnetization]] vectors. The units of '''P''' and '''M''' are usually so chosen that the factors λ and λ′ are equal to the "rationalization constants" &lt;math&gt;4 \pi k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4 \pi \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L})&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. If the rationalization constants are equal, then &lt;math&gt;c^2 = 1 / (\epsilon_0 \mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}^2)&lt;/math&gt;. If they are equal to one, then the system is said to be "rationalized":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the laws for systems of [[spherical geometry]] contain factors of 4π (for example, [[point charge]]s), those of cylindrical geometry – factors of 2π (for example, [[wire]]s), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of π (for example, parallel-plate [[capacitor]]s). However, the original CGS system used λ = λ′ = 4π, or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} \epsilon_0 = \alpha_{\rm B} / (\mu_0 \alpha_{\rm L}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalized.

The constant ''b'' in SI system is a unit-based scaling factor defined as: &lt;math&gt;b=10^7\,\mathrm{A}^2/\mathrm{N} = 10^7\,\mathrm{m/H}=4\pi/\mu_0=4\pi\epsilon_0 c^2=c^2 / k_{\rm C}\;&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, note the following correspondence of the above constants to those in Jackson&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt; and Leung:&lt;ref name=leu/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A}=k_2=k_{\rm E}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}=k_3=k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;

In system-independent form, [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written as:&lt;ref name=Jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=leu&gt;{{cite journal

Note that of all these variants, only in Gaussian and Heaviside–Lorentz systems &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; rather than 1. As a result, vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt; of an [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating in vacuum have the same units and are equal in [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] in these two variants of CGS.

==={{anchor|ESU}}Electrostatic units (ESU)===
{{main|Electrostatic units}}
In one variant of the CGS system, '''Electrostatic units''' ('''ESU'''), charge is defined via the force it exerts on other charges, and current is then defined as charge per time. It is done by setting the [[Coulomb force constant]] &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Coulomb's law]] does not contain an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]].

The ESU unit of charge, '''franklin''' ('''Fr'''), also known as '''[[statcoulomb]]''' or '''esu charge''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=two equal point charges spaced 1 [[centimetre]] apart are said to be of 1 franklin each if the electrostatic force between them is 1 [[dyne]].}} Therefore, in '''electrostatic CGS units''', a franklin is equal to a centimetre times square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr = 1\,statcoulomb = 1\,esu\; charge = 1\,cm\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of current is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Fr/s = 1\,statampere = 1\,esu\; current = 1\,(cm/s)\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{3/2} \cdot s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the ESU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in ESU CGS. This reduction of units is the consequence of the [[Buckingham π theorem]].

====ESU notation====
All electromagnetic units in ESU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "stat" or with a separate abbreviation "esu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

==={{anchor|EMU}}Electromagnetic units (EMU)===
In another variant of the CGS system, '''electromagnetic units''' ('''EMU'''), current is defined via the force existing between two thin, parallel, infinitely long wires carrying it, and charge is then defined as current multiplied by time. (This approach was eventually used to define the SI unit of [[ampere]] as well). In the EMU CGS subsystem, this is done by setting the Ampere force constant &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm A} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that [[Ampère's force law]] simply contains 2 as an explicit [[Proportionality (mathematics)|prefactor]] (this prefactor 2 is itself a result of integrating a more general formulation of Ampère's law over the length of the infinite wire).

The EMU unit of current, '''biot''' ('''Bi'''), also known as '''[[abampere]]''' or '''emu current''', is therefore defined as follows:&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
{{quote|text=The '''biot''' is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[centimetre]] apart in [[vacuum]], would produce between these conductors a force equal to two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length.}} Therefore, in '''electromagnetic CGS units''', a biot is equal to a square root of dyne:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi = 1\,abampere = 1\,emu\; current= 1\,\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2} \cdot s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit of charge in CGS EMU is:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{1\,Bi\cdot s = 1\,abcoulomb = 1\,emu\, charge= 1\,s\cdot\sqrt{dyne}=1\,g^{1/2} \cdot cm^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dimensionally in the EMU CGS system, charge ''q'' is therefore equivalent to m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in EMU CGS.

====EMU notation====
All electromagnetic units in EMU CGS system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix "ab" or with a separate abbreviation "emu".&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;

===Relations between ESU and EMU units===
The ESU and EMU subsystems of CGS are connected by the fundamental relationship &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C} / k_{\rm A} = c^2&lt;/math&gt; (see above), where ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 ≈ 3⋅10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum in centimetres per second. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding "primary" electrical and magnetic units (e.g. current, charge, voltage, etc. – quantities proportional to those that enter directly into [[Coulomb's law]] or [[Ampère's force law]]) is equal either to ''c''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''c'':&lt;ref name=cardsgc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statcoulomb}{1\,abcoulomb}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statampere}{1\,abampere}}=c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,stattesla}{1\,gauss}}=c&lt;/math&gt;.
Units derived from these may have ratios equal to higher powers of ''c'', for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{1\,statohm}{1\,abohm}}=
\mathrm{\frac{1\,statvolt}{1\,abvolt}}\times\mathrm{\frac{1\,abampere}{1\,statampere}}=c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Practical cgs units===
The practical cgs system is a hybrid system that uses the [[volt]] and the [[ampere]] as the unit of voltage and current respectively.  Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small quantities that arise for electromagnetic units in the esu and emu systems.  This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and amp had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tunbridge, ''Lord Kelvin: His Influence on Electrical Measurements and Units'', pp. 34-40, IET, 1992 {{ISBN|0863412378}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the volt and amp, the [[farad]] (capacitance), [[ohm]] (resistance), [[coulomb]] (electric charge), and [[henry (unit)|henry]] are consequently also used in the practical system and are the same as the SI units.  However, [[intensive properties]] (that is, anything that is per unit length, area, or volume) will not be the same as SI since the cgs unit of distance is the centimetre.  For instance [[electric field strength]] is in units of volts per centimetre, [[magnetic field strength]] is in [[oersted]]s and [[resistivity]] is in ohm-cm.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz E. Knoepfel, ''Magnetic Fields: A Comprehensive Theoretical Treatise for Practical Use'', p. 543, Wiley, 2000 {{ISBN|3527617426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[physicists]] and [[electrical engineers]] in North America still use these hybrid units.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepfel, p. xx{{failed verification|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variants===
There were at various points in time about half a dozen systems of electromagnetic units in use, most based on the CGS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this table, ''c'' = 29,979,245,800 is the numeric value of the [[speed of light]] in vacuum when expressed in units of centimetres per second. The symbol "↔" is used instead of "=" as a reminder that the SI and CGS units are ''corresponding'' but not ''equal'' because they have incompatible dimensions. For example, according to the next-to-last row of the table, if a capacitor has a capacitance of 1&amp;nbsp;F in SI, then it has a capacitance of (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm in ESU; ''but'' it is usually incorrect to replace "1&amp;nbsp;F" with "(10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cm" within an equation or formula. (This warning is a special aspect of electromagnetism units in CGS. By contrast, for example, it is ''always'' correct to replace "1&amp;nbsp;m" with "100&amp;nbsp;cm" within an equation or formula.)

One can think of the SI value of the [[Coulomb constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm C}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=\frac{\mu_0 (c/100)^2}{4\pi}=10^{-7}{\rm N}/{\rm A}^2\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot c^2 = 10^{-11}{\rm N}\cdot c^2/{\rm A}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
This explains why SI to ESU conversions involving factors of ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lead to significant simplifications of the ESU units, such as 1&amp;nbsp;statF = 1&amp;nbsp;cm and 1&amp;nbsp;statΩ = 1&amp;nbsp;s/cm: this is the consequence of the fact that in ESU system ''k''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. For example, a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance of a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum. The capacitance ''C'' between two concentric spheres of radii ''R'' and ''r'' in ESU CGS system is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
By taking the limit as ''R'' goes to infinity we see ''C'' equals ''r''.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
While the absence of explicit prefactors in some CGS subsystems simplifies some theoretical calculations, it has the disadvantage that sometimes the units in CGS are hard to define through experiment. Also, lack of unique unit names leads to a great confusion: thus “15 emu” may mean either 15 [[abvolt]]s, or 15 emu units of [[electric dipole moment]], or 15 emu units of [[magnetic susceptibility]], sometimes (but not always) per [[gram]], or per [[mole (unit)|mole]]. On the other hand, SI starts with a unit of current, the [[ampere]], that is easier to determine through experiment, but which requires extra multiplicative factors in the electromagnetic equations. With its system of uniquely named units, the SI also removes any confusion in usage: 1.0 ampere is a fixed value of a specified quantity, and so are 1.0 [[henry (unit)|henry]], 1.0 [[ohm]], and 1.0 volt.

A key virtue of the [[Gaussian units|Gaussian CGS system]] is that electric and magnetic fields have the same units, 4''πε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by 1, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the [[Maxwell equations]] is ''c'', the speed of light. The [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz system]] has these desirable properties as well (with ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equaling 1), but it is a “rationalized” system (as is SI) in which the charges and fields are defined in such a way that there are many fewer factors of 4''π'' appearing in the formulas, and it is in Heaviside–Lorentz units that the Maxwell equations take their simplest form.

In SI, and other rationalized systems (for example, [[Lorentz–Heaviside units|Heaviside–Lorentz]]), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4π, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2π and those dealing with charged surfaces lack π entirely, which was the most convenient choice for applications in [[electrical engineering]]. However, modern [[calculator|hand calculator]]s and [[personal computer]]s have eliminated this "advantage". In some fields where formulas concerning spheres are common (for example, in  astrophysics), it has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that the nonrationalized CGS system can be somewhat more convenient notationally.

Specialized unit systems are used to simplify formulas even further than ''either'' SI ''or'' CGS, by eliminating constants through some system of [[natural units]]. For example, in [[particle physics]] a system is in use where every quantity is expressed by only one unit of energy, the [[electronvolt]], with lengths, times, and so on all converted into electronvolts by inserting factors of [[speed of light|speed of light ''c'']] and the [[Planck constant|Planck constant ''ħ'']]. This unit system is very convenient for calculations in [[particle physics]], but it would be considered impractical in other contexts.

'''Chaining''' is an instructional procedure used in [[behavioral psychology]], [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]]. It involves [[reinforcing]] individual responses occurring in a sequence to form a complex behavior. It is frequently used for training behavioral sequences (or "chains") that are beyond the current repertoire of the learner. The term is often credited to the work of [[B.F. Skinner]], an American [[psychologist]] working at Harvard University in the 1930s. 

==Procedure==
The chain of responses is broken down into small steps using [[task analysis]]. Parts of a chain are referred to as links. The learner's skill level is assessed by an appropriate professional and is then either taught one step at a time while being assisted through the other steps forward or backwards or if the learner already can complete a certain percentage of the steps independently, the remaining steps are all worked on during each trial [[total task]]. A verbal stimulus or prompt is used at the beginning of the teaching trial. The stimulus change that occurs between each response becomes the reinforcer for that response as well as the prompt/stimulus for the next response without requiring assistance from the teacher. For example, in purchasing a soda you pull the money out of your pocket and see the money in your hand and then put the money in the machine. Seeing the money in your hand both was the reinforcer for the first response (getting money out of pocket) and was what prompted you to do the next response (putting money in machine).

As small chains become mastered, i.e. are performed consistently following the initial discriminative stimulus prompt, they may be used as links in larger chains. (Ex. teach hand washing, tooth brushing, and showering until mastered and then teach morning hygiene routine which includes the mastered skills). Chaining requires that the teachers present the training skill in the same order each time and is most effective when teachers are delivering the same prompts to the learner. The most common forms of chaining are backward chaining, forward chaining, and total task presentation.&lt;ref name="Cooper, Heron, and Heward"&gt;John O. Cooper, Timothy E. Heron, and William L. Heward, Applied Behavior Analysis, Second Edition, Pearson Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===More on Chaining===
There are two different types of chains: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The prior homogeneous chains occur when the topography or form of response are similar in each component.  In contrast, a heterogeneous chain requires different types of responses for each link.&lt;ref name="Pierce and Cheney"&gt;W. David Pierce and Carl D. Cheney, Behavior Analysis and Learning, Fourth Edition, Psychology Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30006">'''Choice modelling''' attempts to model the decision process of an individual or segment via [[revealed preference]]s or stated preferences made in a particular context or contexts. Typically, it attempts to use discrete choices (A over B; B over A, B &amp; C) in order to infer positions of the items (A, B and C) on some relevant latent scale (typically "[[utility]]" in economics and various related fields). Indeed many alternative models exist in [[econometrics]], [[marketing]], [[sociometrics]] and other fields, including [[utility]] maximization, [[optimization]] applied to [[consumer theory]], and a plethora of other identification strategies which may be more or less accurate depending on the [[data]], [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], [[hypothesis]] and the particular decision being modelled. In addition, choice modelling is regarded as the most suitable method for estimating consumers' [[willingness to pay]] for quality improvements in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;2001 - Centre for International Economics - Review of willingness-to-pay methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
There are a number of terms which are considered to be synonyms with the term choice modelling. Some are accurate (although typically discipline or continent specific) and some are used in industry applications, although considered inaccurate in academia (such as conjoint analysis).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These include the following:

#[[#Stated preference|Stated preference discrete choice modeling]]
#[[Discrete choice]]
#[[Choice experiment]]
#Stated preference studies
#[[Conjoint analysis]]
#[[Controlled experiments]]
Although disagreements in terminology persist, it is notable that the academic journal intended to provide a cross-disciplinary source of new and empirical research into the field is called the Journal of Choice Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal of Choice Modelling|url = http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-choice-modelling/|website = Elsevier|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical background ==
The theory behind choice modelling was developed independently by economists and mathematical psychologists. The origins of choice modelling can be traced to [[Louis Leon Thurstone|Thurstone's]] research into food preferences in the 1920s and to [[random utility theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1928-00527-001|title=A law of comparative judgment.|last=Thurston|first=|date=1994|website=APA PsycNET|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, random utility theory was then developed by Daniel McFadden&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontiers in Econometrics|last = Zarembka|first = Paul|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1974|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 105–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in mathematical psychology primarily by [[R. Duncan Luce|Duncan]] Luce and Anthony Marley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conditional logit analysis of qualitative choice behavior|last = Luce|first = R. Duncan|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 1959|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, choice modelling assumes that the utility (benefit, or value) that an individual derives from item A over item B is a function of the frequency that (s)he chooses item A over item B in repeated choices. Due to his use of the [[normal distribution]] Thurstone was unable to generalise this binary choice into a multinomial choice framework (which required the [[multinomial logistic regression]] rather than probit link function), hence why the method languished for over 30 years. However, in the 1960s through 1980s the method was axiomatised and applied in a variety of types of study.

== Distinction between revealed and stated preference studies ==
Choice modelling is used in both [[revealed preference]] (RP) and [[stated preference]] (SP) studies. RP studies use the choices made already by individuals to estimate the value they ascribe to items - they "reveal their preferences - and hence values (utilities) – by their choices". SP studies use the choices made by individuals made under experimental conditions to estimate these values – they "state their preferences via their choices". McFadden successfully used revealed preferences (made in previous transport studies) to predict the demand for the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) before it was built. Luce and Marley had previously axiomatised random utility theory but had not used it in a real world application;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some probabilistic models of simple choice and ranking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022249668900783|journal = Journal of Mathematical Psychology|date = 1968-06-01|pages = 311–332|volume = 5|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-2496(68)90078-3|first = A. A. J.|last = Marley}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore they spent many years testing the method in SP studies involving psychology students.

== History ==
McFadden's work earned him the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2000/ Economics 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000. However, much of the work in choice modelling had for almost 20 years been proceeding in the field of stated preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Design and Analysis of Simulated Consumer Choice or Allocation Experiments: An Approach Based on Aggregate Data|jstor = 3151440|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = 1983-11-01|pages = 350–367|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/3151440|first = Jordan J.|last = Louviere|first2 = George|last2 = Woodworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED CHOICE OR ALLOCATION EXPERIMENTS IN TRAVEL CHOICE MODELING|url = http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=189334|journal = Transportation Research Record|date = 1982-01-01|issn = 0361-1981|issue = 890|first = Jordan J.|last = Louviere|first2 = David A.|last2 = Hensher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such work arose in various disciplines, originally transport and marketing, due to the need to predict demand for new products that were potentially expensive to produce. This work drew heavily on the fields of [[conjoint analysis]] and [[design of experiments]], in order to:
# Present to consumers goods or services that were defined by particular features (attributes) that had levels, e.g. "price" with levels "$10, $20, $30"; "follow-up service" with levels "no warranty, 10 year warranty";
# Present configurations of these goods that minimised the number of choices needed in order to estimate the consumer's utility function (decision rule).
Specifically, the aim was to present the minimum number of pairs/triples etc of (for example) mobile/cell phones in order that the analyst might estimate the value the consumer derived (in monetary units) from every possible feature of a phone. In contrast to much of the work in conjoint analysis, discrete choices (A versus B; B versus A, B &amp; C) were to be made, rather than ratings on category rating scales ([[Likert scale]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s). David Hensher and Jordan Louviere are widely credited with the first stated preference choice models.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They remained pivotal figures, together with others including Joffre Swait and Moshe Ben-Akiva, and over the next three decades in the fields of transport and marketing helped develop and disseminate the methods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stated Choice Methods|url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/stated-choice-methods-analysis-and-applications|website = Cambridge University Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Discrete Choice Analysis|url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/discrete-choice-analysis|website = MIT Press|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other figures, predominantly working in transport economics and marketing, contributed to theory and practice and helped disseminate the work widely.

== Relationship with conjoint analysis ==
Choice modelling from the outset suffered from a lack of standardisation of terminology and all the terms given above have been used to describe it. However, the largest disagreement has proved to be geographical: in the Americas, following industry practice there, the term "choice-based conjoint analysis" has come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Survey Software &amp; Conjoint Analysis - What is Conjoint Analysis?|url = http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/products/conjoint-choice-analysis/conjoint-analysis-software|website = www.sawtoothsoftware.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected a desire that choice modelling (1) reflect the attribute and level structure inherited from conjoint analysis, but (2) show that discrete choices, rather than numerical ratings, be used as the outcome measure elicited from consumers. Elsewhere in the world, the term discrete choice experiment has come to dominate in virtually all disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Louviere (marketing and transport) and colleagues in environmental and health economics came to disavow the American terminology, claiming that it was misleading and disguised a fundamental difference discrete choice experiments have from traditional conjoint methods: discrete choice experiments have a testable theory of human decision-making underpinning them (random utility theory), whilst conjoint methods are simply a way of decomposing the value of a good using ''statistical'' designs from numerical ratings that have no ''psychological'' theory to explain what the rating scale numbers mean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discrete Choice Experiments Are Not Conjoint Analysis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700149|journal = Journal of Choice Modelling|date = 2010-01-01|pages = 57–72|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S1755-5345(13)70014-9|first = Jordan J|last = Louviere|first2 = Terry N|last2 = Flynn|first3 = Richard T|last3 = Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designing a choice model ==
Designing a choice model or discrete choice experiment (DCE) generally follows the following steps:
# Identifying the good or service to be valued;
# Deciding on what attributes and levels fully describe the good or service;
# Constructing an [[Experimental design]] that is appropriate for those attributes and levels, either from a design catalogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Orthogonal Arrays|url = https://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts723.html|website = support.sas.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via a software program;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ChoiceMetrics {{!}} Ngene {{!}} Features|url = http://www.choice-metrics.com/features.html|website = www.choice-metrics.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Constructing the survey, replacing the design codes (numbers) with the relevant attribute levels;
# Administering the survey to a sample of respondents in any of a number of formats including paper and pen, but increasingly via web surveys;
# Analysing the data using appropriate models, often beginning with the [[Multinomial logistic regression]] model, given its attractive properties in terms of consistency with economic demand theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Identifying the good or service to be valued ===
This is often the easiest task, typically defined by:
* the research question in an academic study, or
* the needs of the client (in the context of a consumer good or service)

=== Deciding on what attributes and levels fully describe the good or service ===
A good or service, for instance mobile (cell) phone, is typically described by a number of attributes (features). Phones are often described by shape, size, memory, brand, etc. The attributes to be varied in the DCE must be all those that are of interest to respondents. Omitting key attributes typically causes respondents to make inferences (guesses) about those missing from the DCE, leading to omitted variable problems. The levels must typically include all those currently available, and often are expanded to include those that are possible in future – this is particularly useful in guiding product development.

=== Constructing an experimental design that is appropriate for those attributes and levels, either from a design catalogue, or via a software program ===
A strength of DCEs and conjoint analyses is that they typically present a subset of the full factorial. For example, a phone with two brands, three shapes, three sizes and four amounts of memory has 2x3x3x4=72 possible configurations. This is the full factorial and in most cases is too large to administer to respondents. Subsets of the full factorial can be produced in a variety of ways but in general they have the following aim: to enable estimation of a certain limited number of parameters describing the good: main effects (for example the value associated with brand, holding all else equal), two-way interactions (for example the value associated with this brand and the smallest size, that brand and the smallest size), etc. This is typically achieved by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with lower order interactions. For example, two-way and three-way interactions may be confounded with main effects. This has the following consequences:
* The number of profiles (configurations) is significantly reduced;
* A regression coefficient for a given main effect is unbiased if and only if the confounded terms (higher order interactions) are zero;
* A regression coefficient is biased in an unknown direction and with an unknown magnitude if the confounded interaction terms are non-zero;
* No correction can be made at the analysis to solve the problem, should the confounded terms be non-zero.
Thus, researchers have repeatedly been warned that design involves critical decisions to be made concerning whether two-way and higher order interactions are likely to be non-zero; making a mistake at the design stage effectively invalidates the results since the hypothesis of higher order interactions being non-zero is untestable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Designs are available from catalogues and statistical programs. Traditionally they had the property of [[Orthogonality]] where all attribute levels can be estimated independently of each other. This ensures zero collinearity and can be explained using the following example.

Imagine a car dealership that sells both luxury cars and used low-end vehicles. Using the utility maximisation principle and assuming an MNL model, we hypothesise that the decision to buy a car from this dealership is the sum of the individual contribution of each of the following to the total utility.
* Price
* Marque (BMW, Chrysler, Mitsubishi)
* Origin (German, American)
* Performance

Using multinomial regression on the sales data however will not tell us what we want to know. The reason is that much of the data is collinear since cars at this dealership are either:

* high performance, expensive German cars
* low performance, cheap American cars

There is not enough information, nor will there ever be enough, to tell us whether people are buying cars because they are European, because they are a BMW or because they are high performance. This is a fundamental reason why RP data are often unsuitable and why SP data are required. In RP data these three attributes always co-occur and in this case are perfectly [[correlated]]. That is: all BMWs are made in Germany and are of high performance. These three attributes: origin, marque and performance are said to be collinear or non-orthogonal. Only in experimental conditions, via SP data, can performance and price be varied independently – have their effects decomposed.

An [[experimental design]] (below) in a Choice Experiment is a strict scheme for controlling and presenting hypothetical scenarios, or [[choice set]]s to respondents. For the same experiment, different designs could be used, each with different properties. The best design depends on the objectives of the exercise.

It is the experimental design that drives the experiment and the ultimate capabilities of the model. Many very efficient designs exist in the public domain that allow near optimal experiments to be performed.

For example the [[Latin square]] 16&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; design allows the estimation of all main effects of a product that could have up to 16&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately 295 followed by eighteen zeros) configurations. Furthermore this could be achieved within a sample frame of only around 256 respondents.

Below is an example of a much smaller design. This is 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; main effects design.

This design would allow the estimation of main effects utilities from 81 (3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) possible product configurations ''assuming all higher order interactions are zero''. A sample of around 20 respondents could model the main effects of all 81 possible product configurations with statistically significant results.

Some examples of other experimental designs commonly used:

*Balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD)
*Random designs
*Main effects
*Higher order interaction designs
*Full factorial

More recently, efficient designs have been produced.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Constructing Efficient Stated Choice Experimental Designs|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01441640902827623|journal = Transport Reviews|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 0144-1647|pages = 587–617|volume = 29|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/01441640902827623|first = John M.|last = Rose|first2 = Michiel C.

A common function is the [[D-efficiency]] of the parameters. The aim of these designs is to reduce the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of the estimated utility parameters. Such designs have often incorporated Bayesian priors for the parameters, to further improve statistical precision.&lt;ref&gt;[Rossi, P., Allenby, G., McCulloch, R. (2009) Bayesian statistic and marketing. Wiley]&lt;/ref&gt; Highly efficient designs have become extremely popular, given the costs of recruiting larger numbers of respondents. However, key figures in the development of these designs have warned of possible limitations, most notably the following.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Design efficiency is typically maximised when good A and good B are as different as possible: for instance every attribute (feature) defining the phone differs across A and B. This forces the respondent to trade across price, brand, size, memory, etc; no attribute has the same level in both A and B. This may impose cognitive burden on the respondent, leading him/her to use simplifying heuristics ("always choose the cheapest phone") that do not reflect his/her true utility function (decision rule). Recent empirical work has confirmed that respondents do indeed have different decision rules when answering a less efficient design compared to a highly efficient design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Are Efficient Designs Used In Discrete Choice Experiments Too Difficult For Some Respondents? A Case Study Eliciting Preferences for End-Of-Life Care|last = Flynn|first = Terry N|date = March 2016|journal = Pharmacoeconomics|doi = 10.1007/s40273-015-0338-z |pmid = 26589411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More information on experimental designs may be found [[experimental design|here]]. It is worth reiterating, however, that small designs that estimate main effects typically do so by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with the main effects. This means that unless those interactions are zero in practice, the analyst will obtain biased estimates of the main effects. Furthermore (s)he has (1) no way of testing this, and (2) no way of correcting it in analysis. This emphasises the crucial role of design in DCEs.

=== Constructing the survey ===
Constructing the survey typically involves:
* Doing a "find and replace" in order that the experimental design codes (typically numbers as given in the example above) are replaced by the attribute levels of the good in question.
* Putting the resulting configurations (for instance types of mobile/cell phones) into a broader survey than may include questions pertaining to sociodemographics of the respondents. This may aid in segmenting the data at the analysis stage: for example males may differ from females in their preferences.

=== Administering the survey to a sample of respondents in any of a number of formats including paper and pen, but increasingly via web surveys ===
Traditionally, DCEs were administered via paper and pen methods. Increasingly, with the power of the web, internet surveys have become the norm. These have advantages in terms of cost, randomising respondents to different versions of the survey, and using screening. An example of the latter would be to achieve balance in gender: if too many males answered, they can be screened out in order that the number of females matches that of males.

=== Analysing the data using appropriate models, often beginning with the [[multinomial logistic regression]] model, given its attractive properties in terms of consistency with economic demand theory ===
Analysing the data from a DCE requires the analyst to assume a particular type of decision rule - or functional form of the utility equation in economists' terms. This is usually dictated by the design: if a main effects design has been used then two-way and higher order interaction terms cannot be included in the model. Regression models are then typically estimated. These often begin with the conditional logit model - traditionally, although slightly misleadingly, referred to as the multinomial logistic (MNL) regression model by choice modellers. The MNL model converts the observed choice frequencies (being estimated probabilities, on a ratio scale) into utility estimates (on an interval scale) via the logistic function. The utility (value) associated with every attribute level can be estimated, thus allowing the analyst to construct the total utility of any possible configuration (in this case, of car or phone). However, a DCE may alternatively be used to estimate non-market environmental benefits and costs.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Bennet University of Queensland https://www.epa.qld.gov.au/publications?id=1585&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths==
* Forces respondents to consider trade-offs between attributes;
* Makes the frame of reference explicit to respondents via the inclusion of an array of attributes and product alternatives;
* Enables implicit prices to be estimated for attributes;
* Enables welfare impacts to be estimated for multiple scenarios;
* Can be used to estimate the level of customer demand for alternative 'service product' in non-monetary terms; and
* Potentially reduces the incentive for respondents to behave strategically.&lt;ref&gt;2001 – The Centre for International Economics – review of
willingness-to-pay methodologies&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaknesses ==
* Discrete choices provide only [[ordinal data]], which provides less information than ratio or interval data;
* Inferences from ordinal data, to produce estimates on an interval/ratio scale, require assumptions about error distributions and the respondent's decision rule (functional form of the utility function);
* Fractional factorial designs used in practice deliberately confound two-way and higher order interactions with lower order (typically main effects) estimates in order to make the design small: if the higher order interactions are non-zero then main effects are biased, with no way for the analyst to know or correct this ex post;
* Non-probabilistic (deterministic) decision-making by the individual violates random utility theory: under a random utility model, utility estimates become infinite.
* There is one fundamental weakness of all limited dependent variable models such as logit and probit models: the means (true positions) and variances on the latent scale are perfectly [[Confounded]]. In other words they cannot be separated.

== The mean-variance confound ==
Yatchew and Griliches first proved that means and variances were confounded in limited dependent variable models (where the dependent variable takes any of a discrete set of values rather than a [[continuous variable|continuous]] one as in conventional linear regression).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Specification Error in Probit Models|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24094302_Specification_Error_in_Probit_Models|journal = The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume = 67|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1928444|first = Adonis|last = Yatchew|first2 = Zvi|last2 = Griliches}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limitation becomes acute in choice modelling for the following reason: a large estimated beta from the MNL regression model or any other choice model can mean:
# Respondents place the item high up on the latent scale (they value it highly), or
# Respondents do not place the item high up on the scale BUT they are very certain of their preferences, consistently (frequently) choosing the item over others presented alongside, or
# Some combination of (1) and (2).
This has significant implications for the interpretation of the output of a regression model. All statistical programs "solve" the mean-variance confound by setting the variance equal to a constant; all estimated beta coefficients are, in fact, an estimated beta multiplied by an estimated lamda (an inverse function of the variance). This tempts the analyst to ignore the problem. However (s)he must consider whether a set of large beta coefficients reflect strong preferences (a large true beta) or consistency in choices (a large true lamda), or some combination of the two. Dividing all estimates by one other – typically that of the price variable – cancels the confounded lamda term from numerator and denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Combining sources of preference data |journal = Journal of Econometrics|date = 1998-11-26|pages = 197–221|volume = 89|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00061-X|first = David|last = Hensher|first2 = Jordan|last2 = Louviere|first3 = Joffre|last3 = Swait}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solves the problem, with the added benefit that it provides economists with the respondent's willingness to pay for each attribute level. However, the finding that results estimated in "utility space" do not match those estimated in "willingness to pay space",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applications of simulation methods in environmental and resource economics|last = Train|first = Kenneth|publisher = Doredrecht|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heterogeneity Distributions of Willingness-to-Pay in Choice Models|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5155835_Heterogeneity_distributions_of_willingness-to-pay_in_choice_models|journal = |doi = 10.2139/ssrn.928412|first = Garrett|last = Sonnier|first2 = Andrew S.|last2 = Ainslie|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Otter}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the confound problem is not solved by this "trick": variances may be attribute specific or some other function of the variables (which would explain the discrepancy). This is a subject of current research in the field.

== Versus traditional ratings-based conjoint methods ==
Major problems with ratings questions that do not occur with choice models are:
*no trade-off information. A risk with ratings is that respondents tend not to differentiate between perceived 'good' attributes and rate them all as attractive.
*variant personal scales. Different individuals value a '2' on a scale of 1 to 5 differently. Aggregation of the frequencies of each of the scale measures has no theoretical basis.
*no relative measure. How does an analyst compare something rated a 1 to something rated a 2? Is one twice as good as the other? Again there is no theoretical way of aggregating the data.

== Other types ==

=== Ranking ===
Rankings do tend to force the individual to indicate relative preferences for the items of interest. Thus the trade-offs between these can, like in a DCE, typically be estimated. However, ranking models must test whether the same utility function is being estimated at every ranking depth: e.g. the same estimates (up to variance scale) must result from the bottom rank data as from the top rank data.

=== Best–worst scaling ===
[[Best–worst scaling]] (BWS) is a well-regarded alternative to ratings and ranking. It asks people to choose their most and least preferred options from a range of alternatives.  By subtracting or integrating across the choice probabilities, utility scores for each alternative can be estimated on an interval or ratio scale, for individuals and/or groups. Various psychological models may be utilised by individuals to produce best-worst data, including the [[MaxDiff]] model.

== Uses ==

Choice modelling is particularly useful for:

*Predicting uptake and refining [[new product development]]
*Estimating the implied willingness to pay (WTP) for goods and services
*Product or service viability testing
*Estimating the effects of product characteristics on consumer choice
*Variations of product attributes
*Understanding brand value and preference
*Demand estimates and optimum pricing

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building?

Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M.

The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M.

* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]].

In [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and [[literary theory]], the concepts of '''deictic field''' and '''deictic shift''' are sometimes deployed in the study of narrative media. These terms provide a theoretical framework for helping literary analysts to conceptualize the ways in which readers redirect their attention away from their immediate surroundings as they become immersed in the reality generated by the text.

==Deixis==
The term "[[deixis]]" refers to the ways in which language encodes contextual information into its [[grammatical]] system. More broadly, deixis refers to the inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs.  To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the "here" and "now" (proximal deixis) from the "then" and "there" (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, "When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion-specific considerations."&lt;ref name="MG2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective|date=1995|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|isbn=9780203052907|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|pages=19; 59|last1=Galbraith|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story's characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. "Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.

==Labov's narrative model==
When examining perspectives on narration in [[natural language|natural-language]] environments, one must not ignore [[William Labov]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} who argues that stories of personal experience can be divided into distinct sections, each of which serves a unique function within the narrative progression. Labov schematizes the organization of natural narrative using the following conceptual units: abstract, orientation, complicating action, resolution, evaluation, and coda. Generally, anecdotal narratives tend to arrange these units in the order outlined; however, this is not an inflexible, structural progression that defines how every narrative must develop. For instance, sentences and phrasal items that serve an evaluative function can be interspersed throughout a narrative. Some stretches of narrative discourse also feature overlap among these Labovian categories. Each of Labov's narrative divisions serves a characteristic purpose typified by a particular section's grammatical construction and functional role within the unfolding narrative, but the boundaries of such divisions are not always clear-cut.

As a feature of natural language, deixis is an important element of oral narrative and can be realized in different ways in each of Labov's categories. According to Galbraith, "All language use depends on some felt relevance to situation, on the attention of participants, and their ability to lift out the topic....Like zero in mathematics and the dark space in the theater, deixis orients us within a situation without calling attention to itself".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Two of Labov's categories that often feature deixis prominently are the "orientation" and the "coda". The orientation typically occurs near the beginning of a narrative and serves to introduce the characters, settings, and events. Given its presentative quality, the orientation shifts the deictic center away from the speaker's here-and-now into the spatiotemporal coordinates of the story, which logically must occur at a time prior to the story's enunciation. The coda occurs toward the end of a narrative and functions as a means of terminating the flow of story events. By doing so, the coda reorients the speakers and listeners out of the story world and back into the communicative present.

== Deictic center ==
The deictic center—sometimes called the "origo" or zero-point—represents the originating source in relation to which deictic expressions gain their context-dependent meaning. Often the deictic center is the speaker: thus, any tokens of "I" in the speaker's discourse must deictically refer back to the speaker as center; likewise, the word "you" must project outward from this center toward the addressee. Any participants not part of this communicative channel will be referred to in the third person. The theory of deixis is therefore egocentric in that the indexical anchorage of deictic expressions is a function of this zero-point of subjectivity. The "I"-center serves as the perceptual vantage point that surveys relations among salient contextual entities and events. Such a center, therefore, determines which deictic expressions are pragmatically licensed by a context that has been naturally delimited through this perceptual and evaluative locus. Thus, the appropriateness of a proximal "this" over a distal "that" is determined by the nearness of an object or a location in relation to the deictic zero-point.

A deictic field contains the range of bounded participants and objects, spatial locations and landmarks, and temporal frames that point back to some deictic center as the source for their pragmatic demarcation. The deictic field radiates out from the deictic center, and the boundaries of such a field enclose the scope of objects, spaces, and events that constitute a set from which deictic expressions might seek out a potential referent. These fields function as cognitive frames that participants in a discourse can use to conceptualize their contextual surroundings in relation to each interlocutor's (alternating) function as deictic center across communicative turns. Within the context of literature, the presence of multiple deictic fields in a text can be fruitfully analyzed using the cognitive principle of deictic shift (discussed below).

== Deictic shift theory ==
Deictic shift theory (DST) refers to a range of immersion processes by which readers imaginatively project hypothetical deictic centers that are anchored to communicative and experiential loci within a narrative. Such cognitive framing, theorists of DST argue, form a necessary part of the reader's involvement in narrative, whereby through a process of frame shifting the reader constructs a story world by interpreting the (deictic) cues instantiated in the text. Deictic shifting can be accomplished in several ways. The most basic shift involves the reader's initial immersion into the world of the story. Here the deictic center moves out of the here-and-now of the reader's physical environment and becomes anchored to some text-internal perceptual or presentative instance, in most cases the deictic center of a character or a narrator. Deictic shifts at the level of narration include those cues that implicate a covert or overt narrator—specifically, story commentary or instances when the narrator refers to himself or herself as an "I." Such instances of commentary and evaluation often reflect the perceptual field, as well as the interpretive and ideological stance, of the narrator as he or she presents the story's events.

Within the world of the story, deictic shifts occur in a number of ways. A fundamental shift occurs when the deictic center moves from one character to another—for instance, in cases of omniscient thought report. Here the reader must adjust the deictic center accordingly and interprets the lens of the current focal window through the experiential subjectivity of the character-locus. Other forms of story-internal deictic shifts involve the cognitive framing associated with embedded narratives and other discourse-types: stories-within-stories, letters in epistolary fiction, diary entries, hypertext ruptures, etc.
  
"Within literary scholarship, it is often noted that first and second person pronouns (and less so, and differently, third) facilitate readerly identification with the textually inscribed position (the position of the character or narrator designated by that pronoun), and evoke a sense of readerly conceptual immersion in the fictional world of the story, contributing to the ways in which the scene is imaginatively 'realized' in the mind of the reader, particularly the perspective from which the scene is conceptually visualized. Cognitive poetics and cognitive narratology have employed deictic shift theory, largely based on the work of Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt, to attempt to offer a cognitive account of how these interpretative effects are created. DST proposes that readers conceptually project to the contextual locus of the speaker of deictic cues in order to comprehend them, offering a model of how the deictic referents determining such contextual coordinates are processed by readers, and how this contributes to readers' conceptualization of the world of the story" (Deictic shifting in literature: Experimental analysis&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;).

== Deixis in narratology ==
Buhler applied the theory of deixis to narratives. He proposed the concept of Zeigfeld, or deictic field, which operates in three modes:&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; the first, ''ad oculos'', "operates in the here-and-now of the speaker's sensible environment;" the second, anaphora, "operates in the context of the discourse itself considered as a structured environment;" and the third, what Buhler calls ''deixis at phantasma'', operates in the context "of imagination and long-term memory."&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Buhler's model attempts "to describe the psychological and physical process whereby the live deictic field of our own bodily orientation and experience" is "transposed into an imaginative construction." According to Buhler, "the body-feeling representation, or Korspertastbild (what psychologists would probably now call the body schema), becomes loosened from its involvement with the HERE//NOW/I deictic coordinates of waking life in our immediate environment, and becomes available to translation into an environment we construct both conceptually and orientationally"; this deictic coordinate system is used "in the constructive environment to orient ourselves within 'the somewhere-realm of pure imagination and the there-and-there in memory'".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

Katie Hamburger, a German narrative theorist, studied and theorized how deictic words are used in literature. In her work ''The Logic of Literature'', she argued that there are two realms of language act: reality statement and fiction (Galbraith, 24-25). Reality statements are by someone and about something.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; "Acts of fictional narration, on the other hand, transfer their referentiality from the actuality of the historical world to the entertained reality of the fictive world, and transfer the subjectivity of the speaker to the subjectivity of the story world characters".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Hamburger argued that this transfer occurs due to the use of deictic adverbs, and psychological verbs.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

Following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1861, Queen Victoria had withdrawn from social life and "the mantle of royal entertaining" was passed to the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] and his wife, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]].&lt;ref name="enoughofthistomfoolery"/&gt;  During the 1870s,&lt;ref name="Toit2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toit|first1=Herman du|title=Pageants and Processions: Images and Idiom as Spectacle|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443815079|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfUZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; they hosted a costume ball at [[Marlborough House]], their London residence, which was considered a success and carried on the popularity of such events.&lt;ref name="enoughofthistomfoolery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masque1897"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lady Masque|title=The Great World {{!}} Lady's Realm|date=1897|publisher=Hutchinson and Company|page=464|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF5EAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA464|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Devonshires, who were close friends of the Prince and Princess of Wales, therefore, decided to throw a costume ball thrown to celebrate [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[diamond jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Chatsworth"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cavendish Story: The Double Duchess|url=http://www.chatsworthblog.org/2014/11/the-cavendish-story-double-duchess.html|website=www.chatsworthblog.org|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession had taken place on 22 June 1897 and followed a route six miles long through London.  More than 700 invitations were sent out a month before the event, although some reports of the event stated up to 3,000 invites.&lt;ref name="rvondeh"/&gt; By accident, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria]], the [[List of Saxon consorts#Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] did not receive invitations. When the Duchess of Devonshire saw her at a different jubilee [[fête]] and asked if she was coming, "the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha freezingly replied, 'Certainly not'".&lt;ref name="1897INvite"&gt;{{cite news|title=GOTHA SNUBBED IN ENGLAND.; Chaffed by the Prince of Wales Over Newspaper Indifference.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/07/11/117907076.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 July 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costumes===
The Duchess of Devonshire's costume was described in detail by ''[[The Times]]'':&lt;ref name="1897TimesCoverage"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE’S BALL|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/33170650/|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=[[The Times]]|date=3 July 1897|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Duchess of Devonshire, as Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, wore a magnificent costume. The skirt of gold tissue was embroidered all over in a star-like design in emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, and other jewels outlined with gold, the corners where it opened in front being elaborately wrought in the same jewels and gold to represent peacocks outspread tails. This opened to show an underdress of cream crepe de chine, delicately embroidered in silver, gold, and pearls and sprinkled all over with diamonds. The train, which was attached to the shoulders by two slender points and was fastened at the waist with a large diamond ornament, was a green velvet of a lovely shade, and was superbly embroidered in Oriental designs introducing the lotus flower in rubies, sapphires, amethysts, emeralds, and diamonds, with four borderings on contrasting grounds, separated with gold cord. The train was lined with turquoise satin. The bodice was composed of gold tissue to match the skirt, and the front was of crepe de chine hidden with a stomacher of real diamonds, rubies and emeralds and jewelled belt. A gold crown incrusted (sic) with emeralds, diamonds, and rubies, with a diamond drop at each curved end and two upstanding white ostrich feathers in the middle, and round the front festoons of pearls with a large pear shaped pearl in the centre falling on the forehead."&lt;ref name="1897TimesCoverage"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most expensive costumes was worn by [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough]] who went as the [[Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur|French Ambassador]] [[List of Ambassadors of France to Russia|to the Court of]] [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Sara|title=Van Dyck in Check Trousers: Fancy Dress in Art and Life ; 1700 - 1900 ; [1 July to 10 September 1978, Held in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery]|date=1978|publisher=Scottish National Portrait Gallery|isbn=9780903148160|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESyDAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The velvet costume was made by the [[House of Worth]] and was embroidered in silver, pearls and diamonds with a waistcoat made out of gold and white [[damask]]. The price of the costume, which cost 5,000 [[franc]]s, reportedly even shocked the Duke, who had famously married American heiress [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Sebba2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sebba|first1=Anne|title=American Jennie: The Remarkable Life of Lady Randolph Churchill|date=2007|publisher=W.

==Legacy==
The ball was reproduced on the London stage in [[Drury Lane]] in September 1897 "to the scandal of nobility and the amusement of the commoners."&lt;ref name="1897Stage"&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW PLAYS ON LONDON'S STAGE; Kyrle Bellew and Mrs. Potter Make Their Debut in "Francillon" -- Duchess of Devonshire's Ball. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/09/19/102062421.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 September 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ball was utilized as the setting for the last act of a new play entitled ''[[The White Heather (play)|The White Heather]]'' by [[Cecil Raleigh]] and [[Henry Hamilton (playwright)|Henry Hamilton]].  ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "the very possessions of royalter were 'desecrated' by exhibition on the stage, for the managers, with enterprise almost America, had purchased from the costumers some of the most gorgeous habiliments worn at that revel."&lt;ref name="1897Stage"/&gt; The play inspired the 1919 film, ''[[The White Heather]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.mbrs.sfdb.10553/default.html The Library of Congress/FIAF American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:''The White Heather'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutually beneficial connections among industry, natural systems, energy, material and local communities become central factors in designing industrial production processes.&lt;ref name=HandBook&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook on Codes, Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions for Eco-Industrial Parks |url=http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/wei/papers/codes_files/codes.htm |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=23 April 2014 |author=Cohen-Rosenthal, E |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011225060140/http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/wei/papers/codes_files/codes.htm |archivedate=December 25, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach itself is largely voluntary and market-driven but often pressed ahead by favorable government treatment or efforts of development co-operation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== History ==
Since the early 1990s the idea of EID evolved from [[Symbiosis|biological symbiosis]].  This concept was adapted by industrial ecologists in the search for innovative approaches to solve problems of waste, energy shortage and degradation of the environment.  A continuous approach towards improving both environmental and economic outcomes is used.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, B. (2007): The Limit and Merit of Taking Sustainable Buildings as a Catalyst for Eco-Industrial Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[international community]] officially connected development co-operation to sustainable environmental protection for the first time. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[UNCED]]) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil nearly 180 states signed the conference’s Rio Declaration. Although non-binding, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development laid out 27 principles that shall guide the increasing inter-connectedness of development cooperation and sustainability.&lt;ref name=UN1992&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm|publisher=United nations|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the documents drafting was accompanied by a presentation describing the idea of eco-industrial development for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the following years, EID became popular throughout the United States. The recently elected [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration installed a summit of business, labor, government and environmental protection representatives to further develop the approach. This summit established the idea of [[eco-industrial park]]s but soon realized that at first a more efficient management of raw materials, energy and waste has to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Since then, the broad goals and application principles of EID have hardly changed and only became adapted to the rapid technological progress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2012 the IGEP Foundation, for the promotion of trade,&lt;ref name=IGEP&gt;{{cite web|title=IGEP Foundation homepage|url=http://www.igep.org/|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a report called ''Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases''.&lt;ref name=Pathway&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases|url=http://www.igep.in/live/hrdpmp/hrdpmaster/igep/content/e48745/e50194/e50195/121004_Pathway_EID_ISOX3uncoated-1.pdf|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is researched by the Nation Centre for Eco-Industrial Development, a joint project by the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Eco-Industrial Development|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/price/research/NCEID/|publisher=usc.edu|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and concepts ==
The primary goal of eco-industrial development is a significant and continuous improvement in both business and environmental performance. Herein, the notion of industry not only relates to private-sector manufacturing but also covers state-owned enterprise, the service sector as well as transportation. EID’s twin guideline is reflected specifically in the “eco” of eco-industrial as it resembles ecology (decrease in pollution and waste) and economy (increase in commercial success) at the same time.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In order to build a framework of defining an enterprise’s sustainable performance at the micro level, resource use optimization, minimization of waste, cleaner technologies and pollution limits are used in achieving a broad range of goals in EID: 
	
* '''[[Resource efficiency]]''' minimizes the use of energy, materials, water and transportation. This, in turn, lowers production costs due to savings in virtually all areas of business.&lt;ref name="Pathway"/&gt;
* '''Cleaner production''' is a predominantly environmental measure, which aims at the reduction or even substitution of toxics, emissions-control or the re-use of residual material.
* '''[[Renewables]]''' in both energy and material use shall eliminate all pollution through fossil fuels.
* '''Greening of buildings or production sites''' installs high energy and environmental standards by relying on innovation in green architecture or engineering. Moreover, new facility and infrastructure design may also enhance the quality of life in neighboring communities significantly.
* '''Environmental management systems''' such as the [[ISO 14000]] ensure a continuous improvement through regular audits and the progressing establishment of environmental targets.
* '''Ecological site planning''' can then combine each of these aspects by developing a clear understanding of air, water and ground system capacities throughout the surrounding eco-system.
  
Eco-industrial development hence explores the possibility of improvement at the local level.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In unique case-to-case analyses, particular geography, human potential or business climate are investigated. In contrast to the widespread race for top-down governmental support such as tax cuts, EID emphasizes locally achievable success and rooms for improvement. As a result, purposeful enforcements of action plans can make a large difference by optimizing the interaction of business, community and ecological systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Instruments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Eco-industrial development includes and employs four major conceptual instruments. Each of the approaches intends to combine the seemingly antithetic processes of industrial development and bolstering sustainability.

* '''[[Industrial Ecology]]''' focuses on both industrial as well as consumer behavior. By assessing flows of energy and material, the approach determines the flows influences on the environment. In turn, it explores ways and means of optimizing the whole production chain from flow and use of resources to their final transformation. During these analyses, influences of economic, political, regulatory and social factors are key.
* The concept of '''[[Industrial Symbiosis]]''' is based on mainly voluntary cooperation of different industries. By conglomerating complementary enterprises and by then adapting their respective production chains, the presence of each may increase viability and profitability of the others. Therefore, symbioses consider resource scarcity and environmental protection as crucial factors in developing sustainable industries and profits. Industrial Symbiosis often becomes manifest in [[Eco-industrial park]]s.
* '''Environmental Management Systems''' include a wide range of different environmental management approaches in order to ensure continual improvement in sustainability. In early stages, monitoring companies facilitates the identification of hazardous environmental aspects. Further on, objectives and targets are set under consideration of legal requirements. Finally, the establishment of regular audits and other reporting systems combined with continuous follow-up targets shall ensure a constant improvement towards greener industrial production.
* The '''Design for the Environment''' concept originated in engineering disciplines as well as from the product life-cycle analysis. It is a simple but all-encompassing assessment of a product’s potential environmental impact – ranging from energy and materials used for packaging, transportation, consumer use and disposal.

'''Economic freedom''' or '''economic liberty''' is the ability of people of a society to take economic actions. This is a term used in economic and [[policy debate]]s as well as in the [[philosophy of economics]].&lt;ref name=Bronfenbrenner1955&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronfenbrenner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Bronfenbrenner|year=1955|journal=[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]|title=Two Concepts of Economic Freedom|volume=65|issue=3|jstor=2378928|pages=157–70 |doi=10.1086/290998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SenRationalityFreedom&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen|first=Amartya|authorlink=Amartya Sen|title=Rationality and Freedom|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach to economic freedom comes from [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] traditions emphasizing [[free market]]s, [[free trade]], and [[private property]] under free enterprise. Another approach to economic freedom extends the [[welfare economics]] study of individual choice, with greater economic freedom coming from a "larger" (in some technical sense) set of possible choices.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaPubChoice"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Economic Freedom and its Measurement|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Public Choice |year=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-7923-8607-0 |volume=2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YUVMr–aFYwYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1–PA161,M1 161]–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conceptions of economic freedom include [[Right to an adequate standard of living|freedom from want]]&lt;ref name=Bronfenbrenner1955 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RooseveltFourFreedoms&gt;{{Cite web

The [[free market]] viewpoint defines economic liberty as the freedom to produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired without the use of force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaPubChoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surjit S. Bhalla. ''Freedom and economic growth: a virtuous cycle?''. Published in ''Democracy's Victory and Crisis''. (1997).

Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} pp. 57, 64&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[indices of economic freedom]] that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Based on these rankings correlative studies have found higher economic growth to be correlated with higher scores on the country rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayal|first1=Eliezer B.|last2=Karras|first2=Georgios|title=Components of economic freedom and growth: an empirical study|journal=Journal of Developing Areas|volume=32|issue=3|pages=327–38|publisher=Western Illinois University|date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}} With regards to other measures, such as equality, corruption, political and social violence and their correlation to economic freedom it has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and economic freedom in some subcomponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Economic Freedom and Growth: Decomposing the Effects|first1 = Fredrik| last1 = Carlsson |first2 = Susanna |last2= Lundström|url=http://swopec.hhs.se/gunwpe/papers/gunwpe0033.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions of economic freedom===

====Private property rights====
{{Main|Right to property}}

[[File:Goldeagle.jpg|thumb|125px|left|In the 1960s, [[Alan Greenspan]] argued that economic freedom requires the [[gold standard]] for protection of savings from confiscation through inflation&lt;ref&gt;Addision Wiggin, William Bonner. ''Financial Reckoning Day: Surviving the Soft Depression of the 21st Century''. (2004). John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-48130-0}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to the free market view, a secure system of [[property rights (economics)|private property rights]] is an essential part of economic freedom.  Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Milton Friedman]] sees property rights as "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Rose D. Friedman, Milton Friedman. ''Two Lucky People: Memoirs''. (1998). University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-26414-9}} p. 605&lt;/ref&gt; With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they do it on a voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions most people can achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard H. Siegan. ''Property and Freedom: The Constitution, the Courts, and Land-Use Regulation''. Transaction Publishers. (1997). {{ISBN|1-56000-974-8}} pp. 9, 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical evidence]] suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Weimer. ''The political economy of property rights''. Published in ''The Political Economy of Property Rights''. Cambridge University Press. (1997). {{ISBN|0-521-58101-X}} pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]], much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). {{ISBN|0-465-01615-4}} pp. 210–11&lt;/ref&gt; One thinker to question private property was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a socialist and anarchist, who argued that property is both theft and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism''. Edited by Daniel Guerin, translated by Paul Sharkey. 2005. AK Press. {{ISBN|1-904859-25-9}} pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freedom of contract====
[[Freedom of contract]] is the right to choose one's contracting parties and to trade with them on any terms and conditions one sees fit. Contracts permit individuals to create their own enforceable legal rules, adapted to their unique situations.&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth. ''Contract and the Common Law''. Published in '' The State and Freedom of Contract''. (1998). Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3370-8}} p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all contracts need to be enforced by the state. For example, in the United States there is a large number of third-party [[arbitration]] tribunals which resolve disputes under private commercial law.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Harper. ''Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development''. (1999). Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-15342-5}} pp. 82–88&lt;/ref&gt; Negatively understood, freedom of contract is freedom from government interference and from imposed value judgments of fairness. The notion of "freedom of contract" was given one of its most famous legal expressions in 1875 by Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Ooseterhout, Jack J. Vromen, Pursey Heugensp. ''Social Institutions of Capitalism: Evolution and Design of Social Contracts''. (2003). Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84376-495-4}} p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[I]f there is one thing more than another public policy requires it is that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice. Therefore, you have this paramount public policy to consider – that you are not lightly to interfere with this freedom of contract.}}

The doctrine of freedom of contract received one of its strongest expressions in the [[US Supreme Court]] case of [[Lochner v New York]] which struck down legal restrictions on the working hours of bakers. [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html]

Critics of the classical view of freedom of contract argue that this freedom is illusory when the bargaining power of the parties is highly unequal, most notably in the case of contracts between employers and workers. As in the case of restrictions on working hours, workers as a group may benefit from legal protections that prevent individuals agreeing to contracts that require long working hours. In its [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]] decision in 1937, overturning Lochner, the Supreme Court cited an earlier decisions {{cquote|The legislature has also recognized the fact, which the experience of legislators in many States has corroborated, that the proprietors of these establishments and their operatives do not stand upon an equality, and that [p. 394] their interests are, to a certain extent, conflicting. The former naturally desire to obtain as much labor as possible from their employees, while the latter are often induced by the fear of discharge to conform to regulations which their judgment, fairly exercised, would pronounce to be detrimental to their health or strength. In other words, the proprietors lay down the rules and the laborers are practically constrained to obey them. In such cases, self-interest is often an unsafe guide, and the legislature may properly interpose its authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0300_0379_ZO.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
From this point on, the Lochner view of freedom of contract has been rejected by US courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Supreme Court . Capitalism and Conflict . Landmark Cases . Lochner v. New York (1905) {{!}}PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/landmark_lochner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and political freedom===
Some free market advocates argue that political and [[civil liberties]] have simultaneously expanded with market-based economies, and present empirical evidence to support the claim that economic and [[political freedom]]s are linked.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom in the World.'' (1999). Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7658-0675-4}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis F. Abbott. ''British Democracy: Its Restoration &amp; Extension'', ISR/Google Books, 2006, 2010.  Chapter Five: “The Legal Protection Of Democracy &amp; Freedom: The Case For A New Written Constitution &amp; Bill Of Rights”. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xwN-MIMtE6sC&amp;dq=ISBN090632131X]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1962), Friedman further developed Friedrich Hayek's argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He commented that [[centrally planned economy|centralized control of economic activities]] was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman. ''Capitalism and freedom''. (2002). The University of Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-26421-1}} pp. 8–21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that economic and political freedom were mutually dependent: "The idea that political freedom can be preserved in the absence of economic freedom, and vice versa, is an illusion. Political freedom is the corollary of economic freedom. It is no accident that the age of capitalism became also the age of government by the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Von Mises]]. Planning for Freedom. Libertarian Press. 1962. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', Hayek argued that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', University Of Chicago Press; 50th Anniversary edition (1944), {{ISBN|0-226-32061-8}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek criticized [[socialist]] policies as the slippery slope that can lead to totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents |last=Hayek |first= Friedrich |year=2007 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-32055-7 |pages=53–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Tullock]] has argued that "the Hayek-Friedman argument" predicted totalitarian governments in much of Western Europe in the late 20th century – which did not occur. He uses the example of Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of [[GNP]], as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with ''The Road to Serfdom'' is "that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms." While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, "Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one set of arguments depend on the other."&lt;ref name=Tullock&gt;{{cite book |last = Tullock|first=Gordon|author-link = Gordon Tullock|editor-last=Walker|editor-first=Michael A.|title=Freedom, Democracy and Economic Welfare|pages=60–64|publisher=The Fraser Institute|place=Vancouver, B.C., Canada|year=1988|url=http://fraser.stg.devlin.ca/commerce.web/publication_details.aspx?pubID=2942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indices of economic freedom===
{{Main|Indices of economic freedom}}

The annual surveys ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'' (EFW) and ''[[Index of Economic Freedom]]'' (IEF) are two indices which attempt to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. The EFW index, originally developed by Gwartney, Lawson and Block at the [[Fraser Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;Gwartney, L., R. Lawson, and W. Block (1996). ''[[Economic Freedom of the World]]'', 1975–1995. Vancouver: Fraser Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; was likely the most used in empirical studies as of 2000.&lt;ref name=Heckelman&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heckelman | first1 = Jac C. | last2 = Stroup | first2 = Michael D. | year = 2000 | title = Which Economic Freedoms Contribute to Growth? | url = | journal = Kyklos | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 527–44 | doi = 10.1111/1467-6435.00132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major index, which was developed by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]] appears superior for data work, although as it only goes back to 1995, it is less useful for historical comparisons.&lt;ref name=Heckelman/&gt;

According to the creators of the indices, these rankings correlate strongly with higher average income per person, higher income of the poorest 10%, higher life expectancy, higher literacy, lower infant mortality, higher access to water sources and less corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf Economic Freedom of the World: 2004 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316215702/http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/efw2004ch1.pdf |date=2016-03-16 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf Index of Economic Freedom – Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227044144/http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/pdf/index2008_execsum.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The people living in the top one-fifth of countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s. The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $728 in the lowest ranked countries compared with over $7,000 in the highest ranked countries. The life expectancy of people living in the highest ranked nations is 20 years longer than for people in the lowest ranked countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/article/318|title=Issues|author=|date=|website=The Buckeye Institute|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher economic freedom, as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices, correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research. Is It Reliable? What Does It Imply for Policy?] The Cato institute. April 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik Gartzke of the Fraser Institute estimates that countries with a high EFW are significantly less likely to be involved in wars, while his measure of [[democracy]] had little or no impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf Chapter2: Economic Freedom and Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |date=2008-10-16 }}, Economic Freedom of the World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic Freedom of the World'' score for the entire world has grown considerably in recent decades. The average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4 in 2005. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freetheworld.com/release_2005.html|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report|author=|date=|website=freetheworld.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 2008 Index of Economic Freedom methodology world economic freedom has increased 2.6 points since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS49743+15-Jan-2008+PRN20080115|title=Economic Freedom Holding Steady |author=|date=|website=reuters.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[World Bank Group]] also use ''Index of Economic Freedom'' as the indicator of investment climate, because it covers more aspects relevant to the private sector in wide number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/our_effectivene.html Improving Investment Climates]'', World Bank Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8213-6282-8}} pp. 221–24&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critiques====
The nature of economic freedom is often in dispute. [[Robert Lawson (economist)|Robert Lawson]], the co-author of ''EFW'', even acknowledges the potential shortcomings of freedom indices: "The purpose of the EFW index is to measure, no doubt imprecisely, the degree of economic freedom that exists."&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Robert A. 2006. "'On Testing the Connection between
Economic Freedom and Growth." ''Econ Journal Watch'' 3(3): 398–406. [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-3-number-1-september-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; He likens the recent attempts of economists to measure economic freedom to the initial attempts of economists to measure GDP: "They [macroeconomists] were
scientists who sat down to design, as best they could with the tools at hand, a measure of the current economic activity of the nation. Economic activity exists and their job was to measure it.  Likewise economic freedom exists. It is a thing. We can define and measure it."
Thus, it follows that some [[economists]], [[socialists]] and [[anarchists]] contend that the existing indicators of economic freedom are too narrowly defined and should take into account a broader conception of economic freedoms.

Critics of the indices (e.g. [[Thom Hartmann]]) also oppose the inclusion of business-related measures like corporate charters and [[intellectual property]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomhartmann.com/index.php option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=183&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller in [[Dollars &amp; Sense]] has stated that the indices are "a poor barometer of either freedom more broadly construed or of prosperity." He argues that the high correlation between living standards and economic freedom as measured by IEF is the result of choices made in the construction of the index that guarantee this result. For example, the treatment of a large informal sector (common in poor countries) as an indicator of restrictive government policy, and the use of the change in the ratio of government spending to national income, rather than the level of this ratio. Hartmann argues that these choices cause the [[social democratic]] European countries to rank higher than countries where the government share of the economy is small but growing.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2005/0305miller.html |title=Free, Free at Last &amp;#124; Dollars &amp; Sense |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Dani Rodrik]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have separately noted that there appears to be little correlation between measured economic freedom and economic growth when the least free countries are disregarded, as indicated by the strong growth of the Chinese economy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Sachs, ''The End of Poverty; How We Can Make It Happen In Our Lifetime'' (Penguin Books, 2005), pp. 320–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-there-a-grow.html |title=Dani Rodrik's weblog: Is there a growth payoff to economic freedom? |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Altman found that there is a relatively large correlation between economic freedom and both per capita income and per capita growth. He argues that this is especially true when it comes to sub-indices relating to property rights and sound money, while he calls into question the importance of sub-indices relating to labor regulation and government size once certain threshold values are passed.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Altman, "How Much Economic Freedom is Necessary for Economic Growth? Theory and Evidence," ''Economics Bulletin'', Vol. 15 (2008), no. 2, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller further observes that [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]], both only "partially free" according to [[Freedom House]], are leading countries on both economic freedom indices and casts doubt on the claim that measured economic freedom is associated with political freedom.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; However, according to the Freedom House, "there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Karatnycky.

==Choice sets and economic freedom==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}

[[Amartya Sen]] and other economists consider economic freedom to be measured in terms of the set of economic choices available to individuals. Economic freedom is greater when individuals have more economic choices available – when, in some technical sense, the [[choice set]] of individuals expands.

===Positive and negative freedom===
The differences between alternative views of economic freedom have been expressed in terms of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s distinction between [[positive freedom]] and [[negative freedom]]. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast [[Amartya Sen]] argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals.&lt;ref name=Sen1993MAF&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sen|first=Amartya K.|authorlink=Amartya Sen|year=1993|journal=[[Oxford Economic Papers]]|title=Markets and Freedoms: Achievements and Limitations of the Market Mechanism in Promoting Individual Freedoms|volume=45|issue=4|pages=519–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life.&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goodin | first1 = Robert E. | last2 = Rice | first2 = James Mahmud | last3 = Parpo | first3 = Antti | last4 = Eriksson | first4 = Lina | title = Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-70951-4 |pages=1–54 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521709514}} Chapter 1 and 2 discusses the context and validity of the new measure.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Capitalism and Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Milton|title=Capitalism and Freedom|date=1962|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.

==Freedom from want==
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] included [[freedom from want]] in his [[Four freedoms]] speech. Roosevelt stated that freedom from want "translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world".{{cn|date=February 2017}} In terms of US policy, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] included economic freedoms such as freedom of [[trade union]] organisation, as well as a wide range of policies of government intervention and redistributive taxation aimed at promoting freedom from want.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Internationally, Roosevelt favored the policies associated with the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] which fixed exchange rates and established international economic institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Herbert Hoover]] saw economic freedom as a fifth freedom, which secures survival of Roosevelt's Four freedoms. He described economic freedom as freedom "for men to choose their own calling, to accumulate property in protection of their children and old age, [and] freedom of enterprise that does not injure others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=President Herbert Hoover |last=Whisenhunt |first=Donald W. |year=2007 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=978-1-60021-476-9 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association and unions==
The Philadelphia Declaration (enshrined in the constitution of the [[International Labour Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm#annex |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222152631/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/iloconst.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-22 |title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization |work= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that "all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity." The ILO further states that "The right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their own choosing is an integral part of a free and open society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |title=Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining – Themes |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204135134/http://www.ilo.org./global/Themes/Freedom_of_Association_and_the_Right_to_Collective_Bargaining/lang--en/index.htm |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialist views==
The [[socialist]] view of economic freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava. ''Political Theory: An Introduction''. Pearson Education India, 2008. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist]]s stress the importance of freeing the individual from what they view as coercive, [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]] social relationships of production they are compelled to partake in, as well as the importance of economic development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Goodwin. Using Political Ideas. West Sussex, England, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2007. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic impact of economic freedom==
One of the ways to measure economic competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world.  Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed even when we compare these indicators within territories of countries. 
Nevertheless, despite these benefits societies have to be aware that with increasing economic freedom they will have to face going through a phase of increasing [[economic inequality|inequality]], which basically is a result of decreased redistribution, as well as other negative effects from [[economic liberalization]], i.e., running of local enterprises out of business, takeover of competitive firms, enforcing of interests of foreign companies, dependence on foreign capital, deteriorating work rights, harmful manufacturing for the environment, introducing of commercial practices that are not favorable for consumers, as well as endangerment for survival of national cultures.
However, on the bright side, these negative effects from economic freedom tend to be felt in a shorter term, and if countries use the opportunities of economic freedom in our increasingly globalized economy in a right way, as research shows their socioeconomic conditions will be significantly better than in a case of less economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rožāns, Edgars, The Socioeconomic Impact of Economic Freedom. Humanities and Social Sciences, pp. 105–25, 2015. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2683493&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Essence-Function''' (體用, Chinese pinyin: ''tǐ yòng'', Korean: ''che-yong''), also called '''Substance and Function''', is a key concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] and other Far-Eastern philosophies. ''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is relative or concrete reality, the concrete manifestation of ''Essence''. Ti and yong do not represent two separate things, such as Absolute Reality and Concrete Reality. They are always two, flexibly-viewed aspects of a single thing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acmuller.net/articles/2016-06-tiyong-critical-review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=July 2017}}

==Etymology==
* ''Essence'', [[:wikt:體|體]] (ti), Korean pronunciation 체, or ''CHE'': body; shape, form; entity, unit; style, fashion, system; substance, essence; theory (as opposed to practice).{{r|group=web|Sheik}} 
* ''Function'', [[:wikt:用|用]] (yong), Korean pronunciation 용, or ''YONG'':use, employ, apply, operate; exert; use; effect; finance; need; eat, drink.{{r|group=web|Sheik2}}

Together they form the phrase 體用 ti-yong, 체용 che-yong, ''Essence-Function''.

''Essence'' is Absolute Reality, the fundamental "cause" or origin, while ''Function'' is manifest or relative reality, the discernible effects or manifestations of ''Essence''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} ''Essence-Function'' describes the interplay between the two: although Absolute Reality is the ultimate reality, the relative reality nevertheless also exists, as is evident from concrete reality. The relationship between these two realms is espressed in such schemata as the [[Five Ranks]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]]. Various terms are used for "absolute" and "relative".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}

The tree forms a metaphor for ''Essence-Function'', with the roots being ''Essence'' and the branches being ''Function''.{{sfn|Muller|2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}} According to Muller "the most important application of t'i-yung thought [...] is to the human being, where the human mind is seen as "essence," and one's words, thoughts and actions are seen as "function."{{sfn|Muller|1999|p=4}}

According to Sung-bae Park the concept of ''essence-function'' is used by East Asian Buddhists "to show a non-dualistic and non-discriminate nature in their [[Kensho|enlightenment experience]]," but does not exclude notions of subjectivity and objectivity.{{sfn|Park|1983|p=147}} According to Sung-bae Park, the terms "essence" and "function" can also be rendered as "body" and "the body's functions," which is a more personal and less abstract expression of nonduality.{{sfn|Park|2009|p=11}}

==Origins and application of the concept==

===China===
The t'i-yung developed in the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (220–265) – [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Chin]] (265–420) period of Chinese history, when "Unification of the [[Three teachings|Three Teachings]]" ideology was domimant, striving for a theoretical reconciliation of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The t'i-yung concept was first known as ''pen-mo'' ("primary-last" or "primary-subordinate"), and developed into t'i-yung. In the initial development of the theory, "thinkers considered one of the three philosophies as 'the primary' or 't'i' and the others as 'the last' or 'yung,' insisting that their own philosophy was superior to the others."{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=139}} However, although the theory was used to arrange the three teachings hierarchically, it also confirmed their inner unity.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=139–144}}

The concept developed with [[Chinese Buddhism|the introduction of Buddhism in China]], adapting Buddhist philosophy to a Chinese frame of reference. One of the core [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhist doctrines is the [[Two Truths doctrine]], which says that there is a relative truth and an ultimate truth. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality. Phenomenal reality is relative real or true: one can make factual statements about concrete or manifest reality, but those statements have a relative trueness, since everything that exists changes, and is bound to dissolve again. Ultimately everything is empty, [[sunyata]], of an underlying unchanging essence.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata itself is also "empty," 'the emptiness of emptiness', which means that ''sunyata'' itself does not constitute a higher or ultimate "essence" or "reality.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}} The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]]  and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} 

When Buddhism was introduced to China, the two truths doctrine was a point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} The doctrines of [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Sunyata]] were understood as akin to [[Tao|Dao]] and the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}}  It took the Chinese world several centuries to realize that sunyata has another meaning.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

Based on their understanding of the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths. The idea that ultimate reality is present within the daily world of relative reality melded well with Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as [[Nagarjuna]] does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}

The notions appear already in the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|Zhongyong]]'' (''Doctrine of the Mean'') attributed to [[Zi Si]] (481–402 BCE), the grandson of [[Confucius]]. The first philosopher to systematically use the ti-yong schema was [[Wang Bi]] (226–249) in his commentary to [[Daodejing]], chapter 22, when he discussed the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relation between non-being (''wu'') and being (''you''). Subsequently, the notion has been borrowed from the [[Neo-Daoist]] philosophy to other schools of Chinese philosophy, including [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] and other schools of Buddhism, and [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]], and served as a basic tool of interpretation. With these schools it has travelled to Korea, Japan and Vietnam, and has been developed there.

The ''[[Awakening of Mahayana Faith]]'', a key text in Chinese Buddhism, also employs ''Essence-Function''. Although attributed to [[Aśvaghoṣa]] (?80-?150 CE), and traditionally thought to have been translated [[Paramartha]] (499–569),{{sfn|Tarocco|2008}} in 553, many modern scholars now opine that it was actually composed by Paramartha or one of his students.{{sfn|Grosnick|1989}}

The concept was employed by Confucian reformers of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] at the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s (1644 to 1912) rule in China, in the phrase "Chinese learning for essence, Western learning for application".{{refn|group=note|({{zh|t=中學為體，西學為用|s=中学为体，西学为用|p= zhōng xué wéi tǐ, xī xué wéi yòng}}}} The belief was that China should maintain its own Confucian style of learning to keep the "essence" of society, while at the same time using Western learning for "practical application" in developing its infrastructure and economy.{{sfn|Spence|1999|pp=225–226}}

===Korean Buddhism===
''Essence-Function'' is an essential element in the philosophy of [[Wonhyo]] (617–686 CE).{{sfn|Muller|1995|pp=33–48}} Wonhyo developed t'i-yung theory into its most influential form in his commentary on the ''Ta ch'eng ch'i hsin lun'' (''Treatise on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith''). This scripture proclaims the non-duality of the phenomenal or mundane world and the ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''.{{sfn|Kim|2004|p=163}} Wonhyo saw the ''Treatise'''s treatment of ''t'i-yung'' as a way of harmonizing the thought of Madhyamika and Yogacara. For Wonhyo, ''t'i'' corresponds to Madhyamika's ultimate truth and ''yung'' to its conventional truth, and these, in turn, are the two gates of Yogacara's one-mind.{{sfn|Kim|2004|pp=164–166}}

[[Chinul]] (1158–1210) and [[Kihwa]] (1376–1433) also employ and develop this idea of Essence-Function in their writings in particular ways.{{sfn|Muller|1995}} [[Wonch'uk]] (613–696) employed the conceptual and analytical tool, Essence-Function, as an exegetical, hermeneutical and syncretic device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9652">In [[quantum physics]], '''Fermi's golden rule''' is a formula that describes the transition rate (probability of transition per unit time) from one energy [[eigenstate]] of a quantum system into other energy eigenstates in a continuum, effected by a weak [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]]. This rate is effectively constant.

==General==
Although named after [[Enrico Fermi]], most of the work leading to the Golden Rule is due to [[Paul Dirac]] who formulated 20 years earlier a virtually identical equation, including the three components of a constant, the matrix element of the perturbation and an energy difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bransden|first1=B. H.|last2=Joachain|first2=C. J.|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=978-0582356917|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dirac | first = P.A.M. | authorlink = Paul Dirac | title = The Quantum Theory of Emission and Absorption of Radiation | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 114 | pages = 243–265 | date=1 March 1927| issue = 767 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1927.0039 | jstor=94746|bibcode = 1927RSPSA.114..243D }} See equations (24) and (32).&lt;/ref&gt; It was given this name because, on account of its importance, Fermi dubbed it "Golden Rule No. 2." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fermi | first = E. | title = Nuclear Physics | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1950 |isbn= 978-0226243658 }}, formula VIII.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rate and its derivation==
Consider the system to begin in an [[eigenstate]], &lt;math&gt;  | i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, of a given [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], {{mvar| H}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; .  Consider the effect of a (possibly time-dependent) perturbing Hamiltonian, {{mvar| H'}} . If {{mvar| H'}} is time-independent, the system goes only into those states in the continuum that have the same energy as the initial state. If {{mvar| H'}} is oscillating as a function of time with an [[angular frequency]] {{mvar|ω}}, the transition is into states with energies that differ by {{math|  ''ħω''}} from the energy of the initial state.

In both cases, the one-to-many ''transition probability per unit of time'' from the state &lt;math&gt; | i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; to a set of final states &lt;math&gt;| f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is essentially constant. It is given, to first order in the perturbation, by
::&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{i \rightarrow f}= \frac{2 \pi} {\hbar}  \left | \langle f|H'|i  \rangle \right |^{2} \rho&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar| ρ}} is the [[density of states|density of final states]] (number of continuum states per unit of energy) and &lt;math&gt; \langle f|H'|i  \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Matrix element (physics)|matrix element]] (in [[bra–ket notation]]) of the perturbation {{mvar| H'}} between the final and initial states.

This transition probability is also called "decay probability" and is related to the inverse of the [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|mean lifetime]].
Fermi's golden rule is valid when the initial state has not been significantly depleted by scattering into the final states.

The standard way to derive the equation is to start with time-dependent perturbation theory and to take the limit for absorption under the assumption that the time of the measurement is much larger than the time needed for the transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~schwitte/PHY362L/QMnote.pdf R Schwitters' UT Notes on Derivation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is remarkable in that the rate is ''constant'' and not linearly increasing in time, as might be naively expected for transitions with strict conservation of energy enforced. This comes about from interference of oscillatory contributions of transitions to numerous continuum states with only approximate ''unperturbed'' energy conservation, cf. [[Wolfgang Pauli]], ''Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures on Physics'' (Dover Books on Physics, 2000) {{ISBN|0486414620}} , pp. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{main article|Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#Time-dependent perturbation theory}}
The golden rule is a straightforward consequence of the [[Schrödinger equation]], solved to lowest order in the perturbation {{mvar|H'}} of the Hamiltonian,
:&lt;math&gt;
 \left ( H_0+H'-\mathrm{i}\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right ) \sum_n  a_n (t) |n\rangle \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}tE_n/\hbar}=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|{{ket|''n''}}}} are the stationary eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of {{mvar|H}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; .

Rewrite this equation as that of the time evolution of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_n(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\mathrm{d}a_k (t)}{\mathrm{d}t}=\sum_n \langle k| H'|n\rangle a_n(t) \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}t (E_k-E_n)/\hbar}. &lt;/math&gt;
This equation is exact but normally cannot be solved in practice.

For a weak constant perturbation {{mvar|H'}} which turns on at {{mvar|t}}=0, we can use perturbation theory.  Namely, if &lt;math&gt;H'=0&lt;/math&gt;
it is evident that &lt;math&gt;a_n(t)=\delta_{n,i}&lt;/math&gt;, which simply says that the system stays in the initial state &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

For states &lt;math&gt;k\ne i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_k(t)&lt;/math&gt; becomes non-zero due to &lt;math&gt;H'\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; and these are assumed to be small due to the
weak perturbation.  Hence,  one can plug in the zeroth order form &lt;math&gt;a_n(t)=\delta_{n,i}&lt;/math&gt; into the above equation to get the first
correction for the amplitudes &lt;math&gt;a_k(t)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\mathrm{d}a_k (t)}{\mathrm{d}t}= \langle k| H'|i\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}t (E_k-E_i)/\hbar}, &lt;/math&gt;
which integrates to 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{i}\hbar a_k(t)= 2\langle k| H'|i\rangle \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t/2} \frac{\sin \omega t/2}{\omega}
&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\omega\equiv (E_k- E_i)/\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, for a state with {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)}} =1, {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)}}=0, transitioning to a state with {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')}} (again,
&lt;math&gt;k\ne i&lt;/math&gt;).

The transition rate is then
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_{i\rightarrow k }= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left|a_k(t)\right|^2 =  \frac {2|\langle k| H'|i\rangle |^2}{\hbar^2} \frac{\sin \omega t}{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
a [[sinc function]] peaking sharply for small {{mvar|ω}}.  At &lt;math&gt;\omega=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin(\omega t)/\omega=t&lt;/math&gt;, so the transition rate varies ''linearly'' with {{mvar|t}}  for an isolated state &lt;math&gt;|k\rangle&lt;/math&gt;!

By dramatic contrast, for states of energy {{mvar|E}} embedded in a continuum, they must be all accounted for collectively. For a density of states per unit energy interval {{math|''ρ''(''E'')}}, they must be integrated over their energies, and whence the corresponding {{mvar|ω}}s, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_{i\rightarrow f }= \frac {2}{\hbar}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d}\omega \rho(\omega) |\langle f| H'|i\rangle |^2  \frac{\sin \omega t}{\omega} ~.&lt;/math&gt;
For large {{mvar|t}}, the sinc function is sharply peaked at {{mvar|ω}} ≈ 0, and negligible outside {{math|[−''2π/t, 2π/t'']}} ; the density and transition element can be taken out of the integral, so that the rate
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_{i\rightarrow f }= \frac {2\rho |\langle f| H'|i\rangle |^2}{\hbar}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{d}\omega  \frac{\sin \omega t}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;
is now merely proportional to a constant [[Dirichlet integral]], {{mvar|π}}.

''The time dependence has vanished'', and the ''constant decay rate'' of the golden rule follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Eugen Merzbacher|Merzbacher, Eugen]]|year=1998|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=3rd|publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons, Inc.|ISBN=0-471-88702-1|chapter=19.7|url=http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/~ting/other/QM_Merzbacher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a constant, it underlies the exponential [[particle decay]] laws of radioactivity.  (For excessively long times, however, the secular growth of the {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')}}s  invalidates lowest-order perturbation theory, which requires {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; ≪ a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} .)

Only the magnitude of the matrix element  &lt;math&gt; \langle f|H'|i  \rangle&lt;/math&gt; enters the Fermi's Golden Rule. The phase  of this matrix element, however, contains separate information about the transition process.
It appears in expressions that complement the Golden Rule in the semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach to electron transport.&lt;ref name='sinitsyn-08jpa'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coordinate Shift in Semiclassical Boltzmann Equation and Anomalous Hall Effect|author=N.

In [[petroleum]] exploration and development, '''formation evaluation''' is used to determine the ability of a borehole to produce [[petroleum]].  Essentially, it is the process of "recognizing a commercial well when you drill one".

Modern rotary drilling usually uses a heavy mud as a lubricant and as a means of producing a confining pressure against the formation face in the borehole, preventing blowouts.  Only in rare and catastrophic cases, do oil and gas wells ''come in'' with a fountain of gushing oil.  In real life, that is a ''[[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]''&amp;mdash;and usually also a financial and environmental disaster.  But controlling blowouts has drawbacks&amp;mdash;mud filtrate soaks into the formation around the borehole and a mud cake plasters the sides of the hole.  These factors obscure the possible presence of oil or gas in even very porous formations. Further complicating the problem is the widespread occurrence of small amounts of petroleum in the rocks of many [[sedimentary]] provinces.  In fact, if a sedimentary province is absolutely barren of traces of petroleum, it is not feasible to continue drilling there.

The formation evaluation problem is a matter of answering two questions:
#What are the lower limits for porosity, permeability and upper limits for water saturation that permit profitable production from a particular formation or pay zone; in a particular geographic area; in a particular economic climate.
#Do any of the formations in the well under consideration exceed these lower limits.

It is complicated by the impossibility of directly examining the formation. It is, in short, the problem of looking at the formation ''indirectly''.

==Formation evaluation tools==

{{further|Well logging}}
Tools to detect oil and gas have been evolving for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is [[well cuttings]] examination.  Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic [[microscope]] to determine the [[lithology]] of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining.  A portable [[ultraviolet]] light chamber or "Spook Box" is used to examine the cuttings for [[fluorescence]].  Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals.  They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish.  The solvent is usually [[carbon tetrachlorethane]].  Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates.  The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.

Well cuttings examination is a learned skill.  During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) across, are cut from the bottom of the hole by the bit.  Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole.  During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction.  They then are screened out of the mudstream by the [[shale shaker]] and fall on a pile at its base.  Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or [[mudlogger]] as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material.  Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a "bit trip" when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit.  At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.

===Coring===

One way to get more detailed samples of a formation is by coring.  Two techniques commonly used at present.  The first is the "whole core", a cylinder of rock, usually about 3" to 4" in diameter and up to {{convert|50|ft|m}} to {{convert|60|ft|m}} long.  It is cut with a "core barrel", a hollow pipe tipped with a ring-shaped diamond chip-studded bit that can cut a plug and bring it to the surface.  Often the plug breaks while drilling, usually in shales or fractures and the core barrel jams, slowly grinding the rocks in front of it to powder.  This signals the driller to give up on getting a full length core and to pull up the pipe.

Taking a full core is an expensive operation that usually stops or slows drilling for at least the better part of a day.  A full core can be invaluable for later reservoir evaluation.  Once a section of well has been drilled, there is, of course, no way to core it without drilling another well.

Another, cheaper, technique for obtaining samples of the formation is "[[Sidewall Coring]]".  One type of sidewall cores is percussion cores.  In this method, a steel cylinder&amp;mdash;a coring gun&amp;mdash;has hollow-point steel bullets mounted along its sides and moored to the gun by short steel cables.  The coring gun is lowered to the bottom of the interval of interest and the bullets are fired individually as the gun is pulled up the hole.  The mooring cables ideally pull the hollow bullets and the enclosed plug of formation loose and the gun carries them to the surface.  Advantages of this technique are low cost and the ability to sample the formation after it has been drilled.  Disadvantages are possible non-recovery because of lost or misfired bullets and a slight uncertainty about the sample depth.  Sidewall cores are often shot "on the run" without stopping at each core point because of the danger of differential sticking.  Most service company personnel are skilled enough to minimize this problem, but it can be significant if depth accuracy is important.

A second method of sidewall coring is rotary sidewall cores.  In this method, a circular-saw assembly is lowered to the zone of interest on a wireline, and the core is sawed out.  Dozens of cores may be taken this way in one run.  This method is roughly 20 times as expensive as percussion cores, but yields a much better sample.

A serious problem with cores is the change they undergo as they are brought to the surface.  It might seem that cuttings and cores are very direct samples but the problem is whether the formation at depth will produce oil or gas.  Sidewall cores are deformed and compacted and fractured by the bullet impact.  Most full cores from any significant depth expand and fracture as they are brought to the surface and removed from the core barrel.  Both types of core can be invaded or even flushed by mud, making the evaluation of formation fluids difficult.  The formation analyst has to remember that all tools give indirect data.

===Mud logging===

Mud logging (or Wellsite Geology) is a [[well logging]] process in which [[drilling mud]] and drill bit cuttings from the formation are evaluated during drilling and their properties recorded on a strip chart as a visual analytical tool and stratigraphic cross sectional representation of the well. The [[drilling mud]] which is analyzed for [[hydrocarbon]] gases, by use of a [[gas chromatograph]], contains drill bit cuttings which are visually evaluated by a mudlogger and then described in the mud log.  The total gas, chromatograph record, lithological sample, pore pressure, shale density,D-exponent, etc. (all lagged parameters because they are circulated up to the surface from the bit) are plotted along with surface parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), Weight On Bit (WOB),rotation per minute etc. on the mudlog which serve as a tool for the [[mudlogger]], drilling engineers, [[mud engineer]]s, and other service personnel charged with drilling and producing the well.

===Wireline logging===

The oil and gas industry uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's rock properties. Wireline logging can be defined as being "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." Note that "wireline logging" and "mud logging" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to "TAH" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a "well log" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.[1]

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. "Open hole logs" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. "Cased hole logs" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.[2]

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===Electric logs===
In 1928, the [[Schlumberger brothers]] in France developed the workhorse of all formation evaluation tools: the electric log.  Electric logs have been improved to a high degree of precision and sophistication since that time, but the basic principle has not changed.  Most underground formations contain water, often salt water, in their [[porosity|pore]]s.  The resistance to electric current of the total formation&amp;mdash;rock and fluids&amp;mdash;around the borehole is proportional to the sum of the volumetric proportions of mineral grains and conductive water-filled pore space.  If the pores are partially filled with gas or oil, which are resistant to the passage of electric current, the bulk formation resistance is higher than for water filled pores.  For the sake of a convenient comparison from measurement to measurement, the electrical logging tools measure the resistance of a cubic meter of formation.  This measurement is called ''resistivity''.

Modern [[resistivity logging]] tools fall into two categories, Laterolog and Induction, with various commercial names, depending on the company providing the logging services.

Laterolog tools send an electric current from an electrode on the sonde directly into the formation.  The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself.  Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid.  Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode in order to maintain a constant current intensity.  This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation.  Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid.  Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud.
   
Induction logs use an electric coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction.  This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers.  The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde.  The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation.  Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution).  Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of {{convert|40|in|mm}}.  Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools.  These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils.  Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils.  Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity.  Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid.   In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.

Until the late 1950s electric logs, mud logs and sample logs comprised most of the oilman's armamentarium.  Logging tools to measure porosity and permeability began to be used at that time.  The first was the microlog.  This was a miniature electric log with two sets of electrodes.  One measured the formation resistivity about 1/2" deep and the other about 1"-2" deep.  The purpose of this seemingly pointless measurement was to detect permeability.  Permeable sections of a borehole wall develop a thick layer of mudcake during drilling.  Mud liquids, called filtrate, soak into the formation, leaving the mud solids behind to -ideally- seal the wall and stop the filtrate "invasion" or soaking.  The short depth electrode of the microlog sees mudcake in permeable sections.  The deeper 1" electrode sees filtrate invaded formation.  In nonpermeable sections both tools read alike and the traces fall on top of each other on the stripchart log.  In permeable sections they separate.

Also in the late 1950s porosity measuring logs were being developed.  The two main types are: nuclear porosity logs and sonic logs.

===Porosity logs===
The two main nuclear porosity logs are the Density and the Neutron log.

Density logging tools contain a [[caesium-137]] [[gamma ray]] source which irradiates the formation with 662&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] gamma rays. These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation through [[Compton scattering]] and lose energy. Once the energy of the gamma ray has fallen below 100&amp;nbsp;keV, photolectric absorption dominates: gamma rays are eventually absorbed by the formation. The amount of energy loss by Compton scattering is related to the number electrons per unit volume of formation. Since for most elements of interest (below Z = 20) the ratio of atomic weight, A, to atomic number, Z, is close to 2, gamma ray energy loss is related to the amount of matter per unit volume, i.e., formation density.

A gamma ray detector located some distance from the source, detects surviving gamma rays and sorts them into several energy windows. The number of high-energy gamma rays is controlled by compton scattering, hence by formation density. The number of low-energy gamma rays is controlled by photoelectric absorption, which is directly related to the average atomic number, Z, of the formation, hence to [[lithology]]. Modern density logging tools include two or three detectors, which allow compensation for some borehole effects, in particular for the presence of mud cake between the tool and the formation.

Since there is a large contrast between the density of the minerals in the formation and the density of pore fluids, porosity can easily be derived from measured formation bulk density if both mineral and fluid densities are known.

Neutron porosity logging tools contain an [[americium]]-[[beryllium]] [[neutron]] source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation.  Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly away from the source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons.  A detector at some distance from the source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.

The combination of neutron and density logs takes advantage of the fact that lithology has opposite effects on these two porosity measurements.  The average of neutron and density porosity values is usually close to the true porosity, regardless of lithology.  Another advantage of this combination is the "gas effect."  Gas, being less dense than liquids, translates into a density-derived porosity that is too high.  Gas, on the other hand, has much less hydrogen per unit volume than liquids: neutron-derived porosity, which is based on the amount of hydrogen, is too low.  If both logs are displayed on compatible scales, they overlay each other in liquid-filled clean formations and are widely separated in gas-filled formations.

Sonic logs use a pinger and microphone arrangement to measure the velocity of sound in the formation from one end of the sonde to the other.  For a given type of rock, acoustic velocity varies indirectly with porosity. If the velocity of sound through solid rock is taken as a measurement of 0% porosity, a slower velocity is an indication of a higher porosity that is usually filled with formation water with a slower sonic velocity.

Both sonic and density-neutron logs give porosity as their primary information.  Sonic logs read farther away from the borehole so they are more useful where sections of the borehole are caved.  Because they read deeper, they also tend to average more formation than the density-neutron logs do.  Modern sonic configurations with pingers and microphones at both ends of the log, combined with computer analysis, minimize the averaging somewhat.  Averaging is an advantage when the formation is being evaluated for seismic parameters, a different area of formation evaluation.  A special log, the Long Spaced Sonic, is sometimes used for this purpose.  Seismic signals (a single undulation of a sound wave in the earth) average together tens to hundreds of feet of formation, so an averaged sonic log is more directly comparable to a seismic waveform.

Density-neutron logs read the formation within about four to seven inches (178&amp;nbsp;mm)  of the borehole wall.  This is an advantage in resolving thin beds.  It is a disadvantage when the hole is badly caved.  Corrections can be made automatically if the cave is no more than a few inches deep.  A caliper arm on the sonde measures the profile of the borehole and a correction is calculated and incorporated in the porosity reading.  However, if the cave is much more than four inches deep, the density-neutron log is reading little more than drilling mud.

===Lithology logs - SP and gamma ray===
There are two other tools, the SP log and the Gamma Ray log, one or both of which are almost always used in wireline logging.  Their output is usually presented along with the electric and porosity logs described above.  They are indispensable as additional guides to the nature of the rock around the borehole.

The SP log, known variously as a "Spontaneous Potential", "Self Potential" or "Shale Potential" log is a voltmeter measurement of the voltage or electrical potential difference between the mud in the hole at a particular depth and a copper ground stake driven into the surface of the earth a short distance from the borehole.  A salinity difference between the drilling mud and the formation water acts as a natural battery and will cause several voltage effects.  This "battery" causes a movement of charged ions between the hole and the formation water where there is enough permeability in the rock.  The most important voltage is set up as a permeable formation permits ion movement, reducing the voltage between the formation water and the mud.  Sections of the borehole where this occurs then have a voltage difference with other nonpermeable sections where ion movement is restricted.  Vertical ion movement in the mud column occurs much more slowly because the mud is not circulating while the drill pipe is out of the hole.  The copper surface stake provides a reference point against which the SP voltage is measured for each part of the borehole.  There can also be several other minor voltages, due for example to mud filtrate streaming into the formation under the effect of an overbalanced mud system.  This flow carries ions and is a voltage generating current.  These other voltages are secondary in importance  to the voltage resulting from the salinity contrast between mud and formation water.

The nuances of the SP log are still being researched.  In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water.  Some pores are completely filled with water.  Others have a thin layer of water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or oil filling the rest of the pore.  In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation.  If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby.  Shales do not allow water or ion movement.  Although they may have a large water content, it is bound to the surface of the flat clay crystals comprising the shale.  Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock.  As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections.  The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology.  SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column.  It also can suffer from stray voltages caused by other logging tools that are run with it.  Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason.  With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.

The gamma ray log is a measurement of naturally occurring gamma radiation from the borehole walls.  Sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz and limestones are nonradioactive calcite.  Shales however, are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium.  Thus the presence or absence of gamma rays in a borehole is an indication of the amount of shale or clay in the surrounding formation.  The gamma ray log is useful in holes drilled with air or with oil based muds, as these wells have no SP voltage.  Even in water-based muds, the gamma ray and SP logs are often run together.  They comprise a check on each other and can indicate unusual shale sections which may either not be radioactive, or may have an abnormal ionic chemistry.  The gamma ray log is also useful to detect coal beds, which, depending on the local geology, can have either low radiation levels, or high radiation levels due to adsorption of uranium.  In addition, the gamma ray log will work inside a steel casing, making it essential when a cased well must be evaluated.

==Interpreting the tools==

The immediate questions that have to be answered in deciding to complete a well or to plug and abandon (P&amp;A) it are:
*Do any zones in the well contain producible hydrocarbons?
*How much?
*How much, if any, water will be produced with them?

The elementary approach to answering these questions uses the [[Archie's law|Archie Equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12737">In mathematics, the '''Fréchet distance''' is a [[measure of similarity]] between [[curve]]s that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves. It is named after [[Maurice Fréchet]].

==Intuitive definition==

Imagine a man traversing a finite curved path while walking his dog on a leash, with the dog traversing a separate one.  Assume that the dog varies its speed to keep as much slack in her leash as possible: the Fréchet distance between the two curves is the length of the shortest leash sufficient for both to traverse their separate paths.  Note that the definition is symmetric with respect to the two curves—the Frechet distance would be the same if the dog was walking its owner.

==Formal definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. A [[curve]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[map (mathematics)|map]] from the [[unit interval]] into &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;A : [0,1] \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;. A [[parametric equation|reparameterization]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, [[monotonic function|non-decreasing]], [[surjection]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be two given curves in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the '''Fréchet distance''' between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[infimum]] over all reparameterizations &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the maximum over all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the distance in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical notation, the Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;F(A,B) = \inf_{\alpha, \beta}\,\,\max_{t \in [0,1]} \,\,  \Bigg \{d \Big ( A(\alpha(t)), \, B(\beta(t)) \Big ) \Bigg \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

Informally, we can think of the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as "time". Then, &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog's owner at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa). The length of the leash between them at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the infimum over all possible reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to choosing the walk along the given paths where the maximum leash length is minimized. The restriction that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; be non-decreasing means that neither the dog nor its owner can backtrack.

The Fréchet metric takes into account the flow of the two curves because the pairs of points whose distance contributes to the Fréchet distance sweep continuously along their respective curves. This makes the Fréchet distance a better measure of similarity for curves than alternatives, such as the [[Hausdorff distance]], for arbitrary point sets. It is possible for two curves to have small Hausdorff distance but large Fréchet distance.

The Fréchet distance and its variants find application in several problems, from [[morphing]]&lt;ref name="efrat02new"&gt;{{citation

The running time of their algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(mn \cdot \log(mn))&lt;/math&gt; for two polygonal curves with ''m'' and ''n'' segments.

== The free-space diagram ==
[[Image:free-space-diagram.png|thumb|alt=example of a free-space diagram|Free-space diagram of the red and the blue curve. In contrast to the definition in the text, which uses the parameter interval [0,1] for both curves, the curves are parameterized by arc length in this example.]]
An important tool for calculating the Fréchet distance of two curves is the free-space diagram, which was introduced by Alt and Godau.&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt;
The free-space diagram between two curves for a given distance threshold ε is a two-dimensional region in the parameter space that consist of all point pairs on the two curves at distance at most ε:

&lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B) := \{\,(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1]^2\mid d( A(\alpha), B(\beta))\le\varepsilon \,\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is at most ε if and only if the free-space diagram &lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; contains a path from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, which is monotone both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction.

==Variants==

The '''weak Fréchet distance''' is a variant of the classical Fréchet distance without the requirement that the endpoints move monotonically along their respective curves &amp;mdash; the dog and its owner are allowed to backtrack to keep the leash between them short. Alt and Godau&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt; describe a simpler algorithm to compute the weak Fréchet distance between polygonal curves, based on computing [[Widest path problem|minimax paths]] in an associated [[grid graph]].

The '''discrete Fréchet distance''', also called the '''coupling distance''', is an approximation of the Fréchet metric for polygonal curves, defined by Eiter and Mannila.&lt;ref name="eiter94discrete"&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The discrete Fréchet distance considers only positions of the leash where its endpoints are located at vertices of the two polygonal curves and never in the interior of an edge. This special structure allows the discrete Fréchet distance to be computed in polynomial time by an easy dynamic programming algorithm.

When the two curves are embedded in a metric space other than Euclidean space, such as a [[polyhedral terrain]] or some Euclidean space with obstacles, the distance between two points on the curves is most naturally defined as the length of the [[shortest path]] between them. The leash is required to be a [[geodesic]] joining its endpoints. The resulting metric between curves is called the '''geodesic Fréchet distance'''.&lt;ref name="efrat02new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cook08geodesic"&gt;{{citation

The leash cannot switch discontinuously from one position to another &amp;mdash; in particular, the leash cannot jump over obstacles, and can sweep over a mountain on a terrain only if it is long enough. The motion of the leash describes a [[homotopy]] between the two curves. Chambers ''et al.''&lt;ref name="chambers09homotopic"/&gt; describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the homotopic Fréchet distance between polygonal curves in the Euclidean plane with obstacles.

==Examples==
The Fréchet distance between two concentric circles of radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively is &lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|.&lt;/math&gt;
The longest leash is required when the owner stands still and the dog travels to the opposite side of the circle (&lt;math&gt;r_1 + r_2&lt;/math&gt;), and the shortest leash when both owner and dog walk at a constant angular velocity around the circle (&lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|&lt;/math&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Grounding''' is a common discipline technique used with children and teenagers, in which the child or teen is not allowed to leave their place of residence ''or'' [[bedroom]] except for required activities such as [[school]] or [[Employment|work]]. Children and teenagers are generally not allowed to leave the house for [[leisure]] during this time.

Other possible consequences can also include removing [[reinforcement#positive reinforcement|positive reinforcement]]s, privileges and [[freedom]] such as [[video game]]s, [[toy]]s, [[television]], [[computer]]s, [[mobile device]]s, [[Internet]], [[fidget spinner]]s, [[shopping mall]]s and hanging out with or having friends over.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The '''head louse''' (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') is an [[obligate parasite|obligate]] [[parasitism|ectoparasite]] of [[human]]s that causes [[head lice infestation]] (pediculosis capitis).&lt;ref name="Buxton3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buxton|first = Patrick A.|title = The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition = 2nd|publisher = Edward Arnold|location = [[London]]|pages = 24–72|chapter = The biology of ''Pediculus humanus''|year = 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head lice are wingless [[insect]]s spending their entire lives on the human [[scalp]] and feeding exclusively on human [[blood]].&lt;ref name="Buxton3" /&gt; Humans are the only known [[host (biology)|hosts]] of this specific parasite, while [[chimpanzee]]s host a closely related species, ''Pediculus schaeffi''. Other species of [[lice]] infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds,&lt;ref name="Buxton3" /&gt; as well as other parts of the human body.

Lice differ from other [[hematophagic]] ectoparasites such as [[flea]]s in spending their entire lifecycle on a host.&lt;ref name="maunder"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Maunder | first=JW | title=The Appreciation of Lice | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain | volume=55 | pages=1–31 | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head lice cannot fly, and their short, stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces.&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;

The nondisease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying [[body louse]] (''Pediculus humanus humanus'') in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two [[subspecies]] are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M |title=Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |issue=16 |pages=1414–7 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12932325 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoneking"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024 |last=Stoneking |first=Mark |title=Erratum: Molecular Evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the Origin of Clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=24 |pages=2309 |date=29 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or [[crab louse]] (''Pthirus pubis''), also infests humans. It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates.&lt;ref name="Buxton6"&gt;{{cite book|last= Buxton |first= Patrick A.|title= The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control |edition=2nd |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |pages=136–141 |chapter=The crab louse ''Phthirus pubis'' |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as [[pediculosis]].&lt;ref name="urlpediculosis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pediculosis |title=pediculosis – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head lice (especially in children) have been, and still are, subject to various eradication campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice are not the vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, and they have been regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a medical problem. Head lice infestations might be beneficial in helping to foster a natural [[immune]] response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous [[body louse]], which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases.&lt;ref name="mutualism"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rozsa| first = L |author2=Apari, P. | url =http://www.zoologia.hu/list/Why_infest.pdf | title =Why infest the loved ones – inherent human behaviour indicates former mutualism with head lice| journal =Parasitology | volume = 139 | issue = 6 | pages = 696–700| year =2012 | doi=10.1017/s0031182012000017 | pmid=22309598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult morphology==
[[File:Head louse crawling on hairbrush.webm|thumb|upright=1.4|Head louse crawling on hairbrush showing how tiny it is]]
Like other insects of the suborder [[Anoplura]], adult head lice are small (2.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm long), dorsoventrally flattened (see [[anatomical terms of location]]), and entirely wingless.&lt;ref name="buxton1"&gt;{{cite book|last= Buxton|first= Patrick A.|title= The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition=2nd|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|pages=1–4|chapter=The Anoplura or Sucking Lice|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thoracic]] segments are fused, but otherwise distinct from the [[head]] and [[abdomen]], the latter being composed of seven visible [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"&gt;{{cite book|last= Buxton|first= Patrick A.|title= The Louse; an account of the lice which infest man, their medical importance and control|edition=2nd|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|pages=5–23|chapter=The Anatomy of ''Pediculus humanus''|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head lice are grey in general, but their precise color varies according to the environment in which they were raised.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Nuttall (1919) Parasitology 11:201–220 --&gt; After feeding, consumed blood causes the louse body to take on a reddish color.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;

===Head===
[[File:Fig. 1. Male of head louse.jpg|thumb|upright|Male head louse, adult]]
[[File:Pediculus humanus var capitis.jpg|thumb|horizontal|Female head louse, adult]]

One pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], each with five segments, protrudes from the insect's head. Head lice also have one pair of [[compound eye|eye]]s. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most other members of the Anoplura suborder.&lt;ref name="buxton1"/&gt; Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood.&lt;ref name="buxton1"/&gt; These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MerckVet"&gt;

===Thorax===
[[File:Head louse on human hair.jpg|thumb|upright|Head louse gripping a human hair]]
Six [[insect leg|legs]] project from the fused segments of the [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; As is typical in the Anoplura, these legs are short and terminate with a single [[claw]] and opposing "[[thumb]]".&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; Between its claw and thumb, the louse grasps the hair of its host.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; With their short legs and large claws, lice are well adapted to clinging to the hair of their host. These adaptations leave them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. Lice can climb up strands of hair very quickly, allowing them to move quickly and reach another host.&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;

===Abdomen===
Seven segments of the louse [[abdomen]] are visible.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; The first six segments each have a pair of [[spiracles]] through which the insect breathes.&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt; The last segment contains the [[anus]] and (separately) the [[genitalia]].&lt;ref name="buxton2"/&gt;

===Sex differences===
In male lice, the front two legs are slightly larger than the other four. This specialized pair of legs is used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by a pointed end of the abdomen and a well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomens.

==Louse eggs==
[[File:Head louse egg 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Head louse egg (nit) attached to hair shaft of host]]

Like most insects, head lice are [[oviparous]]. Females lay about three or four eggs per day. Louse [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are attached near the base of a host hair shaft.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams LK, Reichert A, MacKenzie WR, Hightower AW, Blake PA |title=Lice, nits, and school policy |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1011–5 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11331679 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.5.1011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burkhart CN, Burkhart CG |title=Head lice: scientific assessment of the nit sheath with clinical ramifications and therapeutic options |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=129–33 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15965432 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg-laying behavior is temperature dependent and likely seeks to place the egg in a location that will be conducive to proper embyro development (which is, in turn, temperature dependent). In cool climates, eggs are generally laid within 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm of the scalp surface.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid {{convert|6|in|cm}} or more down the hair shaft.&lt;ref name="Meinking1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meinking | first = Terri Lynn | title = Infestations | journal = Current Problems in Dermatology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 75–118 |date=May–June 1999 | doi = 10.1016/S1040-0486(99)90005-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To attach an egg, the adult female secretes a glue from her reproductive organ. This glue quickly hardens into a "nit sheath" that covers the hair shaft and large parts of the egg except for the operculum, a cap through which the embryo breathes.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; The glue was previously thought to be [[chitin]]-based, but more recent studies have shown it to be made of [[protein]]s similar to hair [[keratin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt;

Each egg is oval-shaped and about 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt; They are bright, transparent, and tan to coffee-colored so long as they contain an embryo, but appear white after hatching.&lt;ref name="pmid15965432"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinking1999"/&gt; Head lice hatch typically six to nine days after [[oviposition]].&lt;ref name="Williams2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Burgess, IF  | title = Human lice and their management | volume = 36 | pages = 271–342 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7484466 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60493-5 | series = Advances in Parasitology | isbn = 978-0-12-031736-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hatching, the louse [[nymph (biology)|nymph]] leaves behind its egg shell (usually known as a "nit", see below), still attached to the hair shaft. The empty egg shell remains in place until physically removed by abrasion or the host, or until it slowly disintegrates, which may take 6 or more months.&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"/&gt;

==Nits==
The term ''nit'' refers to an egg without embryo or a dead [[egg (biology)|egg]].&lt;ref name="nitdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nit |title=nit – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-02-25 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to eggs, this rather broad definition includes the following:&lt;ref name="pmid10959734"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A |title=Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America |journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=689–93; discussion 694 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10959734 |doi=10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, on the head of an infested individual, these eggs could be found:
* Viable eggs that will eventually hatch
* Remnants of already-hatched eggs (nits)
* Nonviable eggs (dead [[embryo]]) that will never hatch

This has produced some confusion in, for example, school policy (see [[Treatment of human head lice#School treatment|The "no-nit" policy]]) because, of the three items listed above, only eggs containing viable embryos have the potential to infest or reinfest a host.&lt;ref name="pmid14651472"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burgess, IF |title=Human lice and their control |journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. |volume=49 |issue= |pages=457–81 |year=2004 |pmid=14651472 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.49.061802.123253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have reacted to this confusion by restricting the definition of nit to describe only a hatched or nonviable egg:

[[File:Anoplura hatching.jpg|thumb|Louse hatching]]

{{quote|In many languages, the terms used for the hatched eggs, which were obvious for all to see, have subsequently become applied to the embryonated eggs that are difficult to detect. Thus, the term "nit" in English is often used for both. However, in recent years, my colleagues and I have felt the need for some simple means of distinguishing between the two without laborious qualification. We have, therefore, come to reserve the term "nit" for the hatched and empty egg shell and refer to the developing embryonated egg as an "egg".|Ian F. Burgess (1995)&lt;ref name="Burgess1995"/&gt;}}

{{quote|The empty eggshell, termed a nit...|J. W. Maunder (1983)&lt;ref name="maunder"/&gt;}}

{{quote|...nits (dead eggs or empty egg cases)...|Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and others (2006)&lt;ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mumcuoglu KY, Meinking TA, Burkhart CN, Burkhart CG |title=Head louse infestations: the 'no nit' policy and its consequences |journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=891–6 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16911370 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02827.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have retained the broad definition, while simultaneously attempting to clarify its relevance to infestation:

==Development and nymphs==
[[File:Pediculus humanus development.jpg|thumb|Development of ''Pediculus humanus humanus'' ([[body lice]]), which is similar to that of head lice (''Pediculus humanus capitis'')]]

Head lice, like other insects of the order [[Phthiraptera]], are [[hemimetabolous]].&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MerckVet"/&gt; Newly hatched [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] will [[Moulting|moult]] three times before reaching the sexually-mature adult stage.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Warburton, C. (1910) A preliminary investigation on flock as a possible distributor of vermin, and on the life history of the body-louse. Rep. Local Govt. Bourd, Pub. Health and Medical Subjects. (No. 27) --&gt; Thus, mobile head lice populations contain members of up to four developmental stages: three nymphal [[instars]], and the adult ([[imago]]).&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; [[Metamorphosis]] during head lice development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE – Buxton cites Buxton, P.A. (1938) Studies on growth of Pediculus (Anoplura). Parasitology 30:65–84 --&gt; Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior is similar to the adult. Nymphs feed only on human blood (hematophagia), and cannot survive long away from a host.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;

The time required for head lice to complete their nymph development to the imago depends on feeding conditions. At minimum, eight to nine days are required for lice having continuous access to a human host.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE? – Buxton may be citing Buxton, P.A. (1940) The biology of the body louse (Pediculus humanus corpis: Anoplura) under experimental conditions. Parasitology 32:303–312 --&gt; This experimental condition is most representative of head lice conditions in the wild. Experimental conditions where the nymph has more limited access to blood produces more prolonged development, ranging from 12 to 24 days.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;&lt;!-- SECONDARY REFERENCE? – Buxton may be citing Buxton, P.A. (1940) The biology of the body louse (Pediculus humanus corpis: Anoplura) under experimental conditions. Parasitology 32:303–312 --&gt;

Nymph mortality in captivity is high—about 38%—especially within the first two days of life.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal and may be dependent on the humidity of the egg's environment.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host's blood throughout the insect. This results in death within a day or two.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt; Whether the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild is unclear.&lt;ref name="Buxton3"/&gt;

==Reproduction and lifespan==
[[File:Nuttall 1917 f11.gif|right|thumb|Copulation in ''Pediculus humanus humanus'' (''Pediculus humanus capitis'' is similar), female is on top, with the male below. Dilation of the female's vagina has already occurred, and the male's dilator rests against his back (dorsal surface), out of the way. The male vesica, which contains the penis proper (not seen), is fully inserted into the vagina.

Adult head lice [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and [[copulation]] is necessary for the female to produce fertile eggs.

==Factors affecting infestation==
{{main|Head lice infestation}}

The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in head louse infestation. Girls are two to four times more frequently infested than boys. Children between 4 and 14 years of age are the most frequently infested group.&lt;ref name="IJD"/&gt;

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
All stages are blood-feeders and bite the skin four to five times daily to feed. They inject saliva which contains an [[anticoagulant]] and suck blood. The digested blood is excreted as dark red [[frass]].&lt;ref name="UF"&gt;{{cite web|last =Weems, Jr. |first =H. V. |author2=Fasulo, T.

===Position on host===
Although any part of the scalp may be colonized, lice favor the nape of the neck and the area behind the ears, where the eggs are usually laid. Head lice are repelled by light and move towards shadows or dark-coloured objects in their vicinity.&lt;ref name="Bacot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall1919"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nuttall | first = George H.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission===
Lice have no wings or powerful legs for jumping, so they move using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair.&lt;ref name="UF"/&gt; Normally, head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, hats, brushes, towels, clothing, beds, or closets. [[Touching heads|Head-to-head contact]] is by far the most common route of lice transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liceliftersnewjersey.com/lice-myths-facts/ |title=NJ Head Lice &amp;#124; Philadelphia and South New Jersey Hair Lice |publisher=Lice Lifters New Jersey |accessdate=2012-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112031354/http://www.liceliftersnewjersey.com/lice-myths-facts/ |archivedate=2013-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79004">The mathematical concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] emerged in the 17th century in connection with the development of the [[calculus]]; for example, the slope &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}\!y/\operatorname{d}\!x&lt;/math&gt; of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the ''x''-coordinate of the point. Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as [[Oresme]].

Mathematicians of the 18th century typically regarded a function as being defined by an [[analytic expression]]. In the 19th century, the demands of the rigorous development of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] by [[Weierstrass]] and others, the reformulation of [[geometry]] in terms of analysis, and the invention of [[set theory]] by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], eventually led to the much more general modern concept of a function as a single-valued mapping from one set to another.

==Functions before the 17th century==

Already in the 12th century, mathematician [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī|Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi]] analyzed the equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d'' {{=}} ''b''⋅''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the form {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ (''b'' - ''x'') {{=}} ''d'',}} stating that the left hand side must at least equal the value of {{mvar|d}} for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression. It is arguable that the isolation of this expression is an early approach to the notion of a "function". A value less than {{mvar|d}} means no positive solution; a value equal to {{mvar|d}} corresponds to one solution, while a value greater than {{mvar|d}} corresponds to two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in [[Islamic mathematics]], but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe.&lt;ref name="stages"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Victor |last2=Barton |first2=Bill |title=Stages in the History of Algebra with Implications for Teaching |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |date=October 2007 |volume=66 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dieudonné {{sfn | Dieudonné | 1992 |p=55}} and Ponte,&lt;ref&gt;"The emergence of a notion of function as an individualized mathematical entity can be traced to the beginnings of infinitesimal calculus". ({{harvnb |Ponte |1992}})&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of a function emerged in the 17th century as a result of the development of [[analytic geometry]] and the [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Nevertheless, Medvedev suggests that the implicit concept of a function is one with an ancient lineage.&lt;ref&gt;"...although we do not find in [the mathematicians of Ancient Greece] the idea of functional dependence distinguished in explicit form as a comparatively independent object of study, nevertheless one cannot help noticing the large stock of functional correspondences they studied." ({{harvnb |Medvedev|1991|pages=29–30}})&lt;/ref&gt; Ponte also sees more explicit approaches to the concept in the [[Middle Ages]]:

:Historically, some mathematicians can be regarded as having foreseen and come close to a modern formulation of the concept of function. Among them is [[Nicole Oresme|Oresme]] (1323–1382) . . . In his theory, some general ideas about independent and dependent variable quantities seem to be present.{{sfn |Ponte |1992}}

The development of analytical geometry around 1640 allowed mathematicians to go between geometric problems about curves and algebraic relations between "variable coordinates ''x'' and ''y''."{{sfn|Gardiner|1982|p=255}} Calculus was developed using the notion of variables, with their associated geometric meaning, which persisted well into the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Gardiner|1982|p=256}} However, the terminology of "function" came to be used in interactions between Leibniz and Bernoulli towards the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Kleiner 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleiner |first=Israel |chapter=Evolution of the Function Concept: A Brief Survey |editor1=Marlow Anderson |editor2=Victor Katz |editor3=Robin Wilson |title=Who Gave You the Epsilon?: And Other Tales of Mathematical History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwFMjsym9JwC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=2009 |publisher=MAA |isbn=978-0-88385-569-0 |pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The notion of "function" in analysis==

The term "'''function'''" was literally introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in a 1673 letter, to describe a quantity related to points of a [[curve]], such as a [[coordinate]] or curve's [[slope]].&lt;ref&gt;Eves dates Leibniz's first use to the year 1694 and also similarly relates the usage to "as a term to denote any quantity connected with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, and so on" ({{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=234}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Johann Bernoulli]] started calling expressions made of a single variable "functions."
In 1698, he agreed with Leibniz that any quantity formed "in an algebraic and transcendental manner" may be called a function of ''x''.&lt;ref name="Bourbaki2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. Bourbaki|title=Elements of Mathematics Functions of a Real Variable: Elementary Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtYLvM02cRYC&amp;pg=PA154|date=18 September 2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-65340-0|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1718, he came to regard as a function "any expression made up of a variable and some constants."{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=234}} [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]] (in approximately 1734) and [[Leonhard Euler]] introduced the familiar notation &lt;math&gt;{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; for the value of a function.{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=235}}

The functions considered in those times are called today [[derivative|differentiable functions]]. For this type of function, one can talk about [[limit of a function|limit]]s and derivatives; both are measurements of the output or the change in the output as it depends on the input or the change in the input.  Such functions are the basis of [[calculus]].

===Euler===
In the first volume of his fundamental text ''Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum'', published in 1748, Euler gave essentially the same definition of a function as his teacher Bernoulli, as an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]] or [[formula]] involving variables and constants e.g., &lt;math&gt;{x^2+3x+2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves |1990 |p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euler's own definition reads:

:A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.{{sfn |Euler |1988 |p=3}}

Euler also allowed multi-valued functions whose values are determined by an implicit equation.

In 1755, however, in his ''Institutiones Calculi Differentialis,'' Euler gave a more general concept of a function:

:When certain quantities depend on others in such a way that they undergo a change when the latter change, then the first are called ''functions'' of the second. This name has an extremely broad character; it encompasses all the ways in which one quantity can be determined in terms of others.{{sfn|Euler|2000|p=VI}}

Medvedev{{sfn|Medvedev | 1991|p=47}} considers that "In essence this is the definition that became known as Dirichlet's definition." Edwards{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=47}} also credits Euler with a general concept of a function and says further that

:The relations among these quantities are not thought of as being given by formulas, but on the other hand they are surely not thought of as being the sort of general set-theoretic, anything-goes subsets of product spaces that modern mathematicians mean when they use the word "function".

===Fourier===
In his ''Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur,''{{sfn | Fourier | 1822 }} [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] claimed that an arbitrary function could be represented by a Fourier series.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary mathematicians, with much broader and more precise conceptions of functions, integration, and different notions of convergence than was possible in Fourier's time (including examples of functions that were regarded as pathological and referred to as "monsters" until as late as the turn of the 20th century), would not agree with Fourier that a completely arbitrary function can be expanded in Fourier series, even if its Fourier coefficients are well-defined. For example, [[Kolmogorov]] (1922) constructed a Lebesgue integrable function whose Fourier series diverges pointwise almost everywhere. Nevertheless, a very wide class of functions can be expanded in Fourier series, especially if one allows weaker forms of convergence, such as convergence in the sense of distributions. Thus, Fourier's claim was a reasonable one in the context of his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier had a general conception of a function, which included functions that were neither continuous nor defined by an analytical expression.&lt;ref&gt;For example: "A general function ''f(x)'' is a sequence of values or ordinates, each of which is arbitrary...It is by no means assumed that these ordinates are subject to any general law; they may follow one another in a completely arbitrary manner, and each of them is defined as if it were a unique quantity." ({{harvnb|Fourier|1822|p=552}})&lt;/ref&gt; Related questions on the nature and representation of functions, arising from the solution of the [[wave equation]] for a vibrating string, had already been the subject of dispute between [[d'Alembert]] and Euler, and they had a significant impact in generalizing the notion of a function. [[Nikolai Luzin|Luzin]] observes that:

:The modern understanding of function and its definition, which seems correct to us, could arise only after Fourier's discovery. His discovery showed clearly that most of the misunderstandings that arose in the debate about the vibrating string were the result of confusing two seemingly identical but actually vastly different concepts, namely that of function and that of its analytic representation. Indeed, prior to Fourier's discovery no distinction was drawn between the concepts of "function" and of "analytic representation," and it was this discovery that brought about their disconnection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Luzin|
1998 | p=263}}. Translation by Abe Shenitzer of an article by Luzin that appeared (in the 1930s) in the first edition of The Great Soviet Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cauchy===
During the 19th century, mathematicians started to formalize all the different branches of mathematics. One of the first to do so was [[Cauchy]]; his somewhat imprecise results were later made completely rigorous by [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], who advocated building calculus on [[arithmetic]] rather than on [[geometry]], which favoured Euler's definition over Leibniz's (see [[arithmetization of analysis]]). According to Smithies, Cauchy thought of functions as being defined by equations involving real or complex numbers, and tacitly assumed they were continuous:

:Cauchy makes some general remarks about functions in Chapter I, Section 1 of his ''Analyse algébrique'' (1821). From what he says there, it is clear that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.{{sfn|Smithies |1997|p=187}}

===Lobachevsky and Dirichlet===
[[Nikolai Lobachevsky]]&lt;ref&gt;"On the vanishing of trigonometric series," 1834 ({{harvnb | Lobachevsky |1951 | pages=31–80}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]&lt;ref&gt;Über die Darstellung ganz willkürlicher Funktionen durch Sinus- und Cosinusreihen," 1837 ({{harvnb|Dirichlet|1889|pages=135–160}}).&lt;/ref&gt; are traditionally credited with independently giving the modern "formal" definition of a function as a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] in which every first element has a unique second element.

Lobachevsky (1834) writes that

:The general concept of a function requires that a function of ''x'' be defined as a number given for each ''x'' and varying gradually with ''x''. The value of the function can be given either by an analytic expression, or by a condition that provides a means of examining all numbers and choosing one of them; or finally the dependence may exist but remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lobachevsky |1951|p=43}} as quoted in {{harvnb|Medvedev|1991|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

while Dirichlet (1837) writes

:If now a unique finite ''y'' corresponding to each ''x'', and moreover in such a way that when ''x'' ranges continuously over the interval from ''a'' to ''b'', &lt;math&gt;{y=f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; also varies continuously, then ''y'' is called a ''continuous'' function of ''x'' for this interval. It is not at all necessary here that ''y'' be given in terms of ''x'' by one and the same law throughout the entire interval, and it is not necessary that it be regarded as a dependence expressed using mathematical operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirichlet|1889 |p=135}} as quoted in {{harvnb|Medvedev|1991|pages=60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eves asserts that "the student of mathematics usually meets the Dirichlet definition of function in his introductory course in calculus,.&lt;ref&gt;Eves asserts that Dirichlet "arrived at the following formulation: "[The notion of] a ''variable'' is a symbol that represents any one of a set of numbers; if two variables ''x'' and ''y'' are so related that whenever a value is assigned to ''x'' there is automatically assigned, by some rule or correspondence, a value to ''y'', then we say ''y'' is a (single-valued) ''function'' of x. The variable ''x'' . . . is called the ''independent variable'' and the variable ''y'' is called the dependent variable. The permissible values that ''x'' may assume constitute the ''domain of definition'' of the function, and the values taken on by y constitute the ''range of values'' of the function . . . it stresses the basic idea of a relationship between two sets of numbers" {{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirichlet's claim to this formalization has been disputed by [[Imre Lakatos]]:

:There is no such definition in Dirichlet's works at all.  But there is ample evidence that he had no idea of this concept.  In his [1837] paper for instance, when he discusses piecewise continuous functions, he says that at points of discontinuity the function ''has two values'': ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Imre Lakatos |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Worrall |editor2-first=Elie |editor2-last=Zahar |year=1976 |title= Proofs and Refutations |location= Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-29038-4 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1n6SFdXCOBQC}} Published posthumously.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gardiner says
"...it seems to me that Lakatos goes too far, for example, when he asserts that 'there is ample evidence that [Dirichlet] had no idea of [the modern function] concept'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=A.|year=1982|ref=harv |title=Understanding infinity,the mathematics of infinite processes |page=275 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-42538-X |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=NiDCYJ8vrGQC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=dirichlet+lakatos+arbitrary+have+not+checked&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Tn6NPwu42&amp;sig=woChOYaXCoomirwrqW1VVWyRxE8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sTp4T9zyAoHL0QWwsoW4DQ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, as noted above, Dirichlet's paper does appear to include a definition along the lines of what is usually ascribed to him, even though (like Lobachevsky) he states it only for continuous functions of a real variable.

Similarly, Lavine observes that:

:It is a matter of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern definition of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of ''continuous'' function to make it clear that no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's ''definition'' of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law. But I also doubt there is sufficient evidence to settle the dispute.{{sfn | Lavine | 1994 |p=34}}

Because Lobachevsky and Dirichlet have been credited as among the first to introduce the notion of an arbitrary correspondence, this notion is sometimes referred to as the Dirichlet or Lobachevsky-Dirichlet definition of a function.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb | Medvedev | 1991 |pages=55–70}} for further discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; A general version of this definition was later used by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] (1939), and some in the education community refer to it as the "Dirichlet–Bourbaki" definition of a function.

===Dedekind===
[[Jean Dieudonné|Dieudonné]], who was one of the founding members of the Bourbaki group, credits a precise and general modern definition of a function to [[Dedekind]] in his work
''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen'',&lt;ref&gt;"By a mapping φ of a set ''S'' we understand a law that assigns to each element ''s'' of ''S'' a uniquely determined object called the ''image'' of ''s'', denoted as φ(''s''). {{harvnb | Dedekind  |1995|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in 1888 but had already been drafted in 1878. Dieudonné observes that instead of confining himself, as in previous conceptions, to real (or complex) functions, Dedekind defines a function as a single-valued mapping between any two sets:

:What was new and what was to be essential for the whole of mathematics was the entirely general conception of a ''function''.{{sfn | Dieudonné | 1992 | p=135}}

===Hardy===
{{harvnb|Hardy|1908|pp=26–28}} defined a function as a relation between two variables ''x'' and ''y'' such that "to some values of ''x'' at any rate correspond values of ''y''."  He neither required the function to be defined for all values of ''x'' nor to associate each value of ''x'' to a single value of&amp;nbsp;''y''. This broad definition of a function encompasses more relations than are ordinarily considered functions in contemporary mathematics.  For example, Hardy's definition includes [[multivalued function]]s and what in [[computability theory]] are called [[partial functions]].

==The logician's "function" prior to 1850==
[[Logician]]s of this time were primarily involved with analyzing [[syllogism]]s (the 2000-year-old Aristotelian forms and otherwise), or as [[Augustus De Morgan]] (1847) stated it: "the examination of that part of reasoning which depends upon the manner in which inferences are formed,
and the investigation of general maxims and rules for constructing arguments".{{sfn |De Morgan |1847 |p=1}} At this time the notion of (logical) "function" is not explicit, but at least in the work of De Morgan and [[George Boole]] it is implied: we see abstraction of the argument forms, the introduction of variables, the introduction of a symbolic algebra with respect to these variables, and some of the notions of set theory.

De Morgan's 1847 "FORMAL LOGIC OR, The Calculus of Inference, Necessary and Probable" observes that "[a] [[logical truth]] depends upon the ''structure of the statement'', and not upon the particular matters spoken of"; he wastes no time (preface page i) abstracting: "In the form of the proposition, the copula is made as abstract as the terms". He immediately (p.&amp;nbsp;1) casts what he calls "the proposition" (present-day propositional ''function'' or ''relation'') into a form such as "X is Y", where the symbols X, "is", and Y represent, respectively, the ''subject'', ''copula'', and ''predicate.'' While the word "function" does not appear, the notion of "abstraction" is there, "variables" are there, the notion of inclusion in his symbolism "all of the Δ is in the О" (p.&amp;nbsp;9) is there, and lastly a new symbolism for logical analysis of the notion of "relation" (he uses the word with respect to this example " X)Y " (p.&amp;nbsp;75) ) is there:
:" A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; X)Y  To take an X it is necessary to take a Y" [or To be an X it is necessary to be a Y]
:" A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Y)X  To take a Y it is sufficient to take a X" [or To be a Y it is sufficient to be an X], etc.

In his 1848 ''The Nature of Logic'' Boole asserts that "logic  . . . is in a more especial sense the science of reasoning by signs", and he briefly discusses the notions of "belonging to" and "class": "An individual may possess a great variety of attributes and thus belonging to a great variety of different classes" .&lt;ref&gt;Boole 1848 in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |pp=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like De Morgan he uses the notion of "variable" drawn from analysis; he gives an example of "represent[ing] the class oxen by ''x'' and that of horses by ''y'' and the conjunction ''and'' by the sign + . . . we might represent the aggregate class oxen and horses by ''x + y''".&lt;ref&gt;Boole 1848 in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of "the Differential Calculus" Boole defined (circa 1849) the notion of a function as follows:
:"That quantity whose variation is uniform . . . is called the independent variable. That quantity whose variation is referred to the variation of the former is said to be a ''function'' of it. The Differential calculus enables us in every case to pass from the function to the limit. This it does by a certain Operation. But in the very Idea of an Operation is . . . the idea of an inverse operation. To effect that inverse operation in the present instance is the business of the Int[egral] Calculus."&lt;ref&gt;Boole circa 1849 ''Elementary Treatise on Logic not mathematical including philosophy of mathematical reasoning'' in {{harvnb |Grattan-Guinness |Bornet |1997 |p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The logicians' "function" 1850–1950==
Eves observes "that logicians have endeavored to push down further the starting level of the definitional development of mathematics and to derive the theory of sets, or classes, from a foundation in the logic of propositions and propositional functions".{{sfn |Eves |1990 |p=222}} But by the late 19th century the logicians' research into the foundations of mathematics was undergoing a major split. The direction of the first group, the [[Logicist]]s, can probably be summed up best by {{harvard citations |nb |first=Bertrand |last=Russell |year=1903 |p=9}} – "to fulfil two objects, first, to show that all mathematics follows from symbolic logic, and secondly to discover, as far as possible, what are the principles of symbolic logic itself."

The second group of logicians, the set-theorists, emerged with [[Georg Cantor]]'s "set theory" (1870–1890) but were driven forward partly as a result of Russell's discovery of a paradox that could be derived from Frege's conception of "function", but also as a reaction against Russell's proposed solution.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this criticism is intense: see the introduction by [[Willard Quine]] preceding {{harvnb |Russell |1908a}} ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=151}}. See also in {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} the introduction to his ''Axiomatization of Set Theory'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zermelo's set-theoretic response was his 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'' – the first axiomatic set theory; here too the notion of "propositional function" plays a role.

===George Boole's ''The Laws of Thought'' 1854; John Venn's ''Symbolic Logic'' 1881===
In his ''An Investigation into the laws of thought'' Boole now defined a function in terms of a symbol ''x'' as follows:
:"8. Definition. – Any algebraic expression involving symbol ''x'' is termed a function of x, and may be represented by the abbreviated form f(x)"{{sfn |Boole |1854 |p=86}}
Boole then used ''algebraic'' expressions to define both algebraic and ''logical'' notions, e.g., 1&amp;minus;''x'' is logical NOT(''x''), ''xy'' is the logical AND(''x'',''y''), ''x + y'' is the logical OR(''x'', ''y''), ''x''(''x''+''y'') is ''xx''+''xy'', and "the special law" ''xx'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;cf {{harvnb |Boole |1854 |pp=31–34}}. Boole discusses this "special law" with its two algebraic roots ''x'' = 0 or 1, on page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'' Venn was using the words "logical function" and the contemporary symbolism ( x = f(y), y = f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(x), cf page xxi) plus the circle-diagrams historically associated with Venn to describe "class relations",&lt;ref&gt;Although he gives others credit, cf {{harvnb |Venn |1881 |p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notions "'quantifying' our predicate", "propositions in respect of their extension", "the relation of inclusion and exclusion of two classes to one another", and "propositional function" (all on p.&amp;nbsp;10), the bar over a variable to indicate not-x (page 43), etc. Indeed he equated unequivocally the notion of "logical function" with "class" [modern "set"]: "... on the view adopted in this book, f(x) never stands for anything but a logical class. It may be a compound class aggregated of many simple classes; it may be a class indicated by certain inverse logical operations, it may be composed of two groups of classes equal to one another, or what is the same thing, their difference declared equal to zero, that is, a logical equation. But however composed or derived, f(x) with us will never be anything else than a general expression for such logical classes of things as may fairly find a place in ordinary Logic".{{sfn |Venn |1881 |pp=86–87}}

===Frege's ''Begriffsschrift'' 1879===
[[Gottlob Frege]]'s [[Begriffsschrift]] (1879) preceded [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1889), but Peano had no knowledge of {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} until after he had published his 1889.&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's introduction to {{harvnb |Peano |1889}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967}}. For most of his logical symbolism and notions of propositions Peano credits "many writers, especially Boole". In footnote 1 he credits Boole 1847, 1848, 1854, Schröder 1877, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1883, MacColl 1877, 1878, 1878a, 1880; cf {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=86}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers strongly influenced {{harvtxt |Russell |1903}}. Russell in turn influenced much of 20th-century mathematics and logic through his ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1913) jointly authored with [[Alfred North Whitehead]].

At the outset Frege abandons the traditional "concepts ''subject'' and ''predicate''", replacing them with ''argument'' and ''function'' respectively, which he believes "will stand the test of time. It is easy to see how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of the connection between the meanings of the words ''if, and, not, or, there is, some, all,'' and so forth, deserves attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege begins his discussion of "function" with an example: Begin with the expression&lt;ref&gt;Frege's exact words are "expressed in our formula language" and "expression", cf {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide". Now remove the sign for hydrogen (i.e., the word "hydrogen") and replace it with the sign for oxygen (i.e., the word "oxygen"); this makes a second statement. Do this again (using either statement) and substitute the sign for nitrogen (i.e., the word "nitrogen") and note that "This changes the meaning in such a way that "oxygen" or "nitrogen" enters into the relations in which "hydrogen" stood before".&lt;ref&gt;This example is from {{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three statements:
* "Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
* "Oxygen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
* "Nitrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide."
Now observe in all three a "stable component, representing the totality of [the] relations";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; call this '''the function''', i.e.,
: "... is lighter than carbon dioxide", is the function.
Frege calls the '''argument''' of the function "[t]he sign [e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen], regarded as replaceable by others that [[denotation|denotes]] the object standing in these relations".&lt;ref&gt;Frege cautions that the function will have "argument places" where the argument should be placed as distinct from other places where the same sign might appear. But he does not go deeper into how to signify these positions and {{harvnb |Russell |1903}} observes this.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that we could have derived the function as "Hydrogen is lighter than . . .." as well, with an argument position on the ''right''; the exact observation is made by Peano (see more below). Finally, Frege allows for the case of two (or more arguments). For example, remove "carbon dioxide" to yield the invariant part (the function) as:
* "... is lighter than ... "
The one-argument function Frege generalizes into the form Φ(A) where A is the argument and Φ( ) represents the function, whereas the two-argument function he symbolizes as Ψ(A, B) with A and B the arguments and Ψ( , ) the function and cautions that "in general Ψ(A, B) differs from Ψ(B, A)". Using his unique symbolism he translates for the reader the following symbolism:
:"We can read |--- Φ(A) as "A has the property Φ. |--- Ψ(A, B) can be translated by "B stands in the relation Ψ to A" or "B is a result of an application of the procedure Ψ to the object A".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peano's ''The Principles of Arithmetic'' 1889===
Peano defined the notion of "function" in a manner somewhat similar to Frege, but without the precision.&lt;ref&gt;"...Peano intends to cover much more ground than Frege does in his ''Begriffsschrift'' and his subsequent works, but he does not till that ground to any depth comparable to what Frege does in his self-allotted field", {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; First Peano defines the sign "K means ''class'', or aggregate of objects",{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=89}} the objects of which satisfy three simple equality-conditions,{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}} ''a = a'', (''a = b'') = (''b = a''), IF ((''a = b'') AND (''b = c'')) THEN (''a = c''). He then introduces φ, "a sign or an aggregate of signs such that if ''x'' is an object of the class ''s'', the expression φx denotes a new object". Peano adds two conditions on these new objects: First, that the three equality-conditions hold for the objects φx; secondly, that "if ''x'' and ''y'' are objects of class ''s'' and if ''x'' = ''y'', we assume it is possible to deduce ''φx = φy''".&lt;ref&gt;All symbols used here are from {{harvnb |Peano |1889}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Given all these conditions are met, φ is a "function presign". Likewise he identifies a "function postsign". For example   if ''φ'' is the function presign ''a''+, then ''φx'' yields ''a''+''x'', or if ''φ'' is the function postsign +''a'' then ''xφ'' yields  ''x''+''a''.{{sfn |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=91}}

===Bertrand Russell's ''The Principles of Mathematics'' 1903===
While the influence of Cantor and Peano was paramount,&lt;ref&gt;"In Mathematics, my chief obligations, as is indeed evident, are to Georg Cantor and Professor Peano. If I had become acquainted sooner with the work of Professor Frege, I should have owed a great deal to him, but as it is I arrived independently at many results which he had already established", {{harvnb |Russell |1903 |p=viii}}. He also highlights Boole's 1854 ''Laws of Thought'' and [[Ernst Schröder]]'s three volumes of "non-Peanesque methods" 1890, 1891, and 1895 cf {{harvnb |Russell |1903 |p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Appendix A "The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege" of ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', Russell arrives at a discussion of Frege's notion of ''function'', "...a point in which Frege's work is very important, and requires careful examination".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}} In response to his 1902 exchange of letters with Frege about the contradiction he discovered in Frege's ''Begriffsschrift'' Russell tacked this section on at the last moment.

For Russell the bedeviling notion is that of "variable": "6. Mathematical propositions are not only characterized by the fact that they assert implications, but also by the fact that they contain ''variables''. The notion of the variable is one of the most difficult with which logic has to deal. For the present, I openly wish to make it plain that there are variables in all mathematical propositions, even where at first sight they might seem to be absent. . . . We shall find always, in all mathematical propositions, that the words ''any'' or ''some'' occur; and these words are the marks of a variable and a formal implication".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |pp=5–6}}

As expressed by Russell "the process of transforming constants in a proposition into variables leads to what is called generalization, and gives us, as it were, the formal essence of a proposition ... So long as any term in our proposition can be turned into a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it";{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=7}} these generalizations Russell named ''propositional functions''".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=19}} Indeed he cites and quotes from Frege's ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and presents a vivid example from Frege's 1891 ''Function und Begriff'': That "the essence of the arithmetical function 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'' is what is left when the x is taken away, i.e., in the above instance 2(&amp;nbsp;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). The argument ''x'' does not belong to the function but the two taken together make the whole".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}} Russell agreed with Frege's notion of "function" in one sense: "He regards functions – and in this I agree with him – as more fundamental than predicates and relations" but Russell rejected Frege's "theory of subject and assertion", in particular "he thinks that, if a term ''a'' occurs in a proposition, the proposition can always be analysed into ''a'' and an assertion about ''a''".{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=505}}

===Evolution of Russell's notion of "function" 1908–1913===
Russell would carry his ideas forward in his 1908 ''Mathematical logical as based on the theory of types'' and into his and Whitehead's 1910–1913 ''Principia Mathematica''. By the time of ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell, like Frege, considered the propositional function fundamental: "Propositional functions are the fundamental kind from which the more usual kinds of function, such as "sin ''x''" or log x or "the father of x" are derived. These derivative functions . . . are called "descriptive functions". The functions of propositions . . . are a particular case of propositional functions".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1910–1913:15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Propositional function]]s''': Because his terminology is different from the contemporary, the reader may be confused by Russell's "propositional function". An example may help. Russell writes a '''propositional function''' in its raw form, e.g., as ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt". (Observe the circumflex or "hat" over the variable ''y''). For our example, we will assign just 4 values to the variable ''ŷ'': "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit", and "''y''". Substitution of one of these values for variable ''ŷ'' yields a '''proposition'''; this proposition is called a "value" of the propositional function. In our example there are four values of the propositional function, e.g., "Bob is hurt", "This bird is hurt", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" and "''y'' is hurt." A proposition, if it is '''significant'''—i.e., if its truth is '''determinate'''—has a '''truth-value''' of ''truth'' or ''falsity''. If a proposition's truth value is "truth" then the variable's value is said to '''satisfy''' the propositional function. Finally, per Russell's definition, "a ''class'' [set] is all objects satisfying some propositional function" (p.&amp;nbsp;23). Note the word "all'" – this is how the contemporary notions of "For all ∀" and "there exists at least one instance ∃" enter the treatment (p.&amp;nbsp;15).

To continue the example: Suppose (from outside the mathematics/logic) one determines that the propositions "Bob is hurt" has a truth value of "falsity", "This bird is hurt" has a truth value of "truth", "Emily the rabbit is hurt" has an indeterminate truth value because "Emily the rabbit" doesn't exist, and "''y'' is hurt" is ambiguous as to its truth value because the argument ''y'' itself is ambiguous. While the two propositions "Bob is hurt" and "This bird is hurt" are ''significant'' (both have truth values), only the value "This bird" of the ''variable'' ''ŷ'' ''satisfies'' the propositional function ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt". When one goes to form the class α: ''φŷ'': "''ŷ'' is hurt", only "This bird" is included, given the four values "Bob", "This bird", "Emily the rabbit" and "''y''" for variable ''ŷ'' and their respective truth-values: falsity, truth, indeterminate, ambiguous.

Russell defines '''functions of propositions with arguments''', and '''truth-functions''' ''f(p)''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913:6, 8 respectively&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose one were to form the "function of propositions with arguments" p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: "NOT(p) AND q" and assign its variables the values of ''p'': "Bob is hurt" and ''q'': "This bird is hurt". (We are restricted to  the logical linkages NOT, AND, OR and IMPLIES, and we can only assign "significant" propositions to the variables ''p'' and ''q''). Then the "function of propositions with arguments" is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt". To determine the truth value of this "function of propositions with arguments" we submit it to a "truth function", e.g., ''f(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'': ''f''( NOT("Bob is hurt") AND "This bird is hurt" ), which yields a truth value of "truth".

'''The notion of a "many-one" functional relation"''': Russell first discusses the notion of "identity", then defines a '''descriptive function''' (pages 30ff) as the '''unique''' value ''ιx'' that satisfies the (2-variable) propositional function (i.e., "relation") ''φŷ''.
:''N.B. The reader should be warned here that the order of the variables are reversed! ''y'' is the independent variable and ''x'' is the dependent variable, e.g., x = sin(y)''.&lt;ref&gt;Something similar appears in {{harvnb |Tarski |1946}}. Tarski refers to a "relational function" as a "ONE-MANY [sic!] or FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION". Tarski comments about this reversal of variables on page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
Russell symbolizes the descriptive function as "the object standing in relation to ''y''": R'y =&lt;sub&gt;DEF&lt;/sub&gt; (''ιx'')(''x R y''). Russell repeats that "''R'y'' is a function of ''y'', but not a propositional function [sic]; we shall call it a ''descriptive'' function. All the ordinary functions of mathematics are of this kind. Thus in our notation "sin ''y''" would be written " sin '' 'y'' ", and "sin" would stand for the relation sin '' 'y'' has to ''y''".&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913:31. This paper is important enough that van Heijenoort reprinted it as {{harvnb |Whitehead |Russell |1910}} ''Incomplete symbols: Descriptions'' with commentary by W. V. Quine in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=216–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The formalist's "function": David Hilbert's axiomatization of mathematics (1904–1927)==
[[David Hilbert]] set himself the goal of "formalizing" classical mathematics "as a formal axiomatic theory, and this theory shall be proved to be consistent, i.e., free from contradiction".{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |p=53}} In {{harvnb |Hilbert |1927}} ''The Foundations of Mathematics'' he frames the notion of function in terms of the existence of an "object":
: 13. A(a) --&gt; A(ε(A)) Here ε(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all; let us call ε the logical ε-function".&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; [The arrow indicates "implies".]
Hilbert then illustrates the three ways how the ε-function is to be used, firstly as the "for all" and "there exists" notions, secondly to represent the "object of which [a proposition] holds", and lastly how to cast it into the [[choice function]].

'''Recursion theory and computability''': But the unexpected outcome of Hilbert's and his student [[Bernays]]'s effort was failure; see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] of 1931. At about the same time, in an effort to solve Hilbert's [[Entscheidungsproblem]], mathematicians set about to define what was meant by an "effectively calculable function" ([[Alonzo Church]] 1936), i.e., "effective method" or "[[algorithm]]", that is, an explicit, step-by-step procedure that would succeed in computing a function. Various models for algorithms appeared, in rapid succession, including Church's [[lambda calculus]] (1936), [[Stephen Kleene]]'s [[mu-recursive function|μ-recursive functions]](1936) and [[Alan Turing]]'s (1936–7) notion of replacing human "computers" with utterly-mechanical "computing machines" (see [[Turing machine]]s).  It was shown that all of these models could compute the same class of [[computable function]]s. [[Church's thesis]] holds that this class of functions exhausts all the [[number-theoretic function]]s that can be calculated by an algorithm. The outcomes of these efforts were vivid demonstrations that, in Turing's words, "there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula ''U'' of the functional calculus '''K''' [''Principia Mathematica''] is provable";&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in {{cite book |first=Martin |last=Davis |authorlink=Martin Davis |title=The undecidable: basic papers on undecidable propositions, unsolvable problems and computable functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW8x7sQ4JXgC |year=1965 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-43228-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; see more at [[Independence (mathematical logic)]] and [[Computability theory]].

==Development of the set-theoretic definition of "function"==
Set theory began with the work of the logicians with the notion of "class" (modern "set") for example {{harvtxt |De Morgan |1847}}, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] (1880), {{harvtxt |Venn |1881}}, {{harvtxt |Frege |1879}} and {{harvtxt |Peano |1889}}. It was given a push by [[Georg Cantor]]'s attempt to define the infinite in set-theoretic treatment (1870–1890) and a subsequent discovery of an [[antinomy]] (contradiction, paradox) in this treatment ([[Cantor's paradox]]), by Russell's discovery (1902) of an antinomy in Frege's 1879 ([[Russell's paradox]]), by the discovery of more antinomies in the early 20th century (e.g., the 1897 [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and the 1905 [[Richard paradox]]), and by resistance to Russell's complex treatment of logic{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |p=45}} and dislike of his [[axiom of reducibility]]&lt;ref&gt;"The nonprimitive and arbitrary character of this axiom drew forth severe criticism, and much of subsequent refinement of the logistic program lies in attempts to devise some method of avoiding the disliked axiom of reducibility" {{harvnb |Eves |1990 |p=268}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1908, 1910–1913) that he proposed as a means to evade the antinomies.

===Russell's paradox 1902===
In 1902 Russell sent a letter to Frege pointing out that Frege's 1879 ''Begriffsschrift'' allowed a function to be an argument of itself: "On the other hand, it may also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate . . .."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Frege |1879}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this unconstrained situation Russell was able to form a paradox:
:"You state ... that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let ''w'' be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can ''w'' be predicated of itself?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Russell |1902}} ''Letter to Frege'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Frege responded promptly that "Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Frege |1902}} ''Letter to Russell'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point forward development of the foundations of mathematics became an exercise in how to dodge "Russell's paradox", framed as it was in "the bare [set-theoretic] notions of set and element".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary to Russell's ''Letter to Frege'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zermelo's set theory (1908) modified by Skolem (1922)===
The notion of "function" appears as Zermelo's axiom III—the Axiom of Separation (Axiom der Aussonderung). This axiom constrains us to use a propositional function Φ(x) to "separate" a subset M&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; from a previously formed set M:
: "AXIOM III. (Axiom of separation). Whenever the propositional function Φ(x) is definite for all elements of a set M, M possesses a subset M&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt; containing as elements precisely those elements x of M for which Φ(x) is true".&lt;ref&gt;The original uses an Old High German symbol in place of Φ cf {{harvnb |Zermelo |1908a}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no universal set—sets originate by way of Axiom II from elements of (non-set) ''domain B'' – "...this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Zermelo |1908a}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Zermelo's "definite criterion" is imprecise, and is fixed by Weyl, Fraenkel, Skolem, and von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;cf van Heijenoort's commentary before Zermelo 1908 ''Investigations in the foundations of set theory I'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact Skolem in his 1922 referred to this "definite criterion" or "property" as a "definite proposition":
:"... a finite expression constructed from elementary propositions of the form ''a'' ε ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b'' by means of the five operations [logical conjunction, disjunction, negation, universal quantification, and existential quantification].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Skolem |1922}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Van Heijenoort|van Heijenoort]] summarizes:
:"A property is definite in Skolem's sense if it is expressed . . . by a well-formed formula in the simple predicate calculus of first order in which the sole predicate constants are ε and possibly, =. ... Today an axiomatization of set theory is usually embedded in a logical calculus, and it is [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl's]] and Skolem's approach to the formulation of the axiom of separation that is generally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's introduction to Abraham Fraenkel's ''The notion "definite" and the independence of the axiom of choice'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this quote the reader may observe a shift in terminology: nowhere is mentioned the notion of "propositional function", but rather one sees the words "formula", "predicate calculus", "predicate", and "logical calculus." This shift in terminology is discussed more in the section that covers "function" in contemporary set theory.

===The Wiener–Hausdorff–Kuratowski "ordered pair" definition 1914–1921===
The history of the notion of "ordered pair" is not clear. As noted above, Frege (1879) proposed an intuitive ordering in his definition of a two-argument function Ψ(A, B). [[Norbert Wiener]] in his 1914 (see below) observes that his own treatment essentially "revert(s) to [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder's]] treatment of a relation as a class of ordered couples".&lt;ref&gt;But Wiener offers no date or reference cf {{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt |Russell |1903}} considered the definition of a relation (such as Ψ(A, B)) as a "class of couples" but rejected it:
:"There is a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples. This is the formal advantage that it avoids the necessity for the primitive proposition asserting that every couple has a relation holding between no other pairs of terms. But it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent [''domain''] from the relatum [''converse domain'']: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. . . . It seems therefore more correct to take an intensional view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes."{{sfn |Russell |1903 |p=99}}

By 1910–1913 and ''Principia Mathematica'' Russell had given up on the requirement for an [[Intensional statement|intensional]] definition of a relation, stating that "mathematics is always concerned with extensions rather than intensions" and "Relations, like classes, are to be taken in ''extension''".&lt;ref&gt;both quotes from {{harvnb |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the notion of a relation in [[Extension (predicate logic)|extension]] Russell now embraced the notion of ''ordered couple'': "We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by φ(''x, y'') is the class of couples (''x, y'') for which  φ(''x, y'') is true". {{sfn |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}  In a footnote he clarified his notion and arrived at this definition:
:"Such a couple has a ''sense'', i.e., the couple (''x, y'') is different from the couple (''y, x'') unless ''x = y''. We shall call it a "couple with sense," ... it may also be called an ''ordered couple''. {{sfn |Whitehead |Russell |1913 |p=26}}
But he goes on to say that he would not introduce the ordered couples further into his "symbolic treatment"; he proposes his "matrix" and his unpopular axiom of reducibility in their place.

An attempt to solve the problem of the [[antinomies]] led Russell to propose his "doctrine of types" in an appendix B of his 1903 ''The Principles of Mathematics''.{{sfn |Russell |1903 |pp=523–529}} In a few years he would refine this notion and propose in his 1908 ''The Theory of Types'' two [[axiom of reducibility|axioms of reducibility]], the purpose of which were to reduce (single-variable) propositional functions and (dual-variable) relations to a "lower" form (and ultimately into a completely [[extensional]] form); he and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] would carry this treatment over to ''Principia Mathematica'' 1910–1913 with a further refinement called "a matrix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Principia Mathematica  |chapter=*12 The Hierarchy of Types and the axiom of Reducibility |year=1913 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdMgDpNSdLsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first axiom is *12.1; the second is *12.11. To quote Wiener the second axiom *12.11 "is involved only in the theory of relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both axioms, however, were met with skepticism and resistance; see more at [[Axiom of reducibility]]. By 1914 Norbert Wiener, using Whitehead and Russell's symbolism, eliminated axiom *12.11 (the "two-variable" (relational) version of the axiom of reducibility) by expressing a relation as an [[ordered pair]] "using the null set. At approximately the same time, [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] (1914, p. 32) gave the definition of the ordered pair (a, b) as { {a,1}, {b, 2} }. A few years later [[Kuratowski]] (1921) offered a definition that has been widely used ever since, namely { {a, b}, {a} }".&lt;ref&gt;commentary by van Heijenoort preceding {{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} ''A simplification of the logic of relations'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} "This definition . . . was historically important in reducing the theory of relations to the theory of sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Suppes |1960 |p=32}}. This same point appears in van Heijenoort's commentary before {{harvtxt |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observe that while Wiener "reduced" the relational *12.11 form of the axiom of reducibility he ''did not'' reduce nor otherwise change the propositional-function form *12.1; indeed he declared this "essential to the treatment of identity, descriptions, classes and relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Wiener |1914}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schönfinkel's notion of "function" as a many-one "correspondence" 1924===
Where exactly the ''general'' notion of "function" as a many-one correspondence derives from is unclear. Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' states that "It should be observed that all mathematical functions result form one-many [sic – contemporary usage is many-one] relations . . . Functions in this sense are ''descriptive'' functions".{{sfn |Russell |1920 |p=46}} A reasonable possibility is the ''Principia Mathematica'' notion of "descriptive function" – ''R 'y'' =&lt;sub&gt;DEF&lt;/sub&gt; (ι''x'')(''x R y''): "the singular object that has a relation ''R'' to ''y''". Whatever the case, by 1924, [[Moses Schönfinkel]] expressed the notion, claiming it to be "well known":
:"As is well known, by function we mean in the simplest case a correspondence between the elements of some domain of quantities, the argument domain, and those of a domain of function values ... such that to each argument value there corresponds at most one function value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Schönfinkel |1924}} ''On the building blocks of mathematical logic'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Willard Quine]], {{harvnb |Schönfinkel |1924}} "provide[s] for ... the whole sweep of abstract set theory. The crux of the matter is that Schönfinkel lets functions stand as arguments. For Schönfinkel, substantially as for Frege, classes are special sorts of functions. They are propositional functions, functions whose values are truth values. All functions, propositional and otherwise, are for Schönfinkel one-place functions".&lt;ref&gt;commentary by W. V. Quine preceding {{harvtxt |Schönfinkel |1924}} ''On the building blocks of mathematical logic'' in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, Schönfinkel reduces all mathematics to an extremely compact ''functional calculus'' consisting of only three functions: Constancy, fusion (i.e., composition), and mutual exclusivity. Quine notes that [[Haskell Curry]] (1958) carried this work forward "under the head of [[combinatory logic]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf ''Curry and Feys 1958''; Quine in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=357}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Von Neumann's set theory 1925===
By 1925 [[Abraham Fraenkel]] (1922) and [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1922) had amended Zermelo's set theory of 1908. But von Neumann was not convinced that this axiomatization could not lead to the antinomies.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann's critique of the history observes the split between the logicists (e.g., Russell et. al.) and the set-theorists (e.g., Zermelo et. al.) and the formalists (e.g., Hilbert), cf {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=394–396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So he proposed his own theory, his 1925 ''An axiomatization of set theory''.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the 1925 appearance in van Heijenoort, Suppes 1970:12 cites two more: 1928a and 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly contains a "contemporary", set-theoretic version of the notion of "function":
:"[Unlike Zermelo's set theory] [w]e prefer, however, to axiomatize not "set" but "function". The latter notion certainly includes the former. (More precisely, the two notions are completely equivalent, since a function can be regarded as a set of pairs, and a set as a function that can take two values.)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset he begins with ''I-objects'' and ''II-objects'', two objects ''A'' and ''B'' that are I-objects (first axiom), and two types of "operations" that assume ordering as a structural property&lt;ref&gt;In his 1930-1931 ''The Philosophy of Mathematics and Hilbert's Proof Theory'' Bernays asserts (in the context of rebutting Logicism's construction of the numbers from logical axioms) that "the Number concept turns out to be an elementary ''structural concept''". This paper appears on page 243 in Paolo Mancosu 1998 ''From Brouwer to Hilbert'', Oxford University Press, NY, {{isbn|0-19-509632-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; obtained of the resulting objects [''x'', ''y''] and (''x'', ''y''). The two "domains of objects" are called "arguments" (I-objects) and "functions" (II-objects); where they overlap are the "argument functions" (he calls them I-II objects). He introduces two "universal two-variable operations" – (i) the operation [x, y]: ". . . read 'the value of the function ''x'' for the argument ''y'' . . . it itself is a type I object", and (ii) the operation (''x, y''): ". . . (read 'the ordered pair x, y') whose variables ''x'' and ''y'' must both be arguments and that itself produces an argument (''x, y''). Its most important property is that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; follow from (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)". To clarify the function pair he notes that "Instead of ''f''(''x'') we write [''f,x''] to indicate that ''f'', just like ''x'', is to be regarded as a variable in this procedure". To avoid the "antinomies of naive set theory, in Russell's first of all . . . we must forgo treating certain functions as arguments".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from {{harvnb |von Neumann |1925}} in {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |pp=396–398}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopts a notion from Zermelo to restrict these "certain functions".&lt;ref&gt;This notion is not easy to summarize; see more at {{harvnb |van Heijenoort |1967 |p=397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppes&lt;ref&gt;See also van Heijenoort's introduction to von Neumann's paper on pages 393–394.&lt;/ref&gt; observes that von Neumann's axiomatization was modified by Bernays "in order to remain nearer to the original Zermelo system . . . He introduced two membership relations: one between sets, and one between sets and classes". Then Gödel [1940]&lt;ref&gt;cf in particular p. 35 where Gödel declares his primitive notions to be class, set, and "the dyadic ''relation ε'' between class and class, class and set, set and class, or set and set". Gödel 1940 ''The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis with the axioms of set theory'' appearing on pages 33ff in Volume II of ''Kurt Godel Collected Works'', Oxford University Press, NY, {{isbn|0-19-514721-9}} (v.2, pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; further modified the theory: "his primitive notions are those of set, class and membership (although membership alone is sufficient)".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from {{harvnb |Suppes  |1960 |p=12}} footnote. He also references "a paper by R. M. Robinson [1937] [that] provides a simplified system close to von Neumann's original one".&lt;/ref&gt; This axiomatization is now known as [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].

===Bourbaki 1939===
In 1939, [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], in addition to giving the well-known ordered pair definition of a function as a certain subset of the cartesian product E x F, gave the following:

"Let E and F be two sets, which may or may not be distinct. A relation between a variable element x of E and a variable element y of F is called a functional relation in y if, for all x ∈ E, there exists a unique y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x.
"We give the name of function to the operation which in this way associates with every element x ∈ E the element y ∈ F which is in the given relation with x, and the function is said to be determined by the given functional relation. Two equivalent functional relations determine the same function."

==Since 1950==

===Notion of "function" in contemporary set theory===
Both axiomatic and naive forms of Zermelo's set theory as modified by Fraenkel (1922) and Skolem (1922) ''define'' "function" as a relation, ''define'' a relation as a set of ordered pairs, and ''define'' an ordered pair as a set of two "dissymetric" sets.

While the reader of {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} ''Axiomatic Set Theory'' or {{harvtxt |Halmos |1970}} ''Naive Set Theory'' observes the use of function-symbolism in the ''axiom of separation'', e.g., φ(x) (in Suppes) and S(x) (in Halmos), they will see no mention of "proposition" or even "first order predicate calculus". In their place are "''expressions'' of the object language", "atomic formulae", "primitive formulae", and "atomic sentences".

{{harvtxt |Kleene |1952}} defines the words as follows: "In word languages, a proposition is expressed by a sentence. Then a 'predicate' is expressed by an incomplete sentence or sentence skeleton containing an open place. For example, "___ is a man" expresses a predicate ... The predicate is a ''propositional function of one variable''. Predicates are often called 'properties' ... The predicate calculus will treat of the logic of predicates in this general sense of 'predicate', i.e., as propositional function".{{sfn |Kleene |1952 |pp=143–145}}

In 1954, Bourbaki, on p.&amp;nbsp;76 in Chapitre II of Theorie des Ensembles (theory of sets), gave a definition of a function as a triple ''f'' = (''F'', ''A'', ''B'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements de Mathematique,Theorie des Ensembles |author=N.Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |publisher=Hermann &amp; cie |page=76 |year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here ''F'' is a ''functional graph'', meaning a set of pairs where no two pairs have the same first member.  On p.&amp;nbsp;77 (''op. cit.'') Bourbaki states (literal translation): "Often we shall use, in the remainder of this Treatise, the word ''function'' instead of ''functional graph''."

{{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}} in ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', formally defines a ''relation'' (p.&amp;nbsp;57) as a set of pairs, and a ''function'' (p.&amp;nbsp;86) as a relation where no two pairs have the same first member.

===Relational form of a function===
The reason for the disappearance of the words "propositional function" e.g., in {{harvtxt |Suppes |1960}}, and {{harvtxt |Halmos |1970}}, is explained by {{harvtxt |Tarski |1946}} together with further explanation of the terminology:
:"An expression such as ''x is an integer'', which contains variables and, on replacement of these variables by constants becomes a sentence, is called a SENTENTIAL [i.e., propositional cf his index] FUNCTION. But mathematicians, by the way, are not very fond of this expression, because they use the term "function" with a different meaning. ... sentential functions and sentences composed entirely of mathematical symbols (and not words of everyday language), such as: ''x + y = 5'' are usually referred to by mathematicians as FORMULAE. In place of "sentential function" we shall sometimes simply say "sentence" – but only in cases where there is no danger of any misunderstanding".{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=5}}
For his part Tarski calls the relational form of function a "FUNCTIONAL RELATION or simply a FUNCTION".{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=98}} After a discussion of this "functional relation" he asserts that:
:"The concept of a function which we are considering now differs essentially from the concepts of a sentential [propositional] and of a designatory function .... Strictly speaking ... [these] do not belong to the domain of logic or mathematics; they denote certain categories of expressions which serve to compose logical and mathematical statements, but they do not denote things treated of in those statements... . The term "function" in its new sense, on the other hand, is an expression of a purely logical character; it designates a certain type of things dealt with in logic and mathematics."{{sfn |Tarski |1946 |p=102}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights City initiative emerged from the global [[human rights movement]], and it reflects efforts of activist groups to improve respect for human rights principles by governments and other powerful actors who operate at the local/community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]] as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy [[Civil and political rights|civil and political human rights]].

Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as “One whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.”&lt;ref&gt;''Human Rights Learning and Human Rights Cities: Achievements Report''.

== History of the Human Rights Cities movement ==
The Human Rights City initiative is the result of long-standing efforts of popular groups to defend and promote human rights, and thus represents an aspect of [[Human rights movement#Global human rights struggles|global human rights struggles]].

===Origins: From the Right to the City to the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning===

Contemporary human rights city initiatives grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of [[Urban Decay#urban problems|urban problems]] affecting peoples’ everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in places around the world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the “[[right to the city]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The ‘Right to the City’ in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements|last = Meyer|first = Margit|date = 2009|journal = City|doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 13|issue = 2-3|pages = 362–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Harvey]], “to invoke rights to the city means ‘to claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over the ways in which our cities are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rebel Cities: From the Right to the City to the Urban Revolution|last = Harvey|first = David|publisher = Verso|year = 2012|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas inspiring this movement first emerged in the 1970s, with many influenced by [[Henri Lefebvre|Henri Lefebvre’s]] 1968 book, ''Le Droit à la ville''. The movement has expanded and gained momentum around the world since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proliferation of [[Global Financial Crisis#global financial crises|global financial crises]], urban [[austerity]], and [[environmental damage]] has contributed to the rise of a growing number of cities around the world that are referring more explicitly to international human rights in their policies, statements, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Austerity Urbanism: The Neoliberal Crisis of American Cities|last = Peck|first = Jamie|publisher = Rosa Luxemburg Foundation|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/austerity-urbanism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formally named “Human Rights Cities” initiative was launched by the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), which was formerly known as People’s Decade for Human Rights Education, in the wake of the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna, Austria. The initiative aims to mobilize people in communities to “pursue a community-wide dialogue and to launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on human rights norms and standards.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights Cities: Civic Engagement for Societal Development|last = Marks|first = Stephen P.|publisher = People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning &amp; UN Habitat|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Modrowski|last3 = Lichem|first2 = Kathleen A.|first3 = Walther|url = http://www.pdhre.org/Human_Rights_Cities_Book.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is different from the traditional way that human rights are enforced and applied because of its emphasis on popular education, engagement, and culture as a necessary complement to government enforcement.

Human Rights Cities have grown in part because of the enhanced efforts by international agencies like [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Habitat]] to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of urban problems, including a lack of [[affordable housing]], [[traffic congestion]] and [[Human Security#insufficient public services|insufficient public services]]. Cities have looked to international forums like the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Conferences on Human Settlements]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Human Rights Cities international consolidation (1998 - today)===
[[File:Korea-Gwangju 5392-06.JPG|thumb|336x336px|The city of [[Gwangju]] has been a pioneer in the implementation of the human rights cities framework in [[South Korea]]n and Asia, and has coorganized since 2011 the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].]]
1998 would suppose a breakthrough for the human rights movement both in terms of institutional consolidation as well as global outreach. At the European level, the Barcelona [[Conference Cities for Human Rights]] gathered more than 400 hundred local authorities uniting their voice and calling for a stronger political acknowledgment as key actors in safeguarding human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/european-charter |website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference process would culminate in 2 years after in the French city of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]]&lt;!--Most likely Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis - which is not a city--&gt; by the adoption of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] (2000). By the same time, the movement of human rights cities was also taking ground in Asia, as regional civil society organizations were about to launch the [[Asia Human Rights Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia Human Rights Charter |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/sites/default/files/Asian%20Human%20Rights%20Charter%20%281998%29.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gwangju]], 1998). Both charters would highlight the increasing role of local actors in promoting human rights as a way to reinforce local democracy and the place of human rights in the city in an increasingly urbanized world.

After the establishment of [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] as the first Human Rights City back in 1997, other local authorities in South America effectively embraced the human rights-based approach by placing a special emphasis on its link with the notion of [[right to the city]]. In 2001, the [[City Statute|City Statue]] of Brazil offered a renewed framework for promoting human rights and the social function of the city at a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/1947|title=The City Statute of Brazil: A Commentary {{!}} Cities Alliance|date=2011-08-09|website=www.citiesalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico City]] is also among the pioneers in the development of the human rights cities notion: in the last decade, it has promoted the [[Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hic-gs.org/content/Mexico_Charter_R2C_2010.pdf|title=Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City|last=|first=|date=|website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; created mechanisms to monitor human rights at the local level and adopted a new constitution specifically based on the human rights approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2017/02/04/ciudad-de-mexico-aprueba-su-primera-constitucion-y-estrena-nuevos-poderes/|title=Ciudad de México aprueba su primera constitución y estrena nuevos poderes|last=Linares|first=Marina Franco y Albinson|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Bogotá]] was also at the forefront in the implementation of the human rights approach, with the implementation of the [[Bogotá Humana]] policy (2013-2016) which took a specific emphasis on the rights of homeless people, women and elderly population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elespectador.com/opinion/opinion/el-adios-de-gustavo-petro-y-la-bogota-humana-columna-607861|title=El adiós de Gustavo Petro y la Bogotá Humana|date=2015-12-27|work=ELESPECTADOR.COM|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gustavopetroblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/estos-son-los-colegios-de-la-bogota-humana-una-politica-educativa-que-es-hito-mundial/comment-page-1/|title=Estos son los colegios de la Bogota Humana, Una política educativa que es hito mundial.|date=2016-07-04|work=Gustavo Petro Blog|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/rights-approach-through-bogot%C3%A1-humana-development-plan|title=The Rights Approach through the "Bogotá Humana" Development Plan {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, [[Montreal]] was a regional pioneer with the establishment of its local [[Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/charte_mtl_fr/media/documents/charte_montrealaise_english.pdf|title=Montreal City Charter of Rights and Responsibilities|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Monreal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]] has implemented policy translates and implements locally the rights of women as defined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/implementing-un-convention-women%E2%80%99s-rights-locally|title=Implementing the UN convention on women’s rights locally {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights in the United States|Human rights organizers in United States]] have nonetheless faced particular challenges due to the role of the U.S. in the world and to the U.S. failure to ratify most major [[International human rights instruments#international human rights treaties|international human rights treaties]]. However, in the 2000s, more U.S.-based activists have been working to raise international awareness of U.S. human rights violations, including [[racial discrimination in jury selection#racial discrimination|racial discrimination]] in the criminal justice system, [[Economic, social and cultural rights#economic human rights|economic human rights]] violations, and the [[Children's rights#rights of children|rights of children]]. In 2014 residents of Detroit who were losing access to clean water brought their case to the United Nations, which sent a Special Rapporteur&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/SRWaterIndex.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the city and issued a statement condemning practices that inhibited residents’ [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/detroit-and-the-evaporating-right-to-running-water/381731/|title=Detroit and the Evaporating Right to Running Water|last=Graham|first=David A.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue and others have encouraged more U.S. cities, including Baltimore Maryland, Mountain View California,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2015/07/19/dispute-over-human-rights-measure-in-mountain-view&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia South Carolina, to consider the human rights city model.

Throughout the last years, several examples around the world show a deepening on the concept and implications of human rights cities. In South Korea, Gwangju pioneered the establishment of a human rights municipal system (2009)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whrcf.org/E_index.php|title=세계인권도시포럼|last=세계인권도시포럼|website=www.whrcf.org|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was quickly followed by cities such as [[Seoul]] (2012)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/news/latest-news/seoul-municipal-government-division-works-mainstream-rights-approach-local-public|title=In Seoul, a municipal government division works to mainstream the rights approach in local public action {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Busan]]. Gwangju has also been the main organizer of a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]] that has gathered hundreds of human rights cities on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/international-meetings/World-Human-Rights-Cities-Forum-of-Gwangju|title=World Human Rights Cities Forum (WHRCF) of Gwangju, South Korea {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All around Europe, cities such as Barcelona, [[Madrid]], [[Graz]] or [[Utrecht]] have established mechanisms to guarantee human rights and monitor their responsibilities under international human rights standards. Particular examples in this regard can be found in local government measures such as Barcelona’s “City of Rights” programme (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/premsa/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MesuraGovernBCDrets.pdf|title=Mesura de govern "Barcelona Ciutat de Drets"|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Barcelona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid’s “Strategic Plan for Human Rights Cities” (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diario.madrid.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PlanDDHH_PDF.pdf|title=Plan Estratégico de Derechos Humanos de Madrid|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Madrid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cities and international law ==
All [[international human rights law]] is based in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of customary international law, and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation in the implementation of international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of local and regional authorities. They too are bound by these agreements. Local and regional authorities are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Margit | year = 2009 | title = The 'Right to the City' in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements | url = | journal = City | volume = 13 | issue = 2-3| pages = 362–74 | doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

How cities implement human rights ideals varies from city to city. This allows for each city to develop a plan that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ips-dc.org/human_rights_city_toolkit/|title = Human Rights City Toolkit|date = March 2009|access-date = 2016-02-23|website = Institute for Policy Studies|publisher = |last = Karen|first = Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

San Francisco is another such example, since its 1998 adoption of a city ordinance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the principles of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. The San Francisco example has helped shape work by activists organizing a “Cities for CEDAW”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Human Rights Council on the "role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights" ===
In the last years, the advance of the human rights cities movement has been assessed by several resolutions and statements of international organizations such as the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] or the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/local-and-regional-authorities-speeches/-/asset_publisher/igylP6fCBzxu/content/respecting-and-fulfilling-human-rights-at-the-local-level?inheritRedirect=false&amp;desktop=true|title=Respecting and fulfilling human rights at the local level|work=Commissioner for Human Rights|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in this regard was the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Advisory Committee|Advisory Committee]] Report A/HRC/30/49 on the “Role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/AdvisoryCommittee/Pages/LocalGovernmentAndHR.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} AdvisoryCommittee Local government and human rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed local governments responsibilities in the light of international human rights law, but most importantly, emphasized the opportunities posed by the human rights cities movement in promoting and protecting human rights due to their close relation with the needs and aspirations of city inhabitants. The Report promoted local governments participation in the drafting of national human rights strategies, and called to secure the necessary powers and financial resources for local administration to be able to comply with their human rights responsibilities. It enshrined as best practices the initiatives of various local governments and promoted networking as a way to advance the human rights cities movement, including some examples and best practices such as the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju]] or the [[Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/advocacy|title=International advocacy: Local governments are key for the promotion and the protection of human rights {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=Local authorities are close to citizens’ everyday needs and they deal with human right issues on an everyday basis. Therefore, there exists a clear and strong connection between human rights and local government. When performing their functions, local authorities take decisions relating in particular to education, housing, health, the environment, and law and order, which are directly connected with the implementation of human rights and which may enforce or weaken the possibilities of its inhabitants to enjoy their human rights. Furthermore, local government is always facing the risk of discriminatory practices against perceived outsiders, such as immigrants or ethnic minorities, to the local community.

}}The 2015 Report has received an intense follow up by the Human Rights Council constituency and other international and local governments organizations working for the advance of the human rights cities movement. As the world representative of local and regional governments, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] has for instance presented various statements to the Council and shared the Report’s recommendations among its constituency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2016, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution (A/HRC/RES/33/8) “Recognizing the role of local government in the promotion and protection of human rights” and that “given its proximity to people and being at the grass-roots level, one of the important functions of local government is to provide public services that address local needs and priorities related to the realization of human rights at the local level”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session33/Pages/ResDecStat.aspx|title=OHCHR - Session 33: Resolutions, decisions and President’s statements|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2017, the same Council organized an intersessional panel discussion on the Report and the most recent advances in its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/PanelRoleLocalGovernment.aspx|title=OHCHR - HRC: Panel discussion on role of local government, 4 September 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International networking and instruments ==
[[File:Meeting of cities for human rights and the right to the city (Madrid).jpg|thumb|334x334px|The city of Madrid held in 2017 an international  meeting of cities for human rights and the right to the city]]
Work by international human rights activists and by policymakers in the United Nations has helped spread ideas about how city governments can improve human rights implementation. In 2004, UNESCO helped establish the International Coalition of Cities against Racism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/fight-against-discrimination/coalition-of-cities/|title=International Coalition of Cities against Racism {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help municipal leaders exchange ideas and improve policies to fight [[racism]], [[discrimination]], [[xenophobia]] and [[social exclusion#exclusion|exclusion]]. The European Coalition of Cities against Racism (ECCAR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/|title=ECCAR|website=ECCAR|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of that effort, and it now has more than 104 municipalities in its membership and has adopted a ten-point action plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/10-point-plan-action|title=10 Points Action Plan|last=|website=ECCAR|language=en|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] was created in the framework of the largest organization and world representative of local governments: [[United Cities and Local Governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/strategic-plan/background|title=Background {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee represents and facilitates the exchange between worldwide local authorities having a strong agenda on human rights ([[Mexico City]] and [[Gwangju]] were for instance two of its co-chairs in 2018). As relevant outcomes of more than 10 years of work for advancing the notion and recognition of human rights cities, the Committee has been in charge of the follow-up of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] and has created and promoted the [[Global Charter Agenda for Human Rights in the City]]. It has also carried out a strong political advocacy at a UN level for the recognition of local governments as key actors in the promotion and protection of human rights, and co-organized yearly a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].

Another relevant example in regards to concrete partnerships for advancing the human rights cities agenda are the so-called “action-research centers”. In this case, a local research center is generally at the forefront of mobilizing local authorities for the implementation of human rights at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kks.verdus.nl/upload/documents/HRC-Book.pdf|title=Human rights cities: Motivations, mechanisms and implications|last=|first=|date=|website=Kennis voor Krachtige Steden (KKS)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant examples in this regard can be found at a European&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkhumanrights.org/|title=York: Human Rights City - York Human Rights City|website=York Human Rights City|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/2016/09/lund-can-become-swedens-first-human-rights-city/|title=Lund Can Become Sweden’s First Human Rights City|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etc-graz.at/typo3/index.php?id=1011|title=ETC Graz: Human Rights City of Graz|website=www.etc-graz.at|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/netherlands-institute-of-human-rights-sim|title=Netherlands Institute of Human Rights (SIM)|date=2017-05-03|work=Utrecht University|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/our-work/project/national-human-rights-cities-alliance|title=National Human Rights Cities Alliance|date=2016-02-26|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/resources-media/pittsburgh-human-rights-city-alliance-website|title=Pittsburgh Human Rights City Alliance Website|date=2015-09-15|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; levels. One of the most advanced examples on how can a local research center scale up and become a global actor in the promotion of the human rights agenda is the [[Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law|Raoul Wallenberg Institute]]. Although being affiliated to [[Lund University]] since 1984, the Institute's outreach has nonetheless gone beyond its local or even national level, as it now carries out projects in different regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/|title=Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lambda 10 Project''' is a national [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouse]] of information pertaining to [[LGBT]] issues in [[United States|American]] [[fraternities and sororities]]. The [[organization]] works to heighten the visibility of [[Coming out|out]] members (chiefly [[university]] [[student]]s), and offers educational resources related to [[sexual orientation]] and the fraternity/sorority experience.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{Cite web | last =Kaczorowski | first =Craig | title =Fraternities and Sororities | work =glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher =glbtq, Inc. | date =2004-02-12| url =http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/fraternities,2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lambda 10 Project was founded in the autumn of 1995 at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; it is currently [[Headquarters|headquartered]] in the University's Office of Student Ethics and Anti-harassment Programs.

Among the organization's offerings are an index of [[lecture]]rs available for events; lists of [[Internet forum|forum]]s concerning LGBT "[[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]]"; and a repository of [[magazine]] articles, [[website]]s, and pertinent [[news]] stories. Working with the renowned LGBT [[publisher]] [[Alyson Publications]], '''Lambda 10''' also compiled and released three [[Anthology|anthologies]] of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] students' Greek experiences: ''Out on Fraternity Row: Personal Accounts of Being Gay in a College Fraternity'' (1998), ''Secret Sisters: Stories of Being Lesbian and Bisexual in a College Sorority'' (2001) and ''Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Lambda 10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda10.org|work=Lambda 10 Project |publisher=Campus Pride, Inc.|accessdate=2009-12-03 |title=National Clearinghouse for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Fraternity &amp; Sorority Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda 10 Project is an educational initiative of [[Campus Pride]], an [[United States|American]] national [[nonprofit]] [[501(c)(3)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] organization which serves [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) and [[straight ally|ally]] [[student]] leaders and/or [[student society|campus organization]].  It is an associate member of the [[Association of Fraternity Advisors]] and serves as a resource for the leaders of numerous national and international fraternities and sororities.

'''Liquid Fly-back Booster''' (LFBB) was a [[German Aerospace Center]]'s (DLR's) project concept to develop a [[Reusable launch system|reusable]] [[liquid rocket boosters|liquid rocket booster]] for [[Ariane 5]] in order to significantly reduce the high cost of space transportation and increase [[Environmentally friendly|environmental friendliness]].&lt;ref name="Satellitenkatapult"/&gt; LFBB would replace existing [[solid rocket booster]]s, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an [[atmospheric entry]], fly back autonomously to the [[French Guiana]], and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.

Additionally a family of derivative launch vehicles was proposed in order to take an advantage of [[economies of scale]], further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] and [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Arianespace Soyuz]], the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit,&lt;ref name=near70/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt;{{rp|15}} and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.

German Aerospace Center studied Liquid Fly-back Boosters as a part of future launcher research program from 1999 to 2004. After the cancellation of the project, publications at DLR continued until 2009.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) studied potential future launch vehicles of the [[European Union]] under the ''Ausgewählte Systeme und Technologien für Raumtransport'' ([[ASTRA program|ASTRA]]; English: Systems and Technologies for Space Transportation Applications) programme from 1999 to 2005, with additional studies continuing until 2009.&lt;ref name="Satellitenkatapult"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.astronews.com/news/artikel/2007/04/0704-003.shtml|title=Sonnensegel und Satellitenkatapult|language=DE|publisher=astronews.com|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt; The LFBB design was one of two projects within the ASTRA program, the other being [[Phoenix RLV]].&lt;ref name="SART"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6639/11294_read-25975/|title=Space Launcher Systems Analysis (SART)|publisher=DLR|accessdate=9 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330043102/http://www.dlr.de/irs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6639/11294_read-25975/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RLVSdesign"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2002-5220.pdf|title=Progress in the Design of a Reusable Launch Vehicle Stage|format=PDF|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|via=[[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR)|year=2012|accessdate=9 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110171054/http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2002-5220.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DLRsiteLFBBmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7582/12834_read-32243/ |title=Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) |publisher=DLR |accessdate=9 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050518/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7582/12834_read-32243/ |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, scale models were constructed for testing various configurations in DLR's [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] ''Trisonische Messstrecke Köln'' (TMK; English: Trisonic measuring section at [[Cologne]]) and in their ''Hyperschallwindkanal 2 Köln'' (H2K; English: [[Hypersonic speed|Hypersonic]] wind canal at Cologne) [[wind tunnel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gülhan |first=Ali |year=2008 |title=RESPACE - Key Technologies for Reusable Space Systems |location=[[Cologne]] |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |page=20,22,26 |isbn=978-3-540-77819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2003-7056.pdf|title=Experimental studies on a Liquid Fly-Back-Booster configuration (LFBB) in wind tunnels|format=PDF|page=4,5|publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]|date=December 2003|accessdate=21 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610105732/http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2003-7056.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done by the companies [[EADS Space Transportation]] and [[MAN SE|MAN]].&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

The advantages of reusable boosters include simplicity from using only one type of fuel, environmental friendliness, and lower reoccurring costs. Studies concluded that reusable fly-back boosters would be the most affordable and the least risky way for European space launch systems to start becoming reusable. These fly-back boosters had the potential to reduce launch costs. However, when other projects, such as [[Space Shuttle]] or [[VentureStar]], undertook this objective, they failed to meet their goals. Supporting technologies needed for LFBB construction can be developed within 10 years, and additional launchers can be developed based on fly-back boosters to minimise costs and provide maintenance synergy across multiple classes of launch vehicles.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt; 

Eventually, the hardware grew too large and the LFBB project was scrapped, with one member of the French space agency ([[CNES]]) remarking:

{{quote|The thing that shocked me was that at the beginning, this reusable flyback booster was just a cylinder with engines and little wings, just a turbo fan in the back. And three years later these were complete Airbuses in terms of size with four engines in each of them.|Christophe Bonnal, [[CNES]] launcher directorate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/nasa-cnes-warn-spacex-challenges-flying-reusable-falcon-9-rocket|title=French Debris-mitigation Law Could Pose Issue for Arianespace|publisher=Aviation Week|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Description ==
[[Image:LFBB line drawing plain.svg|thumb|400px|A line drawing of DLR's LFBB, showing top, front, and side views|alt=A line drawing of DLR's liquid fly-back booster, showing top, front, and side views]]The overall concept of the liquid boosters in the LFBB programme was to retain the Ariane 5's core and upper [[Multistage rocket|stages]], along with the [[payload fairing]]s, and replace its [[solid rocket booster]]s (EAP P241, from French ''Étages d’Accélération à Poudre'') with reusable [[liquid rocket booster]]s. These boosters would provide the main thrust during take-off. After separation, they would return to a [[spaceport]] in [[French Guiana]] for landing. This vertical take-off, horizontal landing ([[VTHL]]) mode of operation would allow liquid fly-back boosters to continue operating from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], thus avoiding any major changes to the ascend profile of Ariane 5. Launch vehicle payload performance of the [[Cryogenic fuel|Cryogenic]] Evolution type-A (ECA) variant would increase from {{convert|10500|kg|abbr = on}} to {{convert|12300|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elib.dlr.de/64860/1/RC-56-LFBB.pdf|title=Wiederverwendbare Boosterstufen für Ariane 5|trans-title=Reusable booster stages for Ariane 5|language=DE|publisher=Raumfahrt Concret|date=January 2009|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|214}}

In the reference design, each LFBB consists of three engines installed in a circular arrangement at the [[aft]] of the vehicle. Each engine is a [[Vulcain]] engine with reduced [[expansion ratio]]. An additional three [[turbofan]] [[air-breathing engine]]s, installed in the [[nose cone|nose]] section, provide power for fly-back. The [[fuselage]] is {{convert|41|m|abbr = on}} long, with an outer tank diameter of {{convert|5.45|m|abbr = on}}, specifically designed to match the existing Ariane 5 core stage and to reduce manufacturing costs. A [[low-wing]] [[V tail|V-tail]] [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] configuration was selected,&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt; with a [[wingspan]] of approximately {{convert|21|m|abbr = on}} and an area of {{Convert|115|m2|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name=near70/&gt; The [[aerofoil]] was based on a [[transonic]] profile from the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE 2822). The [[gross lift-off mass]] (GLOW) of each booster is {{convert|222.5|t|ST}}, with {{convert|54|t|ST}} upon separation and {{convert|46.2|t|ST}} dry mass. In comparison, the GLOW for EAP P241 is {{convert|273|t|ST}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-bc3ae811-c581-3b79-b123-8acfded8f087|title=Long-term/strategic scenario for reusable booster stages|first1=Martin|last1=Sippel|first2=Chiara|last2=Manfletti|first3=Holger|last3=Burkhardt|work=[[Acta Astronautica]]|issue=58|publisher=[[Elsevier]]| pages=209–221| doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2005.09.012| issn=0094-5765| publication-date=2006|date=28 September 2005|bibcode=2006AcAau..58..209S}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209,210,214}}

The booster was designed to have four independent propulsion systems, the first of which – main rocket propulsion – would be based on three [[Gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] [[Vulcain]] engines fueled by {{convert|168500|kg|abbr = on}} of propellant. Second, [[Eurojet EJ200]] fly-back turbofan engines would be propelled with hydrogen to reduce fuel mass. Further, ten {{Convert|2|kN|abbr = on}} thrusters placed on each side of the vehicle would be used by the [[reaction control system]]. Finally, the fourth propulsion system would be based on solid rocket motors that separate the boosters from the core stage. An up-scaled version of the motors used in existing EAP boosters would be mounted in the attachment ring and inside the wing's main structure.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|211,212}}

A typical mission profile would begin with the ignition of a main stage and both boosters, followed by an acceleration to {{Convert|2|km/s|abbr = on}} and then a separation at the altitude of {{Convert|50|km|abbr = on}}. As the main stage continues its flight into orbit, the boosters follow a [[ballistic trajectory]], reaching an altitude of {{Convert|90|-|100|km|abbr = on}}. After low-energy [[atmospheric entry]], the boosters reach denser layers of the atmosphere where they perform a [[Banked turn#Banked turn in aeronautics|banking turn]] toward the target airfield. Gliding continues until they achieve an altitude that is optimal for engaging turbofan engines and entering [[cruise flight]]. At this point, about {{Convert|550|km|abbr = on}} from the launch point, the boosters would be flying over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The cruise back to the airport requires about {{convert|3650|kg|abbr = on}} of hydrogen fuel and takes over two hours to complete. An undercarriage is deployed and each booster lands autonomously. After separation, the boosters are not under threat of collision until they land due to small differences in their initial flight trajectories.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elib.dlr.de/64860/1/RC-56-LFBB.pdf|title=Wiederverwendbare Boosterstufen für Ariane 5|trans-title=Reusable booster stages for Ariane 5|language=DE|publisher=Raumfahrt Concret|date=January 2009|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|215}}

==Derivatives==

The development of liquid fly-back boosters has the potential to enable three additional space transportation systems with an objective of increasing production and creating [[economies of scale]]. The aim of the LFBB project at DLR was to reduce Ariane 5 operational costs and to develop future derivatives, including a reusable first stage of a small-to-medium launch vehicle, a super-heavy launch vehicle capable of lifting {{Convert|67|tonnes|ST}}&lt;ref name=near70&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|title=ASTRA LFBB configuration|publisher=[[German Aerospace Center]]|accessdate=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225812/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Low Earth orbit]], and a reusable [[two-stage-to-orbit]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DLR - Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme - ASTRA LFBB configuration|url = http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|website = www.dlr.de|accessdate = 30 September 2015|first = Sabine|last = Lindemann|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225812/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|archivedate = 23 September 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, LFBBs would be used only on Ariane 5. Over time, alternative configurations could phase out [[Arianespace Soyuz]] and [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]].&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|215}}

===Reusable first stage===
[[Image:LFBB RFS.svg|thumb|Top view of RFS configurations: Vega and Ariane 5 derivatives (top), large cryogenic upper stage (bottom) with the LFBB shown in blue]]
The LFBB was studied with the three upper stage composites, to attain a Reusable First Stage (RFS) configuration. The first was a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] derivative, with a [[Zefiro 23]] second stage, a [[Zefiro 9]] third stage and an AVUM upper stage. With the LFBB replacing the [[P80 (rocket stage)|P80 stage]], the payload to [[sun-synchronous orbit]] (SSO) would increase to {{convert|1882|kg|abbr = on}}, compared to the {{convert|1450|kg|abbr = on}} of the Vega. The second was an [[Ariane 4]] derivative called H-25&lt;!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source--&gt;. It was  based on an H10 upper stage with a [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci rocket engine]] and {{Convert|25|tonnes|ST}} of [[cryogenic fuel]]. Depending on the method of deceleration, the payload to SSO is between {{Convert|1481|and|2788|kg|abbr = on}}. The third was a large cryogenic upper stage, called H-185, based on an alternative, yet-to-be-developed Ariane 5 main stage with {{Convert|185|tonnes|ST}} of cryogenic fuel. Its payload to SSO is {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt;{{rp|216}}

Two of the lighter configurations (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted on top of the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above {{Convert|2|km/s|abbr = on}} to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using {{Convert|10|tonnes|ST}} of fuel and reduce the velocity by {{Convert|300|m/s|abbr = on}}. However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. Another option is to use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex. As a result, an alternative [[ballute]] was proposed. Flight dynamics simulation revealed that a ballute with a cross-section of {{Convert|45|m2|abbr = on}} offered the best compromise between loads on the booster and deceleration by aerodynamic forces. In this configuration, a launch performance of up to {{convert|2788|kg|abbr = on}} could be achieved, partly thanks to a higher separation velocity.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|216}}

The heaviest configuration uses a single booster with an asymmetrically mounted, large, expendable cryogenic stage designated H-185&lt;!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source--&gt;. It was proposed as a future variant of the Ariane 5 core stage (H158), eventually meant to phase out the main stage in a standard launch configuration with LFBB. H-185 would use a new Vulcain&amp;nbsp;3 main engine, with increased vacuum thrust. When launched with a single booster, both stages would be operated in parallel, and be delivered to a {{Convert|180 by 800|km|abbr = on}} orbit before separation. The remaining upper stage composite would weigh {{convert|7360|kg|abbr = on}}, with a {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}} payload performance to SSO. When launching to [[Low Earth orbit]], payload mass can be increased to over {{convert|10000|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|215–217}}

===Super-heavy lift launcher===
[[Image:LFBB SHLL.svg|thumb|Top view of the SHLL configuration with the LFBB shown in blue]]
The Super-Heavy Lift Launcher (SHLL) would consist of a new cryogenic main stage, five liquid fly-back boosters, and a re-ignitable injection stage. This configuration was designed to provide increased capabilities for complex missions, including manned explorations to the [[Moon exploration|Moon]] and to [[Mars exploration|Mars]], as well as the launch of large solar-powered satellites.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

The new core stage would stand {{convert|28.65|meters|abbr = on}} tall and have a diameter of {{convert|10|meters|abbr = on}}, feeding {{convert|600|tonnes|ST}} of [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] to three Vulcain&amp;nbsp;3 engines. The increased circumference of the main stage allows five LFBBs to be integrated with either retractable or [[variable geometry wing|variable-geometry wing]]s. The upper stage would be a derivative of the Ariane 5 ESC-B, with the size upped to {{convert|5.6 x 8.98|m|ft|abbr = on}}, and strengthened to bear higher loads. The [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci engine]] was proofed to be sufficiently powerful for [[orbital insertion]]. Payload would be enclosed in an {{convert|8 x 29.5|m|ft|abbr = on}} [[Payload fairing|fairing]]. The launch vehicle would have a total height of {{convert|69|meters|abbr = on}} and a [[Gross lift-off mass|mass]] of {{convert|1900|tonnes|ST}}. The payload to [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] would be {{convert|67280|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

When launched to a {{Convert|200 x 600|km|abbr = on}} Low Earth transfer orbit, the LFBBs would separate at an altitude of {{convert|51|km|abbr = on}}, at a speed of {{Convert|1.55|km/s|abbr = on}}. To avoid simultaneous separation of all boosters, either a cross-feed to the main stage, or [[Rocket engine throttling|throttling]] could be used. The return flight of the boosters would require an estimated {{convert|3250|kg|abbr = on}} of fuel, including a 30% reserve.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|218–219}}

===Two-stage-to-orbit===
[[Image:LFBB TSTO.svg|thumb|Top view of the TSTO configuration with the LFBB shown in blue]]
{{See also|Two-stage-to-orbit}}
A reusable Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle was planned to be implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|216}} However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|219}}

The external tank, being a core of the system, would have a diameter of {{convert|5.4|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|30.5|m|ft}}, carrying {{convert|167.5|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The attached orbiter would be {{convert|28.8|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|3.6|m|ft}} in diameter, carrying {{convert|50|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The payload fairing mount atop the orbiter would be {{convert|5.4 x 20.5|m|ft}}. For LEO missions, the launch vehicle would be {{convert|57.3|m|ft}} tall, with a gross lift-off mass of {{convert|739.4|tonnes|ST}}. The payload to LEO would be {{convert|12800|kg}}, with an increase to {{convert|8500|kg}} to GTO when using an expandable upper stage.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|219}}

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons at least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain, for each category, the first fifteen cases with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and at least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and at least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.
The separate articles for the different categories have more extensive lists.

''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (home intruders)]], [[List of familicides]], [[List of familicides in the United States]] and [[List of familicides in Europe]].

This section contains cases that could be considered non-public, which means mass murders perpetrated in a domestic environment. The section is divided into two sub-categories; the first encompasses the lists of familicides and contains those incidents where most of the victims were relatives of the perpetrator, while the second, paraphrased as home intruders, contains those cases where the targeted families were not related to the perpetrator.

==Vehicular homicide==
''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (vehicular homicide)]] &lt;br&gt;
This section contains those cases where only vehicles were [[Vehicle-ramming attack|used to attack people]]. Since it may be quite difficult to distinguish accidents, or cases of reckless driving from those incidents where the driver, or pilot, had the intention to harm others, only those cases are included where it is clear that the vehicle was applied as a weapon and crashed deliberately into people, other vehicles, or buildings. Also, those cases where a rampage killer used an armed vehicle, such as a tank, or a fighter aircraft, to shoot others are listed here. [[Airliner]]s are not included in this section but in [[List of rampage killers#Other incidents|other incidents]].

==Mass murders committed using grenades==
''Only the first 15 entries are shown here. For the entire list see:'' [[List of rampage killers (mass murders committed using grenades)]] &lt;br&gt;
This section lists mass murders where the perpetrator used only [[hand grenade]]s or comparable explosive devices, like [[pipe bomb]]s or [[dynamite]] sticks, for the attack. As it is sometimes difficult to distinguish cases of grenade attacks from acts of terrorism or gang-related attacks, incidents are only included where there is at least some indication that it was neither committed in the context of a political, ethnic, or religious conflict, nor part of an assault with more than one participating offender.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}} 
A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and [[Language of mathematics|language]]. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural science]]s (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[chemistry]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (such as [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]]), as well      as in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]]). 

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.

== Elements of a mathematical model ==

Mathematical models can take many forms, including [[dynamical systems]], [[statistical model]]s, [[differential equations]], or [[Game theory|game theoretic models]].  These and other types of models can overlap, with a given  model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include [[model theory|logical models]].  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments.  Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

In the [[physical sciences]], a traditional mathematical model contains most of the following elements:
# [[Governing equation|Governing equations]]
# Supplementary sub-models
## [[Defining equation (physics)|Defining equations]]
## [[Constitutive equation|Constitutive equations]]
# Assumptions and constraints
## [[Initial condition|Initial]] and [[Boundary condition|boundary conditions]]
## [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|Classical constraints]] and [[Kinematics|kinematic equations]]

== Classifications ==
Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and ''[[variable (mathematics)|variables]]''. Relationships can be described by ''[[Operator (mathematics)|operators]]'', such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc. Variables are abstractions of system [[parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] of interest, that can be [[Quantification (science)|quantified]]. Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:
* '''Linear vs. nonlinear:''' If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit [[linear]]ity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear. A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise. The definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context, and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them.  For example, in a [[Linear model|statistical linear model]], it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters, but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables.  Similarly, a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear [[differential operator]]s, but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it.  In a [[Optimization (mathematics)|mathematical programming]] model, if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by [[linear equation]]s, then the model is regarded as a linear model.  If one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] equation, then the model is known as a nonlinear model.&lt;br&gt;Nonlinearity, even in fairly simple systems, is often associated with phenomena such as [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and [[irreversibility]].  Although there are exceptions, nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones.  A common approach to nonlinear problems is [[linearization]], but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility, which are strongly tied to nonlinearity.
* '''Static vs. dynamic:''' A ''dynamic'' model  accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system, while a ''static'' (or steady-state) model calculates the system in equilibrium, and thus is time-invariant.  Dynamic models typically are represented by [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s.
* '''Explicit vs. implicit:''' If all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations, the model is said to be ''explicit''. But sometimes it is the ''output'' parameters which are known, and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure, such as [[Newton's method]] (if the model is linear) or [[Broyden's method]] (if non-linear). In such a case the model is said to be ''implicit''. For example, a [[jet engine]]'s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design [[thermodynamic cycle]] (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.
* '''Discrete vs. continuous:''' A [[discrete modeling|discrete model]] treats objects as discrete, such as the particles in a [[molecular model]] or the states in a [[statistical model]]; while a [[continuous model]] represents the objects in a continuous manner, such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows, temperatures and stresses in a solid, and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge.
* '''Deterministic vs. probabilistic (stochastic):''' A [[deterministic system|deterministic]] model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables; therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions. Conversely, in a stochastic model—usually called a "[[statistical model]]"—randomness is present, and variable states are not described by unique values, but rather by [[probability]] distributions.
* '''Deductive, inductive, or floating:''' A deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics has been criticized for unfounded models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stanislav Andreski |first=Stanislav |last=Andreski |year=1972 |title=Social Sciences as Sorcery |publisher=[[St. Martin’s Press]] |isbn=0-14-021816-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[catastrophe theory]] in science has been characterized as a floating model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Clifford Truesdell |first=Clifford |last=Truesdell |year=1984 |title=An Idiot’s Fugitive Essays on Science |pages=121–7 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-90703-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance in the natural sciences ==
Mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences, particularly in [[physics]]. Physical [[theory|theories]] are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models.

Throughout history, more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] accurately describe many everyday phenomena, but at certain limits [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]] must be used; even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Examples|date=September 2017}}. It is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits, for example relativistic mechanics reduces to Newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. Quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high. For example, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] of a tennis ball is insignificantly small, so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case.

It is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things. Massless ropes, point particles, [[ideal gases]] and the [[particle in a box]] are among the many simplified models used in physics. The laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as Newton's laws, [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. These laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations. Many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer, a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws. For example, molecules can be modeled by [[molecular orbital]] models that are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation. In [[engineering]], physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as [[finite element analysis]].

Different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe. [[Euclidean geometry]] is much used in classical physics, while [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]] are examples of theories that use [[geometry|geometries]] which are not Euclidean.

== Some applications==&lt;!--whatever this section is, it isn't background (original heading), and isn't general--&gt;
Since [[prehistory|prehistorical times]] simple models such as [[map]]s and [[Mathematical diagram|diagrams]] have been used.

Often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized, they use a mathematical model. In analysis, engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work, or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system. Similarly, in control of a system, engineers can try out different control approaches in [[simulation]]s.

A mathematical model usually describes a system by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables. Variables may be of many types; [[Real number|real]] or [[integer]] numbers, [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values or [[String (computing)|strings]], for example. The variables represent some properties of the system, for example, measured system outputs often in the form of [[Signal (electronics)|signals]], [[Chronometry|timing data]], counters, and event occurrence (yes/no). The actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables.

== Building blocks ==
In [[business]] and [[engineering]], mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output. The system under consideration will require certain inputs. The system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too: [[decision theory|decision variables]], [[state variable]]s, [[Exogeny|exogenous]] variables, and [[random variable]]s.

Decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables.  Exogenous variables are sometimes known as [[parameter]]s or [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]s.
The variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision, input, random, and exogenous variables.  Furthermore, the output variables are dependent on the state of the system (represented by the state variables).

[[Goal|Objective]]s and [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of the system and its users can be represented as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the output variables or state variables.  The [[objective function]]s will depend on the perspective of the model's user.  Depending on the context, an objective function is also known as an ''index of performance'', as it is some measure of interest to the user.  Although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have, using or optimizing the model becomes more involved (computationally) as the number increases.

For example, [[economist]]s often apply [[linear algebra]] when using [[input-output model]]s. Complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of [[vector space|vectors]] where one symbol represents several variables.

== A priori information ==
[[File:Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png|thumb|480px|To analyse something with a typical "black box approach", only  the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) ''box''. The usual representation of this ''black box system''  is a [[data flow diagram]] centered in the box.]]

Mathematical modeling problems are often classified into [[black box]] or [[White box (software engineering)|white box]] models, according to how much [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]] information on the system is available. A black-box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available. A white-box model (also called glass box or clear box) is a system where all necessary information is available. Practically all systems are somewhere between the black-box and white-box models, so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take.

Usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate. Therefore, the white-box models are usually considered easier, because if you have used the information correctly, then the model will behave correctly. Often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables. For example, if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system, we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an [[exponential decay|exponentially decaying]] function. But we are still left with several unknown parameters; how rapidly does the medicine amount decay, and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood? This example is therefore not a completely white-box model. These parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model.

In black-box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions. Using a priori information we could end up, for example, with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately. If there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models. An often used approach for black-box models are [[artificial neural network|neural networks]] which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data. Alternatively the NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous inputs) algorithms which were developed as part of [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. (2013), ''Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains'', Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to select the model terms, determine the model structure, and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise. The advantage of NARMAX models compared to neural networks is that NARMAX produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process, whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque.

=== Subjective information ===
Sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model.  This can be done based on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[experience]], or [[expert opinion]], or based on convenience of mathematical form.  [[Bayesian statistics]] provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis: we specify a [[prior probability distribution]] (which can be subjective), and then update this distribution based on empirical data.

An example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once, recording whether it comes up heads, and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads.  After bending the coin, the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown; so the experimenter would need to make a decision (perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin) about what prior distribution to use.  Incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability.

== Complexity ==
In general, model complexity involves a trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the model.  [[Occam's razor]] is a principle particularly relevant to modeling, its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power, the simplest one is the most desirable.  While added complexity usually improves the realism of a model, it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze, and can also pose computational problems, including [[numerical instability]].  [[Thomas Kuhn]] argues that as science progresses, explanations tend to become more complex before a [[paradigm shift]] offers radical simplification {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

For example, when modeling the flight of an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[classical mechanics]] is an approximated model of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the [[speed of light]], and we study macro-particles only.

== Training and tuning ==
Any model which is not pure white-box contains some [[parameter]]s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe. If the modeling is done by an [[artificial neural network]] or other [[machine learning]], the optimization of parameters is called ''training''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Why|date=September 2017}}, while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called ''tuning'' and often uses [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. In more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions, parameters are often determined by ''[[curve fitting]]''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

== Model evaluation ==
A crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately.  This question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation.

=== Fit to empirical data ===
Usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data.  In models with parameters, a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets: training data and verification data. The training data are used to estimate the model parameters.  An accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model's parameters. This practice is referred to as [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] in statistics.

Defining a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit.  In statistics, decision theory, and some [[economic model]]s, a [[loss function]] plays a similar role.

While it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters, it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model.  In general, more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of [[statistical model]]s than models involving [[differential equations]].  Tools from [[non-parametric statistics]] can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model's mathematical form.

=== Scope of the model ===
Assessing the scope of a model, that is, determining what situations the model is applicable to, can be less straightforward.  If the model was constructed based on a set of data, one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a "typical" set of data.

The question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called [[interpolation]], and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called [[extrapolation]].

As an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model, in evaluating Newtonian [[classical mechanics]], we can note that Newton made his measurements without advanced equipment, so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light.  Likewise, he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles, but macro particles only. It is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains, even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics.

=== Philosophical considerations ===
Many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about [[causality]].  This is usually (but not always) true of models involving differential equations.  As the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world, the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations, but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model. One can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions. One can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied.

An example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of [[optimal foraging theory]] do not offer insight that goes beyond the common-sense conclusions of [[evolution]] and other basic principles of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyke | first1 = G. H. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515 | title = Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 15 | pages = 523–575 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* One of the popular examples in [[computer science]] is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s.

[[File:DFAexample.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[state diagram]] for ''M'']]
''M'' = (''Q'', Σ, δ, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F'') where
*''Q'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;},
*Σ = {0, 1},
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
*''F'' = {''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}, and
*δ is defined by the following [[state transition table]]:
:{| border="1" cell padding="1" cell spacing="0"
| || &lt;center&gt;'''0'''&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;'''1'''&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

The state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, ''M'' will finish in state ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.

The language recognized by ''M'' is the [[regular language]] given by the [[regular expression]] 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the [[Kleene star]], e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1".

* Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical [[map projection]] of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface  is a model&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landinfo.com/resources_dictionaryMP.htm landinfo.com, definition of map projection]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel.
* Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as [[dead reckoning]] when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallistel |first= |title=The Organization of Learning |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1990 |ISBN=0-262-07113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whishaw | first1 = I.

* ''[[Population]] Growth''. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the [[Malthusian growth model]]. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the [[logistic function]], and its extensions. 
* ''Model of a particle  in a potential-field''. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function &lt;math&gt;V\!:\mathbb{R}^3\!\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the trajectory, that is a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\!:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, is the solution of the [[differential equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt; -\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}m=\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial x}\mathbf{\hat{x}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial y}\mathbf{\hat{y}}+\frac{\partial V[\mathbf{r}(t)]}{\partial z}\mathbf{\hat{z}}, &lt;/math&gt;

that can be written also as:

::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=-\nabla V[\mathbf{r}(t)]. &lt;/math&gt;

:Note this model assumes  the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion.

* ''Model of rational behavior for a consumer''.  In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of ''n'' commodities labeled 1,2,...,''n'' each with a market price ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The consumer is assumed to have an [[ordinal utility]] function ''U'' (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed.  The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget ''M'' which is used to purchase a vector ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in such a way as to maximize ''U''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem, that is:
:: &lt;math&gt; \max U(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:: subject to:
:: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i \leq M.&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; x_{i} \geq 0   \; \; \; \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \} &lt;/math&gt;
: This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in [[general equilibrium theory]] to show existence and [[Pareto efficiency]] of economic equilibria.

In [[digital electronics]], [[analogue electronics]] and [[entertainment]], the [[user interface]] of media may include '''media controls''' or '''player controls''', to enact and change or adjust the process of watching [[film]] or listening to [[Sound|audio]]. These widely known symbols can be found in a multitude of software products, exemplifying what is known as [[dominant design]].

==Symbols==
[[File:Logitech G15 Media Keys.jpg|thumb|A multimedia keyboard with play, pause, stop, skip next and skip back buttons]]
These are common icons on [[data storage device|physical devices]] and [[application software]]. They are commonly found on [[portable media player]]s, [[videocassette recorder|VCRs]], [[DVD player]]s, [[Phonograph|record players]], [[remote control]]s, [[Cassette deck|tape players]] and [[multimedia keyboard]]s. Their application is described in [[ISO/IEC 18035]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/IEC 18035:2003 Information technology -- Icon symbols and functions for controlling multimedia software applications|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/30820.html|website=International Organization for Standardization|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=27 January 2018|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The main symbols date back to the 1960s, with the Pause symbol having reportedly been invented at [[Ampex]] during that decade for use on [[reel-to-reel]] audio recorder controls, due to the difficulty of translating the word "pause" into some languages used in foreign markets.  The Pause symbol was designed as a variation on the existing square Stop symbol and was intended to evoke the concept of an interruption or "stutter stop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin of play, stop, pause, etc. buttons? - Straight Dope Message Board |url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=493618 |date=2015-04-03 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Secret Histories of Those @#$%ing Computer Symbols |url=https://gizmodo.com/5612630/the-secret-histories-of-those-ing-computer-symbols |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
=== Consumer products ===
In popular culture, the play triangle is arguably the most widely used of the media control symbols. In many ways, the symbol has become synonymous with music culture and more broadly the digital download era. As such, there are now a multitude of items such as T-shirts, posters, and tattoos that feature this symbol. Similar cultural references can be observed with the [[Power symbol]] which is especially popular among video gamers and technology enthusiasts.

=== Branding ===
Media symbols can be found on an array of advertisements, from live music venues to streaming services. In 2012, Google rebranded its digital download store to [[Google Play]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/introducing-google-play-all-your.html|title=Introducing Google Play: All your entertainment, anywhere you go|website=Official Google Blog|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a play symbol in its logo.  The play symbol also serves as a logo for the Google-owned video sharing site [[YouTube]] since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16216868/new-youtube-logo-redesign-font-color-app-design|title=YouTube has a new look and, for the first time, a new logo|work=The Verge|access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use on appliances and other mechanical devices ==
[[File:Washing machine Media Symbols.jpg|thumb|A washing machine with an illuminated ►❚❚ symbol.]]
In recent years, there has been a proliferation of devices that use media symbols in order to represent the Run/Stop/Pause functions. Likewise, user interface programing pertaining to these functions has also been influenced by that of media players. For example, some washers and dryers with a common illuminated play/pause button are programmed so that when the appliance is off, the play/pause light stays off.  When the device is running the light stays on, and when the washer/dryer is in a paused state, the button flashes. This type of programing is similar to that of earlier CD players, which are also set to flash in this manner in the pause state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.sony.com/release/deg3.pdf|title=Sony Portable CD Player Operating Instructions (Page 7)|last=|first=|date=|website=Sony.com|publisher=Sony Corporation|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from appliances, there are many other instances when run/stop/pause functionality is needed and media symbols could theoretically  be used instead of or in addition to words. In recent years, some exercise machine manufactures have chosen to do this. A notable difference in the use of these symbols on exercise equipment is that these machines usually contain an emergency stop button. Typically, this function is denoted with a red octagonal stop sign symbol, as opposed to a square, when the button may also be used for emergencies.

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}
The '''Minkowski diagram''', also known as a '''spacetime diagram''', was developed in 1908 by [[Hermann Minkowski]] and provides an illustration of the properties of space and time in the [[special theory of relativity]]. It allows a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] without mathematical equations.

Minkowski diagrams are two-dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a [[universe]] consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance will be displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space [[units of measurement]] are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45° angle to the diagram's axes.

In this way, each object, like an observer or a vehicle, traces a certain line in the diagram, which is called its [[world line]]. Also, each point in the diagram represents a certain position in space and time, and is called an '''event''', regardless of whether anything relevant happens there.

== Basics ==
=== Position versus time graphs ===
[[File:Distance-time graph example.svg|thumb]]
In the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are position vs. time graphs? |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/a/position-vs-time-graphs |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66&amp;nbsp;m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed.

=== Spacetime diagrams ===
At its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in STR, the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light {{mvar|c}}, and thus are often labeled by {{mvar|ct.}} This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from &lt;''Time''&gt; to &lt;''Length''&gt;, in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled {{mvar|x.}}

=== Standard configuration ===
[[File:Standard configuration of coordinate systems.svg|thumb|Galilean diagram of two frames of reference in standard configuration.]]

To ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different [[Inertial frame of reference|reference frames]], compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two  [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced "S&amp;nbsp;prime"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ±''v'' are said to be in ''standard configuration'', when:
* The ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.
* Frame S′ moves in the ''x''-direction of frame S with a constant velocity ''v'' as measured in frame S.
* The origins of frames S and S′ coincide for time ''t'' = 0 in frame S and ''t''′ = 0 in frame S′.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Most Incomprehensible Thing: Notes Towards a Very Gentle Introduction to the Mathematics of Relativity|last1=Collier|first1=Peter|publisher=Incomprehensible Books|year=2017|isbn=9780957389465|edition=3rd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}}

This spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities ''t'' and ''t'''.

In a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing ''x'' and ''ct'' to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above.

=== Minkowski diagrams ===
The term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity.  The term is used in both a generic and particular sense. In general, a Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of [[Minkowski space]], usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the [[light cone]] at an event consists of the lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one through that event.&lt;ref&gt;Mermin (1968) Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of ''simultaneous events'' for a stationary observer at the origin.

A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a [[Lorentz transformation]]. The Lorentz transformation relates two [[inertial frames of reference]], where an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] stationary at the event {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} makes a change of [[velocity]] along the {{math|''x''}}-axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle {{math|''α''}} with the previous time axis, with {{math|''α'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|4}}}} (see the first figure on the right). In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by {{math|''α''}} to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new {{math|''x''}}-axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the [[Minkowski inner product]] or ''relativistic dot product''.

Whatever the magnitude of {{mvar|α}}, the line {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''x''}} forms the universal&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vladimir Karapetoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bisection|bisector]].

The space and time [[units of measurement]] on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:
* Units of 30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s
* [[Astronomical unit]]s and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds (500 seconds)
* [[Light year]]s and [[year]]s
* [[Light-second]] and second

This way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes.

== Spacetime diagrams in Newtonian physics ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - Newtonian physics.svg|thumb|right|256px|In Newtonian physics for both observers the event at A is assigned to the same point in time.]]
The black axes labelled {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''ct''}} on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}. This observer's world line is identical with the {{math|''ct''}} time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed {{math|''v''}} to the right, such as a moving observer.

This blue line labelled {{math|''ct''′}} may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the {{math|''x''}} axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not [[perpendicular]] to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off.

Determining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since {{math|1=''t'' =  0}}. Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the {{math|''x''}} axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''t''′}}, modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called [[Galilean transformation]].

:*Various English translations on Wikisource: [[s:Space and Time|Space and Time]]&lt;/ref&gt; Space and time have properties which lead to different rules for the translation of coordinates in case of moving observers. In particular, events which are estimated to happen simultaneously from the viewpoint of one observer, happen at different times for the other.

In the Minkowski diagram this [[relativity of simultaneity]] corresponds with the introduction of a separate &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; for the moving observer. Following the rule described above, each observer interprets all events on a line parallel to his &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis as simultaneous. The sequence of events from the viewpoint of an observer can be illustrated graphically by shifting this line in the diagram from bottom to top.

If {{math|''ct''}} instead of {{math|''t''}} is assigned on the time axes, the angle {{math|''α''}} between the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}} axes will be identical with that between the time axes {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''ct''′}}. This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle {{math|''α''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanics and Thermodynamics |edition=illustrated |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Demtröder |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27877-3 |page=92-93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 Extract of page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha)=\frac{v}{c}=\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:MinkScale.svg|thumb|right|256px|Different scales on the axes.]]
The corresponding translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the [[Lorentz transformation]]. Whatever space and time axes arise through such transformation, in a Minkowski diagram they correspond to [[conjugate diameters]] of a pair of [[hyperbola]]s. The scales on the axes are given as follows: If {{math|''U''}} is the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''x''′}} is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jürgen |last=Freund |title=Special Relativity for Beginners: A Textbook for Undergraduates |publisher=World Scientific| year=2008 |pages=49|isbn=981277159X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U'=U\cdot\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''ct''}}-axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in {{math|''S''}}, with {{math|''U''}} representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the [[proper time]] between these events. Length {{math|''U''}} upon the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents the rest length or [[proper length]] of a rod resting in {{math|''S''}}. The same interpretation can also be applied to distance {{math|''U''′}} upon the {{math|''ct''′}}- and {{math|''x''′}}-axes for clocks and rods resting in {{math|''S''′}}.

=== History  ===
In Minkowski’s 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines.&lt;ref name=minko /&gt; The first diagram used a branch of the [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt; t^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to show the locus of a unit of [[proper time]] depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of [[FitzGerald contraction]]. In 1914 [[Ludwik Silberstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein |first=Ludwik |date=1914 |title=The Theory of Relativity |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a diagram of "Minkowski’s representation of the Lorentz transformation". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of [[conjugate diameters]]. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the [[transformation geometry]] of special relativity. [[E. T. Whittaker]] has pointed out that the [[principle of relativity]] is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for [[time]] in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Edwin B. Wilson]] applied the methods of [[synthetic geometry]] to develop the properties of the [[non-Euclidean]] plane that has Minkowski diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Edwin B.|last=Wilson|author1-link=Edwin B.

While the rest frame has space and time axes at right angles, the moving frame has primed axes which form an acute angle. Since the frames are meant to be equivalent, the asymmetry may be disturbing. However, several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent ("median frame").&lt;ref name=mirimanoff /&gt; In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} and {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|1 − ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}}} is given between S and S′, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name=mirimanoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirimanoff|first=Dmitry|title=La transformation de Lorentz-Einstein et le temps universel de M.

(2) &amp;  &amp; \beta_{0} &amp; =\frac{\gamma-1}{\beta\gamma}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0.5}} between S and S′, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with approximately {{math|±0.268''c''}} each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.5}} in S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then by (1) the relative velocity between S and S′ in their own rest frames is {{math|0.8''c''}}. The construction of the axes of S and S′ is done in accordance with the ordinary method using {{math|tan ''α'' {{=}} ''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1).

However, it turns out that, when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at all. Instead, the relative velocity {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} between S and S′ can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result:&lt;ref name=sartori&gt;{{cite book |first=Leo |last=Sartori  |title=Understanding Relativity: A simplified approach to Einstein's theories |isbn=0-520-20029-2 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996|pages=151ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''φ''}} is the angle between the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''ct''}} (or between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}}), and {{math|''θ''}} between the axes of {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''′}}, it is given:&lt;ref name=sartori /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shado /&gt;

\cos\varphi=\sin\theta &amp; =\frac{1}{\gamma},\\
\tan\varphi=\cot\theta &amp; =\beta\cdot\gamma.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Two methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The {{math|''x''}}-axis is drawn perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''}}-axes are added at angle {{math|''φ''}}; (b) the ''x''′-axis is drawn at angle {{math|''θ''}} with respect to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''}}-axis is added perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the {{math|''ct''}}-axis perpendicular to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis.

Also the components of a vector can be vividly demonstrated by such diagrams (Fig. 3): The parallel projections {{math|(''x'', ''t''; ''x''′ ,''t''′)}} of vector {{math|''R''}} are its [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components, {{math|(''ξ'', ''τ''; ''ξ''′, ''τ''′)}} its covariant components.&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;

=== History ===
*[[Max Born]] (1920) drew Minkowski diagrams by placing the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis almost perpendicular to the {{math|''x''}}-axis, as well as the {{math|''ct''}}-axis to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis, in order to demonstrate length contraction and time dilation in the symmetric case of two rods and two clocks moving in opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Born|first=Max|title=Die Relativitätstheorie Einsteins|trans-title=Einstein's Theory of Relativity|location=|pages=177–180|publisher=Springer|year=1920|edition=First|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006663730}} See also [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=de_6AAAAQBAJ|page=187}} Reprint (2013) of third edition (1922) at Google books, p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Symmetric diagrams were systematically developed by [[Paul Gruner]] in collaboration with Josef Sauter in two papers in 1921.

== Time dilation ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time dilation.svg|thumb|right|256px|Time dilation: Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower.]]
Relativistic time dilation means that a clock (indicating its [[proper time]]) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. In fact, time itself in the frame of the moving clock is observed to run slower. This can be read immediately from the adjoining Loedel diagram quite straightforwardly because unit lengths in the two system of axes are identical. Thus, in order to compare reading between the two systems, we can simply compare lengths as they appear on the page: we do not need to consider the fact that unit lengths on each axis are warped by the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which we would have to account for in the corresponding Minkowski diagram.

The observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock.

A second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense.

== Length contraction ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - length contraction.svg|thumb|right|256px|Length contraction: Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter.]]
Relativistic length contraction means that the [[proper length]] of an object moving relative to an observer is decreased and finally also the space itself is contracted in this system. The observer is assumed again to move along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at {{nowrap|1=''t''′ = 0}}. Due to {{nowrap|OA &lt; OB}}. the object is contracted for the first observer.

The second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.

For all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view.

== Constancy of the speed of light ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Minkowski diagram for 3 coordinate systems. For the speeds relative to the system in black {{math|1=''v''′ = 0.4''c''}} and {{math|1=''v''″ = 0.8''c''}} holds.]] Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to himself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium.

For world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions {{math|1=''x'' = ''ct''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = −''ct''}} holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the {{math|''x′''}}- and {{math|''ct''′}}-axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed {{math|''c''}} for both photons.

Further coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems.

== Speed of light and causality ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - causality.svg|thumb|right|256px|Past and future relative to the origin. For the grey areas a corresponding temporal classification is not possible.]]
Straight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram.

Following the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin.

The relationship between any such pairs of event is called ''timelike'', because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called ''lightlike''.

In principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called [[light cones]].

== The speed of light as a limit ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time travel.svg|thumb|right|256px|Sending a message at superluminal speed from O via A to B into the past. Both observers consider the temporal order of the pairs of events O and A as well as A and B different.]]
Following the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called ''spacelike'' because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different.

Therefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality.

Also, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the {{math|''x''-''ct''}} system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the {{math|''x''′-''ct''′}} system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to [[time dilation]], time would effectively stop passing for them.

These considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime.

==Eponym==
When Taylor and Wheeler composed ''Spacetime Physics'' (1966), they did ''not'' use the term "Minkowski diagram" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski’s contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor |last2=Wheeler |title=Spacetime Physics |date=1966 |page=37 |quote=Minkowski's insight is central to the understanding of the physical world. It focuses attention on those quantities, such as interval, which are the same in all frames of reference. It brings out the relative character of quantities, such as velocity, energy, time, distance, which depend on the frame of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When abstracted to a line drawing, then any figure showing conjugate hyperbolas, with a selection of conjugate diameters, falls into this category. Students making drawings to accompany the exercises in [[George Salmon]]’s ''A Treatise on Conic Sections'' (1900) at pages 165–171 (on conjugate diameters) will be making Minkowski diagrams.

==Spacetime diagram of an accelerating observer in special relativity==

[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed]]

The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.

"The '''normalization''' principle means making available to all [[people with disabilities]] patterns of life and conditions of everyday living which are as close as possible to the regular circumstances and ways of life or society."&lt;ref&gt;''The basis and logic of the normalisatioprinciple'', Bengt Nirje, Sixth International Congress of IASSMD, Toronto, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization is a rigorous theory of human services that can be applied to disability services.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Glenn, L. (1973). "Program Analysis of Service Systems (PASS): A Method for the Quantitative Evaluation of Human Services". Vol. 1. Handbook. Volume II. Field Manual. Downsview, Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization theory arose in the early 1970s, towards the end of the institutionalisation period in the US; it is one of the strongest and long lasting integration theories for people with severe disabilities.

== Definition==
Normalization involves the acceptance of  some people with disabilities, with their disabilities, offering them the same conditions as are offered to other citizens. It involves an awareness of the normal rhythm of life – including the normal rhythm of a day, a week, a year, and the life-cycle itself (e.g., celebration of holidays; workday and weekends). It involves the normal conditions of life – housing, schooling, employment, exercise, recreation and freedom of choice previously denied to individuals with severe, profound, or significant disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, Bengt as cited in S. Cohen &amp; C. Gothelf. (1988). A Preservice Trining Curriculum for Administrators for Community-Based Residential Programs Service People with Developmental Disabilities. NY, NY: City University of New York, Hunter College.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfensberger's definition is based on a concept of cultural normativeness: "Utilization of a means which are as culturally normative as possible, in order to establish and/or maintain personal behaviors and characteristics that are as culturally normative as possible." Thus, for example, "medical procedures" such as shock treatment or restraints, are not just punitive, but also not "culturally normative" in society. His principle is based upon social and physical integration, which later became popularized, implemented and studied in services as [[community integration]] encompassing areas from work to recreation and living arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientation Manual on Mental Retardation'', Pt. 1. Downsview, Ontario: National Institute on Mental Retardation, Kinsmen NIMR Building, pp. 41-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical foundations===
This theory includes "the [[dignity of risk]]", rather than an emphasis on "protection"&lt;ref&gt;''Misconceptions on the principle of normalisation'', Bank-Mikkelsen, Address to IASSMD Conference, Washington, D.C., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based upon the concept of integration in community life. The theory is one of the first to examine comprehensively both the individual and the service systems, similar to theories of human ecology which were competitive in the same period.

The theory undergirds the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements, and forms the legal basis for affirming rights to education, work, community living, medical care and citizenship. In addition, self-determination theory could not develop without this conceptual academic base to build upon and critique.&lt;ref&gt;Allard, M., Howard, A., Vorderer, L. &amp; Wells, A. (1999). "Ahead of His Time: Selected Speeches of Gunnar Dybwad." Washington, DC: American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[social role valorization]] is closely related to the principle of normalization&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities'', 11(2): 65-68.&lt;/ref&gt; having been developed with normalization as a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social role valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. ''Mental Retardation, 21'', 234-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory retains most aspects of normalization concentrating on socially valued roles and means, in socially valued contexts to achieve integration and other core quality of life values.

== History ==
The principle of normalization was developed in [[Scandinavia]] during the sixties and articulated by [[Bengt Nirje]] of the Swedish Association for Retarded Children with the US human service system a product of [[Wolf Wolfensberger]] formulation of normalization and evaluations of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The normalisation principle and its human management implications, in R. Kugel &amp; W. Wolfensberger (Eds.) ''Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded'', Washington, D.C: President’s Committee on Mental Retardation, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1972). ''The Principle of Normalization in Human Services''. Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the history taught in the 1970s, although the "exact origins are not clear", the names Bank-Mikkelson (who moved the principle to Danish law), Grunewald, and Nirje from Scandinavia (later Ministry of Community and Social Services in Toronto, Canada) are associated with early work on this principle. Wolfensberger is credited with authoring the first textbook as a "well-known scholar, leader, and scientist" and Rutherford H. (Rud) Turnbull III reports that integration principles are incorporated in US laws.

===Academe===
The principle was developed and taught at the university level and in field education during the seventies, especially by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]] of the United States, one of the first clinical psychologists in the field of mental retardation, through the support of [[Canada]] and the [[National Institute on Mental Retardation]] (NIMR) and Syracuse University in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolfensberger, W. (1972). The Principle of Normalization in Human Services'' Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; PASS and PASSING marked the quantification of service evaluations based on normalization, and in 1991 a report was issued on the quality of institutional and community programs in the US and Canada based on a sample of 213 programs in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R. J., LaPointe, N., Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Thomas, S. (1991, July 19). Quality of Institutional and Community Human Service Programs in Canada and the United States. ""Journal of Psychiatry and Neurosciences"", 16(3): 146-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance in structuring service systems===
Normalization has had a significant effect on the way services for people with disabilities have been structured throughout the UK, Europe, especially Scandinavia, North America, Israel, Australasia (e.g., New Zealand) and increasingly, other parts of the world. It has led to a new conceptualisation of disability as not simply being a medical issue (the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] which saw the person as indistinguishable from the disorder, though Wolfensberger continued to use the term into the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Associates. (2001). "The 19th Century "Moral Treatment" Approach to Human Services, Especially to the Treatment of Mental Disorder, and Lessons for Services for Our Own Day". Syracuse, NY: Training Institute for Human Services Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt; but as a [[Social model of disability|social situation]] as described in [[social role valorization]].

Government reports began from the 1970s to reflect this changing view of disability (Wolfensberger uses the term devalued people), e.g. the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board report of 1981 made recommendations on "the rights of people with intellectual handicaps to receive appropriate services, to assert their rights to independent living so far as this is possible, and to pursue the principle of normalization." The New York State Quality of Care Commission also recommended education based upon principles of normalization and social role valorization addressing "deep-seated negative beliefs of and about people with disabilities".&lt;ref&gt;Cashen, J. (1989, Nov-Dec). The need for value-enhancement training and informal support systems. ''Quality of Care'', Issue 42: 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfensberger's work was part of a major systems reform in the US and Europe of how individuals with disabilities whould be served, resulting in the growth in community services in support of homes, families and community living.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R.J. &amp; Nitsch, K.E. (1980). ''Normalization, Social Integration and Community Services''. (pp. 117-129). Baltimore, MD; Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical ideology of human services===
Normalization is often described in articles and education texts that reflect deinstitutionalization, family care or community living as the ideology of human services.&lt;ref&gt;Landesman, S. &amp; Butterfield, E. (1987, August). Normalization and deinstitutionalization of mentally retarded individuals: Controversy and facts. "American Psychologist", 42: 809-816.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruininks, R.H. &amp; Lakin, K.C. (1985). Living and Learning in the Least Restrictive Environment". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots are European-American, and as discussed in education fields in the 1990s, reflect a traditional gender relationship-position (Racino, 2000), among similar diversity critiques of the period (i.e., multiculturalism).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability: Toward Universal Approaches to Support". Binghamton, NY: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization has undergone extensive reviews and critiques, thus increasing its stature through the decades often equating it with school mainstreaming, life success and normalization,and deinstitutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zipperlin, H. (1975). Normalization. In: J. Wortis (Ed.), "Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, VII". NY, NY: Brumer Mazel Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, A. (1992).

==In contemporary society==
{{essay|section|date=April 2015}}
In the United States, large public institutions housing adults with developmental disabilities began to be phased out as a primary means of delivering services in the early 1970s and the statistics have been documented until the present day (2015) by David Braddock and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Fujiura, G., Bachelder, L., &amp; Mitchell, D. (1990). "The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the late 1960s, the normalization principle was described to change the pattern of residential services, as exposes occurred in the US and reform initiatives began in Europe. These proposed changes were described in the leading text by the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (PCMR) titled: "Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded" with leaders Burton Blatt, Wolf Wolfensberger, Bengt Nirje, Bank-Mikkelson, Jack Tizard, Seymour Sarason, Gunnar Dybwad, Karl Gruenwald, Robert Kugel, and lesser known colleagues Earl Butterfield, Robert E. Cooke, David Norris, H. Michael Klaber, and Lloyd Dunn.&lt;ref&gt;Kugel, R.H. &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (1969). Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded." Washington, DC: President's Committee on Mental Retardation"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deinstitutionalization and community development===
The impetus for this mass deinstitutionalization was typically complaints of systematic abuse of the patients by staff and others responsible for the care and treatment of this traditionally vulnerable population with media and political exposes and hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, B. &amp; Kaplan, F. (1974). "Christmas in Purgatory: A Photographic Essay on Mental Retardation". Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These complaints, accompanied by judicial oversight and legislative reform, resulted in major changes in the education of personnel and the development of principles for conversion models from institutions to communities, known later as the community paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support For All". London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, B., Bogdan, R., Biklen, D. &amp; Taylor, S. (1977). From institution to community - A conversion model - Educational programming for the severely/profoundly handicapped. In: E. Sontag, J. Smith, &amp; N. Certo (Eds)., "Educational Programming for the Severely and Profoundly Handicapped" (pp. 40-52). Reston, VA: Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt; In many states the recent process of deinstitutionalization has taken 10–15 years due to a lack of community supports in place to assist individuals in achieving the greatest degree of independence and community integration as possible. Yet, many early recommendations from 1969 still hold such as financial aid to keep children at home, establishment of foster care services, leisure and recreation, and opportunities for adults to leave home and attain employment (Bank-Mikkelsen, p.&amp;nbsp;234-236, in Kugel &amp; Wolfensberger, 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Bank-Mikkelsen, N. (1969). Ch. 10: A metropolitan area in Denmark, Copenhagen. In:  R.B. Kugel &amp; W. Wolfensberger, ''Changing Patterns of Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded'' (now Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2015). Washington, DC: President's Committee on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community supports and community integration===
A significant obstacle in developing community supports has been ignorance and resistance on the part of "typically developed" community members who have been taught by contemporary culture that "those people" are somehow fundamentally different and flawed and it is in everyone's best interest if they are removed from society (this developing out of 19th Century ideas about health, morality, and contagion). Part of the normalization process has been returning people to the community and supporting them in attaining as "normal" as life as possible, but another part has been broadening the category of "normal" (sometimes taught as "regular" in community integration, or below as "typical") to include all human beings. In part, the word "normal" continues to be used in contrast to "abnormal", a term also for differentness or out of the norm or accepted routine (e.g., middle class).&lt;ref&gt;Traustadottir, R. (1995). A mother's work is never done: Constructing a "normal" family life. In: S. Taylor, R. Bogdan &amp; Z.M. Lutfiyya, ''The Variety of Community Experiences: Qualitative Studies of Family and Community Life''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. &amp; Rogan, P. (1990). ''RCE/SPE 636: Community Services and Systems Change: Syllabi''. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Division of Special Education and Rehabilitation, School of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary services and workforces===
In 2015, public views and attitudes continue to be critical both because personnel are sought from the broader society for fields such as mental health&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. &amp; Gagne, C. (2002). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation". Boston, MA: Boston University, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation.&lt;/ref&gt; and contemporary community services continue to include models such as the international "emblem of the group home" for individuals with significant disabilities moving to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. &amp; Traustadottir, R. (2005). "Deinstitutionalization and People with Intellectual Disabilities". London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the US direct support workforce, associated with the University of Minnesota, School of Education, Institute on [[Community Integration]]&lt;ref&gt;Larson, S., Sedlezky, L., &amp; Hewitt, A. &amp; Blakeway, C. (2012/14). US direct support workforce. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; can trace its roots to a normalization base which reflected their own education and training at the next generation levels.

People with disabilities are not to be viewed as sick, ill, abnormal, subhuman, or unformed, but as people who require significant supports in certain (but not all) areas of their life from daily routines in the home to participation in local community life.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P. &amp; Rogan, P. (2007). "Making the Day Matter: Promoting Typical Lifestyles for Adults with Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; With this comes an understanding that all people require supports at certain times or in certain areas of their life, but that most people acquire these supports informally or through socially acceptable avenues. The key issue of support typically comes down to productivity and self-sufficiency, two values that are central to society's definition of self-worth. If we as a society were able to broaden this concept of self-worth perhaps fewer people would be labeled as "disabled."

=== Contemporary Views on Disability ===
{{POV section|date=May 2018}}

During the mid to late 20th century people with disabilities where met with fear, stigma, and pity. Their opportunities for a full productive life where minimal at best and often emphasis was placed more on personal characterizes that could be enhanced so the attention was taken from their disability &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Groomes  &amp; Linkowski|first=D. A. G., &amp;  D. C.|date=2007|title=Examining the structure of the revised acceptance disability scale|url=http://libproxy.boisestate.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/docview/236273029?accountid=9649|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation,|volume=73|pages=3–9|via=proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linkowski developed the Acceptance of Disability Scale (ADS) during this time to help measure a person’s struggle to accept disability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He developed the ADS to reflect the value change process associated with the acceptance of loss theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast to later trends, the current trend shows great improvement in the quality of life for those with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sociopolitical definitions of disability, the independent living movement, improved media and social messages, observation and consideration of situational and environmental barriers, passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 have all come together to help a person with disability define their acceptance of what living with a disability means.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bogdan and Taylor's (1993)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; acceptance of sociology, which states that a person need not be defined by personal characterizes alone, has become influential in helping persons with disabilities to refuse to accept exclusion from mainstream society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to some disability scholar’s, disabilities are created by oppressive relations with society, this has been called the social creationist view of disability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vehmas|first=Simo|date=2004|title=Dimensions of Disability|url=|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=13 |issue=1|pages=34–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, it is important to grasp the difference between physical impairment and disability. In the article The Mountain written by Eli Clare, Michael Oliver defines impairment as lacking part of or all of a limb, or having a defective limb, organism or mechanism of the body and the societal construct of disability; Oliver defines disability as the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization which takes no or little account of people who have physical (and/or cognitive/developmental/mental) impairments and thus excludes them from the mainstream of society.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Clare: The Mountain&lt;/ref&gt; In society, language helps to construct reality, for instance, societies way of defining disability which implies that a disabled person lacks a certain ability, or possibility, that could contribute to her personal well-being and enable her to be a contributing member of society versus abilities and possibilities that are considered to be good and useful .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Society needs to destruct the language that is used and build a new one that does not place those with disabilities in the “other” category.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Personal wounds, quality of life and social role valorization===
However, the perspective of Wolfensberger, who served as associated faculty with the Rehabiltation Research and Training Center on Community Integration (despite concerns of federal funds), is that people he has known in institutions have "suffered deep wounds". This view, reflected in his early overheads of PASS ratings, is similar to other literature that has reflected the need for hope in situations where aspirations and expectations for quality of life had previously been very low (e.g., brain injury, [[independent living]]).  Normalization advocates were among the first to develop models of residential services, and to support contemporary practices in recognizing families and supporting employment.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W., Thomas, S., &amp; Caruso, G. (1996). Because of the universal "good things in life" which the implementation of social role valorization can be expected to make more accessible to devalued people. "International Social Role Valorization Journal", 2: 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfensberger himself found the new term social role valorization&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1985). Social role valorization: A new inight, and a new term, for normalization. ''Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded Journal'', 9(1): 4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; to better convey his theories (and his German Professorial temperament, family life and beliefs)than the constant "misunderstandings" of the term normalization!

===Related theories and development===
Related theories on integration in the subsequent decades have been termed [[community integration]], self-determination or empowerment theory, support and empowerment paradigms, community building, functional-competency, family support, often not independent living (supportive living),and in 2015, the principle of inclusion which also has roots in service fields in the 1980s.

== Misconceptions ==
Normalization is so common in the fields of disability, especially intellectual and developmental disabilities, that articles will critique normalization without ever referencing one of three international leaders: Wolfensberger, Nirje, and Bank Mikkelson or any of the women educators (e.g., Wolfensberger's Susan Thomas; Syracuse University colleagues Taylor, Biklen or Bogdan; established women academics (e.g., Sari Biklen); or emerging women academics, Traustadottir, Shoultz or Racino in national research and education centers (e.g., Hillyer, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Hillyer, B. (1993). ''Feminism and Disability''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is important to discuss common misconceptions about the principle of normalization and its implications among the provider-academic sectors:

*a) '''Normalization does not mean making people "normal" – forcing them to conform to societal norms'''.
Wolfensberger himself, in 1980, suggested "Normalizing measures can be offered in some circumstances, and imposed in others."&lt;ref&gt;''The definition of normalisation: update, problems, disagreements and misunderstandings'', Wolfensberger, W. (1980) In R.J. Flynn &amp; K.E. Nitsch (Eds). Normalization, social integration and human services. Baltimore: University Park Press&lt;/ref&gt; This view is not accepted by most people in the field, including Nirje. Advocates emphasize that the ''environment'', not the ''person'', is what is normalized, or as known for decades a person-environment interaction.

Normalization is very complex theoretically, and Wolf Wolfensberger's educators explain his positions such as the conservatism corollary, deviancy unmaking, the developmental model (see below) and social competency, and relevance of social imagery, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Tullman, S. (1982). A brief outline of the principle of normalization. "Rehabilitation Psychology", 27(3): 131-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

*b) '''Normalization does not support "dumping" people into the community or into schools without support'''.
Normalization has been blamed for the closure of services (such as institutions) leading to a lack of support for children and adults with disabilities. Indeed, normalization personnel are often affiliated with human rights groups. Normalization is not deinstitutionalization, though institutions have been found to not "pass" in service evaluations and to be the subject of exposes. Normalization was described early as alternative special education by leaders of the deinstitutionalization movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1977). The principle of normalization. In: B. Blatt, D. Biklen, &amp; R. Bogdan, "An Alternative Textbook in Special Education: People, Schools and Other Institutions". Denver, CO: Love Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

However support services which facilitate normal life opportunities for people with disabilities – such as special education services, housing support, employment support and advocacy – are not incompatible with normalization, although some particular services (such as special schools) may actually detract from rather than enhance normal living bearing in mind the concept of normal 'rhythms' of life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

* c) '''Normalization supports [[community integration]], but the principles vary significantly on matters such as gender and disability with community integration directly tackling services in the context of race, ethnicity, class, income and gender'''.
Some misconceptions and confusions about normalization are removed by understanding a context for this principle. There has been a general belief that 'special' people are best served if society keeps them apart, puts them together with 'their own kind, and keep them occupied. The principle of normalization is intended to refute this idea, rather than to deal with subtlety around the question of 'what is normal?' The principle of normalization is congruent in many of its features with "[[community integration]]" and as been described by educators as supporting early mainstreaming in community life.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, J. (1979). The Principle of Normalization, Guidelines for Tours, and Guidelines for Administrative Inquiries". Syracuse, NY: Training Institute on Human Services Planning and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt;

* d) '''Normalization supports adult services by age range, not "mental age", and appropriate services across the lifespan'''.
Arguments about choice and individuality, in connection with normalization, should also take into account whether society, perhaps through paid support staff, has encouraged them into certain behaviours. For example, in referring to normalization, a discussion about an adult's choice to carry a doll with them must be influenced by a recognition that they have previously been encouraged in childish behaviours, and that society currently expects them to behave childishly. Most people who find normalization to be a useful principle would hope to find a middle way - in this case, an adult's interest in dolls being valued, but with them being actively encouraged to express it in an age-appropriate way (e.g., viewing museums and doll collections), with awareness of gender in toy selection (e.g., see cars and motorsports), and discouraged from behaving childishly and thus accorded the rights and routines only of a "perpetual child". However, the principle of normalization is intended also to refer to the means by which a person is supported, so that (in this example) any encouragement or discouragement offered in a patronising or directive manner is itself seen to be inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

*e) '''Normalization is a set of values, and early on (1970s)was validated through quantitative measures (PASS, PASSING)'''.
Normalization principles were designed to be measured and ranked on all aspects through the development of measures related to homes, facilities, programs, location (i.e. community development), service activities, and life routines, among others. These service evaluations have been used for training community services personnel, both in institutions and in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Glenn, L. (1975). ""PASS 3: A Method for Quantitative Evaluation of the Human Services Field. Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation"".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Thomas, S. (1983). ""PASSING: Program Analysis of Service Systems Implementation of Normalization Goals"". Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R.J. &amp; Heal, L.W. (1981). A short form of PASS 3: A study of its structure, interrater reliability, and validity for assessing normalization. ""Evaluation Review"", 5(3): 357-376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demaine, G.C., Silverstein, A.B. &amp; Mayeda, T. (1980, June). Validation of PASS 3: A first step in service evaluation through environmental assessments. ''Mental Retardation'', 18: 131-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization as the basis for education of community personnel in Great Britain is reflected in a 1990s reader, highlighting Wolf Wolfensberger's moral concerns as a Christian, right activist, side-by-side ("How to Function with Personal Model Coherency in a Dysfunctional (Human Service) World") with the common form of normalization training for evaluations of programs.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, P. &amp; Wainwright, T. (1992). Normalisation training: Conversion or commitment? In: H. Brown &amp; H. Smith (Eds), "Normalisation: A Reader for the Nineties". London: Tavistock/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Community educators and leaders in Great Britain and the US of different political persuasions include John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien, Paul Williams and Alan Tyne, Guy Caruso and Joe Osborn, Jim Mansell and Linda Ward, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. &amp; Tyne, A.

'''Obfuscation''' is the [[wikt:obscure#Verb|obscuring]] of the intended [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of [[communication]] by making the message difficult to understand, usually with [[mental confusion|confusing]] and [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] language. The obfuscation might be either unintentional or [[intention|intentional]] (although intent usually is [[connotation|connoted]]), and is accomplished with [[circumlocution]] (talking around the subject), the use of [[jargon]] (technical language of a profession), and the use of an [[argot]] ([[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] language) of limited communicative value to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Tom McArthur, Ed., (1992) p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[expository writing]], unintentional obfuscation usually occurs in [[draft document]]s, at the beginning of [[composition (language)|composition]]; such obfuscation is illuminated with [[critical thinking]] and editorial revision, either by the writer or by an editor. Etymologically, the word ''obfuscation'' derives from the Latin ''obfuscatio'', from [[wikt:obfuscate#Etymology|''obfuscāre'' (to darken)]]; synonyms include the words [[wikt:beclouding|beclouding]] and [[wikt:abstrusity#Noun|abstrusity]].

==Background==
Doctors are faulted for using [[jargon]] to conceal unpleasant facts from a patient; the American author and physician [[Michael Crichton]] said that [[medical writing]] is a "highly skilled, calculated attempt to confuse the reader". The psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]] said that medical notation is a form of multiple audience control, which allows the doctor to communicate to the pharmacist things which the patient might oppose if he or she could understand medical jargon.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957) ''Verbal Behavior'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eschew==
"Eschew obfuscation", also stated as "eschew obfuscation, espouse elucidation", is a humorous [[fumblerules|fumblerule]] used by English teachers and professors when lecturing about proper writing techniques. Literally, the phrase means "avoid being unclear" or "avoid being unclear, support being clear", but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion in much of the audience (those lacking the [[vocabulary]]), making the statement an example of [[irony]], and more precisely a [[heterological]] phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a [[NASA]] document.&lt;ref&gt;United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ''NASA Technical Memorandum'' (1959), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier similar phrase appears in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses]]'', where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as "eschew [[surplusage]]".

==White box cryptography==
In white-box cryptography, obfuscation refers to the protection of cryptographic keys from extraction when they are under the control of the adversary, e.g., as part of a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Chow S, Eisen P, Johnson H, et al. A white-box DES implementation for DRM applications[M]//Digital Rights Management. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2002: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network security==
In [[network security]], obfuscation refers to methods used to obscure an attack payload from inspection by network protection systems.

'''Overall equipment effectiveness''' ('''OEE''') is a term coined by [[Seiichi Nakajima]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of OEE|url=http://www.oeefoundation.org/origin-of-oee/|website=OEE Foundation|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s to evaluate how effectively a [[manufacturing]] operation is utilized.  It is based on the [[Harrington Emerson]] way of thinking regarding labor efficiency.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The results are stated in a generic form which allows comparison between manufacturing units in differing industries. It is not however an absolute measure and is best used to identify scope for process performance improvement, and how to get the improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding OEE|url=http://www.ofsystems.com/understanding-oee|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If for example the [[cycle time]] is reduced, the OEE will increase i.e. more product is produced for less resource. Another example is if one enterprise serves a high volume, low variety market, and another enterprise serves a low volume, high variety market. More [[changeover]]s (set-ups) will lower the OEE in comparison, but if the product is sold at a premium, there could be more margin with a lower OEE.

OEE measurement is also commonly used as a [[key performance indicator]] (KPI) in conjunction with [[lean manufacturing]] efforts to provide an indicator of success. OEE can be illustrated by a brief discussion of the six metrics that comprise the system. The hierarchy consists of two top-level measures and four underlying measures.

== Top-level metrics ==
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and '''total effective equipment performance''' (TEEP) are two closely related metrics that report the overall utilization of facilities, time and material for manufacturing operations. These top view metrics directly indicate the gap between actual and ideal performance.

* Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) quantifies how well a manufacturing unit performs relative to its designed capacity, during the periods when it is scheduled to run.
* [[Total effective equipment performance]] (TEEP) measures OEE against calendar hours, i.e.: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

== Underlying metrics ==
In addition to the above measures, there are four underlying metrics that provide understanding as to why and where the OEE and TEEP gaps exist.

The measurements are described below

*''' [[Task loading|Loading]]:''' The portion of the TEEP Metric that represents the percentage of total calendar time that is actually scheduled for operation.
*''' [[Availability]]:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. Often referred to as Uptime.
*''' Performance:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed.
*''' [[Quality (business)|Quality]]:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started. It is commonly referred to as the [[first pass yield]] (FPY).

== Calculations for OEE and TEEP ==
What follows is a detailed presentation of each of the six OEE / TEEP Metrics and examples of how to perform calculations. The calculations are not particularly complicated, but care must be taken as to standards that are used as the basis. Additionally, these calculations are valid at the work center or part number level but become more complicated if rolling down to aggregate levels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://capstonemetrics.com/files/whitepaper-oeeoverview.pdf | title = OEE Overview - with Calculation Methods |accessdate = 23 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overall equipment effectiveness ===
OEE breaks the performance of a manufacturing unit into three separate but measurable components:  [[Availability]], Performance, and [[Quality (business)|Quality]]. Each component points to an aspect of the process that can be targeted for improvement. OEE may be applied to any individual Work Center, or rolled up to Department or Plant levels. This tool also allows for drilling down for very specific analysis, such as a particular Part Number, Shift, or any of several other parameters.
It is unlikely that any manufacturing process can run at 100% OEE. Many manufacturers benchmark their industry to set a challenging target; 85% is not uncommon.
*OEE is calculated with the formula (Availability)*(Performance)*(Quality)

*Using the examples given below:
*(Availability= 86.6%)*(Performance=93%)*(Quality=91.3%)= (OEE=73.6%)
Alternatively, and often easier, OEE is calculated by dividing the minimum time needed to produce the parts under optimal conditions by the actual time needed to produce the parts. For example:
*Total Time: 8 hour shift or 28,800 seconds, producing 14,400 parts, or one part every 2 seconds.
*Fastest possible cycle time is 1.5 seconds, hence only 21,600 seconds would have been needed to produce the 14,400 parts. The remaining 7,200 seconds or 2 hours were lost.
*The OEE is now the 21,600 seconds divided by 28,800 seconds (same as minimal 1.5 seconds per part divided by 2 actual seconds per part), or 75%.

=== Total effective equipment performance ===
Where OEE measures effectiveness based on scheduled hours, TEEP measures effectiveness against calendar hours, i.e.: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

TEEP, therefore, reports the 'bottom line' utilization of assets.

TEEP = Loading * OEE&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Loading===
The Loading portion of the TEEP Metric represents the percentage of time that an operation is scheduled to operate compared to the total Calendar Time that is available. The Loading Metric is a pure measurement of Schedule Effectiveness and is designed to exclude the effects how well that operation may perform.

'''Calculation: Loading = Scheduled Time / Calendar Time'''

''Example:''

A given Work Center is scheduled to run 5 Days per Week, 24 Hours per Day.

For a given week, the Total Calendar Time is 7 Days at 24 Hours.

Loading  = (5 days x 24 hours) / (7 days x 24 hours) = 71.4%

===Availability===
The Availability portion of the OEE Metric represents the percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. The Availability Metric is a pure measurement of Uptime that is designed to exclude the effects of Quality and Performance. The losses due to wasted availability are called ''availability losses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ofsystems.com/#!understanding-oee/c1mpi | title = Understanding Availability |accessdate = 9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''
A given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break and during the break the lines stop, and unscheduled downtime is 60 minutes.

The scheduled time = 480 minutes - 30 minutes = 450 minutes.

Operating Time = 480 Minutes – 30 Minutes Scheduled Downtime – 60 Minutes Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes

'''Calculation: Availability = operating time / scheduled time'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Availability = 390 minutes / 450 minutes = 86.6%

===Performance and productivity===
Also known as "process rate", the Performance portion of the OEE Metric represents the speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed. The Performance Metric is a pure measurement of speed that is designed to exclude the effects of Quality and Availability. The losses due to wasted performance are also often called ''speed losses''. In practice it is often difficult to determine speed losses, and a common approach is to merely assign the remaining unknown losses as speed losses.

'''Calculation: Performance ([[Productivity]]) = (Parts Produced * Ideal Cycle Time) / Operating time''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oee.com/calculating-oee.html | title = OEE Primer: Calculating OEE |accessdate = 9 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''

A given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.

Operating Time = 450 Min Scheduled – 60 Min Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes

The Standard Rate for the part being produced is 40 Units/Hour or 1.5 Minutes/Unit

The Work Center produces 242 Total Units during the shift. Note: The basis is Total Units, not Good Units. The Performance metric does not penalize for Quality.

Time to Produce Parts = 242 Units * 1.5 Minutes/Unit  = 363 Minutes

Performance (Productivity)  = 363 Minutes / 390 Minutes = 93.1%

===Quality===
The Quality portion of the OEE Metric represents the Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started. The Quality Metric is a pure measurement of Process Yield that is designed to exclude the effects of Availability and Performance. The losses due to defects and rework are called ''quality losses''.

'''Calculation: Quality = (Units produced - defective units) / (Units produced)'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sensrtrx.com/calculate-oee/|title=Calculate OEE - Simple Calculator &amp; OEE Formulas|newspaper=SensrTrx {{!}} Cloud Manufacturing Analytics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''

242 Units are produced. 21 are defective.

(242 units produced - 21 defective units) = 221 units

221 good units / 242 total units produced = 91.32%

== "Six Big Losses" ==
[[File:OEE SixLoss Calculation Example.png|thumb|Example of OEE and Six Loss calculation]]
To be able to better determine what is contributing to the greatest loss and so what areas should be targeted to improve the performance, these categories (Availability, Performance and Quality) have been subdivided further into what is known as the ‘Six Big Losses’ to OEE.

These are categorized as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Availability!! Performance!! Quality
|-
| Planned Downtime || Minor Stops || Production Rejects
|-
| Breakdowns || Speed Loss || Rejects on Start up
|-
|}

The reason for identifying the losses in these categories is so that specific countermeasures can be applied to reduce the loss and improve the overall OEE.

== Heuristic ==
OEE is useful as a [[heuristic]], but can break down in several circumstances.  For example, it may be far more costly to
run a facility at certain times.  Performance and quality may not be independent of each other or of availability and loading.
Experience may develop over time. Since the performance of shop floor managers is at least sometimes compared to the OEE, these numbers are often not reliable, and there are numerous ways to fudge these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutlean.com/fudge-oee | title = Top Three Methods on how to Fudge Your OEE|accessdate = 5 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OEE has properties of a [[geometric mean]].  As such it punishes [[Statistical variability|variability]] among its subcomponents.  For example, 20% * 80% = 16%,
whereas 50% * 50% = 25%.  When there are asymmetric costs associated with one or more of the components, then the model may become less appropriate.

Consider a system where the cost of error is exceptionally high. In such a condition, higher quality may be far more important
in a proper evaluation of [[effectiveness]] than performance or availability. OEE also to some extent assumes a closed system and a potentially static one. If one can bring in additional resources (or lease out unused resources to other projects or business units) then it may be more appropriate for example to use an expected [[net present value]] analysis.

Variability in flow can also introduce important costs and [[risk]]s that may merit further modeling. [[Sensitivity analysis]] and measures of change may be helpful.

The term "permission" is more commonly used to refer to [[consent]]. '''Consent''' is the legal embodiment of the concept, in which approval is given to another party.

Permissions depend on [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s or [[institution]]s.

Many permissions and [[obligation]]s are complementary to each other, and [[deontic logic]] is a tool sometimes used in reasoning about such relationships.

'''Place attachment''' is the emotional bond between person and place,&lt;ref name=Florek /&gt; and is a main concept in [[environmental psychology]]. It is highly influenced by an individual and his or her personal experiences.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; There is a considerable amount of research dedicated to defining what makes a place "meaningful" enough for place attachment to occur.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewicka|first=Maria|title=Place attachment: How far have we come in the last 40 years?|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=207–230|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder (1991) notably discussed the difference between "meaning" and "preference," defining meaning as "the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape" and preference as "the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another."&lt;ref name=Schroeder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=HW|title=Preference and meaning of arboretum landscapes: Combining quantitative and qualitative data|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=September 1991|volume=11|issue=3|pages=231–248|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80185-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Place attachment is multi-dimensional&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scannell|first=Leila|author2=Robert Gifford |title=Defining place attachment: a tripartite organizing framework|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=30|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2009.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be explained simply through a cause and effect relationship. Instead, it depends on a reciprocal relationship between behavior and experiences.&lt;ref name=Rollero /&gt; Due to numerous varying opinions on the definition and components of place attachment, organizational models have been scarce until recent years.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; A noteworthy conceptual framework is the Tripartite Model, developed by Scannell and Gifford (2010), which defines the variables of place attachment as the three P’s: Person, Process, and Place.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt;

Little is known about the neurological changes that make place attachment possible because of the exaggerated focus on social aspects by environmental psychologists, the difficulties in measuring place attachment over time, and the heavy influence of individualistic experiences and emotions on the degree of attachment.&lt;ref name="Morgan, attachment theory" /&gt;

== Tripartite model ==
=== Person ===
The Person dimension addresses the question of, "who is attached?"

When examined individually, places often gain meaning because of personal experiences, life milestones, and occurrences of personal growth. With communities, however, places derive religious, historical, or other cultural meanings.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; Community behaviors contribute not only to place attachment experienced by citizens of that community as a group, but also to those citizens individually. For example, desires to preserve ecological or architectural characteristics of a place have a direct impact on the strength of place attachment felt by individuals, notably through self-pride and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; People experience stronger attachments to places that they can identify with or otherwise feel proud to be a part of.

=== Process ===
The process dimension answers the question “How does the attachment exist?” Similar to other concepts in [[social psychology]], this dimension relies on the collective effects of [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], cognitive, and behavioral aspects.

==== Affect ====
The most common emotions associated with people-place bonding are positive, such as happiness and love.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], a noteworthy [[human geography|human geographer]] and pioneer in place attachment research, coined the term [[topophilia]] to describe the love that people feel for particular places.&lt;ref name=Rollero /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tuan book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuan|first=Yi-Fu|title=Topophilia: a study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values|year=1974|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative emotions and experiences are also capable of giving places significance; however, negative emotions are usually not associated with people-place bonding since place attachment represents individuals’ yearnings to replicate positive experiences and emotions.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

==== Cognition ====
[[Cognition]] incorporates the knowledge, memories, and meanings that individuals or groups have associated with places of attachment. Specifically, these cognitive elements represent what makes specific places important enough for people-place bonding to develop.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; Environmental psychologists additionally use the term [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] to describe how people organize their beliefs and knowledge in regards to places and has led some researchers to note [[wikt:familiar|familiarity]] as a central cognitive element in place attachment.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fullilove&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fullilove|first=Mindy T.|title=Psychiatric implications of displacement: contributions from the psychology of place|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1996|volume=153|pages=1516–1523|PMID=8942445|doi=10.1176/ajp.153.12.1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of familiarity has been used in explaining why people mark themselves as “city people” or why they develop preferences for certain types of homes.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; Researchers have coined a number of terms based on familiarity, including “settlement identity”&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Roberta M.|title=Settlement identity: psychological bonds with home places in a mobile society|journal=Environment and Behavior|year=1990|volume=22|pages=183–229|doi=10.1177/0013916590222002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “generic place dependence.”&lt;ref name=Stokols&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=John H.|title=Cognition, social behavior, and the environment|publisher=L. Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=441–488|author2=Stokols, Daniel |author3=Shumaker, Sally A. |chapter=People in places: a transactional view of settings|isbn=978-0898590821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Behavior ====
[[Behavior]] is the physical manifestation of place attachment and can represent the cognitive and affective elements that an individual possesses in their person-place bonds. [[Proximity-maintaining behaviors]] have been noted as common behaviors among people who have attachment of place, similar to those who have [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal attachments]].&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; Many individuals unknowingly experience the effects of place attachment through [[homesickness]]&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt; and will carry out proximity-maintaining behaviors to satisfy their desires to relieve it by returning home or reinventing their current environments to match the characteristics of home.&lt;ref name=Cieraad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cieraad|first=Irene|title=Homes from homes: Memories and projections|journal=Home Cultures|year=2010|volume=7|issue=1|pages=85–102|doi=10.2752/175174210X12591523182788}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinvention of current environments has been coined as [[reconstruction of place]] and is a notable place attachment behavior. Reconstruction of place often occurs when communities are rebuilding after natural disasters or war. As counterintuitive as it may seem, trips and even pilgrimages away from places can enhance a person-place bond because individuals grow an increased appreciation for the places they have left behind, contributing to feelings of [[nostalgia]] that often accompany attachment and the memories that places evoke.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

=== Place ===
The Place dimension addresses the question of, “what is attached?” and can be applied to any geographic type.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; Many researchers stress that place attachment relies on both physical and social aspects.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

==== Social ====
There is debate among environmental psychologists that place attachment occurs due to the social relationships that exist within the realm of an individual's significant place rather than the physical characteristics of the place itself.&lt;ref name = "Hidalgo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=M. Carmen|author2=Hernández, Bernardo|title=Place attachment: conceptual and empirical questions|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2001|volume=21|pages=273–281|doi=10.1006/jevp.2001.0221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hidalgo and Hernández (2001) studied levels of attachment based on different dimensions and found that while social aspects were stronger than physical ones, both affected the overall person-place bond.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

==== Physical ====
Natural and built environments can both be subjects of person-place bonds. The resources that these environments provide are the most tangible aspects that can induce attachment. These resources can lead to the development of [[place dependence]].&lt;ref name=Smaldone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smaldone|first=David|title=The Role of Time in Place Attachment|journal=Proceedings of the 2006 Northeastern Recreation Research Symposium|year=2006|pages=47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Place dependence negatively correlates with environmental press, which can be defined as the demands and stresses that an environment puts on people physically, interpersonally, or socially.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavanaugh|first=John C.|title=Adult Development and Aging|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-60174-6|page=151|edition=Sixth|author2=Blanchard-Fields, Fredda }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, intangible aspects of environments can also promote attachment. In particular, the characteristics and symbolic representations that an individual associates with his or her perceptions of self are pivotal in the person-place bond.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

== Developmental theories ==
There is very little research dedicated to the underlying developmental and neurological processes for place attachment, which is a major criticism of the field. Suggested developmental theories include the [[mere-exposure effect]] and the [[security-exploration cycle]].&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; Environmental psychologists have recognized parallels between the [[attachment theory]] and the development of place attachment, but the attachment theory at times fails to recognize place as a playing piece and instead classifies it as a background for attachment relationships.&lt;ref name = "Morgan, attachment theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Paul|title=Towards a developmental theory of place attachment|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=30|pages=11–22|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2009.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security-exploration cycle indicates that a place can become the target of attachment when it incorporates both security and exploration. For example, the home, a popular object of attachment, typically possesses a safe or familiar indoor environment and an outdoor space that satisfies desires to explore and expand knowledge. This example is capitalized upon by Morgan (2010), who proposed a combination of human attachment and place attachment in a model called the Exploration-Assertion Motivational System, which suggests that the strongest attachments originate during childhood.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; The model states that place attachment forms due to a cycle of repeated arousals and behaviors that are linked to both places and [[attachment figure]]s. As a result of this balance between exploration and attachment behavior, children receive positive reinforcements in the forms of [[connectedness]] and a sense of adventure and mastery.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan, attachment theory" /&gt;

Despite the absence of a well-established developmental theory and understanding of the neurological changes that accompany place attachment, most researchers agree that some form of place attachment occurs for each person at some point in his or her lifetime,&lt;ref name=Florek /&gt; with childhood homes being the most prevalent object of attachment.&lt;ref name="Morgan, attachment theory" /&gt;

== Scientific research ==

=== Predictors of attachment ===

There is a desire among researchers to create a list of concrete variables that account for differing extents of place attachment among individuals. It is believed that increased length of residence in a location increases the attachment a person has to that location.&lt;ref name="Hashem" /&gt; Place attachment tends to develop fast in early years of life and in a short time of residence, it helps that a person visits constantly the same place and no others, making, place attachment and place identity settle and grow.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=Tomeu|last2=Valera|first2=Sergi|last3=Peró|first3=Maribel|date=2010-01-01|title=Place attachment, place identity and residential mobility in undergraduate students|url=https://doi.org/10.1174/217119710792774834|journal=Psyecology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=291–307|doi=10.1174/217119710792774834|issn=2171-1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;Over extended periods of time, place identity can develop.&lt;ref name=Rollero&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rollero|first=Chiara|author2=De Piccoli, Norma|title=Place attachment, identification and environment perception: An empirical study|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=198–205|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2009.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Place identity]] is defined as an individual's perception of self as a member of a particular environment.&lt;ref name=Smaldone /&gt; 
Other proposed positively correlated variables are ownership (i.e. of home, land) and social interactions. Some inversely related variables that have been suggested are building size and age.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hashem&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashemnezhad|first=Hashem|author2=Yazdanfar, Seyed Abbas |author3=Heidari, Ali Akbar |author4= Behdadfar, Nazgol |title=Comparison of the Concepts of Sense of Place and Attachment to Place in Architectural Studies|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|year=2013|volume=7|issue=1|pages=219–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place Identity ===
This construct is usually mistaken with place attachment, even if they develop from different causes. Place attachment develops from positive experiences and the satisfactory relationship between a person and a place, while place identity comes from beliefs, meanings, emotions, ideas and attitudes assigned to a place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casakin|first=Hernan|last2=Ruiz|first2=Cristina|last3=Hernández|first3=Bernardo|date=2013-01-01|title=Differences in place attachment and place identity in non-natives of cities of Israel and cities of Tenerife|url=https://doi.org/10.1174/021093913808349325|journal=Estudios de Psicología|volume=34|issue=3|pages=287–297|doi=10.1174/021093913808349325|issn=0210-9395}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proshansky|first=Harold M.|last2=Fabian|first2=Abbe K.|last3=Kaminoff|first3=Robert|title=Place-identity: Physical world socialization of the self|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494483800218|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=57–83|doi=10.1016/s0272-4944(83)80021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Place Dependence or Functional Attachment ===

Defined as a functional relationship based on the conditions provided for a place in order to satisfy the needs of a person or accomplish a specific goal. Also depends on how is evaluated in other places, answering the question, "What can I do in this place that I can't do in other places?". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Christopher M.|last2=Brown|first2=Gregory|last3=Weber|first3=Delene|title=The measurement of place attachment: Personal, community, and environmental connections|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494410000794|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=422–434|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional attachment depends on certain characteristics related to the place, as how much this area is compatible with a person, as they can carry out their activities and goals, this type of attachment is common in those who practice green exercise. This kind of attachment grows exponentially in relation to the number of visits. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=D.|last2=Vaske|first2=J. J.|date=|title=The Measurement of Place Attachment: Validity and Generalizability of a Psychometric Approach.|url=|journal=Forest Science|volume=46|issue=6|pages=830-840|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Benefits related to Place Attachment ===

The benefits related to place attachment include the ability to build memories as the person is capable to connect with his ancestors past, the feeling of belonging to a place, the personal growth as it provides the opportunity to experience positive emotions as a result from a healthy relationship with the place, so the person can feel security and freedom. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scannell|first=Leila|last2=Gifford|first2=Robert|title=The experienced psychological benefits of place attachment|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494417300518|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=51|pages=256–269|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring attachment ===

[[psychometrics|Psychometric]] and [[Likert scale]]s are the most commonly used quantitative methods for different dimensions of place attachment, such as belongingness and identity. Meanings of places are often quantitatively studied by asking participants to score a set list of places on the basis of 12 categories: aesthetic, heritage, family connection, recreation, therapeutic, biological diversity, wilderness, home, intrinsic, spiritual, economic, life-sustaining, learning, and future.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt; Another example of quantitative measurements are frequency counts with word associations.&lt;ref name=Rollero /&gt;
Qualitative research has been conducted with the intention to gain insight into meanings that places possess. Some of the techniques used for qualitative research are free association tasks, in-depth interviews, and verbal reports from focus groups.&lt;ref name="Lewica: review of pa history" /&gt;

=== Memory association ===

[[Memory|Memories]] combine [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s and [[perception]]s to create images that can be used to retain and recall information or past experiences. Over time, memories collectively allow an individual to develop feelings of familiarity that comprise a [[sense of place]]. When an interactive experience with three-dimensional space does not match these developed expectations, an individual adapts his or her understanding of place through learning and sensory input. For this reason, places are frequently associated with memories that can evoke physical senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Othman|first=Sumaiyah|author2=Nishimura, Yukio |author3=Kubota, Aya |title=Memory Association in Place Making: A review|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2013|volume=85|pages=554–563|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of memories means that place identities are subject to change. Memories of places and individual preferences for specific places both change over time.&lt;ref name="Morgan, attachment theory" /&gt; Adults tend to focus on the emotions, meanings, and contextual implications of feelings in association with places. Children, however, focus on physical aspects of environments and what can be performed in various environments, which can be seen in the popularity of “pretend” and imagination games among children.&lt;ref name="Morgan, attachment theory" /&gt; Consequently, childhood memories of places are typically oriented around heavily emotional, intense, or euphoric events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebba|first=Rachel|title=The landscapes of childhood: the reflection of childhood's environment in adult memories and in children's attitudes|journal=Environment and Behaviour|year=1991|volume=23|issue=4|pages=395–422|doi=10.1177/0013916591234001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Disaster psychology ===
A healthy emotional relationship between a city or neighborhood and its inhabitants maintains the culture and positive attitudes despite any detrimental events that may be occurring in that city or neighborhood (i.e. people having an increased sense of security even if they live in a war zone). When forced relocation occurs, refugees experience a [[grieving process]] similar to when loved ones are lost. Through reconstruction of place, the familiarity of an attachment to places lost can be mimicked to relieve stress and grief.&lt;ref name="Scannell (tripartite)" /&gt;

=== Space planning ===
An understanding of the psychological factors responsible for place attachment is important for the effective development of place loyalty that allows cities and towns to flourish.&lt;ref name = "Florek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Florek|first=Magdalena|title=No place like home: Perspectives on place attachment and impacts on city management|journal=Journal of Town &amp; City Management|year=2011|volume=1|issue=4|pages=346–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, successful places address the needs or maintain the cultural integrities and meanings that communities have placed upon them.&lt;ref name = "Manzo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manzo|first=Lynne C.|author2=Perkins, Douglas D. |title=Finding Common Ground: The Importance of Place Attachment to Community Participation and Planning|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|year=2006|volume=20|issue=4|pages=335–350|doi=10.1177/0885412205286160|url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/ManzoPerkins.2006.Neighborhoods-as-common-ground.JPL_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, additions of buildings or monuments&lt;ref name = "Manzo" /&gt; and creation of outdoor recreational spaces&lt;ref name=Schroeder /&gt; must be well-aligned with a community’s place attachment to prevent backlash from inhabitants that do not agree with the intended land developments.&lt;ref name = "Manzo" /&gt;

=== Senior communities ===

In [[economics]], '''polytomous choice''' is a setting (model) with more than ''two'' choices; contrast to [[dichotomous choice]]. The use of the term [[polychotomous]] is also in common usage in the prior research literature; however, polytomous is the more technically correct spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, David J. (1995). “Polychtomous or Polytomous?,” Applied Psychological Measurement, Vol. 19, No. 1, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Progress charts''' are tools used in classrooms, in child care centers, and in homes across the world.  They are used to promote good behaviors and reward children for those behaviors, which is why they are also known as [[behavior chart]]s.  They can be used in a variety of situations and they can come in a variety of styles.  Progress charts are easy to use and promote positive reinforcement.

==What is it?==
A progress chart is a reward system.  It involves stickers or stars, and a chart that can be either printed off or made by hand.  The main goal of a progress chart is to track children's learning or behavior.  It can be used to curb bad behaviors and to encourage good behaviors. It is inexpensive and can be changed to fit different situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morin|first1=Amy|title=Sticker Charts:Motivate Your Preschooler with a Reward System|url=http://discipline.about.com/od/increasepositivebehaviors/a/Sticker-Charts-Motivate-Your-Preschooler-With-A-Reward-System.htm|website=About Parenting|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child earns stickers for the desired behavior and after so many stars, earns a reward.

==Variety==
The [[Raising Children Network]] agrees that you can either make a chart or you can find them just about anywhere on the internet. Children all have different needs when learning, so these charts can help children of any age with anything from potty training to reading books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Reward Charts Successfully|url=http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/reward_charts.html|publisher=Raising Children Network|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Progress charts can be used at home as well as in daycares and in schools.  These charts can be individualized throughout classrooms, where children can learn to make their own specialized ones.  There are several types of charts that parents, caregivers, and educators can use.

==Types==

* [[Chore chart]]
* Behavior charts
** Single behavior charts
**Multiple behavior charts
* Homework charts
* Toilet training charts

Single behavior charts can be used for all ages and is best used for learning one skill at a time. Multiple behavior charts also can be used for a variety of ages and can be used for processes that require several steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Downloadables! Child Behavior Charts: How to Use Behavior Charts Effectively|url=http://www.empoweringparents.com/How-to-Use-Behavior-Charts-Effectively.php#|website=Empowering Parents|publisher=Legacy Publishing Company|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chore charts and behavior charts can each be used for several different situations.  On the other hand, Homework charts and toilet training charts are used for what their titles suggest.  Experts advise only using one [[chart]] at a time though, otherwise children can get confused and so can the adult. Charts like these can be found on several websites which have pages of downloadable charts that you can print off.  They have a big variety of styles for their charts that can be used for different ages.  All of these charts can be manipulated in order to fit each child's needs easily as well.

==Benefits==
The benefits of progress charts include motivation for a certain task, and clear expectations for that task or skill.  It provides a visual picture of goal setting and helps the child to achieve the goal and be able to receive a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandeen|first1=Del|title=Reward Chart for Children|url=http://kids.lovetoknow.com/reward-chart-children|website=lovetoknow|publisher=LoveToKnow Corp.|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a solid basis to a skill that children will have to know in the future—setting goals and achieving them.  The charts give children immediate feedback and this usually invokes fewer consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Downloadables! Child Behavior Charts: How to Use Behavior Charts Effectively|url=http://www.empoweringparents.com/How-to-Use-Behavior-Charts-Effectively.php#|website=Empowering Parents|publisher=Legacy Publishing Company|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rewards==
Rewards don't have to be very elaborate, but can be simple.  It's best if rewards are given right away as stickers should be given right away, so that the child knows what the reward is for exactly.  The goal of the reward is to keep the child continuing this behavior or skill. Dr. Virginia Shiller, a psychologist and instructor at the [[Yale Child Study Center]] and coauthor of the book Rewards for Kids, rewards can help parents teach their children new habits. Shiller says the key is in how the incentives are given; in setting appropriate, realistic goals; and in figuring out a strategy to achieve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PBS parents|url=https://www.pbs.org/parents/special/article-finance-should-you-give-kids-rewards.html|website=pbs.org|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PullApart''' is a UK-based, independent packaging [[recycling]] classification system. Applied at the kerbside, it combines [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to provide customers with a measurement of the ease with which specific types of packaging may be recycled locally. The process was invented by Michael Butler of [[Dawlish]] in 2005, and is operated for free.

[[Image:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|left|thumbnail|290px|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]

==Methodology==
As PullApart is applied to existing [[local authority]]-installed recycling bin [[refuse collection]] systems, its scoring scheme is dependent on individual local authorities’ own packaging disassembly practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=820 |title=Teignbridge refuse collection systems |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=teignbridge.gov.uk |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613210020/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=820 |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sample packaging is disassembled, according to the Local Authority’s process, rearranged and its components graded for ease of recycling. The raw information from this exercise is also made available to the public.

A final, consumer-oriented "PAC" ('''P'''ull'''A'''part '''C'''ode) score is achieved by measuring what proportion of a product's components is recyclable from the kerbside. The PAC score is represented by 13 stages of ‘traffic light’ grading.

{{ambox | textstyle = text-align: justify; | text = A simplified mathematical representation of PullApart's kerbside scoring system.
Determining local recyclability only, by weight:&lt;br /&gt;
A packaging's non-recyclable is divided by its recyclable. If &lt;= 1 then its GOOD; if &gt; 1 its BAD.
The nearer to zero it is, the better, and the greater above 1, the worse.
Please note: Weight is not the only consideration, there are others including volume, therefore the analysis is more complex than the above.}}

==Broader aims==
PullApart’s stated aims are to [[Advocacy groups|encourage]], [[Manufacturing|manufactures]], [[Retailing|retailers]], [[Food production|food]] and [[Agriculture|agricultural]] producers to give greater weight to the ease of disposal and recycling in their [[packaging]] designs. Weighting the consumers point of view equally to that of packaging manufactures, retailers and recyclers, in the handling of domestic waste products for [[kerbside collection]]s. To provide consumers with information enabling product choice ([[ethical consumerism]]), that's easy, local and totally kerbside recyclable. Furnishing an unambiguous tool, that measures the differences between those mentioned above, assisting in the optimisation of products for the goal of near [[Zero waste]].

According to PullApart’s current [[Teignbridge]] (2011) survey of over 2000 products, 2.84% are ideally suited for kerbside recycling and a further 29.32% are good, whilst the rest fail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pullapart.co.uk/ PullApart's Teignbridge survey:] 2011 (constantly updated)&lt;/ref&gt; The sample area, Teignbridge, and therefore Teignbridge District Council, has a current recycling rate of 57% (2008/2009), (by weight).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10370 Teignbridge District Council's recycling rate:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613210704/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=10370 |date=2011-06-13 }} 2008/2009 - 57%&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from their [[Periodical publication|periodical]], “Teignbridge Life” explaining to local people how PullApart works: “The online packaging recycling guide features a free search function which classifies ordinary consumer products, like cereal boxes, with a 'PullApart' rating. The rating breaks the product down into its components, explaining which parts can be recycled in Teignbridge.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5967 Teignbridge Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827083754/http://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5967 |date=2010-08-27 }} Summer 2009(a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] download)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ambox | textstyle = text-align: justify; | text = A simplified measurement of effectiveness.
From a local consumer's perspective, the combined effectiveness of both packaging and their local kerbside recycling is simply determined by:&lt;br /&gt;
The percentage of easy “green” packaging (taken from PullApart's 2011 survey), divided by the number of kerbside collection bins and bags. For Teignbridge areas A and B, this is (at the time of writing), 32.16% / 4 = 8.04  and for their communal area C its 32.16% / 6 = 5.36 out of a maximum of 100 (totally easy “green” kerbside packaging into just one collection bin or bag).}}

==Awards for the scheme==
PullApart is considered to be of “Environmental Best Practice” by The Green Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenorganisation.info/ Green Apple Awards] Green Apple Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other efforts==
{{main | sustainable packaging}}
Worldwide there are broader packaging scoring systems that address the full environmental impact of packaging. Recycling being one factor, other vital considerations include the use of recycled materials in the package, avoidance of toxic substances, minimization of packaging, effects on atmosphere (greenhouse gas, VOC, etc.), use of [[renewable resource]]s, etc.   Efforts involve methodologies such as [[life cycle assessment]] to inventory the all environmental impacts and factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''revelation principle''' is a fundamental principle in [[mechanism design]]. It states that if a [[social choice function]] can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism (i.e. if that mechanism has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to the outcome of the social choice function), then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism (i.e. in which players [[Incentive compatibility|truthfully report]] type) with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs).&lt;ref name="AGT"&gt;{{Cite Algorithmic Game Theory 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–225}}

In [[mechanism design]], the revelation principle is of utmost importance in finding solutions. The researcher need only look at the set of equilibrium characterized by [[incentive compatibility]]. That is, if the mechanism designer wants to implement some outcome or property, he can restrict his search to mechanisms in which agents are willing to reveal their private information to the mechanism designer that has that outcome or property. If no such direct and truthful mechanism exists, no mechanism can implement this outcome/property. By narrowing the area needed to be searched, the problem of finding a mechanism becomes much easier.

The principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of [[Incentive compatibility|incentive-compatibility]]:
*The ''dominant-strategy revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in [[Strategic dominance|dominant-strategies]] can be implemented by a  [[Strategyproofness|dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC)]] mechanism (introduced by [[Allan Gibbard]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard, A. 1973. Manipulation of voting schemes: a general result. Econometrica 41, 587–601.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*The ''Bayesian-Nash revelation-principle'' says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium ([[Bayesian game]], i.e. game of incomplete information) can be implemented by a [[Incentive compatibility|Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatibility (BNIC)]] mechanism. This broader solution concept was introduced by Dasgupta, Hammond and [[Eric Maskin|Maskin]],&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, P., Hammond, P. and Maskin, E. 1979. The implementation of social choice rules: some results on incentive compatibility. Review of Economic Studies 46, 185–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmstrom,&lt;ref&gt;Holmstrom, B. 1977. On incentives and control in organizations. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, R. 1979. Incentive-compatibility and the bargaining problem. Econometrica 47, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider the following example. There is a certain item that Alice values as &lt;math&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob values as &lt;math&gt;v_B&lt;/math&gt;. The government needs to decide who will receive that item and in what terms. 
* A ''social-choice-function'' is a function that maps a set of individual ''preferences'' to a social outcome. An example function is the [[utilitarian]] function, which says "give the item to a person that values it the most". We denote a social choice function by '''Soc''' and its recommended outcome given a set of preferences by '''Soc(Prefs)'''.
* A ''mechanism'' is a rule that maps a set of individual ''actions'' to a social outcome. A mechanism '''Mech''' induces a [[game theory|game]] which we denote by '''Game(Mech)'''.
* A mechanism '''Mech''' is said to ''implement'' a social-choice-function '''Soc''' if, for every combination of individual preferences, there is a [[Nash equilibrium]] in '''Game(Mech)''' in which the outcome is '''Soc(Prefs)'''. Two example mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says a number between 1 and 10. The item is given to the individual who says the lowest number; if both say the same number, then the item is given to Alice". This mechanism does NOT implement the utilitarian function, since for every individual who wants the item, it is a dominant strategy to say "1" regardless of his/her true value. This means that in equilibrium the item is always given to Alice, even if Bob values it more.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is a mechanism which implements the utilitarian function. For example, if &lt;math&gt;v_B&gt;v_A&lt;/math&gt;, then any action profile in which Bob bids more than Alice and both bids are in the range &lt;math&gt;(v_A,v_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a Nash-equilibrium in which the item goes to Bob. Additionally, if the valuations of Alice and Bob are random variables drawn independently from the same distribution, then there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] in which the item goes to the bidder with the highest value.
* A ''direct-mechanism'' is a mechanism in which the set of actions available to each player is just the set of possible preferences of the player. 
* A direct-mechanism '''Mech''' is said to be ''Bayesian-Nash-[[Incentive-compatible]] (BNIC)'' if there is a [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]] of '''Game(Mech)''' in which all players reveal their true preferences. Some example direct-mechanisms are:
** "Each individual says how much he values the item. The item is given to the individual that said the highest value. In case of a tie, the item is given to Alice". This mechanism is NOT BNIC, since a player who wants the item is better-off by saying the highest possible value, regardless of his true value.
** [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] is also NOT BNIC, since the winner is always better-off by bidding the lowest value that is slightly above the loser's bid.
** However, if the distribution of the players' valuations is known, then there is [[First-price sealed-bid auction#Incentive-compatible_variant|a variant]] which is BNIC and implements the utilitarian function.
** Moreover, it is known that [[Second price auction]] is BNIC (it is even IC in a stronger sense - dominant-strategy IC). Additionally, it implements the utilitarian function.

== Proof ==
Suppose we have an arbitrary mechanism '''Mech''' that implements '''Soc'''.

We construct a direct mechanism '''Mech'''' that is truthful and implements '''Soc'''.

'''Mech'''' simply simulates the equilibrium strategies of the players in Game('''Mech'''). I.e:
* '''Mech'''' asks the players to report their valuations.
* Based on the reported valuations, '''Mech'''' calculates, for each player, his equilibrium strategy in '''Mech'''.
* '''Mech'''' returns the outcome returned by '''Mech'''.

Reporting the true valuations in '''Mech'''' is like playing the equilibrium strategies in '''Mech'''. Hence, reporting the true valuations is a Nash equilibrium in '''Mech'''', as desired. Moreover, the equilibrium payoffs are the same, as desired.

==In correlated equilibrium==
The revelation principle says that for every arbitrary ''coordinating device'' a.k.a. correlating there exists another direct device for which the state space equals the action space of each player.  Then the coordination is done by directly informing each player of his action.

'''Romina Ressia''' (born March 11, 1981) is a multi-award winning photographer and artist from Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is well known for her anachronisms and her strong [[Renaissance]] influence. Her works have been featured by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[Interview Magazine|Interview]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Vogue Italia]]'' and ''The Wild Magazine'', among others. ''The Wall Street International'' wrote, "Romina's photography provokes and challenges us to confront things which may seem uncomfortable however manages to provide a reassuring quality. This juxtaposition between comfort and uncomfortable is a powerful one which resonates throughout her practice."&lt;ref name="Hide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Romina Ressia. HIde &amp; Seek|url=http://wsimag.com/art/14091-romina-ressia-hide-and-seek|publisher=|work=The Wall Street International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ressia was born on March 11, 1981, in [[Azul, Buenos Aires]], Argentina. At the age of 19 she moved to Capital Federal to study, where she graduated as an accountant with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. She later abandoned those professions to devote herself to [[photography]]. She studied photography, [[art direction]] and [[scenery]] at several institutions, including the [[Teatro Colon]].

She started in fashion photography but was gradually moving to fine arts, venturing beyond photography into [[mixed media]]. Her works are represented by galleries in the UK, New York, Switzerland and Italy, and they have also been exhibited in cities such as Milan, Zurich, Paris and Buenos Aires.

The '''separation of mechanism and policy'''&lt;ref&gt;Butler W. Lampson and Howard E. Sturgis. ''[http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/15-ReflectionsOnOS/Acrobat.pdf Reflections on an Operating System Design]'' [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360051.360074] Communications of the ACM  19(5):251-265 (May 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[software design|design]] principle in [[computer science]].  It states that mechanisms (those parts of a system implementation that control the [[authorization]] of operations and the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]]) should not dictate (or overly restrict) the policies according to which decisions are made about which operations to authorize, and which resources to allocate.

This is most commonly discussed in the context of security mechanisms (authentication and authorization), but is actually applicable to a much wider range of resource allocation
problems (e.g. [[Scheduling (computing)|CPU scheduling]], [[memory allocation]], [[quality of service]]), and the general 
question of good object abstraction.

[[Per Brinch Hansen]] introduced the concept of separation of policy and mechanism in operating systems in the [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Per Brinch Hansen • IEEE Computer Society|url = http://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-per-hansen|website = www.computer.org|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artsy and Livny, in a 1987 paper, discussed an approach for an operating system design having an "extreme separation of mechanism and policy".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. S., &amp; Drexler, K. E. (1988). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033556/http://www.agorics.com/Library/agoricpapers/aos/aos.4.html "Markets and computation: Agoric open systems"]. In Huberman, B. A. (Ed.). (1988), pp. 133–176. ''The Ecology of Computation''. North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artsy, Yeshayahu ''et al.'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 article, Chervenak et al. described the principles of ''mechanism neutrality'' and ''policy neutrality''.&lt;ref&gt;Chervenak 2000 p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale and implications==

The separation of mechanism and policy is the fundamental approach of a [[microkernel]] that distinguishes it from a [[Monolithic kernel|monolithic]] one. In a microkernel the majority of operating system services are provided by user-level server processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphael Finkel]], [[Michael L. Scott]], Artsy Y. and Chang, H. ''[www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/1989_IEEETSE_Charlotte.pdf Experience with Charlotte: simplicity and function in a distributed operating system]. IEEE Trans. Software Engng 15:676-685; 1989. Extended abstract presented at the IEEE Workshop on Design Principles for Experimental Distributed Systems, Purdue University; 1986. &lt;/ref&gt; It is important for an [[operating system]] to have the flexibility of providing adequate mechanisms to support the broadest possible spectrum of real-world security policies.&lt;ref&gt;R. Spencer, S. Smalley, P. Loscocco, M. Hibler, D. Andersen, and J. Lepreau ''[http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/papers/flask-usenixsec99-abs.html The Flask Security Architecture: System Support for Diverse Security Policies]'' In Proceedings of the Eighth USENIX Security Symposium, pages 123–139, Aug. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is almost impossible to envision all of the different ways in which a system might be used by different types of users over the life of the product.  This means that any hard-coded policies are likely to be inadequate or inappropriate for some (or perhaps even most) potential users.
Decoupling the mechanism implementations from the policy specifications makes it possible for different applications to use the same mechanism implementations with different policies.  This means that those mechanisms are likely to better meet the needs of a wider range of users, for a longer period of time.

If it is possible to enable new policies without changing the implementing mechanisms, the costs and risks of such policy changes can be greatly reduced. In the first instance, this could be accomplished merely by segregating mechanisms and their policies into distinct modules: by replacing the module which dictates a policy (e.g. CPU scheduling policy) without changing the module which executes this policy (e.g. the scheduling mechanism), we can change the behaviour of the system.  Further, in cases where a wide or variable range of policies are anticipated depending on applications' needs, it makes sense to create some non-code means for specifying policies, i.e. policies are not hardcoded into executable code but can be specified as an independent description.  For instance, file protection policies (e.g.  [[Filesystem permissions|Unix's ''user/group/other read/write/execute'']]) might be parametrized. Alternatively an implementing mechanism could be designed to include an interpreter for a new policy specification language. In both cases, the systems are usually accompanied by a {{clarify-span|deferred binding|date=August 2013}} mechanism (e.g. [[configuration file]]s, or [[Application programming interface|API]]s) that permits policy specifications to be incorporated to the system or replaced by another after it has been delivered to the customer.

An everyday example of mechanism/policy separation is the use of [[Keycard lock|card keys]] to gain access to locked doors. The mechanisms (magnetic card readers, remote controlled locks, connections to a security server) do not impose any limitations on entrance policy (which people should be allowed to enter which doors, at which times). These decisions are made by a centralized security server, which (in turn) probably makes its decisions by consulting a database of room access rules. Specific authorization decisions can be changed by updating a room access database. If the rule schema of that database proved too limiting, the entire security server could be replaced while leaving the fundamental mechanisms (readers, locks, and connections) unchanged.

Contrast this with issuing physical keys:  if you want to change who can open a door, you have to issue new keys and change the lock.  This intertwines the unlocking mechanisms with the access policies.  For a hotel, this is significantly less effective than using key cards.

[[File:Diensthund.jpg|thumb]]
The term '''shock collar''' is a term used in order to describe a family of [[Dog training|training]] collars (also called '''e-collars''', '''Ecollars''', '''remote training collars''', '''Zap collars''', or '''electronic collars''') that deliver [[electrical shock]]s of varying intensity and duration to the neck of a dog (they can also be applied to other places on the dog's body, to achieve various training effects) via a radio-controlled electronic device incorporated into a dog collar. Some collar models also include a tone or vibrational setting, as an alternative to or in conjunction with the shock. Others include integration with Internet mapping capabilities and GPS to locate the dog or alert an owner of his/her whereabouts.

Originally used in the late 1960s to train hunting dogs, early collars were very high powered. Many modern versions are capable of delivering very low levels of shock.  Shock collars are now readily available and have been used in a range of applications, including behavioral modification, obedience training, and pet containment, as well as military, police and service training.  While similar systems are available for other animals, the most common are the collars designed for [[domestic dog]]s.

The most common use of shock collars is pet containment systems that are used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence.  Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above ground installation to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire around the perimeter of the yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences which do carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of unauthorized or defective installation or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar worn by the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lindsay|2005|p=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar will activate.

===Bark control collars===
Bark control collars are used to curb excessive or nuisance barking by delivering a shock at the moment the dog begins barking. Bark collars can be activated by microphone or vibration, and some of the most advanced collars use both sound and vibration to eliminate the possibility of extraneous noises activating a response.

===Training collars or remote trainers===
Training collars can be activated by a handheld device. Better quality remote trainers have a large variety of levels and functions, can give varying duration of stimulation, better quality stimulation, and have a beep or vibration option useful for getting the dog’s attention.  Proper training is an imperative for remote collar use, as misuse can cause negative behavioral fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Polsky|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recommend consulting a behaviorist or a certified training professional who is experienced with shock collars for successful usage and application.

Shock collars may be used in conjunction with [[positive reinforcement]] and / or utilizing other principles of [[operant conditioning]], depending on the trainer's methods either as a form of [[positive punishment]], where the shock is applied at the moment an undesired behavior occurs, in order to reduce the frequency of that behavior; or as a form of [[Reinforcement (psychology)|negative reinforcement]], where a continuous stimulation is applied until the moment a desired behavior occurs, in order to increase the frequency of that behavior.

==Frame of reference==
[[Electrical shock]] is the physiological reaction, sensation, or injury caused by electric current passing through the body. It occurs upon contact of a body part with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles, or hair.

Commenting in his textbook on training and behaviour, Steven Lindsay wrote about the public perception of the term "shock" and its application in the description of training aids; "At low levels, the term shock is hardly fitting to describe the effects produced by electronic training collars, since there is virtually no effect beyond a pulsing tingling or tickling sensation on the surface of the skin ... the word shock is loaded with biased connotations, images of convulsive spasms and burns, and implications associated with extreme physical pain, emotional trauma, physiological collapse, and laboratory abuses ... the stimulus or signal generated by most modern devices is highly controlled and presented to produce a specific set of behavioral and motivational responses to it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the trade magazine "Office for veterinary service and food control", Dr. Dieter Klein compared the effects of shock collars with other electrical stimulation products; "Modern devices ... are in a range in which normally no organic damage is being inflicted. The electric properties and performances of the modern low current remote stimulation devices ... are comparable to the electric stimulation devices used in human medicine. Organic damage, as a direct impact of the applied current, can be excluded.” &lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dieter R., 2000, How Dangerous are Remote Stimulation Devices for the Training of Dogs?” Amtstierärztlicher Dienst und Lebensmittelkontrolle&lt;/ref&gt;

"At 0.914 joules the electric muscle stimulation and contractions a human receives from an 'abdominal energizer' fitness product is exponentially stronger — more than 1,724 times stronger— than the impulse a dog receives from a pet containment collar set at its highest level."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical considerations==
Electric shock can be characterised in terms of voltage, current, waveform, frequency (of waveform), pulse rate and duration. 
Although voltage, current and duration of shock can be used to calculate the amount of energy applied (in [[Joules]]), these are not indicators of the intensity of the stimulus or how it may be perceived by the recipient.  Static electric shocks that are experienced in daily life are of the order of 20,000 to 25,000 volts, and yet are not painful or physically damaging because they are of very low current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Binns |first1=Corey |title=The Shocking Truth Behind Static Electricity |url=https://www.livescience.com/4077-shocking-truth-static-electricity.html |website=LiveScience |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on design, shock collars can be set so that the shock delivered is only mildly uncomfortable.  Variable settings of this kind are essential, so that the shock collar can be adjusted to the level that the dog requires, as situations change.

Shock collars are sometimes referred to as delivering a "static shock"; however, static electricity is [[direct current]] and carries little energy (order of millijoules). Shock collars make use of [[alternating current]]. It is therefore inappropriate to refer to shock collars as delivering a static shock.

In order to deliver consistent shocks, good contact must be made between the collar electrodes and the dog's skin (the collar must be fitted according to the manufacturer's instructions). Local humidity and individual variation in coat density, skin thickness and surface conductivity, will also affect the delivery of the shock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The waveform, its frequency, the pulse rate, current, voltage and impedance are important determinants of likely response. "Many e−collars appear to shift intensity levels by altering the pulse duration or repetition rate while keeping the output current and voltage relatively constant, depending on the electrode−skin load." (Lindsay 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;573).

Individual variations in temperament, pain sensitivity and susceptibility to startle of dogs, means that shock settings must be carefully adjusted to produce a shock that is perceived by the dog as only just aversive enough to stop the dog engaging in the unwanted behaviour.  Normally salient stimuli, such as noises, commands and even shocks, may have no effect on a dog that is highly aroused and focused on an activity such as hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Potential to cause harm==
In 1980 (revised 1987), the US [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM), a branch of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), concurred in regulatory action against a manufacturer of a bark collar, stating "Complaints received, which were later corroborated by our own testing, included severe burns in the collar area and possible personality adjustment injuries to the dogs. The shocking mechanism was found to be activated not only by barking but by vehicle horns, slamming doors or any other loud noise. CVM concurred in regulatory action against the device since it was deemed to be dangerous to the health of the animal.".&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074684.htm | title= FDA Compliance enforcement| author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standing policy of the US FDA is that "Dog collars which are activated by the noise of barking to produce an electric shock are considered as hazardous to the health of the animal."&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

No regulations exist specifying the performance characteristics or reliability of these devices, so there is considerable variation in shock level and waveform characteristics between manufacturers, and perhaps even between batches of collars from a single manufacturer. The lack of regulation or standards, and the fact that some of the safety features of shock collars are patented by specific manufacturers,&lt;ref name="Innotek Patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everypatent.com/comp/pat6184790.html | title= Innotek patent| author=Innotek}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that the safety and operational characteristics of individual products cannot be verified.

== Training effectiveness ==
[[File:Shock collar.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shock%20collar.jpg|thumb|Shock Collar]]{{Cleanup section|reason=has footnotes that aren't inline citations|date=June 2018}}

The debate over the effectiveness of shock collars is highly debated, however it is not one sided. Each side has a wide variety of backers and activists from professors, to activists, and trainers. 

According to Pat Nolan, who has been training dogs for over thirty years, shock training is a key and effective use to train dogs (Nolan, 2011). According to his methods described in his book regular and fair use is key in shock training. He goes into detail about what fair use is, stating that keeping a regular training schedule is key and to set some boundaries your pet will understand (Nolan, 2011).

== Deterring predation in the wild ==
The Wildlife Society article addresses the use of shock collars as a way to prevent sheep from being preyed upon by wild [[coyote]]s. According to (Phillips, 1999)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andelt|first=William F.|last2=Phillips|first2=Robert L.|last3=Gruver|first3=Kenneth S.|last4=Guthrie|first4=Jerry W.|date=1999|title=Coyote Predation on Domestic Sheep Deterred with Electronic Dog-Training Collar|jstor=3783933|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin (1973-2006)|volume=27|issue=1|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; they tested these collars on coyotes for a four-month period and found that the collars stopped thirteen attacks on sheep herds. This also is said to deter future attacks by the tested coyotes. Collars have also been used on wolves for similar reasons. This document is the assessment of the shock collar on wolves’ long-term behavior. The article talks about trying to alter [[wolves]]’ behavior over an extended period of time using the collar. The consensus was while it did have an effect while in use and temporally after it was removed, the study concluded that longer exposure would be needed in order to have any substantial evidence (Hawley, 2008). As far as non-lethal alternatives these two sources both concluded that shock collars are the most effective deterrence to predators. Both groups continued their research and the [[The Wildlife Society|Wildlife Society]] has developed a new and improved version that eliminates the risk of neck injury when used on animals that previous versions caused. They have increased battery life and the durability of the unit. They devised a unit that is worn like a back pack for the animal. Previous versions caused excessive rubbing and soreness as well as being irritating for the animal to the point were they would try to take the harness off.

==Scientific studies==

===Christiansen et al study (2001a)===
Christiansen et al., looked at behavioural differences between three breeds of dogs when confronted by domestic sheep (138 dogs; Elkhounds, hare hunting dogs and English setters).&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Frank O. 2001, pp. 115-129"&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural differences between three breed groups of hunting dogs confronted with domestic sheep . Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72(2), pp. 115-129. .&lt;/ref&gt; Two testing procedures were used and shock collars were used to deter attacks on sheep. The first, a path test, involved observing the dogs' reactions to a set of novel stimuli (rag pulled across the track, bundle of cans thrown down, tethered sheep at 5m) as it was walked. The second test involved monitoring the dog's reaction to a free-roaming sheep flock in a field. In this study they identified several factors that predicted a high hunting motivation and attack severity. These were lack of previous opportunity to chase sheep, low fearfulness towards gunshots and unfamiliar people and general interest in sheep when encountering them. Younger dogs (&lt;3 years of age) showed more pronounced initial hunting motivation and more frequent attacks. Elkhounds showed more hunting behaviour, more attacks and were more frequently given electric shocks during the tests. A shock collar was used to deter attacks on the sheep during the experiments. Shocks (3000V, 0.4A, duration 1 second) were delivered when dogs came within a distance of 1-2m of the sheep, and were repeated until the dogs left the area. The objective was to suppress an attack, but not to damage the hunting ability of the dogs. Despite frequently initiated chases and attacks, few shocks were delivered. This was because few dogs approached closer than 1–2 m, and the intention was to deter proximity to sheep rather than to associate hunting behaviour with an aversive shock, which would impair future hunting behaviour in other contexts.

===Christiansen et al. study (2001b)===
The dogs used in the first study were re-tested using the same procedures in order to assess the long-term impact of the training on their reaction to sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural changes and aversive conditioning in hunting dogs by the second-year confrontation with domestic sheep. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72, pp. 131-143. .&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p&lt;0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed to the use of the shock collar. When comparing owners’ reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p &lt; 0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs which received el. shocks the first year needed el. shocks also the second year.The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of el. shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that el. shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented "In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with special competence on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device."

===Salgirli dissertation (2008)===

The aim of Salgirli's study was "...to investigate whether any stress is caused by the use of specific conditioned signal, quitting signal, and/or pinch collars as alternatives to electric training collars, and if they do so, whether the stress produced in the process is comparable to the one with electric training collars.".&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"&gt;http://elib.tiho-hannover.de/dissertations/salgirliy_ws08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study population were a group of 42 adult police dogs. The quitting signal was a conditioned frustration equivalent to [[negative punishment]]. It was conditioned by associating failure to obtain an anticipated food reward with a specific vocal signal. In the test, dogs were walked past a "provocateur" who attempted to taunt the dog into a reaction. If the dog reacted, it was punished, and if it failed to react on subsequent provocations then the punishment was deemed to have had a learning effect. The study is therefore a comparison of negative and positive punishment methods, and not a comparison of punishment with positive reinforcement. Learning effect was measured by assessing the number of dogs that learned to quit a behaviour after application of the punishing stimulus. There was no statistical difference in learning effect between the pinch and shock collar, but the quitting signal produced a significantly poorer learning effect compared to shock or pinch collars (p &lt; 0.01 in both cases). "Although the pinch collar caused more behavioral reactions, in the form of distress, than the electronic training collar, the electronic training collar elicits more vocal reactions in dogs than the pinch collars"; the explanation for increased vocalisation in the shock collar group was that this was due to a startle response rather than pain reactions.

Salivary cortisol was monitored to measure the stress levels of the dogs, but this data was not presented in the dissertation; behavioral observation was the sole measure of stress.  The study concluded that the electronic training collar induces less distress and shows stronger “learning effect” in dogs in comparison to the pinch collar. Commenting on the quitting signal, the author stated "It should particularly be mentioned, that the quitting signal training was implied only on adult dogs within the frame of this study. Therefore, the results should not be interpreted as that the quitting signal can not be a suitable method in police dog training. As previously stated training of the quitting signal requires a hard and a structured procedure. Thus, if the training, namely the conditioning, begins in puppyhood, the quitting signal can also be an effective method in police dog training". Comparing the effects of the three punishment methods; "These results can probably be explained by that electronic training collar complies completely with the punishment criteria, which were defined by TORTORA (1982), in case of proof of the proficient and experienced user. On the other hand when applying the pinch collar, these criteria can not be met even though perfect timing is applied since reactions of the dog and effectiveness of the method depends on several different factors such as the willingness, strength and motivation of the handler, as well as his/her proficiency. In addition to that, the visibility of the administrator and, thus, of the punishment is another important factor influencing the efficiency of the pinch collar because the dog directly links the punishment with its owner. Therefore this method does not satisfy the ‘‘punishment criteria’’ at all. The quitting signal on the other hand requires criteria, such as good timing and structured training procedure, on account of complete conditioning in order to achieve effective results. Even if these criteria are met, the personality trait of the dog is another factor, which influences the efficiency of the signal."&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"/&gt;

===Schalke et al. study (2007)===

Schalke et al. conducted a 7-month study to investigate the effect of shock collars on stress parameters, in a series of different training situations.&lt;ref&gt;Schalke, E., Stichnoth, J., Ott, S., Jones-Baade, R., 2007, Clinical signs caused by the use of electric training collars on dogs in everyday life situations. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 105, pp. 369-380.&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rate and saliva cortisol were used to determine the stress levels in three groups of dogs. Group A received the electric shock when they touched the "prey" (a rabbit dummy attached to a motion device), Group H ("here" command) received the electric shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting, and Group R (random) received random shocks that were unpredictable and out of context.  Group A did not show a significant rise in cortisol levels; the other two groups (R &amp; H) did show a significant rise, with group R showing the highest level of cortisol. Salivary cortisol was measured, as this procedure is less likely to cause stress related rise in cortisol.

From this the researchers concluded that the dogs who could clearly associate the shock with their action (i.e. touching the prey) and as a result were able to predict and control whether they received a shock, did not show considerable or persistent stress.  The evidence of increased stress in the other groups was felt to support earlier findings that poor timing and/or inappropriate use of a shock collar puts the dog at high risk of severe and ongoing stress.  They conclude that "The results of this study suggest that poor timing in the application of high level electric pulses, such as those used in this study, means there is a high risk that dogs will show severe and persistent stress symptoms. We recommend that the use of these devices should be restricted with proof of theoretical and practical qualification required and then the use of these devices should only be allowed in strictly specified situations."

===Schilder &amp; van der Borg study (2004)===

Schilder and van der Borg conducted a study to compare the behavior of police service dogs that had previously been trained using a shock collar (Group S) with those which had not (Group C).&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, M.B.H., van der Borg, J.A.M, 2004, Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 85, pp. 319-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In the training test no shocks were applied, but the animal's behavior was observed during training tasks. The intention was to investigate whether shock collar based training might have a long-term effect on stress-related behavior even in the absence of shock, and whether this related to specific features of the training context. Behaviors recorded included recognised indicators of stress (panting, lip-licking, yawning, paw lifting and body posture) as well as yelping, squealing, snapping and avoidance. During free walks on the training grounds, groups S dogs showed significantly more stress related behaviors and a lower body posture than group C dogs. During training, the same differences were found. The difference between the groups was more significant when training took place on the familiar training ground, indicating a contextual effect. The presence of the trainer was considered to be part of this context. The authors concluded "We concluded that shocks received during training are not only unpleasant but also painful and frightening."

Lindsay says of this study, "Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy.... The absence of reduced drive or behavioral suppression with respect to critical activities associated with shock (e.g., bite work) makes one skeptical about the lasting adverse effects the authors claim to document. Although they offer no substantive evidence of trauma or harm to dogs, they provide loads of speculation, anecdotes, insinuations of gender and educational inadequacies, and derogatory comments regarding the motivation and competence of IPO trainers in its place."  &lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=611–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steiss et al. study (2007)===
Steiss, et al., conducted a four-week study of adult shelter dogs’ physiological and behavioral responses to bark control collars. Plasma cortisol was used as the stress measure. Dogs were randomly assigned to either a shock collar, a spray collar, or a dummy collar (control group). Dogs that were known to bark at an unfamiliar dog were used for the study. Test conditions involved presentation of an unfamiliar dog. Dogs wore activated collars for period of 30 minutes per day for three days in two consecutive weeks. The amount of barking was significantly reduced starting on the second day with both the spray and shock collars. There was no significant difference in effect between the two collar types. The treatment group dogs showed a mild yet statistically significant increase in blood cortisol level (an indicator of stress) only on the first day of wearing the collars (as compared to the Control Group.)&lt;ref&gt;Steiss, J.E., Schaffer, C., Ahmad, H.A., and Voith, V.L., 2007, Evaluation of Plasma Cortisol Levels and Behavior in Dogs Wearing Bark Control Collars. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 106, pp. 96-106.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the study, Dr. Steiss and her team concluded that "In the present study, with dogs wearing bark control collars intermittently over a 2-week period, the collars effectively deterred barking without statistically significant elevations in plasma cortisol, compared to controls, at any of the time points measured."

===Tortora Study (1983)===

Tortora applied a method called "safety training" to treat aggression in 36 cases exhibiting a form of "instrumental aggression", selected after screening a population of 476 cases. "Instrumental aggression" was defined as describing aggressive acts that "do not have a clear evolutionary significance, are not directly related to emotional arousal, do not have specific releasing stimuli, are not directly modulated by hormones, and do not have an identifiable focus in the brain". Tortora states that in the context of the article "instrumental aggression" was specifically defined as "aggressive responses that have "a specifiable learning history, show a growth function over time and are modulated by their consequences. These dogs had few operant alternatives to gain reinforcement by compliance and were channeled down a path that allowed their innate aggressiveness to come under the control of the negatively reinforcing contingencies in the environment". The dogs initially behaved as though they "expected" aversive events and that the only way to prevent these events was through aggression. The dogs were therefore a highly selected subset that had not learned strategies for coping with threat.

Each dog was trained to respond to a set of 15 commands taken from the AKC standard for CDX obedience. The commands were selected to provide control over the dog, and included "heel", "stand" "go", "come", "hold", "drop" and "sit". These behaviors were termed "safety behaviors". Training was divided into 9 stages, each of which was composed of 5-20 twice daily training sessions. Dogs could only progress to the next stage after passing a test. On average, dogs took 10-15 sessions to complete each stage. After training basic commands, the dogs were trained to perform the behaviors they had already learned in order to avoid progressively increasing electric shock. After that, they were conditioned to perform a safety behavior in order to avoid a "safety tone" that allowed them to anticipate the shock. In the later stages of training, dogs were exposed to provocation by a distractor dog, and were punished using full intensity shock if they failed to perform a safety behavior or if they showed aggression. After training was complete, and the dogs were choosing to perform the safety behaviors instead of aggression, owners were taught to use the shock collar and the training was transferred into everyday situations. The training resulted in a long-lasting and complete suppression of aggressive behaviour in the dogs. Dogs were followed up 3 years after the end of training, and the reduction in aggression were maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1984-03181-001&amp;CFID=7872469&amp;CFTOKEN=51050078&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) opposes the use of shock collars, stating "Dogs wearing shock collars can suffer from physical pain and injury (ranging from burns to cardiac fibrillation) and psychological stress, including severe anxiety and displaced aggression. Individual animals vary in their temperaments and pain thresholds; a shock that seems mild to one dog may be severe to another. The anxiety and confusion caused by repeated shocks can lead to changes in the heart and respiration rate or gastrointestinal disorders. Electronic collars can also malfunction, either administering nonstop shocks or delivering no shocks at all".&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/caring-animal-companions/dogs/electric-fences-shock-collars/ | title= Electric Fences and Shock Collars| author=PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CABTSG (The Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group), an affiliate group of the BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association), produced a policy statement on the use of shock collars, stating "Their effectiveness depends upon the pain and fear experienced by the animal, but to use them correctly requires detailed understanding of behaviour and its motivation, as well as very precise timing. Few operators are able to achieve any reliable success with these devices and the consequences of failure can be a worsening of the problem behaviour. The indiscriminate use of shock collars therefore poses a threat to the safety of the general public, as well as to the welfare of the animal. We believe that sufficient alternative methods of treatment exist that such electronic training devices are redundant. Therefore, as an association affiliated to BSAVA, it is our duty to recommend that shock collars and all other related training and control aids should be banned from sale or use".&lt;ref name="CABTSG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doghavendogs.com/Companion%20Animal%20Behaviour%20Therapy%20Study%20Group%20-%20Electronic%20training%20aids.pdf | title= CABTSG Policy Statement| author=CABTSG}}&lt;/ref&gt; CABTSG has been renamed the British Veterinary Behaviour Association.

The BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association) produced a statement on the risks associated with collars "In principle, the BSAVA opposes the use of electronic shock collars for training and containment of animals. Shocks received during training may not only be acutely stressful, painful and frightening for the animal but also may produce long term adverse effects on behavioural and emotional responses.".&lt;ref name="BSAVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsava.com/Resources/Positionstatements/Aversivetrainingmethods.aspx | title= BSAVA Statement| author=BSAVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and other welfare groups, the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers)banned the use of shock collars for police dog training by all UK police forces. The current ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance states "Equipment that is not approved for use in the training of police dogs includes remote training collars designed to give an electric shock and Pinch Collars" .&lt;ref name="ACPO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |title=ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702042548/http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSPCA commissioned a review of the effects of shock collars from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Bristol University, which is available online. It states "Given the lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of behavioural modification using shock collars, particularly in the long term, in addition to the potential for mistakes or deliberate abuse and the difficulty in correcting such errors, the widespread use of these devices must be carefully considered." &lt;ref name="RSPCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232713013325&amp;mode=prd | title= RSPCA Review| author=Casey and Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Kennel Club]] has an ongoing campaign to achieve a ban on the sale and use of shock collars; "The Kennel Club is against the use of any negative training methods or devices. The Kennel Club believes that there are many positive training tools and methods that can produce dogs that are trained just as quickly and reliably, with absolutely no fear, pain, or potential damage to the relationship between dog and handler." "The Kennel Club in calling upon the Government and Scottish Parliament to introduce an outright ban on this barbaric method of training dogs.".&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/banshockcollars | title= Kennel Club Campaign| author=Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two British members of the World Union of German Shepherd Clubs (WUSV) have joined the Kennel Club in calling for a complete ban on shock collars, and passed a motion to exclude this equipment from any of its training branches during official club training times.&lt;ref name="WUSV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |title=WUSV Ban |author=WUSV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325061026/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSUS ([[Humane Society of the United States]]) provides the following comment on the use of aversive collars (choke chains, pinch collars and shock collars): "Some trainers use aversive collars to train "difficult" dogs with correction or punishment. These collars rely on physical discomfort or even pain to teach the dog what not to do. They suppress the unwanted behavior but don't teach him what the proper one is. At best, they are unpleasant for your dog, and at worst, they may cause your dog to act aggressively and even bite you. Positive training methods should always be your first choice." They go on to comment on shock collars specifically: "The least humane and most controversial use of the shock collar is as a training device. The trainer can administer a shock to a dog at a distance through a remote control. There is a greater chance for abuse (delivery of shocks as punishment) or misuse (poor timing of shocks). Your dog also may associate the painful shock with people or other experiences, leading to fearful or aggressive behavior".&lt;ref name="HSUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/collars.html | title= HSUS statement| author=HSUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCAE (Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics) "recommends the introduction of a ban electric training collars and similar remote-controlled or automatic electronic devices that cause your dog substantial discomfort. It should nevertheless be granted an exemption for such training carried out by authorized persons in order to prevent hunting of livestock and wildlife."  &lt;ref name="Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radetfordyreetikk.no/1996/02/elektriske-dressurmidler-hund/ | title=Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics| author=NCAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APDT (Association of Professional Dog Trainers) says, "[Electronic] training collars should not be used by novice dog owners or by trainers who are not properly instructed in their use. Use of electronic training collars can result in trauma to your dog and generally are not recommended by positive reinforcement trainers".&lt;ref name="APDT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdt.com/petowners/choose/equipment.aspx | title=APDT| author=APDT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AVSAB (American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior) has produced a position statement titled "The use of punishment for behavior modification in animals", the opening paragraph of which reads "AVSAB’s position is that punishment (e.g. choke chains, pinch collars, and electronic collars) should not be used as a first-line or early-use treatment for behavior problems. This is due to the potential adverse effects which include but are not limited to: inhibition of learning, increased fear-related and aggressive behaviors, and injury to animals and people interacting with animals." &lt;ref name="AVSAB Position Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avsabonline.org/uploads/position_statements/Combined_Punishment_Statements.pdf |title=AVSAB Position Statement|author=AVSAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==
In his 2005 textbook on training and behavior, Steven Lindsay writes "Instead of instilling social aversion and anxiety ... animal and human research supports the notion that competent shock [collar] training appears to promote positive social attachment, safety, and reward effects that may be provided and amplified via affectionate petting and reassuring praise. The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that [electrical stimulation] escape/avoidance and pain reduction should promote long-term effects that are incompatible with fear and stress, making the trainer an object of significant extrinsic reward that actually enhances the dog's welfare via an improved capacity for social coping, learning, and adaptation".&lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"/&gt; Steven Lindsay states "If minimizing the intensity, duration, and frequency of aversive stimulation during training is recognized as a significant factor in the definition of humane dog training, then the radio controlled e-collar must be ranked as one of the most humane dog-training tools currently available" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP) strongly opposes legislation that bans or limits the humane use of any training tool, saying It is our conviction that limiting the humane use of training tools would result in a higher incidence of nuisance and dangerous dog behavior, and more dogs being surrendered to already over-burdened public shelters.... Dog training is a very diverse field with a single common thread: communication. Dogs are trained for many different tasks such as assisting the disabled, police work, herding, hunting, protection, competition and companionship. Professional trainers achieve these training goals by using a wide variety of tools to communicate with the dog, both at close range, and over long distances. Done effectively, this communication increases desirable behaviors and reduces the incidence of problem behaviors in dogs.... Any efforts to ban or limit the use of training tools would hinder this communication, and our ability to train dogs would suffer. Working dogs would no longer be able to achieve highly specialized tasks, and families with pet dogs would have fewer options available to correct behavioral problems.... Training tools, when properly utilized, are safe and humane".&lt;ref name="IACP Position Paper on Training Tools"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.canineprofessionals.com/assets/docs/iacp%20training%20tools%20position%20statement-1.pdf | title=IACP Position Paper on Training Tools| author=IACP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randall Lockwood PhD, Senior Vice President, Anti-cruelty Initiatives and Legislative Services, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was quoted in a 2007 White Paper titled "The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices," produced by Radio Systems, a manufacturer of shock collars, "We recognize that older products were often unreliable and difficult to use humanely. But we feel that new technology employed by responsible manufacturers has led to products that can be and are being used safely and effectively to preserve the safety and well-being of many dogs and strengthen the bond with their human companions."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public control==
The use of shock collars is banned in [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/electric-shock-collars/ | work=Kennel Club UK | title=Electric Shock Collars}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some territories of [[Australia]], including [[New South Wales]] and Southern Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-use-of-electronic-dog-collars-legal_279.html | work=RSPCA Australia | title=Is the use of electronic dog collars legal? | date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[Welsh Assembly]] voted to ban the use of shock collars in [[Wales]]. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8584028.stm |title=Wales the first part of the UK to ban pet shock collars |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was unsuccessfully challenged by Petsafe, a manufacturer of these devices, and the Electronic Collar Manufacturers' Association, who claimed that it breached Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="EU Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/11/23/electric-shock-pet-collar-ban-did-not-breach-human-rights/ | title= Welsh Ban Challenge| author=Welsh Ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, it was announced that shock collars for cats and dogs would be banned in England. The [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] said that shock collars caused unacceptable "harm and suffering". Animal charities, including the [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCC]] and the [[Dogs Trust]], welcomed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45320038|title=Ban on electric shock collars for pets|date=2018-08-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal cases involving shock collars==
The potential for shock collars to have a negative impact on behaviour has been recognised by the UK courts. In 2001 Ostarra Langridge was prosecuted after one of her dogs attacked and killed a [[Shih Tzu]] whilst on a walk. A control order, rather than a destruction order, was imposed as the magistrates accepted the defense that Ms. Langridge's dog's aggressive behaviour was attributable to the effects of the shock collar. "Ms. Langridge sought the help of a behaviourist when her dogs started to run away from her on their walks along the beach. The dogs were given shock collars, which Miss Langridge was told to keep on for three months and activate whenever they misbehaved. But the first time the dogs got a shock was by mistake, after a small dog they were walking past made Miss Langridge jump. From then on her pets associated the shocks with small dogs and became afraid of them. When Miss Langridge described the day in July when her dogs turned on a Shih Tzu she had tears in her eyes.". She stated ""They connected the pain of the electric shock with little dogs because of the first time I used the collar. The day that machine came in this house I regret." &lt;ref name="Legal case"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| title=Collars turned dogs into killers| author=The Argus| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024152825/http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| archivedate=2014-10-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2011, a 48-year-old man from [[Ogmore-by-Sea]] became the first person convicted of illegal use of a shock collar in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13042363 | work=BBC News | title=Shock collar found on pet dog roaming on Vale beach | date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently fined £2,000 and assessed £1,000 for court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14181927 | work=BBC News | title=Ogmore illegal shock collar dog owner gets £2,000 fine | date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the RSPCA, Victoria (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) lost a defamation lawsuit to Orion Pet Products, a shock collar manufacturer, and was ordered to pay $100,00 in damages.  The RSPCA had falsely claimed that shock collars can cause burns and delivered 3,000 volt shocks to dogs.  They made the "fanciful claim" that the current from a shock collar had caused a 60 Kilogram dog to perform backflips and resulted in brain damage.  Justice Weinberg also found that the RSPCA claims that these collars caused epileptic fits, vomiting, seizures, burning and bleeding were misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogfight nets RSPCA chief $30,000 |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/dogfight-nets-rspca-chief-30-000-20020706-gdud8l.html |website=The Age |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RSPCA's senior inspector had falsified evidence in an attempt to demonstrate that shock collars can cause burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) |url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2002/860.html |website=Federal Court of Australia |publisher=Federal Court of Australia |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social distance''' describes the [[distance#Theoretical distances|distance]] between different [[Social group|group]]s in [[society]] and is opposed to [[distance#Physical distances|''locational distance'']]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. The notion includes differences such as [[social class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[human sexuality|sexuality]], but also the fact that the different groups mix less than members of the same group&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.A., McPherson, M. and Smith-Lovin, L., 2014. Social distance in the United States: Sex, race, religion, age, and education homophily among confidants, 1985 to 2004. American Sociological Review, 79(3), pp.432-456.&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is often applied in [[city|cities]], but its use is not limited to that. 

An old concept, in 1924 [[Robert Ezra Park|Robert E. Park]] defined social distance as "an attempt to reduce to something like measurable terms the grade and degrees of understanding and intimacy which characterizes personal and social relations generally".&lt;ref&gt;Park, R. E. (1924). The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the measure of nearness or intimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group in a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the extent of perceived likeness of beliefs..&lt;ref&gt;Boguna, Marian, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, Albert Díaz-Guilera, and Alex Arenas (2004).

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[sociology|sociological]] literature, social distance is conceptualized in several different ways.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Karakayali, Nedim. 2009. "Social Distance and Affective Orientations." ''Sociological Forum'', vol. 23, n.3, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Affective social distance: One widespread conception of social distance focuses on [[negative affectivity|affectivity]]. According to this approach, social distance is associated with affective distance, i.e. how much sympathy the members of a group feel for another group. [[Emory Bogardus]], the creator of "Bogardus social distance scale" was typically basing his scale on this [[subjectivity|subjective-affective]] conception of social distance: "[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people."&lt;ref&gt;Bogardus, E. S. 1947. ''Measurement of Personal-Group Relations,'' ''Sociometry'', 10: 4: 306–311.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Normative social distance: A second approach views social distance as a [[social norm|normative]] category. Normative social distance refers to the widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who should be considered as an [[ingroup|"insider"]] and who an [[Outgroup (sociology)|"outsider/foreigner".]] Such norms, in other words, specify the distinctions between "us" and "them". Therefore, normative social distance differs from affective social distance, because it conceives social distance is conceived as a [[Objectivity (science)|non-subjective]], [[social structure|structural]] aspect of social relations. Examples of this conception can be found in some of the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]], [[Emile Durkheim]] and to some extent [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]].
#Interactive social distance: A third conceptualization of social distance focuses on the frequency and intensity of interactions between two groups, claiming that the more the members of two groups interact, the closer they are socially. This conception is similar to the approaches in [[social network|sociological network]] theory, where the frequency of interaction between two parties is used as a measure of the "strength" of the social ties between them.
#Cultural and Habitual Distance: A fourth conceptualization of social distance focuses cultural and habitual which is proposed by Bourdieu (1990). This type of distance is influenced by the "capital" people possess.  

It is possible to view these different conceptions as "dimensions" of social distance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might interact with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that they will feel "close" to each other or that normatively they will consider each other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive, normative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly associated.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Social distance was also used in a different meaning by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and cross-cultural researcher, [[Edward T. Hall]], to describe the psychological distance which an animal can stand to be away from its group before beginning to feel [[anxiety|anxious]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be seen in human babies and toddlers who can only walk or crawl so far from their parents or guardians before becoming anxious and quickly returning to the safe space. The babies' social distance is quite small.

Hall also notes that this concept of social distance has been extended by technological advances such as the [[telephone]], [[walkie talkie]], and [[television]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall’s analysis of social distance came before the development of the [[internet]], which has expanded social distance exponentially. Social distance is now even expanding beyond our planet as we send people into outer space on space missions and even personal trips to space.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Prejudice==

It is said|date=June 2016}} that every individual regards his or her own [[culture]] as being superior to all other cultures, and other cultures as being inferior due to their differences from his or her own culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The social distance between two cultures may ultimately manifest in the form of hatred.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} A consequence of this distance and hatred is [[prejudice|prejudices]], that different cultural groups assume to be true for differing social groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} For example, the [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] are believed to possess the highest, and the [[Shudra|shudras]] the lowest [[Social status|status]] in [[Hindu caste system|Hindu society]]. If a Brahmin child ever touches the child of some shudra, the former is given a bath to rid him of his supposed defilement caused by his touch. As a result of this strict formulation of his activities, the Brahmin child forms a prejudice in his mind that shudras are untouchable and impure.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma, Rajendra|first=Sharma, Rachana|title=Social Psychology|year=1972|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and distributors|location=New Delhi|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to study social distance==
Some ways social distance can be [[measurement|measured]] include: direct observation of people interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route planning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see [[sociogram]]).

In questionnaires, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they would accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not they would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as a marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately measure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to become a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to measure one's feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What a person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Social-Distance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a systematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When asked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a word’s presence, people respond more quickly when "we" was displayed in a spatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when "others" was displayed in a
spatially distant versus a spatially proximate location.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., &amp; Algom, D. (2007). Automatic processing of psychological distance: Evidence from a Stroop task. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136,'' 610-622.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.

Route planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social distance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people tend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, J.L. &amp; Matlock, T. (2011). Understanding the link between spatial distance and social distance. ''Social Psychology, 42'', 185-192. {{doi|10.1027/1864-9335/a000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it is for the people passing one another to communicate. 

There is some evidence that reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared processing resources in the human parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Yamakawa, Y., Kanai, R., Matsumura, M., &amp; Naito, E. (2009). Social distance evaluation in human parietal cortex. PLoS ONE, 4(2): e4360. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0004360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Core-periphery structure|Social periphery]]'' is a term often used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being 'distant' with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is measured from the dominant ''city élite''. The social periphery of a city is often located in the [[city center|centre]].

''Locational periphery'' in contrast is used to describe places physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often include [[suburbia|suburbs]] which are socially close to the core of the city. In some cases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in [[Paris]]' ''[[banlieu|banlieues]]''.

In 1991, Mulgan stated that "The centres of two cities are often for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own peripheries."&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan G (1991) Communications and Control: Networks and the New Economics of Communication (Polity, Cambridge)&lt;/ref&gt; This reference to social distance is especially true for [[global cities]].

The '''Spinning Dancer''', also known as the '''silhouette illusion''', is a [[Kinetic depth effect|kinetic]], [[Multistable perception|bistable]] [[optical illusion]] resembling a [[pirouette|pirouetting]] female dancer. The illusion, created in 2003 by web designer Nobuyuki Kayahara,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procreo.jp/labo.html Nobuyuki Kayahara's website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | last = Parker-Pope | first = Tara | title = The Truth About the Spinning Dancer | work = Well Blog | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2008-04-28 | url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/the-truth-about-the-spinning-dancer/ | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the apparent direction of motion of the figure. Some observers initially see the figure as spinning [[clockwise]] (viewed from above) and some counterclockwise. Additionally, some may see the figure suddenly spin in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The illusion derives from the lack of visual cues for depth. For instance, as the dancer's arms move from viewer's left to right, it is possible to view her arms passing between her body and the viewer (that is, in the foreground of the picture, in which case she would be circling counterclockwise on her right foot) and it is also possible to view her arms as passing behind the dancer's body (that is, in the background of the picture, in which case she is seen circling clockwise on her left foot).

When she is facing to the left or to the right, her breasts and ponytail clearly define the direction she is facing, although there is ambiguity in which leg is which.  However, as she moves away from facing to the left (or from facing to the right), the dancer can be seen (by different viewers, not by a single individual) facing in either of two directions.  At first, these two directions are fairly close to each other (both left, say, but one facing slightly forward, the other facing slightly backward) but they become further and further away from each other until we reach a position where her ponytail and breasts are in line with the viewer (so that neither her breasts nor her ponytail are seen so readily). In this position, she could be facing either away from the viewer or towards the viewer, so that the two positions the two different viewers could see are 180 degrees apart.

== Psychology of visual perception ==

It has been established that the silhouette is more often seen rotating clockwise than counterclockwise. According to an online survey of over 1600 participants, approximately two thirds of observers initially perceived the silhouette to be rotating clockwise. In addition, observers who initially perceived a clockwise rotation had more difficulty experiencing the alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Casual Fridays: TK-421, why can't you spin that woman in reverse? | work = Cognitive Daily | date = 2008-10-10 | url = http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/10/casual_fridays_tk421_why_cant.php | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|upright|right|150px|This [[positron emission tomography]] [[Full-body CT scan|scan]] of a woman has a similar effect when viewed spinning]]

These results can be explained by a psychological study providing evidence for a viewing-from-above bias that influences observers' perceptions of the silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Troje N F | first = McAdam M | title = The viewing-from-above bias and the silhouette illusion | work = i-Perception 1(3) 143-148 | date = 2010-11-14 | url = http://i-perception.perceptionweb.com/fulltext/i01/i0408.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110430013619/http://i-perception.perceptionweb.com/fulltext/i01/i0408.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-04-30 | accessdate = 2010-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kattinakere | first = Ragu | title = Spinning lady explained | date = 2008-02-03 | url = http://thoughtslot.blogspot.com/2008/02/spinning-nude-lady.html | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kayahara's dancer is presented with a camera elevation slightly above the horizontal plane. Consequently, the dancer may also be seen from above or below in addition to spinning clockwise or counterclockwise, and facing toward or away from the observer. Upon inspection, one may notice that in Kayahara's original illusion, seeing the dancer spin clockwise is paired with constantly holding an elevated viewpoint and seeing the dancer from above. The opposite is also true; an observer maintaining an anti-clockwise percept has assumed a viewpoint below the dancer. If observers report perceiving Kayahara's original silhouette as spinning clockwise more often than counterclockwise, there are two chief possibilities. They may have a bias to see it spinning clockwise, or they may have a bias to assume a viewpoint from above. To tease these two apart, the researchers created their own versions of Kayahara's silhouette illusion by recreating the dancer and varying the camera elevations. This allowed for clockwise/from-above (like Kayahara's original) and clockwise/from-below pairings. The results indicated that there was no clockwise bias, but rather viewing-from-above bias. Furthermore, this bias was dependent upon camera elevation. In other words, the greater the camera elevation, the more often an observer saw the dancer from above.

In [[popular psychology]], the illusion has been incorrectly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Novella | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Novella | title = Left Brain - Right brain and the Spinning Girl | work = NeuroLogica Blog | date = 2007-10-11 | url = http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=27 | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as a [[personality test]] that supposedly reveals which [[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere of the brain]] [[Lateralization of brain function|is dominant]] in the observer. Under this wrong interpretation, it has been popularly called the Right Brain–Left Brain test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Right Brain vs Left Brain test | work = PerthNow | publisher = The Sunday Times | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,22492511-5005375,00.html | accessdate = 2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was widely circulated on the Internet during late 2008 to early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Which side of your brain is more dominant? | url = http://en.sommer-sommer.com/braintest/ | accessdate = 2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper describes the brain activation related to the switching of perception. Utilizing fMRI in a volunteer capable to switch at will the direction of rotation, it was found that a part of the right parietal lobe is responsible for the switching. The authors relate this brain activation to the recently described spontaneous brain fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Bernal B, Guillen M, Marquez J. The spinning dancer illusion and spontaneous brain fluctuations: an fMRI study. Neurocase. 2014;20:627-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bistable perception ==

There are other optical illusions that depend on the same or a similar kind of visual ambiguity known as [[multistable perception|multistable, in that case bistable, perception]]. One example is the [[Necker Cube]].

Depending on the perception of the observer, the apparent direction of spin may change any number of times, a typical feature of so-called [[bistable percept]]s such as the [[Necker cube]] which may be perceived from time to time as seen from above or below. These alternations are spontaneous and may randomly occur without any change in the stimulus or [[intention]] by the observer. However some observers may have difficulty perceiving a change in motion at all.

One way of changing the direction perceived is to use averted vision and mentally look for an arm going behind instead of in front, then carefully move the eyes back. Some may perceive a change in direction more easily by narrowing visual focus to a specific region of the image, such as the spinning foot or the shadow below the dancer and gradually looking upwards. One can also try to tilt one's head to perceive a change in direction. Another way is to watch the base shadow foot, and perceive it as the toes always pointing away from you and it can help with direction change. You can also close your eyes and try and envision the dancer going in a direction then reopen them and the dancer should change directions. Still another way is to wait for the dancer's legs to cross in the projection and then try to perceive a change in the direction in what follows. You could also try using your peripheral vision to distract the dominant part of the brain, slowly look away from the ballerina and you may begin to see it spin in the other direction. Perhaps the easiest method is to blink rapidly (slightly varying the rate if necessary) until consecutive images are going in the 'new' direction.  Then open your eyes and the new rotational direction is maintained. It is even possible to see the illusion in a way that the dancer is not spinning at all, but simply rotating back and forth 180 degrees.

Slightly altered versions of the animation have been created with an additional visual cue to assist viewers who have difficulty 'seeing' one rotation direction or the other.  Labels and white edges have been added to the legs, to make it clear which leg is passing in front of the other. ''(see below)'' Looking at one of these can sometimes then make the original dancer image above spin in the corresponding direction.

== Further analysis ==
{{Wide image|Spinning Dancer - Frames.png|5100px|A frame-by-frame wide version of the Spinning Dancer. To create this image, the original was split into its 34 constituent frames, and a horizontal [[panorama]] was created from those frames.}} &lt;!-- As of 2008/08/09, use of a collapsed navbox was attempted to wrap the wide image. Unfortunately, with this set up, the image displays correctly with MF2, but not with MF3 or IE7. With MF3 or IE7, the width of the image is not restricted to the page width as it should be, but instead it is the entire width of the image, and this is a problem. Due to this problem, the navbox was removed. Other collapsible navboxes and a collapsible table were attempted as well, but they all resulted in the same problem. It is hoped that this image doesn't have the same spoiler effect as the images with the visual cue do. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1143">In [[probability theory]] &amp;ndash; specifically in the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a '''stationary sequence''' is a [[random sequence]] whose [[joint probability distribution]] is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] over time.  If a random sequence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is stationary then the following holds:

where ''F'' is the joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[random variable]]s in the subscript.

If a sequence is stationary then it is [[wide-sense stationary]].

If a sequence is stationary then it has a constant [[mean (mathematics)|mean]] (which may not be finite):

==Education==
Smalley majored in biological anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]], and as an undergraduate became interested in [[population genetics]] and [[human evolution]].  She received a BA in anthropology in 1976, and in 1981 earned an MA in anthropology from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. She was awarded a Ph.D in anthropology with specialization in population genetics from UCLA in 1985.  Her dissertation examined the genetics of [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial ability]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;  
==Career==
===ADHD and behavior genetics===
Smalley joined the faculty at UCLA after she completed post-doctoral fellowships in [[medical genetics]] and [[Child psychopathology|childhood psychopathology]], moving from assistant to full professor until her retirement to emeritus in 2011.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucla.academia.edu/SueSmalley/CurriculumVitae|title=Sue Smalley at the University of California, Los Angeles|website=ucla.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 she published a review paper on the genetics of autism in ''[[JAMA Psychiatry]]''. Following its publication, she received a [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) grant to investigate genetic determinants in autism, and pioneered an approach to behavioral genetics by studying known genetic disorders with behavioral [[Sequela|sequelae]], specifically, the study of [[Tuberous sclerosis complex|tuberous sclerosis complex]], (TSC), a genetic disorder in which autistic disorder occurs at higher rates than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Susan|first=Smalley,|title=Detection of Susceptibility Genes in Adhd|url=http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-MH058277-02|journal=NIH Grants|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to research autism for the following ten years, producing numerous papers on the genetics and subclinical variants of autism beyond the diagnostic classification as well as genetic and behavioral studies of TSC.&lt;ref name="NYT nature"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-adhd-expert.html?pagewanted=all|title=Nature, Nurture and Attention Deficit|last=Baruchin|first=Aliyah|date=2008-03-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley's focus subsequently shifted to ADHD.  Her lab produced more than 40 publications on the disorder, including the first genome-wide scan (in conjunction with investigators at [[Oxford University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/10/021023065107.htm|title=UCLA Geneticists Find Location Of Major Gene In ADHD; Targeted Region Also Linked To Autism|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; candidate gene investigations, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/09_00/DRD4_gene.shtml|title=The DRD4 Gene: Psychiatry's Repeat Offender|work=Genome News Network|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of  papers on ADHD among a northern Finnish birth cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/28/health/he-adhd28|title=Growing up with, and out of, ADHD|last=Healy|first=Melissa|date=2008-01-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote extensively on the strengths of those with ADHD, characterizing it as a different way of thinking rather than a deficit. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/26/opinion/oe-hallowell26|title=ADD's black box scare|last=Hallowell|first=Edward M.|date=2006-02-26|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindful awareness===
Smalley was diagnosed with an early stage melanoma in 2002. She took a leave of absence to explore non-western wellness practices, and in addition to significant lifestyle changes, she developed a meditation practice.  When she returned to UCLA, she began researching mindfulness meditation and its impact on ADHD and other disorders. She subsequently led seminal studies that demonstrated the relationship between mindfulness and common personality traits of those with ADHD, mindfulness as an intervention in ADHD, and school-based approaches to bringing mindfulness to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/what-inspired-a-scientist_b_228356.html|title=What Inspired A Scientist To Open A Meditation Center At UCLA?|last=Fitzgerald|first=Dr Patricia|date=2009-08-15|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and founded the Mindful Awareness Research Center at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior (MARC) to bring meditation practices to the general public through research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/us/16mindful.html|title=In the Classroom, a New Focus on Quieting the Mind|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|date=2007-06-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',  she wrote: "As a scientist, I love the challenge of understanding my mind, from the inside, while learning what science tells us from the outside. The merging of these two approaches will yield knowledge far greater than either can alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-smalley/mindfulness-and-meditatio_b_64753.html|title=Mindfulness And Meditation In The Modern World|last=Ph.D|first=Susan Smalley|date=2007-09-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈtomaːʃ ˈɡarɪk ˈmasarɪk|lang}}), sometimes anglicised to '''Thomas Masaryk''' (7 March 1850 – 14 September 1937), was a [[Czechs|Czechoslovak]] [[politician]], statesman, [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher]].

After trying to reform the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[monarchy]] into a [[federal state]], with the help of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], he eventually succeeded in gaining Czechoslovak independence as a republic after [[World War I]]. He both founded and was the first [[list of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|President]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and so is called the "President Liberator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Prezident osvoboditel)

==Early life==
Masaryk was born to a poor working-class family in the predominantly [[Catholic]] city of [[Hodonín]], [[Moravia]] (in the region of [[Moravian Slovakia]], today in the [[Czech Republic]] but then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].) Another tradition claims the nearby [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village of [[Kopčany]], the home of his father, as his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;Michaláč, Jozef 2007 T.G.Masaryk a kopčianska legenda. Kde sa v skutočnosti narodil náš prvý prezident? Bratislava: Nestor.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently grew up in the village of [[Čejkovice (Hodonín District)|Čejkovice]], in [[South Moravian Region|South Moravia]], before he moved to [[Brno]] to study.&lt;ref name=capek&gt;Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. ''Talks with T.G. Masaryk'', tr. Michael Henry Heim. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father Jozef Masárik, born in [[Kopčany]] in Slovakia (then the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary), was a carter and later the steward and coachman at the Imperial Estate of nearby [[Hodonín]]. Tomáš's mother, Teresie Masaryková ([[née]] Kropáčková), was a [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] of Slavic origin but [[German language|German]] education. She worked as a cook at the Estate where she met Masárik, and they married on 15 August 1849.

==Education==
After grammar school in Brno and [[Vienna]], from 1872 to 1876, Masaryk attended the [[University of Vienna]], where he was a student of [[Franz Brentano]].&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;Zumr, Joseph. 1998. "Masaryk, Tomáš Garrigue (1850–1937)". pp. 165–66 in the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ed. Edward Craig. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna in 1876 and completed his [[habilitation]] thesis at the same university in 1879, entitled ''Der Selbstmord als sociale Massenerscheinung der modernen Civilisation'' ("Suicide as a Social Mass Phenomenon of Modern Civilization").&lt;ref name=routledge /&gt; Between 1876 and 1879, he studied in [[Leipzig]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;
Čapek, Karel. 1995 [1935–1938]. Talks with T.G. Masaryk, tr. [[Michael Henry Heim]]. North Haven, CT: Catbird Press, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 1878, he married [[Charlotte Garrigue]] in [[Brooklyn]], whom he had met at Leipzig. They lived in Vienna until 1881, when they moved to Prague.

In 1882, he was appointed Professor of Philosophy in the Czech part of [[Charles University of Prague]]. The following year he founded ''[[Athenaeum (Czech magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', a magazine devoted to Czech culture and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepka |first=Karel |date=2015 |title=Mathematics in T. G. Masaryk journal Athenaeum |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Danish school of education |pages=749–59 |isbn=978-87-7684-737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Athenaeum'' issued in October 15, 1883 (editor was Jan Otto).

He challenged the validity of the epic poems ''Rukopisy královedvorský a zelenohorský'', supposedly dating from the early [[Middle Ages]] and providing a false nationalistic basis of Czech [[chauvinism]] to which he was continuously opposed. Further enraging Czech sentiment, he fought against the old superstition of [[Jewish]] blood [[libel]] during the [[Hilsner Trial]] of 1899.

==Early career==
Masaryk served in the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'' from 1891 to 1893 in the [[Young Czech Party]] and again from 1907 to 1914 in the [[Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1900, but he did not yet campaign for the independence of [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] from [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1909, he helped [[Hinko Hinković]] in [[Vienna]] in the defense during the fabricated trial against members of the [[Croato-Serb Coalition]] (such as [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribićević]]) and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years, with a number of [[Death penalty|death penalties]].

When the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek an independent country for Czechs and Slovaks, outside Austria-Hungary. He went into exile with his daughter, Olga, in December 1914, to [[Rome]], then to [[Geneva]] and then to [[London]] via [[Paris]] in 1915, the [[Russian Empire]] in May 1917 and the United States via [[Vladivostok]] and [[Tokyo]] in April 1918. From Geneva onwards, he started organizing Czechs and Slovaks living outside Austria-Hungary, primarily in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[England]], Russia and the United States, establishing the contacts that would prove crucial for Czechoslovak independence. He also gave lectures and wrote numerous articles and official memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. In Russia, he was pivotal in establishing [[Czechoslovak Legions]] as an effective fighting force on the side of the Allies in World War I. During the war, he held a [[Serbian passport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:494171-Srbija-nekada-mamila-kao-Amerika|title=Србија некада мамила као Америка|website=www.novosti.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, he was one of the first members of staff of the new [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]], now part of [[University College London]], where the Student Society and Senior Common Room are named after him. He became Professor of Slavic Research at [[King's College London|King's College]] in [[London]], lecturing on "the problem of small nations".

===Creation of Czechoslovak Legion===
During the war, Masaryk's intelligence network of Czech revolutionaries provided important and critical intelligence to the Allies. Masaryk's [[Europe|European]] network worked with an American counterespionage network of nearly 80 members, headed by [[E.V. Voska]], who, as [[Habsburg]] subjects were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other things, the intelligence from these networks was critical in uncovering the [[Hindu-German Conspiracy]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masaryk50/&gt;&lt;ref name=Masaryk50&gt;{{Harvnb|Masaryk|1970|pp=50, 221, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Voska|Irwin|1940|pp=98, 108, 120, 122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bose|1971|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.G. Masaryk started teaching at London University in October 1915. There, he published "Racial Problems in Hungary" in which he also expressed thoughts on Czechoslovak's independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the [[French government]] of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. After the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, he proceeded to Russia (he left London for St. Petersburg in May) to help organize Slavic resistance to the Austrians, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]].

On 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion, recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914 and was attached to the Russian Third Army.

From its start, Masaryk desired to grow the Družina from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the Družina to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but the order was rescinded after a few weeks because of opposition in other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and the Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917.

Under such conditions the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914 and 1917. In early 1916, the Družina was reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. Following the Czechoslovak soldiers' stellar performance in July 1917 at the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]], when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches, the Russian Provisional Government finally granted to Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (Československý sbor na Rusi), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (Československá legie) in Russia. A second division consisting of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.

In 1918, he traveled to the United States (starting from Moscow 7 March to [[Vladivostok]], [[Fusan]] and Tokyo and then to [[Vancouver]] by steamliner, and from [[Canada]] to [[Chicago]]), where he convinced President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the righteousness of his cause. Speaking on 26 October 1918 from the steps of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], as head of the [[Mid-European Union]], Masaryk called for the independence of the Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of Central Europe. On May 5, 1918, more than 150,000 Chicagoans filled the streets to give a triumphant welcome to the future President of Czechoslovakia. Chicago was then the center of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States and the city gave Masaryk an enthusiastic reception, which echoed Masaryk's earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902. Masaryk had lectured at the University of Chicago in 1902 and 1907. He also had strong personal links with the US since 1878 by his marriage with an [[American citizen]] and his friendship with [[Charles R. Crane]]. a Chicago industrialist. Crane got Masaryk invited to the [[University of Chicago]] and introduced into the highest political circles, including to Wilson.

==Leader of Czechoslovakia==

{{expand section|date=June 2012}}

With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] recognized Masaryk as head of the Provisional Czechoslovak government (on October 14), and on November 14, 1918, [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1918|he was elected President of the Czechoslovak Republic]] by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. He came back to Prague Castle on December 21, 1918.

Masaryk was re-elected as president three times: in May [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1927|1927]], and [[Czechoslovak presidential election, 1934|1934]]. A provision in the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] exempted him from the two-term limit. He visited many countries like France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] in 1923 and 1927. With [[Herbert Clark Hoover]], he guaranteed the 1. PIMCO – First Prague International Management Congress, organized Masaryks Academy of Labour and 120 experts around the world in Prague in July 1924. In March 1930, the National Assembly approved the law: "T.G. Masaryk, he deserved on the State" (law No.22/1930 Sb., from March 6, Czech: "T.G. Masaryk, zasloužil se o stát"). After the rise of Hitler, he was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. He resigned from office on December 14, 1935 on the grounds of old age and poor health, and [[Edvard Beneš]] succeeded him.

On paper, Masaryk's powers as president were limited; the framers of the constitution intended for the [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia|Prime Minister]] and Cabinet to hold the real power. However, he provided a considerable measure of stability in the face of frequent changes of government (there were ten cabinets headed by nine Prime Ministers during his tenure). The stability that he ensured, as well as his great prestige both inside and outside the country, made Masaryk enjoy almost-legendary authority by the people. He used his authority to create an extensive informal political network called ''[[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]]'' (the Castle). Under his watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in central Europe.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13623, Tomá- Garrigue Masaryk.jpg|thumb|upright|Masaryk in 1932]]
Masaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in [[Lány (Kladno District)|Lány]], Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic. He died before the [[Munich Agreement]] and the Nazi occupation of his country. He was known as "The Great Old Man of Europe". Commemorations of Masaryk, state institutions and democratic societies have taken place annually in Lány cemetery on March 7 and September 14, since 1989.

Masaryk wrote several books, including ''The Czech Question'' (1895), ''The Problems of Small Nations in the European Crisis'' (1915), ''The New Europe'' (1917) and ''The World Revolution'' (1925), in Czech, published in English as ''The Making of a State'' (1927), and the two following Volumes). The writer [[Karel Čapek]] wrote a series of articles entitled 'Hovory s T.G.M.' (Conversations with T.G.M.) which were later collected as a form of [[autobiography]].

==Philosophy==
Masaryk's life motto was "Do not fear and do not steal" ({{lang-cz|Nebát se a nekrást}}). He was a philosopher and an outspoken [[rationalist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]], he emphasised practical [[ethics]], reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy, and especially the work of 18th Century German philosopher, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who is considered the founder of nationalism. He was critical of German [[idealism|idealistic philosophy]] {{cn-span|and [[Marxism]].|date=February 2018}}

==Personal life==
Masaryk married Charlotte Garrigue in 1878 and took her family name as his middle name. They had met in [[Leipzig]], Germany, and were engaged in 1877. She was born in [[Brooklyn]] in a Protestant family with French [[Huguenots]] among their ancestors. She came to learn Czech perfectly and published studies in ''[[Bedřich Smetana]]'', a Czech magazine. Hardships during the war took their toll on her, and she died in 1923 from an unspecified illness. Their son, [[Jan Masaryk]], served as [[Foreign Minister]] in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940–1945) and in the governments of 1945 to 1948. Charlotte gave birth to four other children, Herbert, [[Alice Masaryková|Alice]], Eleanor (Anna, or Hana), and Olga.

Although born a [[Catholic]], Masaryk eventually became a non-practising [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="rozhlas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/nabozenstvi/mezinebem/_zprava/masarykuv-vztah-k-nabozenstvi--1464205 |title=Masarykův vztah k náboženství |language=czech |publisher=rozhlas.cz |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced in part by both the declaration of [[papal Infallibility]] in 1870 and his wife, who was raised as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]].&lt;ref name="HaanDaskalova2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francisca de Haan|author2=Krasimira Daskalova|author3=Anna Loutfi|title=Biographical Dictionary of Women's Movements and Feminisms in Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe: 19th and 20th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsgQjbgBOAkC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=2013-08-07|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-7326-39-4|pages=306–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
[[File:Statue of Masaryk in Prague, Apr 2012.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue of Masaryk in Prague.]]]]

As the principal [[father of the nation|founding father]] of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk was regarded in a way as [[George Washington]] is regarded in the [[United States]]. Czechs and Slovaks alike still regard him as a symbol of democracy.

The [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] is a [[order (decoration)|state decoration]] established in 1990 that is awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.

[[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno]], founded in 1919 as the second university of Czechoslovakia, is named after him, first when it was founded and again since 1990, after it had carried the name ''Univerzita [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně|Jana Evangelisty Purkyně]] v Brně'' for 30 years

Numerous statues, busts and plaques commemorate Masaryk. Most are located in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but some are in other countries; notably the [[Statue of Tomas Masaryk (Washington, D.C.)|Masaryk Statue]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as in [[Chicago]] on the [[Midway Plaisance|Midway]], and in [[San Francisco]]'s Golden Gate Park [[rose garden]]. A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is set on a wall of Rachiv, [[Ukraine]], on the site of a hotel where he reportedly resided for a time (1917 to 1918). There is also a bust of Masaryk, erected in 2002, at Druzhba Narodiv Square (Friendship of Nations Square) in [[Uzhhorod]], in the far-western corner of Ukraine.

[[Avenida Presidente Masaryk]] (President Masaryk Avenue), a main avenue in [[Mexico City]], where are located some of the most exclusive garment retailers takes its name from him, as does [[Masaryktown, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6xaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Xk8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5126%2C1819266 | title=Into center of state | work=St. Petersburg Times | date=Mar 23, 1952 | accessdate=1 November 2015 | author=Blackstone, Lillian | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; So too does the [[Kfar Masaryk|Kfar Masaryk kibbutz]] near [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], founded largely by Czechoslovak immigrants. Also [[Tel Aviv]] has a Masaryk Square - Masaryk had visited Tel Aviv in 1927. There is a street in [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]], named ''Masarykova ulica'', as well in many other Croatian towns such as [[Dubrovnik]], [[Daruvar]], [[Varaždin]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. ''Masarikova ulica'' in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], although one of the smallest in the city, has the address of the tallest building in Belgrade, the [[Beograđanka]] palace. One of the streets in the centre of [[Novi Sad]], Serbia is named ''Masarikova ulica''. One of the biggest streets in the capital of [[Slovenia]], [[Ljubljana]], is also named after Masaryk. There is "Rue Thomas Masaryk" in Geneva as well, as well as in downtown [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].

A [[United Nations]] Expeditionary Force [[starship]] in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s 1974 science fiction novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' is named ''Masaryk.''

A photograph of Masaryk leaning out of a train window, waving to and shaking hands with supporters, is the front cover for [[alternative metal]] band, [[Faith No More]]'s 1997 album ''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]''. The [[liner notes]] for the [[album jacket]] depicts the funeral of an old man, with the words "[[Truth prevails|pravda vítězí]]" (truth prevails) adorning the coffin. The statement is the motto of the [[Czech Republic]] and is seen as a symbol of democracy.

Asteroid [[1841 Masaryk]], discovered by [[Lubos Kohoutek]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1842 |title=(1841) Masaryk.

'''Trivialism''' ({{etymology|la|trivialis|found everywhere}}) is the [[logical theory]] that all [[Statement (logic)|statements]] (also known as [[propositions]]) are [[truth value|true]] and that all [[contradiction]]s of the form "p and not p" (e.g. the ball is red and not red) are true. In accordance with this, a '''trivialist''' is a person who believes everything is true.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Dov M.|editor1-last=Gabbay|editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=131|first=Graham|last=Priest|chapter=Paraconsistency and Dialetheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kabay|title=On the Plenitude of Truth.  A Defense of Trivialism|year=2010|publisher=[[Lambert Academic Publishing]]|isbn=978-3-8383-5102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical logic]], trivialism is in direct violation of [[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]]. In [[philosophy]], trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of [[skepticism]]. [[Paraconsistent logic]]s may use "the law of non-triviality" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions.

Theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as [[modal realism]], [[dialetheism]] and paraconsistent logics.

==Overview==

===Etymology===
Trivialism, as a term, is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''trivialis,'' meaning something that can be found everywhere. From this, "[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]" was used to suggest something was introductory or simple. In [[logic]], from this meaning, a "trivial" theory is something regarded as defective in the face of a complex [[phenomenon]] that needs to be completely represented. Thus, literally, the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Theory===

In [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]], trivialism may be expressed as the following:&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=29|publisher=[[The University of Melbourne]], Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \forall pTp &lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as "given any proposition, it is a true proposition" through [[universal quantification]] (∀).

A claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth, otherwise known as a [[truth predicate]]:

: &lt;math&gt;p \leftrightarrow Tp&lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as a "proposition [[if and only if]] a true proposition," meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true. Without consistent use of this concept, a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism; as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as probably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory.&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Taxonomy of trivialisms===

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists four types of trivialism through the concept of [[possible world]]s, with a "world" being a possibility and "the actual world" being reality. It is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true. This taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context:

: (T0) Minimal trivialism: At some world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T1) Pluralist trivialism: In some worlds, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T2) [[Actualism|Actualist]] trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T3) Absolute trivialism: In all worlds, all propositions have a designated value.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

==Arguments against trivialism==

The consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism, termed as non-trivialism or anti-trivialism.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estrada-González|first=Luis|title=Models of Possibilism and Trivialism|journal=Logic and Logical Philosophy|volume=21|pages=175–205|url=http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/LLP/article/view/791}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the [[principle of explosion]] and it being considered an [[absurdity]] ([[reductio ad absurdum]]).&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]] and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism. Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" has interpreted Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics Book IV]]'' as such: "...A family of arguments between 1008a26 and 1007b12 of the form 'If trivialism is right, then X is the case, but if X is the case then all things are one. But it is impossible that all things are one, so trivialism is impossible.'(...)these Aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism: Trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified, and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical, namely, truth and falsehood."&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Priest===

It is implicitly claimed by [[Graham Priest]], a professor of philosophy, that a position for trivialism is unsubstantial: "...a substantial case can be made for [dialetheism]; belief in [trivialism], though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Perceiving contradictions|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=77|issue=4|date=1999|page=Volume 77, Issue 4, p. 443|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912349211?journalCode=rajp20#.U3wYzyg0rDc|doi=10.1080/00048409912349211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has coined his rejection of trivialism "the law of non-triviality" as a replacement for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in [[paraconsistent logic]] and [[dialetheism]].&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Arguments for trivialism==

There are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a [[devil's advocate]]:

===Argument from possibilism===
Paul Kabay has argued for trivialism in "On the Plenitude of Truth" from the following:

# "Possibilism is true [premise]
# If possibilism is true, then there is a world (either possible or impossible or both), ''w'', in which trivialism is true [premise]
# ''w'' is a possible world [premise]
# It is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to the actual world, A [2]
# If it is true that there is a world, ''w'', and ''w'' is a possible world, and it is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to A, then trivialism is true [premise]
# Trivialism is true [1–5]"&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

Above, possibilism ([[modal realism]]; related to [[possible worlds]]) is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible. With this assumed to be true, trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to Kabay.

===Paradoxes===

The [[liar's paradox]], [[Curry's paradox]] alongside the [[principle of explosion]] all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism.&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

==Philosophical implications==

===Comparison to skepticism===
In Paul Kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of [[philosophical skepticism]] (in "On the Plenitude of Truth")—such as [[Pyrrhonism]]—who seek to attain a form of [[ataraxia]], or state of imperturbability; it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state. This is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] being true, even in a state of anxiety. Once universally accepted as true, the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true.

Kabay compares the Pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a [[Epoché|suspension]] of [[belief]], the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief.

In this case—and according to independent claims by Graham Priest—trivialism is considered the complete opposite of [[skepticism]].&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Could Everything Be True?"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Priest |first1=G. |title=Could everything be true? |doi=10.1080/00048400012349471 |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=189–195 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true, the Pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth (or falsity) of such affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Empiricus, S. (2000). ''Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. "Suspension of judgement is a standstill of intellect, owing to which we neither reject nor posit anything" (p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impossibility of action===
It is asserted by both Priest and Kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist [[Apraxia|to truly choose and thus act]]. Priest argues this by the following in ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar'': "One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, ''s'', if one believes ''s'' already to hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of bringing ''s'' about, one cannot believe that ''s'' already obtains."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Doubt truth to be a liar|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199238510|pages=69–71|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kevalin&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/KABITD|work=The Australasian Philosophy of Religion Association Conference|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims, the Pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges.&lt;ref&gt;Comesaña, J. (2012). Can Contemporary Semantics Help the Pyrrhonian Get a Life?. In Pyrrhonism in Ancient, Modern, and Contemporary Philosophy (pp. 217-240). Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, J. W. (2012) Can Pyrrhonists act normally? Philosophical Explorations: An International Journal for the Philosophy of Mind and Action 15(3):277-289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnyeat, M. (1980). Can the sceptic live his scepticism?. In M. Schofield, M. Burnyeat, and J. Barnes (eds.), Doubt and Dogmatism (pp. 20-53). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates==
Paul Kabay, an Australian philosopher, in his book ''A Defense of Trivialism'' has argued that various philosophers in history have held views resembling trivialism, although he stops short of calling them trivialists. He mentions various pre-Socratic Greek philosophers as philosophers holding views resembling trivialism. He mentions that Aristotle in his book ''Metaphysics'' appears to suggest that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras advocated trivialism. He quotes Anaxagoras as saying that all things are one. Kabay also suggests Heraclitus' ideas are similar to trivialism because Heraclitus believed in a union of opposites, shown in such quotes as "the way up and down is the same".&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, P.D. (2008) ''A Defense of Trivialism''. Phd Thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry, The University of Melbourne pages 32–35&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions a fifteen century Roman Catholic cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, stating that what Cusa wrote in ''De Docta Ignorantia'' is interpreted as stating that God contained every fact, which Kabay argues would result in trivialism, but Kabay admits that mainstream Cusa scholars would not agree with interpreting Cusa as a trivialist.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Spinoza as a philosopher whose views resemble trivialism. Kabay argues Spinoza was a trivialist because Spinoza believed everything was made of one substance which had infinite attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Hegel as a philosophers whose views resemble trivialism, quoting Hegel as stating in ''The Science of Logic'' "everything is inherently contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 40–41. [https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/35203/117801_A%20Defense%20of%20Trivialismelectronic.pdf?sequence=1 A Defense of Trivialism]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azzouni===
[[Jody Azzouni]] is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article ''The Strengthened Liar'' by claiming that [[natural language]] is [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] and inconsistent through the existence of the [[liar paradox]] ("This sentence is false"), and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction. It is heavily implied by Azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=42|quote=...According to Azzouni, natural language is trivial, that is to say, every sentence in natural language is true...And, of course, trivialism follows straightforwardly from the triviality of natural language: after all, 'trivialism is true' is a sentence in natural language...|publisher=The University of Melbourne, Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Troubles with Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bueno |first1=O.

===Anaxagoras===
The Greek philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] is suggested as a possible trivialist by [[Graham Priest]] in his 2005 book ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar''. Priest writes, "He held that, at least at one time, everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Anti-trivialism==
[[File:Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in symbolic logic.svg|thumb|Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]]; Read as "given any proposition, it is neither a true or false proposition."]]

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists eight types of anti-trivialism (or non-trivialism) through the use of [[possible worlds]]:

: (AT0) [[Actualist]] minimal anti-trivialism: In the actual world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT1) Actualist absolute anti-trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT2) Minimal anti-trivialism: In some worlds, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT3) Pointed anti-trivialism (or minimal logical [[nihilism]]): In some worlds, every proposition does not have a value of true or false.
: (AT4) Distributed anti-trivialism: In every world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT5) Strong anti-trivialism: Some propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.
: (AT6) Super anti-trivialism (or moderate logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false at some world.
: (AT7) Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

'''''Weltschmerz''''' (from the German, literally ''world-pain'', also ''world weariness'', {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʃmɛɐ̯ts|pron}}) is a term coined by the German author [[Jean Paul]] and denotes the kind of feeling experienced by someone who believes that physical reality can never satisfy the demands of the mind.{{cn|date=June 2018}} This kind of [[world view]] was widespread among several [[romanticism|romantic]] and [[decadent movement|decadent]] authors such as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[William Blake]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Nikolaus Lenau]],&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braun|first1=Wilhelm Afred|title=Types of Weltschmerz in German Poetry|date=1905|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C58tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=weltschmerz+heinrich+heine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TWO6WoD9bz&amp;sig=N5V6VYVUmyW3GfPQbf_tSNeXGKE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA54Dq_YDMAhUC6yYKHSVdB-MQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=weltschmerz%20heinrich%20heine&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Hesse]],&lt;ref name="Stelzig"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stelzig|first1=Eugene L.|title=Hermann Hesse's Fictions of the Self: Autobiography and the Confessional Imagination|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-06750-3|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwQABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=weltschmerz+hermann+hesse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3Vgdf1LOxk&amp;sig=_jzL8PW02vdf5liGPmk_TuTE5rI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-joSf_IDMAhUBQCYKHfh7AKY4ChDoAQgiMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=weltschmerz%20hermann%20hesse&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

[[Frederick C. Beiser]] defines ''Weltschmerz'' more broadly as "a mood of weariness or sadness about life arising from the acute awareness of evil and suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwRDAAAQBAJ |title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900 |last=Beiser |first=Frederick C. |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191081347 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that by the 1860s the word was used ironically in Germany to refer to oversensitivity to those same concerns.

==Further examples==
[[John Steinbeck]] wrote about this feeling in ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' and referred to it as the ''Welshrats''; and in ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', Samuel Hamilton feels it after meeting Cathy Trask for the first time. [[Ralph Ellison]] uses the term in ''[[Invisible Man]]'' with regard to the pathos inherent in the singing of spirituals: "beneath the swiftness of the hot tempo there was a slower tempo and a cave and I entered it and looked around and heard an old woman singing a spiritual as full of Weltschmerz as [[flamenco]]". [[Kurt Vonnegut]] references this feeling in his novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''; it is felt by Doctor Paul Proteus and his father. In [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', he describes an acquaintance, "Moldorf", who has prescriptions for Weltschmerz on scraps of paper in his pocket.
