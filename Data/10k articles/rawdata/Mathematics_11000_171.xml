      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebra bundle''' is a [[fiber bundle]] whose [[fiber (mathematics) | fiber]]s are [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s and [[local trivialization]]s respect the algebra structure. It follows that the [[Transition map|transition functions]] are [[algebra isomorphism]]s. Since algebras are also [[vector space]]s, every algebra bundle is a [[vector bundle]].

Examples include the [[tensor-algebra bundle]], [[exterior bundle]], and [[symmetric bundle]] associated to a given [[vector bundle]], as well as the [[Clifford bundle]] associated to any Riemannian vector bundle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2332">'''Analysis on fractals''' or '''calculus on fractals''' is a generalization of [[Differentiable manifold|calculus on smooth manifolds]] to [[calculus]] on [[fractals]].

The theory describes dynamical phenomena which occur on objects modelled by fractals.
It studies questions such as "how does heat diffuse in a fractal?" and "How does a fractal vibrate?"

In the smooth case the operator that occurs most often in the equations modelling these questions is the [[Laplacian]], so the starting point for the theory of analysis on fractals is to define a Laplacian on fractals. This turns out not to be a full [[differential operator]] in the usual sense but has many of the desired properties. There are a number of approaches to defining the Laplacian: probabilistic, analytical or measure theoretic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2979">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bogomolov conjecture''', named for [[Fedor Bogomolov]], is the following statement:

Let ''C'' be an [[algebraic curve]] of [[genus (curve)|genus]] ''g'' at least two defined over a [[number field]] ''K'', let &lt;math&gt;\overline K&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K'', fix an embedding of ''C'' into its [[Jacobian variety]] ''J'', and let &lt;math&gt;\hat h&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Néron-Tate height]] on ''J'' associated to an [[Ample divisor|ample symmetric divisor]]. Then there exists an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the set

: &lt;math&gt;\{ P \in C(\overline{K}) : \hat{h}(P) &lt; \epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp; is finite.

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat h(P)=0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''P'' is a [[torsion point]], the Bogomolov conjecture generalises the [[Manin-Mumford conjecture]]. The original Bogomolov conjecture was proved by [[Emmanuel Ullmo]] and [[Shou-Wu Zhang]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ullmo |first=E. |title=Positivité et Discrétion des Points Algébriques des Courbes |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=167–179 |doi=10.2307/120987 | zbl=0934.14013 |arxiv=alg-geom/9606017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''A'' be an [[abelian variety]] defined over ''K'', and let &lt;math&gt;\hat h&lt;/math&gt; be the Néron-Tate height on ''A'' associated to an ample symmetric divisor. A [[subvariety]] &lt;math&gt;X\subset A&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''torsion subvariety'' if it is the translate of an abelian subvariety of ''A'' by a torsion point. If ''X'' is not a torsion subvariety, then there is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the set

: &lt;math&gt;\{ P \in X(\overline{K}) : \hat{h}(P) &lt; \epsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp; is not [[Zariski dense]] in ''X''.

In CECPQ1, 32 bytes of shared secret material are derived using X25519 key exchange, with a further 32 bytes being derived using the newhope lattice-based key exchange method (whence the quantum-resistance). The resulting bytes are concatenated and form a pre-master secret for deriving shared keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">'''Centipede mathematics''' is a term used, sometimes derogatorily, to describe the [[Generalization|generalisation]] and study of mathematical objects satisfying progressively fewer and fewer restrictions. This type of study is likened to studying how a [[centipede]] behaves when its legs are removed one by one.

The term is attributed to Polish mathematician [[Antoni Zygmund]]. Zygmund is said to have described the metaphor of the centipede thus: "You take a centipede and pull off ninety-nine of its legs and see what it can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steven Krantz|title=Mathematical Apocrypha Redux: More Stories and Anecdotes of Mathematicians and the Mathematical|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780883855546|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;Thus, Zygmund has been known by many mathematicians as the "Centipede Surgeon".

The study of [[semigroup]]s is cited as an example of doing centipede mathematics.&lt;ref name=nLab&gt;{{cite web|title=Centipede mathematics|url=http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/centipede+mathematics|publisher=nLab|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One starts with the notion of an [[abelian group]]. First delete the [[commutativity]] restriction to obtain the concept of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The restriction of existence of inverses is then removed. This produces a [[monoid]].  If one now removes the restriction regarding the existence of identity, the resulting object turns out to be a semigroup. Still more legs can be removed. If the [[associativity]] restriction is also discarded one gets a [[magma (algebra)|magma]] or a groupoid. The restrictions that define an abelian group may be removed in different orders also.  The study of [[ternary ring]] has been cited as an example of centipede mathematics. The progressive removal of axioms of [[Euclidean geometry]] and studying the resulting geometrical objects also illustrate the methodology of centipede mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John Baez|title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 145)|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week145.html|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following quote summarises the value and usefulness of the concept: "The term ‘centipede mathematics’ is new to me, but its practice is surely of great antiquity. The binomial theorem (tear off the leg that says that the exponent has to be a natural number) is a good example. A related notion is the importance of good notation and the importance of overloading, aka abuse of language, to establish useful analogies." — Gavin Wraith.&lt;ref name=nLab/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''chain complex''' is an [[algebraic structure]] that consists of a sequence of [[abelian group]]s (or [[module (mathematics)|modules]]) and a sequence of [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]] between consecutive groups such that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of each homomorphism is included in the [[kernel (algebra)#Group homomorphisms|kernel]] of the next. Associated to a chain complex is its [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]], which describes how the images are included in the kernels.

A '''cochain complex''' is similar to a chain complex, except that its homomorphisms follow a different convention. The homology of a cochain complex is called its cohomology.

In [[algebraic topology]], the singular chain complex of a [[topological space]] X is constructed using [[continuous function#continuous functions between topological spaces|continuous maps]] from a [[simplex]] to X, and the homomorphisms of the chain complex capture how these maps restrict to the boundary of the simplex. The homology of this chain complex is called the [[singular homology]] of X, and is a commonly used [[topological invariant|invariant]] of a topological space.

Chain complexes are studied in [[homological algebra]], but are used in several areas of mathematics, including [[abstract algebra]], [[Galois theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. They can be defined more generally in [[abelian categories]].

==Definitions==
A '''chain complex''' &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet, d_\bullet)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... connected by homomorphisms (called '''boundary operators''' or '''differentials''') ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;→''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is the zero map. Explicitly, the differentials satisfy ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, or with indices suppressed, ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. The complex may be written out as follows.

::&lt;math&gt;
\cdots
\xleftarrow{d_0} A_0
\xleftarrow{d_1} A_1
\xleftarrow{d_2} A_2
\xleftarrow{d_3} A_3
\xleftarrow{d_4} A_4
\xleftarrow{d_5}
\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''cochain complex''' &lt;math&gt;(A^\bullet, d^\bullet)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] notion to a chain complex. It consists of a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, ... connected by homomorphisms ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; : ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;→''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; satisfying ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''d''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  = 0. The cochain complex may be written out in a similar fashion to the chain complex.

::&lt;math&gt;
\cdots
\xrightarrow{d^{-1}}
A^0 \xrightarrow{d^0}
A^1 \xrightarrow{d^1}
A^2 \xrightarrow{d^2}
A^3 \xrightarrow{d^3}
A^4 \xrightarrow{d^4}
\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

The index ''n'' in either ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is referred to as the '''degree''' (or '''dimension'''). The difference between chain and cochain complexes is that, in chain complexes, the differentials decrease dimension, whereas in cochain complexes they increase dimension. All the concepts and definitions for chain complexes apply to cochain complexes, except that they will follow this different convention for dimension, and often terms will be given the [[prefix]] ''co-''. In this article, definitions will be given for chain complexes when the distinction is not required.

A '''bounded chain complex''' is one in which [[almost all#cardinality|almost all]] the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are 0; that is, a finite complex extended to the left and right by 0. An example is the chain complex defining the [[simplicial homology]] of a finite [[simplicial complex]]. A chain complex is '''bounded above''' if all modules above some fixed degree ''N'' are 0, and is '''bounded below''' if all modules below some fixed degree are 0. Clearly, a complex is bounded both above and below if and only if the complex is bounded.

The elements of the individual groups of a (co)chain complex are called '''(co)chains'''. The elements in the kernel of ''d'' are called '''(co)cycles''' (or '''closed''' elements), and the elements in the image of ''d'' are called '''(co)boundaries''' (or '''exact''' elements). Right from the definition of the differential, all boundaries are cycles. The '''''n''-th (co)homology group''' ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (''H''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) is the group of (co)cycles [[modulo_(jargon)#structures|modulo]] (co)boundaries in degree ''n'', that is,

::&lt;math&gt;H_n = \frac{\ker d_{n}}{\mbox{im } d_{n+1}}\quad \left(H^n = \frac{\ker d^{n}}{\mbox{im } d^{n-1}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Exact sequences===
{{main article|Exact sequence}}
An '''exact sequence''' (or '''exact''' complex) is a chain complex whose homology groups are all zero. This means all closed elements in the complex are exact. A '''short exact sequence''' is a bounded exact sequence in which only the groups ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt; may be nonzero. For example, the following chain complex is a short exact sequence.
:&lt;math&gt;
\cdots
\xrightarrow{} \; 0 \;
\xrightarrow{} \; \mathbf{Z} \;
\xrightarrow{\times p} \; \mathbf{Z}
\twoheadrightarrow \mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z} \;
\xrightarrow{} \; 0 \;
\xrightarrow{}
\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
In the middle group, the closed elements are the elements p'''Z'''; these are clearly the exact elements in this group.

===Chain maps===
A '''chain map''' ''f'' between two chain complexes &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet, d_{A,\bullet})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(B_\bullet, d_{B,\bullet})&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence &lt;math&gt;f_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; of homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f_n : A_n \rightarrow B_n&lt;/math&gt; for each ''n'' that commutes with the boundary operators on the two chain complexes, so &lt;math&gt; d_{B,n} \circ f_n = f_{n-1} \circ d_{A,n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is written out in the following [[commutative diagram]].
:[[Image:Chain map.svg|650 px]]

A chain map sends cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries, and thus induces a map on homology &lt;math&gt;(f_\bullet)_*:H_\bullet(A_\bullet, d_{A,\bullet}) \rightarrow H_\bullet(B_\bullet, d_{B,\bullet})&lt;/math&gt;.

A continuous map ''f'' between topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' induces a chain map between the singular chain complexes of ''X'' and ''Y'', and hence induces a map ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; between the singular homology of ''X'' and ''Y'' as well. When ''X'' and ''Y'' are both equal to the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]], the map induced on homology defines the [[Degree of a continuous mapping#From Sn to Sn|degree]] of the map ''f''.

The concept of chain map reduces to the one of boundary through the construction of the [[Mapping cone (homological algebra)|cone]] of a chain map.

===Chain homotopy===
{{See also|Homotopy category of chain complexes}}
A chain homotopy offers a way to relate two chain maps that induce the same map on homology groups, even though the maps may be different. Given two chain complexes ''A'' and ''B'', and two chain maps ''f'',''g'' : ''A'' → ''B'', a '''chain homotopy''' is a sequence of homomorphisms ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''hd''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;''h'' = ''f'' − ''g''. The maps may be written out in a diagram as follows, but this diagram is not commutative.

:[[Image:Chain homotopy between chain complexes.svg|650 px]]

The map ''hd''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;''h'' is easily verified to induce the zero map on homology, for any ''h''. It immediately follows that ''f'' and ''g'' induce the same map on homology. One says ''f'' and ''g'' are '''chain homotopic''' (or simply '''homotopic'''), and this property defines an [[equivalence relation]] between chain maps.

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces. In the case of singular homology, a [[homotopy]] between continuous maps ''f'',''g'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' induces a chain homotopy between the chain maps corresponding to ''f'' and ''g''. This shows that two homotopic maps induce the same map  on singular homology. The name "chain homotopy" is motivated by this example.

==Examples==

===Singular homology===
{{main|Singular homology}}
Let ''X'' be a topological space. Define ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for [[Natural number|natural]] ''n'' to be the [[free abelian group]] formally generated by [[singular homology|singular n-simplices]] in ''X'', and define the boundary map &lt;math&gt;\partial_n: C_n(X) \to C_{n-1}(X)&lt;/math&gt; to be

::&lt;math&gt;\partial_n : \, (\sigma: [v_0,\ldots,v_n] \to X) \mapsto \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i (\sigma: [v_0,\ldots, \hat v_i, \ldots, v_n] \to X)&lt;/math&gt;

where the hat denotes the omission of a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. That is, the boundary of a singular simplex is the alternating sum of restrictions to its faces. It can be shown that ∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, so &lt;math&gt;(C_\bullet, \partial_\bullet)&lt;/math&gt; is a chain complex; the '''singular homology''' &lt;math&gt;H_\bullet(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the homology of this complex.

Singular homology is a useful invariant of topological spaces up to [[homotopy#homotopy_equivalence|homotopy equivalence]]. The degree zero homology group is a free abelian group on the [[connected space#connected components|connected components]] of ''X''.

===de Rham cohomology===
{{main|de Rham cohomology}}
The [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]] on any [[smooth manifold]] ''M'' form a [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] called Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') under addition. 
The [[exterior derivative]] ''d'' maps Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') to Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(''M''), and ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 follows essentially from [[symmetry of second derivatives]], so the vector spaces of ''k''-forms along with the exterior derivative are a cochain complex.

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega^0(M)\ \stackrel{d}{\to}\ \Omega^1(M) \to \Omega^2(M) \to \Omega^3(M) \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt; 

The cohomology of this complex is called the '''de Rham cohomology''' of ''X''. The homology group in dimension zero is isomorphic to the vector space of [[locally constant function]]s from ''M'' to '''R'''. Thus for a compact manifold, this is the real vector space whose dimension is the number of connected components of ''M''.

[[smoothness#smooth functions between manifolds|Smooth maps]] between manifolds induce chain maps, and smooth homotopies between maps induce chain homotopies.

==Category of chain complexes==
Chain complexes of ''K''-modules with chain maps form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] Ch&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''K'' is a commutative ring.

If ''V'' = ''V''&lt;math&gt;{}_*&lt;/math&gt; and ''W'' = ''W''&lt;math&gt;{}_*&lt;/math&gt; are chain complexes, their '''tensor product''' &lt;math&gt; V \otimes W &lt;/math&gt; is a chain complex with degree ''n'' elements given by 
:&lt;math&gt; (V \otimes W)_n = \bigoplus_{\{i,j|i+j=n\}} V_i \otimes W_j &lt;/math&gt;

and differential given by 
: &lt;math&gt; \partial (a \otimes b) = \partial a \otimes b + (-1)^{\left|a\right|} a \otimes \partial b &lt;/math&gt; 
where ''a'' and ''b'' are any two homogeneous vectors in ''V'' and ''W'' respectively, and &lt;math&gt; \left|a\right| &lt;/math&gt; denotes the degree of ''a''.

This tensor product makes the category Ch&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; into a [[symmetric monoidal category]]. The identity object with respect to this monoidal product is the base ring ''K'' viewed as a chain complex in degree 0. The [[braided monoidal category|braiding]] is given on simple tensors of homogeneous elements by 
:&lt;math&gt; a \otimes b \mapsto (-1)^{\left|a\right|\left|b\right|} b \otimes a &lt;/math&gt;
The sign is necessary for the braiding to be a chain map.

Moreover, the category of chain complexes of ''K''-modules also has [[closed monoidal category|internal Hom]]: given chain complexes ''V'' and ''W'', the internal Hom of ''V'' and ''W'', denoted Hom(''V'',''W''), is the chain complex with degree ''n'' elements given by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i}\text{Hom}_K (V_i,W_{i+n})&lt;/math&gt; and differential given by
: &lt;math&gt; (\partial f)(v) = \partial(f(v)) - (-1)^{\left|f\right|} f(\partial(v)) &lt;/math&gt;.
We have a [[natural isomorphism]]
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A\otimes B, C) \cong \text{Hom}(A,\text{Hom}(B,C))&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Four concyclic points.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Four concyclic points forming a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], showing two equal angles]]

In [[geometry]], a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[point (geometry)|points]] are said to be '''concyclic''' (or '''cocyclic''') if they lie on a common [[circle]]. All concyclic points are the same distance from the [[center (geometry)|center]] of the circle. Three points in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] that do not all fall on a [[straight line]] are concyclic, but four or more such points in the plane are not necessarily concyclic.

==Bisectors==
In general the centre ''O'' of a circle on which points ''P'' and ''Q'' lie must be such that ''OP'' and ''OQ'' are equal distances. Therefore ''O'' must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ''PQ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The radius of the circle on which lie a set of points is, by definition, the radius of the circumcircle of any triangle with vertices at any three of those points. If the pairwise distances among three of the points are ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', then the circle's radius is

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\frac{a^2b^2c^2}{(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of the circumcircle of a triangle, and expressions for the radius and the coordinates of the circle's center, in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given [[Circumscribed circle#Circumcircle equations|here]] and [[Circumscribed circle#Cartesian coordinates|here]].

an expression that was derived by the Indian mathematician Vatasseri [[Parameshvara]] in the 15th century.

By [[Ptolemy's theorem]], if a quadrilateral is given by the pairwise distances between its four vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' in order, then it is cyclic if and only if the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides: 

: &lt;math&gt;AC \cdot BD = AB \cdot  CD + BC \cdot AD.&lt;/math&gt;

If two lines, one  containing segment ''AC'' and the other containing segment ''BD'', intersect at ''X'', then the four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' are concyclic if and only if&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bradley |first=Christopher J. |title=The Algebra of Geometry: Cartesian, Areal and Projective Co-Ordinates |publisher=Highperception |year=2007 |isbn=1906338000 |page=179 |oclc=213434422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle AX\cdot XC = BX\cdot XD.&lt;/math&gt;

The intersection ''X'' may be internal or external to the circle. This theorem is known as [[power of a point]].

===n-gons===

More generally, a polygon in which all vertices are concyclic is called a [[cyclic polygon]]. A polygon is cyclic if and only if the perpendicular bisectors of its edges are concurrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Variations==
Some authors consider [[collinear points]] (sets of points all belonging to a single line) to be a special case of concyclic points, with the line being viewed as a circle of infinite radius. This point of view is helpful, for instance, when studying [[Inversive geometry|inversion through a circle]] and [[Möbius transformation]]s, as these transformations preserve the concyclicity of points only in this extended sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the [[complex plane]] (formed by viewing the real and imaginary parts of a [[complex number]] as the ''x'' and ''y'' [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the plane), concyclicity has a particularly simple formulation: four points in the complex plane are either concyclic or collinear if and only if their [[cross-ratio]] is a [[real number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Examples==

===Triangles===

In any triangle all of the following nine points are concyclic on what is called the [[nine-point circle]]: the midpoints of the three edges, the feet of the three altitudes, and the points halfway between the orthocenter and each of the three vertices.

[[Lester's theorem]] states that in any [[scalene triangle]], the two [[Fermat point]]s, the [[nine-point center]], and the [[circumcenter]] are concyclic.

If [[Line (mathematics)|lines]] are drawn through the [[Lemoine point]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the sides of a triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, in what is called the [[Lemoine circle]].

The [[van Lamoen circle]] associated with any given triangle &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[circumcenter]]s of the six triangles that are defined inside &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by its three [[median (geometry)|median]]s.

A triangle's [[circumcenter]], its [[Lemoine point]], and its first two [[Brocard points]] are concyclic, with the segment from the circumcenter to the Lemoine point being a diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J. A. "Some examples of the use of areal coordinates in triangle geometry", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 83, November 1999, 472–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other polygons===

A [[polygon]] is defined to be [[cyclic polygon|cyclic]] if its vertices are all concyclic. For example, all the vertices of a [[regular polygon]] of any number of sides are concyclic.

A [[tangential polygon]] is one having an [[inscribed circle]] tangent to each side of the polygon; these tangency points are thus concyclic on the inscribed circle.

A convex quadrilateral is [[orthodiagonal]] (has perpendicular diagonals) if and only if the midpoints of the sides and the feet of the four [[Quadrilateral#Special line segments|altitudes]] are eight concyclic points, on what is called the '''eight-point circle'''.

In [[mathematics]] and in particular in [[algebra]], a [[linear equation system|linear]] or [[nonlinear equation system|nonlinear]] [[system of equations]] is '''consistent''' if there is at least one set of values for the unknowns that satisfies every equation in the system&amp;mdash;that is, that when substituted into each of the equations makes each equation hold true as an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]. In contrast, an equation system is '''inconsistent''' if there is no set of values for the unknowns that satisfies all of the equations.

If a system of equations is inconsistent, then it is possible to manipulate and combine the equations in such a way as to obtain contradictory information, such as 2 = 1, or ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 5 ''and'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 6 (which implies 5 = 6).

Both types of equation system, consistent and inconsistent, can be any of [[overdetermined system|overdetermined]] (having more equations than unknowns), [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]] (having fewer equations than unknowns), or exactly determined.

==Simple examples==

===Underdetermined and consistent===
The system
:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=3,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x+y+2z=4&lt;/math&gt;

has an infinite number of solutions, all of them having ''z'' = 1 (as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second), and all of them therefore having ''x+y'' = 2 for any values of ''x'' and ''y''.

The nonlinear system

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2=10,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=5&lt;/math&gt;

has an infinitude of solutions, all involving &lt;math&gt;z=\pm \sqrt{5}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since each of these systems has more than one solution, it is an [[indeterminate system]].

===Underdetermined and inconsistent===

The system

:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=3,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=4&lt;/math&gt;

has no solutions, as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second to obtain the impossible 0 = 1.

The nonlinear system

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2=10,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2=12&lt;/math&gt;

has no solutions, because if one equation is subtracted from the other we obtain the impossible 0 = 2.

===Exactly determined and consistent===

The system 

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+2y= 5&lt;/math&gt;

has exactly one solution: ''x'' = 1, ''y''= 2.

The nonlinear system 

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

has the two solutions (''x, y'') = (1, 0) and (''x, y'') = (0, 1), while

:&lt;math&gt;x^3+y^3+z^3=10,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^3+2y^3+z^3=12,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3x^3+5y^3+3z^3=34&lt;/math&gt;

has an infinite number of solutions because the third equation is the first equation plus twice the second one and hence contains no independent information; thus any value of ''z'' can be chosen and values of ''x'' and ''y'' can be found to satisfy the first two (and hence the third) equations.

===Exactly determined and inconsistent===

The system 

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4x+4y=10&lt;/math&gt;

has no solutions; the inconsistency can be seen by multiplying the first equation by 4 and subtracting the second equation to obtain the impossible 0 = 2.

Likewise, 

:&lt;math&gt;x^3+y^3+z^3=10,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^3+2y^3+z^3=12,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3x^3+5y^3+3z^3=32&lt;/math&gt;

is an inconsistent system because the first equation plus twice the second minus the third contains the contradiction 0 = 2.

===Overdetermined and consistent===

The system 

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+ 2y= 7,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4x+6y=20&lt;/math&gt;

has a solution, ''x''  = –1, ''y'' = 4, because the first two equations do not contradict each other and the third equation is redundant (since it contains the same information as can be obtained from the first two equations by multiplying each through by 2 and summing them).

The system

:&lt;math&gt;x+2y=7,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3x+6y=21,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;7x+14y=49&lt;/math&gt;

has an infinitude of solutions since all three equations give the same information as each other (as can be seen by multiplying through the first equation by either 3 or 7). Any value of ''y'' is part of a solution, with the corresponding value of ''x'' being 7–2y.

The nonlinear system

:&lt;math&gt;x^2-1=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y^2-1=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x-1)(y-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;

has the three solutions (''x, y'') = (1, –1), (–1, 1), and (1, 1).

===Overdetermined and inconsistent===

The system

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=3,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+ 2y= 7,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4x+6y=21&lt;/math&gt;

is inconsistent because the last equation contradicts the information embedded in the first two, as seen by multiplying each of the first two through by 2 and summing them.

The system

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+2y^2=2,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2x^2+3y^2=4&lt;/math&gt;

is inconsistent because the sum of the first two equations contradicts the third one.

==Criteria for consistency==

As can be seen from the above examples, consistency versus inconsistency is a different issue from comparing the numbers of equations and unknowns.

===Linear systems===
{{Main|Linear equation system#Consistency}}

A linear system is consistent [[if and only if]] its [[coefficient matrix]] has the same [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] as does its [[augmented matrix]] (the coefficient matrix with an extra column added, that column being the [[column vector]] of constants).

In [[mathematics]], in the areas of [[order theory]] and [[combinatorics]], '''Dilworth's theorem''' characterizes the '''width''' of any finite [[partially ordered set]] in terms of a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the order into a minimum number of chains. It is named for the mathematician {{harvs|first=Robert P.|last=Dilworth|authorlink=Robert P. Dilworth|year=1950|txt}}.

An [[antichain]] in a partially ordered set is a set of elements no two of which are comparable to each other, and a chain is a set of elements every two of which are comparable.  Dilworth's theorem states that there exists an antichain ''A'', and a partition of the order into a family ''P'' of chains, such that the number of chains in the partition equals the cardinality of ''A''.  When this occurs, ''A'' must be the largest antichain in the order, for any antichain can have at most one element from each member of ''P''. Similarly, ''P'' must be the smallest family of chains into which the order can be partitioned, for any partition into chains must have at least one chain per element of ''A''. The width of the partial order is defined as the common size of ''A'' and ''P''.

An equivalent way of stating Dilworth's theorem is that, in any finite partially ordered set, the maximum number of elements in any antichain equals the minimum number of chains in any partition of the set into chains. A version of the theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that, in this case, a partially ordered set has finite width ''w'' if and only if it may be partitioned into ''w'' chains, but not less.

== Inductive proof ==

The following proof by induction on the size of the partially ordered set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is based on that of {{harvs|last=Galvin|authorlink=Fred Galvin|txt|year=1994}}.

Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a finite partially ordered set. The theorem holds trivially if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is empty. So, assume that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; has at least one element, and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal element of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

By induction, we assume that for some integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the partially ordered set &lt;math&gt;P':=P\setminus\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; disjoint chains &lt;math&gt;C_1,\dots,C_k&lt;/math&gt; and has at least one antichain &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;A_0\cap C_i\ne\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\dots,k&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\dots,k&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; be the maximal element in &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; that belongs to an antichain of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;, and set &lt;math&gt;A:=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
We claim that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an antichain. 
Let &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; be an antichain of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. Fix arbitrary distinct indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A_i\cap C_j\ne\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;y\in A_i\cap C_j&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;y\le x_j&lt;/math&gt;, by the definition of &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that &lt;math&gt;x_i\not \ge x_j&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x_i\not\ge y&lt;/math&gt;. By interchanging the roles of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in this argument we also have &lt;math&gt;x_j\not\ge x_i&lt;/math&gt;. This verifies that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an antichain.

We now return to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose first that &lt;math&gt;a\ge x_i&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be the chain &lt;math&gt;\{a\}\cup\{z\in C_i:z\le x_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the choice of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P\setminus K&lt;/math&gt; does not have an antichain of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Induction then implies that &lt;math&gt;P\setminus K&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; disjoint chains since &lt;math&gt;A \setminus \{x_i \}&lt;/math&gt; is an antichain of size &lt;math&gt;k - 1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P \setminus K&lt;/math&gt;. 
Thus, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; disjoint chains, as required. Next, if &lt;math&gt;a\not\ge x_i&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A\cup\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is an antichain of size &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is maximal in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). Now &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by the &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; chains &lt;math&gt;\{a\},C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k&lt;/math&gt;, completing the proof.

==Proof via Kőnig's theorem==
[[Image:Dilworth-via-König.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Proof of Dilworth's theorem via Kőnig's theorem: constructing a bipartite graph from a partial order, and partitioning into chains according to a matching]]

Like a number of other results in combinatorics, Dilworth's theorem is equivalent to [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)|Kőnig's theorem]] on [[bipartite graph]] matching and several other related theorems including [[Hall's marriage theorem]] {{harv|Fulkerson|1956}}.

To prove Dilworth's theorem for a partial order ''S'' with ''n'' elements, using Kőnig's theorem, define a bipartite graph ''G'' = (''U'',''V'',''E'') where ''U'' = ''V'' = ''S'' and where (''u'',''v'') is an edge in ''G'' when ''u'' &lt; ''v'' in ''S''.  By Kőnig's theorem, there exists a matching ''M'' in ''G'', and a set of vertices ''C'' in ''G'', such that each edge in the graph contains at least one vertex in ''C'' and such that ''M'' and ''C'' have the same cardinality ''m''.  Let ''A'' be the set of elements of ''S'' that do not correspond to any vertex in ''C''; then ''A'' has at least ''n'' - ''m'' elements (possibly more if ''C'' contains vertices corresponding to the same element on both sides of the bipartition). Let ''P'' be a family of chains formed by including ''x'' and ''y'' in the same chain whenever there is an edge (''x'',''y'') in ''M''; then ''P'' has ''n'' - ''m'' chains. Therefore, we have constructed an antichain and a partition into chains with the same cardinality.

To prove Kőnig's theorem from Dilworth's theorem, for a bipartite graph ''G'' = (''U'',''V'',''E''), form a partial order on the vertices of ''G'' in which ''u'' &lt; ''v'' exactly when ''u'' is in ''U'', ''v'' is in ''V'', and there exists an edge in ''E'' from ''u'' to ''v''. By Dilworth's theorem, there exists an antichain ''A'' and a partition into chains ''P'' both of which have the same size. But the only nontrivial chains in the partial order are pairs of elements corresponding to the edges in the graph, so the nontrivial chains in ''P'' form a matching in the graph. The complement of ''A'' forms a vertex cover in ''G'' with the same cardinality as this matching.

This connection to bipartite matching allows the width of any partial order to be computed in [[polynomial time]]. More precisely, ''n''-element partial orders of width ''k'' can be recognized in time ''O''(''kn''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) {{harv|Felsner|Raghavan|Spinrad|2003}}.

==Extension to infinite partially ordered sets==
Dilworth's theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that a partially ordered set has finite width ''w'' if and only if it may be partitioned into ''w'' chains.  For, suppose that an infinite partial order ''P'' has width ''w'', meaning that there are at most a finite number ''w'' of elements in any antichain. For any subset ''S'' of ''P'', a decomposition into ''w'' chains (if it exists) may be described as a [[graph coloring|coloring]] of the [[comparability graph|incomparability graph]] of ''S'' (a graph that has the elements of ''S'' as vertices, with an edge between every two incomparable elements) using ''w'' colors; every color class in a proper coloring of the incomparability graph must be a chain. By the assumption that ''P'' has width ''w'', and by the finite version of Dilworth's theorem, every finite subset ''S'' of ''P'' has a ''w''-colorable incomparability graph. Therefore, by the [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (graph theory)|De Bruijn–Erdős theorem]], ''P'' itself also has a ''w''-colorable incomparability graph, and thus has the desired partition into chains {{harv|Harzheim|2005}}.

However, the theorem does not extend so simply to partially ordered sets in which the width, and not just the cardinality of the set, is infinite. In this case the size of the largest antichain and the minimum number of chains needed to cover the partial order may be very different from each other. In particular, for every infinite cardinal number κ there is an infinite partially ordered set of width [[Aleph-naught|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] whose partition into the fewest chains has κ chains {{harv|Harzheim|2005}}.

{{harvtxt|Perles|1963}} discusses analogues of Dilworth's theorem in the infinite setting.

==Dual of Dilworth's theorem (Mirsky's theorem)==
{{main article|Mirsky's theorem}}
A dual of Dilworth's theorem states that the size of the largest chain in a partial order (if finite) equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned {{harv|Mirsky|1971}}.  The proof of this is much simpler than the proof of Dilworth's theorem itself: for any element ''x'', consider the chains that have ''x'' as their largest element, and let ''N''(''x'') denote the size of the largest of these ''x''-maximal chains. Then each set ''N''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''i''), consisting of elements that have equal values of ''N'', is an antichain, and these antichains partition the partial order into a number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain.

==Perfection of comparability graphs==
A [[comparability graph]] is an [[undirected graph]] formed from a partial order by creating a vertex per element of the order, and an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Thus, a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a comparability graph corresponds to a chain, and an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in a comparability graph corresponds to an antichain. Any [[induced subgraph]] of a comparability graph is itself a comparability graph, formed from the restriction of the partial order to a subset of its elements.

An undirected graph is [[Perfect graph|perfect]] if, in every induced subgraph, the [[chromatic number]] equals the size of the largest clique. Every comparability graph is perfect: this is essentially just Mirsky's theorem, restated in graph-theoretic terms {{harv|Berge|Chvátal|1984}}. By the [[perfect graph theorem]] of {{harvtxt|Lovász|1972}}, the [[Complement graph|complement]] of any perfect graph is also perfect. Therefore, the complement of any comparability graph is perfect; this is essentially just Dilworth's theorem itself, restated in graph-theoretic terms {{harv|Berge|Chvátal|1984}}. Thus, the complementation property of perfect graphs can provide an alternative proof of Dilworth's theorem.

==Width of special partial orders==
The [[Boolean lattice]] ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[power set]] of an ''n''-element set ''X''—essentially {1, 2, …, ''n''}—ordered by [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] or, notationally, (2&lt;sup&gt;[''n'']&lt;/sup&gt;, ⊆). [[Sperner's theorem]] states that a maximum antichain of ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has size at most
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{width}(B_n) = {n \choose \lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, a largest family of incomparable subsets of ''X'' is obtained by selecting the subsets of ''X'' that have median size. The [[Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality]] also concerns antichains in a power set and can be used to prove Sperner's theorem.

If we order the integers in the interval [1,&amp;nbsp;2''n''] by [[divisibility]], the subinterval [''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2''n''] forms an antichain with cardinality ''n''. A partition of this partial order into ''n'' chains is easy to achieve: for each odd integer ''m'' in [1,2''n''], form a chain of the numbers of the form ''m''2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, by Dilworth's theorem, the width of this partial order is ''n''.

The [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] on monotone subsequences can be interpreted as an application of Dilworth's theorem to partial orders of [[order dimension]] two {{harv|Steele|1995}}.

The "convex dimension" of an [[antimatroid]] is defined as the minimum number of chains needed to define the antimatroid, and Dilworth's theorem can be used to show that it equals the width of an associated partial order; this connection leads to a polynomial time algorithm for convex dimension {{harv|Edelman|Saks|1988}}.

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] arises in the study of the [[Lorenz Oscillator]], a dynamical system.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''dynamical system''' is a system in which a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] describes the [[time]] dependence of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[Manifold|geometrical space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock [[pendulum]], [[fluid dynamics|the flow of water in a pipe]], and [[population dynamics|the number of fish each springtime in a lake]].

At any given time, a dynamical system has a [[State (controls)|state]] given by a [[tuple]] of [[real numbers]] (a [[vector space|vector]]) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate [[state space]] (a geometrical [[manifold]]). The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state.  Often the function is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strogatz |first=S. H. |year=2001 |title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: with Applications to Physics, Biology and Chemistry |location= |publisher=Perseus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Katok |first2=B. |last2=Hasselblatt |title=Introduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-34187-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some systems are [[stochastic system|stochastic]], in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

In [[physics]], a '''dynamical system''' is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/dynamical-systems|publisher=Springer Nature|accessdate= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a prediction about the system’s future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of [[dynamical systems theory]], which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=P.|last2=et.al.|title=Dynamics of Self-Adjusting Systems With Noise|journal=Chaos 15|date=2005|doi=10.1063/1.1953147|bibcode=2005Chaos..15c3902M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gintautas|first1=V.|last2=et.al.|title=Resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics|journal=J.

Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of [[chaos theory]], [[logistic map]] dynamics, [[bifurcation theory]], the [[self-assembly]] process, and the [[edge of chaos]] concept.

==Overview==
The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]].  There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future.  (The relation is either a [[differential equation]], [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]] or other [[Time scale calculus|time scale]].)  To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times&amp;mdash;each advancing time a small step.  The iteration procedure is referred to as ''solving the system'' or ''integrating the system''. If the system can be solved, given an initial point it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a ''[[trajectory]]'' or ''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''.

Before the advent of [[computers]], finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems.  Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.

For simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories.  The difficulties arise because:
* The systems studied may only be known approximately&amp;mdash;the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations.  The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions.  To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as [[Lyapunov stability]] or [[structural stability]].  The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] changes with the different notions of stability.
* The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory.  Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class.  Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. [[Linear dynamical system]]s and [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|systems that have two numbers describing a state]] are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.
* The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes.  For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Turbulence|transition to turbulence of a fluid]].
* The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random.  In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories.  The averages are well defined for [[ergodic theory|ergodic systems]] and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [[Anosov diffeomorphism|hyperbolic systems]]. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and of [[chaos theory|chaos]].

==History==

Many people regard [[Henri Poincaré]] as the founder of dynamical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Philip. "Poincaré, celestial mechanics, dynamical-systems theory and "chaos"." ''Physics Reports'' 193.3 (1990): 137-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]], which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

[[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamic system.

In 1913, [[George David Birkhoff]] proved Poincaré's "[[Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem|Last Geometric Theorem]]", a special case of the [[three-body problem]], a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his ''[http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll9/ Dynamical Systems]''Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the [[ergodic theorem]]. Combining insights from [[physics]] on the [[ergodic hypothesis]] with [[measure theory]], this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of [[statistical mechanics]]. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.

[[Stephen Smale]] made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

[[Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky]] developed [[Sharkovsky's theorem]] on the periods of [[discrete dynamical system]]s in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the [[real line]] has a [[periodic point]] of period&amp;nbsp;3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

==Basic definitions==
{{Main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
A dynamical system is a [[manifold]] ''M'' called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; that for any element of ''t'' ∈ ''T'', the time, map a point of the [[phase space]] back into the phase space.  The notion of smoothness changes with applications and the type of manifold.  There are several choices for the set&amp;nbsp;''T''.  When ''T'' is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called a ''[[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]''; and if ''T'' is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a ''semi-flow''. When ''T'' is taken to be the integers, it is a ''cascade'' or a ''map''; and the restriction to the non-negative integers is a ''semi-cascade''.

=== Examples ===
The evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is often the solution of a ''differential equation of motion''

:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = v(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The equation gives the time derivative, represented by the dot, of a trajectory ''x''(''t'') on the phase space starting at some point&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[vector field]] ''v''(''x'') is a smooth function that at every point of the phase space ''M'' provides the velocity vector of the dynamical system at that point. (These vectors are not vectors in the phase space&amp;nbsp;''M'', but in the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M'' of the point&amp;nbsp;''x''.)  Given a smooth Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, an autonomous vector field can be derived from it.

There is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for time dependence in ''v''(''x'') because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.  Other types of [[differential equations]] can be used to define the evolution rule:

: &lt;math&gt; G(x, \dot{x}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is an example of an equation that arises from the modeling of mechanical systems with complicated constraints.

The differential equations determining the evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; are often [[ordinary differential equation]]s; in this case the phase space ''M'' is a finite dimensional manifold.  Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds&amp;mdash;those that are locally [[Banach space]]s&amp;mdash;in which case the differential equations are [[partial differential equation]]s.  In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity.

==Linear dynamical systems==
{{Main|Linear dynamical system}}
Linear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified.  In a linear system the phase space is the ''N''-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with ''N'' numbers.  The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a [[superposition principle]]: if ''u''(''t'') and ''w''(''t'') satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will ''u''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w''(''t'').

===Flows===
For a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], the vector field Φ(''x'') is an [[affine transformation|affine]] function of the position in the phase space, that is,
:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = \phi(x) = A x + b,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix, ''b'' a vector of numbers and ''x'' the position vector.  The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).
The case ''b''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 with ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is just a straight line in the direction of&amp;nbsp;''b'':

: &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_1) = x_1 + b t. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' is zero and ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then the orbit remains there.
For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the [[matrix exponential|exponential of a matrix]]: for an initial point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

:  &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_0) = e^{t A} x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' = 0, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' determine the structure of the phase space.  From the eigenvalues and the [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.

The distance between two different initial conditions in the case ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast.  Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]].

===Maps===
A [[Discrete-time dynamical system|discrete-time]], [[Affine transformation|affine]] dynamical system has the form of a [[matrix difference equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} =  A x_n + b, &lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix and ''b'' a vector.  As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' removes the term ''b'' from the equation. In the new [[coordinate system]], the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
The solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space.  The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.

As in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ''A'' determine the structure of phase space.  For example, if ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector of ''A'', with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along ''α''&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''α''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''', is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.

There are also many [[List of chaotic maps|other discrete dynamical systems]].

==Local dynamics==
The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative):   a ''singular point'' of the vector field (a point where&amp;nbsp;''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a ''periodic orbit'' is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop.  It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.

===Rectification===
A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple.  If ''y'' is a point where the vector field ''v''(''y'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around ''y'' where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude.  This is known as the rectification theorem.

The ''rectification theorem'' says that away from [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]] the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line.  The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space ''M'' the dynamical system is ''integrable''.  In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space.  There may be singular points in the vector field (where ''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.

===Near periodic orbits===
In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used.  Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to ''v''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  These points are a [[Poincaré section]]  ''S''(''γ'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the [[Poincaré map]] ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'', for points starting in ''S'' and returning to&amp;nbsp;''S''.  Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map ''F''. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The Taylor series of the map is ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;O(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so a change of coordinates ''h'' can only be expected to simplify ''F'' to its linear part

: &lt;math&gt; h^{-1} \circ F \circ h(x) = J \cdot x.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the conjugation equation.  Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems.  Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition.  If ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt; are the eigenvalues of ''J'' they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others.  As terms of the form ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ndash; ∑ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function ''h'', the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

===Conjugation results===
The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of ''J'' and the degree of smoothness required from ''h''.  As ''J'' does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers.  When the eigenvalues of ''J'' are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F'' is called ''[[Hyperbolic fixed point|hyperbolic]]'' and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called ''elliptic''.

In the hyperbolic case, the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]] gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map ''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''. The hyperbolic case is also ''structurally stable''.  Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of ''J'' in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.

The [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM)]] theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.

==Bifurcation theory==
{{Main|Bifurcation theory}}
When the evolution map Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (or the [[vector field]] it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the [[phase space]] until a special value ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is reached.  At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.

Bifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a periodic orbit, or an invariant [[torus]]) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter&amp;nbsp;''μ''. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures.  By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.

The bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of a system family ''F&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be characterized by the [[eigenvalues]] of the first derivative of the system ''DF''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of ''DF&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on [[Bifurcation theory]].

Some bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the [[Ruelle&amp;ndash;Takens scenario]] describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a [[strange attractor]]. In another example, [[Bifurcation diagram|Feigenbaum period-doubling]] describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of [[period-doubling bifurcation]]s.

==Ergodic systems==
{{Main|Ergodic theory}}
In many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant.  This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(momentum).  The flow takes points of a subset ''A'' into the points Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') and invariance of the phase space means that
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{vol} (A) = \mathrm{vol} ( \Phi^t(A) ). &lt;/math&gt;
In the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]], given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow.  The volume is said to be computed by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville measure]].

In a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible.  The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.

For systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|recurrence theorem]]: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let ''F'' be a phase space volume-preserving map and ''A'' a subset of the phase space.  Then almost every point of ''A'' returns to ''A'' infinitely often.  The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]] to object to [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.

One of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the [[ergodic hypothesis]].  The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region ''A'' is vol(''A'')/vol(Ω).

The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of [[statistical mechanics]] and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems.  [[Bernard Koopman|Koopman]] approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of [[functional analysis]].  An observable ''a'' is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height).  The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;.  This introduces an operator ''U''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[transfer operator]],

: &lt;math&gt; (U^t a)(x) = a(\Phi^{-t}(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator ''U'' it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of&amp;nbsp;Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving&amp;nbsp;''U''.

The Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in [[Statistical mechanics|equilibrium statistical mechanics]].  An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the  [[Statistical mechanics#Canonical ensemble|Boltzmann factor exp(&amp;minus;β''H'')]].  This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. [[SRB measure]]s replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.

===Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos===
{{Main|Chaos theory}}
Simple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called ''[[chaos theory|chaos]]''. [[Anosov diffeomorphism|Hyperbolic systems]] are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems.  In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the ''stable manifold'') and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the ''unstable manifold'').

This branch of [[mathematics]] deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a [[steady state]] in the long term, and if so, what are the possible [[attractor]]s?" or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

Note that the chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. [[Meteorology]] has been known for years to involve complex&amp;mdash;even chaotic&amp;mdash;behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The [[logistic map]] is only a second-degree polynomial; the [[horseshoe map]] is piecewise linear.

=== Geometrical definition ===
A dynamical system is the tuple &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathcal{M}, f , \mathcal{T}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; a manifold (locally a Banach space or Euclidean space), &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; the domain for time (non-negative reals, the integers, ...) and ''f'' an evolution rule ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;) such that ''f&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] of the manifold to itself. So, f is a mapping of the time-domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, ''f''(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, for every time ''t'' in the domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; .

=== Measure theoretical definition ===
{{main|Measure-preserving dynamical system}}
A dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a [[sigma-algebra]], the quadruplet (''X'', Σ, μ, τ). Here, ''X'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], and Σ is a [[sigma-algebra]] on ''X'', so that the pair (''X'', Σ) is a measurable space. μ is a finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (''X'', Σ, μ) is a [[measure space|probability space]]. A map τ: ''X'' → ''X'' is said to be [[measurable function|Σ-measurable]] if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\tau^{-1}\sigma \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A map τ is said to '''preserve the measure''' if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\mu(\tau^{-1}\sigma ) = \mu(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;. Combining the above, a map τ is said to be a '''measure-preserving transformation of ''X'' ''', if it is a map from ''X'' to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (''X'', Σ, μ, τ), for such a τ, is then defined to be a '''dynamical system'''.

The map τ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the [[iterated function|iterates]] &lt;math&gt;\tau^n=\tau \circ \tau \circ \cdots\circ\tau&lt;/math&gt; for integer ''n'' are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map τ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.

Dynamical systems are defined over a single independent variable, usually thought of as time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple independent variables and are therefore called [[multidimensional systems]]. Such systems are useful for modeling, for example, [[image processing]].

:''For edge in [[graph theory]], see [[Edge (graph theory)]]''
In [[geometry]], an '''edge''' is a particular type of [[line segment]] joining two [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] in a [[polygon]], [[polyhedron]], or higher-dimensional [[polytope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter M. Ziegler|title=Lectures on Polytopes|at=Definition 2.1, p. 51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xd25TXSSUcgC&amp;pg=PA51|volume=152|series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]|publisher=Springer|year=1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary,&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Polygon Edge." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolygonEdge.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is often called a '''side'''. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two [[Face (geometry)|faces]] meet.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Polytope Edge." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolytopeEdge.html&lt;/ref&gt; A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a [[diagonal]].

==Relation to edges in graphs==
In [[graph theory]], an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] is an abstract object connecting two [[vertex (graph theory)|graph vertices]], unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.
However, any polyhedron can be represented by its [[n-skeleton|skeleton]] or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shaping Space: Exploring Polyhedra in Nature, Art, and the Geometrical Imagination|first=Marjorie|last=Senechal|authorlink=Marjorie Senechal|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9780387927145|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZtCAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by [[Steinitz's theorem]] as being exactly the [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-vertex-connected]] [[planar graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Number of edges in a polyhedron==

Any [[convex polyhedron]]'s surface has [[Euler characteristic]]

:&lt;math&gt;V - E + F = 2,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the number of [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], ''E'' is the number of edges, and ''F'' is the number of [[face (geometry)|faces]]. This equation is known as [[Euler's polyhedron formula]]. Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.

==Incidences with other faces==
In a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by [[Balinski's theorem]], at least ''d'' edges meet at every vertex of a ''d''-dimensional convex polytope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the graph structure of convex polyhedra in ''n''-space|first=M. L.|last=Balinski|authorlink=Michel Balinski|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=11|issue=2|year=1961|pages=431–434|mr=0126765|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1103037323|doi=10.2140/pjm.1961.11.431}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Polyhedron Models|first=Magnus J.|last=Wenninger|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1974|isbn=9780521098595|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8lX2T-4njIC&amp;pg=PA1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.

==Alternative terminology==
In the theory of high-dimensional [[convex polytope]]s, a [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] or ''side'' of a ''d''-dimensional [[polytope]] is one of its (''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional features, a [[Ridge (geometry)|ridge]] is a (''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)-dimensional feature, and a [[Peak (geometry)|peak]] is a (''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional [[convex polyhedron]] are its ridges, and the edges of a [[4-polytope|4-dimensional polytope]] are its peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10746">Explicit formulas for '''eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the [[second derivative]]''' with different boundary conditions are provided both for the continuous and discrete cases. In the discrete case, the standard [[Central_difference#Higher-order_differences|central difference approximation of the second derivative]] is used on a uniform grid. 

These formulas are used to derive the expressions for [[eigenfunctions]] of [[Laplacian]] in case of [[separation of variables]], as well as to find [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of multidimensional [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]], which is presented as a [[Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians]] in one-dimension.

==The continuous case==
The index j represents the jth eigenvalue or eigenvector and runs from 1 to &lt;math&gt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;. Assuming the equation is defined on the domain &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,L]&lt;/math&gt;, the following are the eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors. The eigenvalues are ordered in descending order.

===Pure Dirichlet boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{j^2 \pi^2}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_j(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{j \pi x}{L}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Pure Neumann boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{(j - 1)^2 \pi^2}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;
v_j(x) = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
L^{- \frac{1}{2}} &amp; j = 1\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \cos\left(\frac{(j - 1) \pi x}{L} \right) &amp; otherwise
\end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Periodic boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_j = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
-\frac{j^2 \pi^2}{L^2} &amp; \mbox{j is even.}\\
-\frac{(j-1)^2 \pi^2}{L^2} &amp; \mbox{j is odd.}
\end{array}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

(That is: &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a simple eigenvalue and all further eigenvalues are given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{j^2 \pi^2}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, each with multiplicity 2).

:&lt;math&gt; v_j(x) = \begin{cases}
L^{-\frac{1}{2}} &amp; \mbox{if } j = 1.\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{j \pi x}{L}\right) &amp; \mbox{ if j is even.}\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \cos\left(\frac{(j-1) \pi x}{L}\right) &amp; \mbox{ if j is odd.}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

===Mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{(2j - 1)^2 \pi^2}{4 L^2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_j(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{(2j - 1) \pi x}{2 L}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{(2j - 1)^2 \pi^2}{4 L^2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_j(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \cos\left(\frac{(2j - 1) \pi x}{2 L}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

==The discrete case==
Notation: The index j represents the jth eigenvalue or eigenvector. The index i represents the ith component of an eigenvector. Both i and j go from 1 to n, where the matrix is size n x n. Eigenvectors are normalized. The eigenvalues are ordered in descending order.

===Pure Dirichlet boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_j = -\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi j}{2(n + 1)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_{i,j} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{n+1}} \sin\left(\frac{i j \pi}{n+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Pure Neumann boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_j = -\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (j - 1)}{2n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
n^{- \frac{1}{2}} &amp; \mbox{j = 1}\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi (j - 1)(i - 0.5)}{n}\right) &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Periodic boundary conditions===

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_j = \begin{cases}
-\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (j-1)}{2n}\right) &amp; \mbox{ if j is odd.}\\
-\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi j}{2n}\right) &amp; \mbox{ if j is even.}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that eigenvalues are repeated except for 0 and the largest one if n is even.)
:&lt;math&gt; v_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
n^{-\frac{1}{2}} &amp; \mbox{if } j = 1.\\
n^{-\frac{1}{2}} (-1)^i &amp; \mbox{if } j = n \mbox{ and n is even.}\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi (i-0.5) j}{n} \right) &amp; \mbox{ otherwise if j is even.}\\
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi (i-0.5) (j - 1)}{n}\right) &amp; \mbox{ otherwise if j is odd.}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

===Mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_j = -\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (j-\frac{1}{2})}{2n + 1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_{i,j} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{n+0.5}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi i (2j - 1)}{2n + 1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions===
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_j = -\frac{4}{h^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (j-\frac{1}{2})}{2n + 1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_{i,j} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{n+0.5}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi (i-0.5) (2j - 1)}{2n + 1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivation of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in the Discrete Case ==
===Dirichlet case===
In the 1D discrete case with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we are solving

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} = \lambda v_{k}, \ k=1,...,n, \ v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms, we get

:&lt;math&gt; v_{k+1} = (2 + h^2 \lambda)v_k - v_{k-1}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt; 2 \alpha = (2 + h^2 \lambda) &lt;/math&gt;. Also, assuming &lt;math&gt; v_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we can scale eigenvectors by any nonzero scalar, so scale &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;v_1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Then we find the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;
v_0 = 0
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v_1 = 1.
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
v_{k+1} = 2 \alpha v_{k} - v_{k-1}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Considering &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; as an indeterminate,

:&lt;math&gt; v_{k+1} = U_k (\alpha) \,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt; U_k &lt;/math&gt; is the kth [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial]] of the 2nd kind.

Since &lt;math&gt; v_{n+1} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we get that 

:&lt;math&gt; U_n (\alpha) = 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is clear that the eigenvalues of our problem will be the zeros of the nth Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind, with the relation &lt;math&gt; 2 \alpha = (2 + h^2 \lambda) &lt;/math&gt;.

These zeros are well known and are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_k = \cos\left(\frac{k \pi}{n+1}\right).
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these into the formula for &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
2 \cos\left(\frac{k \pi}{n+1}\right) = h^2 \lambda_k + 2
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_k = -\frac{2}{h^2}\left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{k \pi}{n+1}\right)\right].
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And using a trig formula to simplify, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_k = -\frac{4}{h^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k \pi}{2(n+1)}\right).
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Neumann case===
In the Neumann case, we are solving

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} = \lambda v_{k}, \ k = 1,...,n, \ v'_{0.5} = v'_{n+0.5} = 0.
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the standard discretization, we introduce &lt;math&gt;v_{0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{n+1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and define

:&lt;math&gt;
v'_{0.5} := \frac{v_1 - v_0}{h}, \ v'_{n+0.5} := \frac{v_{n+1} - v_n}{h}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions are then equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1 - v_0 = 0, \ v_{n+1} - v_n = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we make a change of variables,
:&lt;math&gt;
w_k = v_{k+1} - v_k, \ k = 0,...,n
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we can derive the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} &amp; = \lambda v_{k} \\
v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1} &amp; = h^2 \lambda v_{k} \\
(v_{k+1} - v_k) - (v_k - v_{k-1}) &amp; = h^2 \lambda v_{k} \\
w_k - w_{k-1} &amp; = h^2 \lambda v_{k}  \\
&amp; = h^2 \lambda w_{k-1} + h^2 \lambda v_{k-1} \\
&amp; =  h^2 \lambda w_{k-1} + w_{k-1} - w_{k-2} \\
w_{k} &amp; = (2 + h^2 \lambda) w_{k-1} - w_{k-2} \\
w_{k+1} &amp; = (2 + h^2 \lambda) w_{k} - w_{k-1} \\
&amp; = 2 \alpha w_k - w_{k-1}.
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;w_{n} = w_{0} = 0&lt;/math&gt; being the boundary conditions.

This is precisely the Dirichlet formula with &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; interior grid points and grid spacing &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. Similar to what we saw in the above, assuming &lt;math&gt; w_{1} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_k = -\frac{4}{h^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k \pi}{2n}\right), \ k = 1,...,n-1.
&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; eigenvalues and there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If we drop the assumption that &lt;math&gt; w_{1} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we find there is also a solution with &lt;math&gt; v_{k} = \mathrm{constant} \  \forall \ k=0,...,n+1, &lt;/math&gt; and this corresponds to eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Relabeling the indices in the formula above and combining with the zero eigenvalue, we obtain,

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_k = -\frac{4}{h^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{(k-1) \pi}{2n}\right), \ k = 1,...,n.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Dirichlet-Neumann Case===

For the Dirichlet-Neumann case, we are solving

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} = \lambda v_{k}, \ k=1,...,n, \ v_0 = v'_{n+0.5} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; v'_{n+0.5} := \frac{v_{n+1} - v_n}{h}. &lt;/math&gt;

We need to introduce auxiliary variables &lt;math&gt; v_{j + 0.5}, \ j = 0,...,n. &lt;/math&gt;

Consider the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt; v_{k+0.5} = 2 \beta v_{k} - v_{k-0.5}, \text{ for some }\beta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, we know &lt;math&gt;v_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and assuming &lt;math&gt;v_{0.5} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we can scale &lt;math&gt;v_{0.5}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;v_{0.5} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write
:&lt;math&gt; 
v_{k} = 2 \beta v_{k-0.5} - v_{k-1}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_{k+1} = 2 \beta v_{k+0.5} - v_{k}. 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the correct combination of these three equations, we can obtain

:&lt;math&gt; v_{k+1} = (4 \beta^2 - 2) v_{k} - v_{k-1}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And thus our new recurrence will solve our eigenvalue problem when

:&lt;math&gt; h^2 \lambda + 2 = (4 \beta^2 - 2). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; we get 

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{4 (\beta^2 - 1)}{h^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Our new recurrence gives 

:&lt;math&gt;v_{n+1} = U_{2n + 1}(\beta), \ v_{n} = U_{2n - 1}(\beta), \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{k}(\beta) &lt;/math&gt; again is the kth [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial]] of the 2nd kind.

And combining with our Neumann boundary condition, we have

:&lt;math&gt; U_{2n + 1}(\beta) - U_{2n - 1}(\beta) = 0. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A well-known formula relates the [[Chebyshev polynomials]] of the first kind, &lt;math&gt;T_k(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, to those of the second kind by

:&lt;math&gt;
U_{k}(\beta) - U_{k - 2}(\beta) = T_k (\beta). 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus our eigenvalues solve 

:&lt;math&gt; T_{2n + 1} (\beta) = 0, \ \lambda = \frac{4 (\beta^2 - 1)}{h^2}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The zeros of this polynomial are also known to be

:&lt;math&gt; \beta_{k} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\right), \ k=1,...,2n + 1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And thus 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{2}
\lambda_{k} &amp; = \frac{4}{h^2}\left[\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\right) - 1\right] \\
&amp; = -\frac{4}{h^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\right).
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there are 2n + 1 of these values, but only the first n + 1 are unique. The (n + 1)th value gives us the zero vector as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, which is trivial. This can be seen by returning to the original recurrence. So we consider only the first n of these values to be the n eigenvalues of the Dirichlet - Neumann problem.

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_{k} = -\frac{4}{h^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\right), \ k = 1,...,n.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Eugenia Loh-Gene Cheng''' is an English [[mathematician]], [[pianist]], [[Artist in Residence|Scientist-in-Residence]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] and an honorary [[fellow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eugeniacheng.com/|title=Eugenia Cheng homepage|website=Eugeniacheng.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[pure mathematics]] at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name="sheffieldmaths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/staff_info_35.html|title=Dr Eugenia Cheng|author=University of Sheffield|publisher=maths.dept.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/eugeniacheng/|title=SAIC - Eugenia Cheng - School of the Art Institute of Chicago|publisher=saic.edu|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mathematical interests include [[higher-dimensional category theory]], and as a pianist she specialises in [[lied]]er and [[art song]].&lt;ref name="sheffieldpiano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/piano/|title=Eugenia Cheng, piano|publisher=cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also passionate about explaining mathematics to non-mathematicians to rid the world of [[math phobia]], often using entertaining analogies with food and baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/science/eugenia-cheng-math-how-to-bake-pi.html?_r=0 |title=Eugenia Cheng Makes Math a Piece of Cake|first=Natalie|last=Angier |newspaper=The New York Times|date=2010-05-02|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Early life and education ==
Cheng was born in [[Hampshire]], England but moved to [[Sussex]] when she was one, and spent the rest of her childhood there.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/content/book-review-cakes-custard-and-category-theory-by-eugenia-cheng|title=Cakes, Custard and Category Theory: Easy Recipes for Understanding Complex Maths, by Eugenia Cheng &amp;#124; Times Higher Education|publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her interest in mathematics stemmed from a young age thanks largely to her mother who made mathematics a part of life.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-3101123/If-follow-simple-cake-recipe-applied-mathematics.html|title=If you can follow a simple cake recipe...then you can do applied mathematics|website=dailymail.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was also supportive, encouraging her to be imaginative;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; but Cheng's biggest influence was her mother, who introduced stimulating mathematical ideas and used the language of logic naturally.&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/bright/why-i-don-t-like-being-a-female-role-model-10055873ea97|title=Why I Don’t Like Being a "Female Role Model" — Bright — Medium|author=Dr Eugenia Cheng|website=Medium.com|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheng attended [[Roedean School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faberij de Jonge|first1=Jane|title=Profile: Dr Eugenia Cheng|journal=Roedean Magazine|date=2013|pages=36–37|url=http://issuu.com/roedeanschool/docs/roedean_magazine_2013_final_single_/39}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was bored by school when she was young,{{fact|date=January 2018}} but practised the piano every day and was an avid reader.&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; She was also “very serious about eating”.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; She studied the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] where she was a student of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. Her postgraduate research was supervised by [[Martin Hyland]].&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt;&lt;ref name=ePhD&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/thesis.pdf|doi=|title=Higher-dimensional category theory : opetopic foundations|first= Eugenia Loh-Gene|last=Cheng|date=2002|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.597569}}|website=cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk|oclc=879393286|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031182847/http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/thesis.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChengHyland2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Eugenia|last2=Hyland|first2=Martin|last3=Power|first3=John|title=Pseudo-distributive Laws|journal=[[Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science]]|volume=83|year=2003|pages=227–245|issn=15710661|doi=10.1016/S1571-0661(03)50012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Before working at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Cheng has held academic appointments at the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]], the [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt; Cheng is still affiliated to the University of Sheffield as a senior lecturer of pure mathematics, but is now based at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she teaches mathematics to arts students.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;  She has published over a dozen research papers across several journals within her area of category theory.&lt;ref name="shef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/research.html|title=Research papers|publisher=cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former doctoral students include Nick Gurski&lt;ref name=mathgene&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=70455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas	Cottrell.&lt;ref name=cottphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Sheffield|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5324/|doi=|title=Comparing algebraic and non-algebraic foundations of n-category theory|first= Thomas|last=Cottrell|date=2014|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.595261}}|website=etheses.whiterose.ac.uk|oclc=879388784}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics and baking ===
Cheng's research interests are in category theory, which she has written about for a general audience by using analogies from baking. Her vision is to rid the world of mathematics phobia. In ''[[How to Bake Pi]]'',&lt;ref name=pi&gt;{{Citation|last=Eugenia,|first=Cheng,|title=How to bake pi : an edible exploration of the mathematics of mathematics|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898167298|others=Gilbert, Tavia,|isbn=9781622316687|oclc=898167298}} (also known as ''Cakes, Custard and Category Theory'')&lt;/ref&gt; each chapter begins with a recipe for a dessert, to illustrate the commonalities in the methods and principles of mathematics and cooking. The book was well received&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Other Writing ===
Cheng's second book, ''Beyond Infinity,'' explains [[set theory]] for lay audiences using analogies and anecdotes, including [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] and [[Zeno's paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euro-math-soc.eu/review/beyond-infinity-expedition-outer-limits-mathematics|title=Review:  Beyond Infinity: An Expedition to the Outer Limits of Mathematics {{!}} EMS|website=euro-math-soc.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shortlisted for the 2017 Insight Investment Science Book Prize under the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/book-prizes/science-book-prize/2017/|title=2017 Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book Prize  {{!}} Royal Society|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

She published her third book, ''The Art of Logic in an Illogical World,'' in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eugenia-cheng/the-art-of-logic-in-an-illogical-world/9781541672482/|title=The Art of Logic in an Illogical World|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It explores arguments on real-world topics like [[same-sex marriage]], [[white privilege]], and [[police brutality in the United States]] using methods from [[logic]], including explanations of [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Euclid's axioms]] on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/19/the-art-of-logic-by-eugenia-cheng-review|title=The Art of Logic by Eugenia Cheng review – the need for good arguments|last=Guest|first=Katy|date=2018-07-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheng writes a column called ''Everyday Math'' for [[The Wall Street Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/author/8737|title=Eugenia Cheng - News, Articles, Biography, Photos  - WSJ.com|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on topics including [[probability theory]], [[set theory]], and [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's Cube solutions]]. 

=== Music ===
Cheng is a pianist who specializes in [[lieder]] and [[art song]]. She was awarded the Sheila Mossman Memorial Award from the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]], and was the first recipient of the Brighton and Hove Arts Council Award for the Musician of the Year.  In Chicago, she gave a recital in the Pianoforte Chicago recital series; she performed ''[[Schwanengesang]]'' and ''[[Winterreise]]'' with Paul Geiger at Schubertiade Chicago in 2005 and 2006 respectively, and ''[[Die Schöne Müllerin]]'' with Ryan de Ryan at Schubertiade Chicago 2007. She performed lieder with tenor Nicholas Harkness in the Noontime Recital Series at the University of Chicago, the Salon Series at the Tower Club, and the Maxwell Recital Series, and she gave recitals for the Auxiliary Board Chapter of the Lyric Opera; she also performed ''[[La Traviata]]'' at the Oak Park Village Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Eugenia Cheng, piano|url = http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/piano|website = cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Cheng founded Liederstube as an oasis for art song in the Fine Arts Building, in downtown Chicago.  The mission of Liederstube is to present and enjoy classical music in an intimate and informal setting. The Liederstube is a Not For Profit 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = home|url = http://liederstube.wix.com/home|website =Liederstube.wix.com|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">In [[mathematics]], '''Friedrichs's inequality''' is a [[theorem]] of [[functional analysis]], due to [[Kurt O. Friedrichs|Kurt Friedrichs]]. It places a bound on the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' norm]] of a function using ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' bounds on the [[weak derivative]]s of the function and the [[geometry]] of the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]], and can be used to show that certain [[norm (mathematics)|norms]] on [[Sobolev space]]s are equivalent. Friedrichs's inequality is a general case of the [[Poincaré–Wirtinger inequality]] which deals with the case&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Statement of the inequality==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; with [[diameter]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;u:\Omega\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; lies in the Sobolev space &lt;math&gt;W_0^{k, p} (\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;u\in W^{k,p}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Sobolev space#Traces|trace]] of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is zero. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{L^p (\Omega)} \leq d^k \left( \sum_{| \alpha | = k} \| \mathrm{D}^{\alpha} u \|_{L^p (\Omega)}^p \right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the above
* &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_{L^p (\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' norm]];
* ''&amp;alpha;'' = (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[multi-index]] with norm |''&amp;alpha;''| = ''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;;
* D&lt;sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sup&gt;''u'' is the mixed [[partial derivative]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{D}^\alpha u = \frac{\partial^{| \alpha |} u}{\partial_{x_1}^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial_{x_n}^{\alpha_n} }.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9586">In [[mathematics]], the '''Grothendieck inequality''' states that there is a universal constant ''k'' with the following property. If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is an ''n'' by ''n'' ([[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with
:&lt;math&gt; \left| \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} s_i t_j \right|\le 1&lt;/math&gt;

for all (real or complex) numbers ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of absolute value at most 1, then
:&lt;math&gt; \left| \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} \langle S_i , T_j \rangle \right|\le k&lt;/math&gt;,

for all [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[unit ball]] ''B''(''H'')  of a (real or complex) [[Hilbert space]] ''H'', the constant ''k'' being independent of ''n''. For a fixed ''n'', the smallest constant which satisfies this property for all ''n'' by ''n''  matrices is called a '''Grothendieck constant''' and denoted ''k''(''n''). In fact there are two Grothendieck constants ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') for each ''n'' depending on whether one works with real or complex numbers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pisier  | first = Gilles  | authorlink = Gilles Pisier |date=April 2012 | title = Grothendieck's Theorem, Past and Present  | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 49 | issue = 2  | pages = 237–323  | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-2011-01348-9 | arxiv = 1101.4195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grothendieck constant of order ''d''==

If we replace the (real or complex) Hilbert space ''H'' in the above definition with a (real or complex) ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], we get the constants ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'', ''d'') and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'', ''d'') for the real and complex case, respectively. With increasing ''d'' these constants are monotone increasing and their limit is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), respectively. For each ''d'', with increasing ''n'' the constants are also increasing and their limit is the Grothendieck constant of order ''d'' which can be denoted as ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt;(∞, ''d'') and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;(∞, ''d''), respectively.

The Grothendieck constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt;(∞, 3) plays an essential role in the [[quantum nonlocality]] problem of the two-qubit [[Werner state]]s.

In [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional [[cobordism]] ''W'' between ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s ''M'' and ''N'' is an '''''h''-cobordism''' (the ''h'' stands for [[homotopy equivalence]]) if the inclusion maps

: &lt;math&gt; M \hookrightarrow W \quad\mbox{and}\quad N \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;

are homotopy equivalences.

The '''''h''-cobordism theorem''' gives sufficient conditions for an ''h''-cobordism to be trivial, i.e., to be '''C'''-isomorphic to the cylinder ''M'' × [0, 1]. Here '''C''' refers to any of the categories of '''[[smooth manifold|smooth]]''', '''[[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]]''', or '''[[topological manifold|topological]]''' manifolds.

The theorem was first proved by [[Stephen Smale]] for which he received the [[Fields Medal]] and is a fundamental result in the theory of high-dimensional manifolds. For a start, it almost immediately proves the [[Generalized Poincaré Conjecture]].

==Background==
Before Smale proved this theorem, mathematicians became stuck while trying to understand manifolds of dimension 3 or 4, and assumed that the higher-dimensional cases were even harder. The ''h''-cobordism theorem showed that (simply connected) manifolds of dimension at least 5 are much easier than those of dimension 3 or 4. The proof of the theorem depends on the "[[Whitney embedding theorem|Whitney trick]]" of [[Hassler Whitney]], which geometrically untangles homologically-tangled spheres of complementary dimension in a manifold of dimension &gt;4. An informal reason why manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 are unusually hard is that [[4-manifold#Failure of the Whitney trick in dimension 4|the trick fails to work]] in lower dimensions, which have no room for untanglement.

==Precise statement of the ''h''-cobordism theorem==

Let ''n'' be at least 5 and let ''W'' be a compact (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional ''h''-cobordism between ''M'' and ''N'' in the category '''C'''='''[[smooth manifold|Diff]]''', '''[[piecewise linear manifold|PL]]''', or '''[[topological manifold|Top]]''' such that ''W'', ''M'' and ''N'' are [[simply connected]], then ''W'' is '''C'''-isomorphic to ''M'' × [0, 1]. The isomorphism can be chosen to be the identity on ''M'' × {0}.

This means that the homotopy equivalence between M, W, and N is homotopic to a '''C'''-isomorphism.

==Lower dimensional versions==
For ''n'' = 4, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is true topologically (proved by [[Michael Freedman]] using a 4-dimensional Whitney trick) but is false PL and smoothly (as shown by [[Simon Donaldson]]).

For ''n'' = 3, the ''h''-cobordism theorem for smooth manifolds has not been proved and, due to the 3-dimensional [[Poincaré conjecture]], is equivalent to the hard open question of whether the 4-sphere has non-standard [[smooth structure]]s.

For ''n'' = 2, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is equivalent to the [[Poincaré conjecture]] stated by [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1904 (one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Problems]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems|title = Millennium Problems {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute|website = www.claymath.org|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was proved by [[Grigori Perelman]] in a series of three papers in 2002 and 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2002-11-11|title = The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications  |arxiv = math/0211159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2003-03-10|title = Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds |arxiv = math/0303109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2003-07-17|title = Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds |arxiv = math/0307245}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he follows [[Richard S. Hamilton]]'s program using [[Ricci flow]].

For ''n'' = 1, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is vacuously true, since there is no closed simply-connected 1-dimensional manifold.

For ''n'' = 0, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is trivially true: the interval is the only connected cobordism between connected 0-manifolds.

==A proof sketch==
A [[Cobordism#Morse functions|Morse function]] &lt;math&gt;f:W\to[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[handle decomposition]] of ''W'', i.e., if there is a single critical point of index ''k'' in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}([c,c'])&lt;/math&gt;, then the ascending cobordism &lt;math&gt;W_{c'}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;W_c&lt;/math&gt; by attaching a ''k''-handle. The goal of the proof is to find a handle decomposition with no handles at all so that integrating the non-zero gradient vector field of ''f'' gives the desired diffeomorphism to the trivial cobordism.

This is achieved through a series of techniques.

'''1) Handle rearrangement'''

First, we want to rearrange all handles by order so that lower order handles are attached first. The question is thus when can we slide an ''i''-handle off of a ''j''-handle? This can be done by a radial isotopy so long as the ''i'' attaching sphere and the ''j'' belt sphere do not intersect. We thus want &lt;math&gt;(i-1)+(n-j)\leq\dim\partial W-1=n-1&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;i\leq j&lt;/math&gt;.

We then define the handle chain complex &lt;math&gt;(C_*,\partial_*)&lt;/math&gt; by letting &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; be the free abelian group on the ''k''-handles and defining &lt;math&gt;\partial_k:C_k\to C_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; by sending a ''k''-handle &lt;math&gt;h_{\alpha}^k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sum_\beta \langle h_\alpha^k\mid h_\beta^{k-1}\rangle h_\beta^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle h_\alpha^k\mid h_\beta^{k-1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection number of the ''k''-attaching sphere and the (''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-belt sphere.

'''2) Handle cancellation'''

Next, we want to "cancel" handles. The idea is that attaching a ''k''-handle &lt;math&gt;h_\alpha^k&lt;/math&gt; might create a hole that can be filled in by attaching a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-handle &lt;math&gt;h_\beta^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;. This would imply that &lt;math&gt;\partial_{k+1}h_\beta^{k+1}=\pm h_\alpha^k&lt;/math&gt; and so the &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; entry in the matrix of &lt;math&gt;\partial_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. However, when is this condition sufficient? That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The answer lies in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the [[Whitney embedding theorem|Whitney trick]]. This analysis leads to the requirement that ''n'' must be at least 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,''n''-, or (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique.

'''3) Handle trading'''

The idea of handle trading is to create a cancelling pair of (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)- and (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)-handles so that a given ''k''-handle cancels with the (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-handle leaving behind the (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the ''k''-handle which is an element in &lt;math&gt;\pi_k(W,M)&lt;/math&gt;. This group is trivial since ''W'' is an ''h''-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk &lt;math&gt;D^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so long as we can embed this disk into the boundary of ''W''. This embedding exists if &lt;math&gt;\dim\partial W-1=n-1\geq 2(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Since we are assuming ''n'' is at least 5 this means that ''k'' is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −''f'', we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the ''n''- and (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-handles as desired.

'''4) Handle sliding'''

Finally, we want to make sure that doing row and column operations on &lt;math&gt;\partial_k&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a geometric operation. Indeed, it isn't hard to show (best done by drawing a picture) that sliding a ''k''-handle &lt;math&gt;h_\alpha^k&lt;/math&gt; over another ''k''-handle &lt;math&gt;h_{\beta}^k&lt;/math&gt; replaces &lt;math&gt;h_\alpha^k&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;h_\alpha^k\pm h_\beta^k&lt;/math&gt; in the basis for &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of the theorem now follows: the handle chain complex is exact since &lt;math&gt;H_*(W,M;\mathbb{Z})=0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;C_k\cong \operatorname{coker} \partial_{k+1}\oplus\operatorname{im} \partial_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; since the &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; are free. Then &lt;math&gt;\partial_k&lt;/math&gt;, which is an integer matrix, restricts to an invertible morphism which can thus be diagonalized via elementary row operations (handle sliding) and must have only &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt; on the diagonal because it is invertible. Thus, all handles are paired with a single other cancelling handle yielding a decomposition with no handles.

==The ''s''-cobordism theorem ==
If the assumption that ''M'' and ''N'' are simply connected is dropped, ''h''-cobordisms need not be cylinders; the obstruction is exactly the [[Whitehead torsion]] τ (''W'', ''M'') of the inclusion &lt;math&gt;M \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;.

Precisely, the '''''s''-cobordism theorem''' (the ''s'' stands for [[simple-homotopy equivalence]]), proved independently by [[Barry Mazur]], [[John Stallings]], and [[Dennis Barden]], states (assumptions as above but where ''M'' and ''N'' need not be simply connected):
: An ''h''-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if [[Whitehead torsion]] τ (''W'', ''M'') vanishes.
The torsion vanishes if and only if the inclusion &lt;math&gt;M \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; is not just a homotopy equivalence, but a [[simple homotopy equivalence]].

Note that one need not assume that the other inclusion &lt;math&gt;N \hookrightarrow W&lt;/math&gt; is also a simple homotopy equivalence—that follows from the theorem.

Categorically, ''h''-cobordisms form a [[groupoid]].

Then a finer statement of the ''s''-cobordism theorem is that the isomorphism classes of this groupoid (up to '''C'''-isomorphism of ''h''-cobordisms) are [[torsor]]s for the respective&lt;ref&gt;Note that identifying the Whitehead groups of the various manifolds requires that one choose base points &lt;math&gt;m\in M, n\in N&lt;/math&gt; and a path in ''W'' connecting them.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]]s Wh(π), where &lt;math&gt;\pi \cong \pi_1(M) \cong \pi_1(W) \cong \pi_1(N).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
One consequence of the theorem is that testing whether a graph is planar may be formulated as solving a [[system of linear equations]] over the [[GF(2)|finite field of order two]]. These equations may be solved in [[polynomial time]], but the resulting [[algorithm]]s are less efficient than other known planarity tests.&lt;ref name="ttp"/&gt;

==Generalizations==
For other surfaces ''S'' than the plane, a graph can be drawn on ''S'' without crossings if and only if it can be drawn in such a way that all pairs of edges cross an even number of times; this is known as the weak Hanani–Tutte theorem for ''S''. The strong Hanani–Tutte theorem, known for the [[projective plane]] as well as for the Euclidean plane, states that a graph can be drawn without crossings on ''S'' if and only if it can be drawn in such a way that all independent pairs of edges cross an even number of times, without regard for the number of crossings between edges that share an endpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The same approach, in which one shows that pairs of edges with an even number of crossings can be disregarded or eliminated in some type of graph drawing and uses this fact to set up a system of linear equations describing the existence of a drawing, has been applied to several other graph drawing problems, including [[upward planar drawing]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A '''homoclinic bifurcation''' is a [[global bifurcation]] which often occurs when a [[periodic orbit]] collides with a [[saddle point]].

The image below shows a phase portrait before, at, and after a homoclinic bifurcation in 2D. The periodic orbit grows until it collides with the saddle point. At the bifurcation point the period of the periodic orbit has grown to infinity and it has become a [[homoclinic orbit]]. After the bifurcation there is no longer a periodic orbit.

[[Image:homoclinic_bif.png|frame|center|A homoclinic bifurcation occurs when a periodic orbit collides with a saddle point. '''Left panel''': For small parameter values, there is a [[saddle point]] at the origin and a [[limit cycle]] in the first quadrant. '''Middle panel''': As the bifurcation parameter increases, the limit cycle grows until it exactly intersects the saddle point, yielding an orbit of infinite duration. '''Right panel''': When the bifurcation parameter increases further, the limit cycle disappears completely.]]

Homoclinic bifurcations can occur supercritically or subcritically. The variant above is the "small" or "type I" homoclinic bifurcation.
In 2D there is also the "big" or "type II" homoclinic bifurcation in which the homoclinic orbit "traps" the other ends of the unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle. In three or more dimensions, higher codimension bifurcations can occur, producing complicated, possibly [[chaos theory|chaotic]] dynamics.

==Background==
Harré was born in Apiti, in northern [[Manawatu]], near [[Palmerston North]], New Zealand, but held [[British citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~mstewart/cogsci/rom_harre_cv.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213062114/http://www.willamette.edu/~mstewart/cogsci/rom_harre_cv.doc |archivedate=13 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; He studied chemical engineering (for which he retains a great affection) and later graduated with a BSc in mathematics (1948) and a Master's in Philosophy (1952), both at the [[University of New Zealand]], now the [[University of Auckland]].

He taught mathematics at [[King's College, Auckland]] (1948–53) and the [[University of Punjab]] in Lahore, [[Pakistan]] (1953&amp;ndash;4). He then studied at [[University College, Oxford]], where he completed a B.Phil. under the supervision of [[J. L. Austin]] in 1956. After a fellowship at the [[University of Birmingham]] he was lecturer at the [[University of Leicester]] from 1957 to 1959.

He returned to Oxford as the successor to Frederick Waismann as University Lecturer in Philosophy of Science in 1960 (age 34). At Oxford he was active in the founding of the Honours School of Physics and Philosophy and played an important part in the discursive turn in [[social psychology]], a field he came to in the middle of his career. After mandatory retirement from Oxford in 1995 he joined the psychology department of [[Georgetown University]], Washington, D.C. where he continues as Distinguished Research Professor teaching every year in the Spring Semester.

He has given occasional courses at both [[American University]] in Washington, D.C. and at [[George Mason University]] at Fairfax, Virginia. From 2009 until 2011 he served as Director [[CPNSS|Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science]] at the [[London School of Economics]] in conjunction with his US post. He has been Visiting Professor at many places, teaching courses at [[Aoyama University]], Tokyo; [[Universidad Santiago de Compostela]], Spain; [[Universidad Caetano, Peru]]; [[Free University at Brussels]]; [[Aarhus University]] in Denmark and elsewhere.

== Intellectual interests ==

Harré is one of the world's most prolific social scientists. He has written on a wide variety of subjects including: [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[philosophy of science]], [[ontology]], [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], sociology and philosophy. He was an important early influence on the British philosophical movement [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], publishing ''Causal Powers'' with Madden in 1975, the same year as ''A Realist Theory of Science''. He supervised [[Roy Bhaskar]]'s doctoral studies, and has continued to maintain close involvement with realism. He also supervised [[Patrick Baert]], [[G. E. Berrios|German Berrios]], and [[Jonathan Smith (psychologist)|Jonathan Smith]]'s doctoral studies, respectively in [[social theory]], history and epistemology of psychiatry, and [[social psychology]]. Another one of Harré's distinctive contributions was to the understanding of the [[social self]] in [[microsociology]], which he called "[[ethogenics]]:" this method attempts to understand the systems of belief or means by which individuals can attach significance to their actions and form their identities, in addition to the structure of rules and cultural resources that underlie these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, Ian. (1991). ''Social Selves: Theories of the Social Formation of Personality.'' London: SAGE Publications, 55, 65&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">An '''intracule''' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mathematical function for the two electron density which depends not upon the absolute values of position or momentum but rather upon their relative values. Its use is leading to new methods in [[physics]] and [[computational chemistry]] to investigate the [[electronic structure]] of molecules and solids. These methods are a development of [[Density functional theory]] (DFT), but with the two electron density replacing the one electron density.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8045">[[File:Set a rectangles (Klee's Trevis).svg|thumb|A set of rectangular ranges ('trellis') whose area has to be measured.]]
In [[computational geometry]], '''Klee's measure problem''' is the problem of determining how efficiently the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of ([[dimension|multidimensional]]) rectangular ranges can be computed. Here, a ''d''-dimensional rectangular range is defined to be a [[Cartesian product]] of ''d'' [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of [[real number]]s, which is a [[subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The problem is named after [[Victor Klee]], who gave an algorithm for computing the length of a union of intervals (the case ''d'' = 1) which was later shown to be optimally efficient in the sense of [[computational complexity theory]]. The computational complexity of computing the area of a union of 2-dimensional rectangular ranges is now also known, but the case ''d'' ≥ 3 remains an [[open problem]].

==History and algorithms==

In 1977, [[Victor Klee]] considered the following problem: given a collection of ''n'' [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] in the [[real line]], compute the length of their union.  He then presented an [[algorithm]] to solve this problem with [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] (or "running time") &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; see [[Big O notation]] for the meaning of this statement. This algorithm, based on [[sorting]] the intervals, was later shown by [[Michael Fredman]] and Bruce Weide (1978) to be optimal.

Later in 1977, [[Jon Bentley (computer scientist)|Jon Bentley]] considered a 2-dimensional analogue of this problem: given a collection of ''n'' [[rectangle]]s, find the [[area (geometry)|area]] of their union.  He also obtained a complexity &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; algorithm, now known as '''Bentley's algorithm''', based on reducing the problem to ''n'' ''1''-dimensional problems: this is done by sweeping a vertical line across the area. Using this method, the area of the union can be computed without explicitly constructing the union itself. Bentley's algorithm is now also known to be optimal (in the 2-dimensional case), and is used in [[computer graphics]], among other areas.

These two problems are the 1- and 2-dimensional cases of a more general question: given a collection of ''n'' ''d''-dimensional rectangular ranges, compute the measure of their union. This general problem is Klee's measure problem.

When generalized to the ''d''-dimensional case, Bentley's algorithm has a running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n^{d-1} \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.  This turns out ''not'' to be optimal, because it only decomposes the ''d''-dimensional problem into ''n'' (''d-1'')-dimensional problems, and does not further decompose those subproblems.  In 1981, [[Jan van Leeuwen]] and Derek Wood improved the running time of this algorithm to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{d-1})&lt;/math&gt; for ''d'' ≥ 3 by using dynamic [[quadtree]]s.

In 1988, [[Mark Overmars]] and Chee Yap proposed an &lt;math&gt;O(n^{d/2} \log n)&lt;/math&gt; algorithm for ''d'' ≥ 3.  Their algorithm uses a particular data structure similar to a [[kd-tree]] to decompose the problem into 2-dimensional components and aggregate those components efficiently; the 2-dimensional problems themselves are solved efficiently using a [[trellis (graph)|trellis]] structure.  Although asymptotically faster than Bentley's algorithm, its data structures use significantly more space, so it is only used in problems where either ''n'' or ''d'' is large.  In 1998, Bogdan Chlebus proposed a simpler algorithm with the same asymptotic running time for the common special cases where ''d'' is 3 or 4.

In 2013, Timothy M. Chan developed a simpler algorithm that avoids the need for dynamic data structures and eliminates the logarithmic factor, lowering the best known running time for d ≥ 3 to &lt;math&gt;O(n^{d/2})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Known bounds==

The only known [[lower bound]] for any ''d'' is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt;, and optimal algorithms with this running time are known for ''d''=1 and ''d''=2.  The Chan algorithm provides an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;O(n^{d/2})&lt;/math&gt; for ''d'' ≥ 3, so for ''d'' ≥ 3, it remains an open question whether faster algorithms are possible, or alternatively whether tighter lower bounds can be proven.  In particular, it remains open whether the algorithm's running time must depend on ''d''.  In addition, the question of whether there are faster algorithms that can deal with special cases (for example, when the input coordinates are integers within a bounded range) remains open.

The 1D Klee's measure problem (union of intervals) can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log p)&lt;/math&gt; where ''p'' denotes the number of piercing points required to stab all intervals&lt;ref&gt;"Adaptive Computational Geometry", F. Nielsen, 
[https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/person/nielsen/PT/phdthesis/phdthesis.html pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (the union of intervals pierced by a common point can be calculated in linear time by computing the extrema). 
Parameter ''p'' is an adaptive parameter that depends on the input configuration, and the piercing algorithm&lt;ref&gt;"Fast stabbing of boxes in high dimensions", F. Nielsen,

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397598003363 pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; yields an adaptive algorithm for Klee's measure problem.

'''Luigi Federico Menabrea''' (4 September 1809 &amp;ndash; 24 May 1896), later made '''1st Count Menabrea''' and '''1st Marquess of Valdora''', was an Italian general, statesman and mathematician who served as the [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1867 to 1869.

==Biography==
Menabrea was born at [[Chambéry]], then part of the [[First French Empire]]. He was educated at the [[University of Turin]], where he qualified as an engineer and became a doctor of mathematics. As an officer of engineers he replaced [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] in 1831 at the [[Fort Bard|fortress of Bard]]. He then became professor of mechanics and construction at the military academy and at the university of Turin. Among his notable publications: ''Sketch of the [[Analytical Engine]] Invented by [[Charles Babbage]], Esq.'' [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|with notes]] by translator [[Ada Lovelace]] (1842), which described many aspects of [[computer architecture]] and programming. [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|King Charles Albert]] sent him in 1848 on diplomatic missions to secure the adhesion of [[Modena]] and [[Parma]] to [[Sardinia]]. He entered the Piedmontese parliament, and was attached successively to the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs.

He belonged to the right centre, and until the [[Second Italian War of Independence|events of 1859]] he believed in the possibility of a compromise between the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the state. He was major-general and commander-in-chief of the engineers in the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] campaign of 1859. He superintended the siege works against Peschiera, was present at [[battle of Palestro|Palestro]] and [[battle of Solferino|Solferino]], and repaired the fortifications of some of the northern fortresses. In 1860 he became lieutenant-general and conducted the [[siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]]. He was appointed senator and received the title of count.

Entering the [[Bettino Ricasoli|Ricasoli]] cabinet of 1861 as minister for the navy, he held the portfolio of public works until 1864 in the succeeding [[Luigi Carlo Farini|Farini]] and [[Marco Minghetti|Minghetti]] cabinets. After the war of 1866, he was chosen as Italian [[plenipotentiary]] for the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Prague (1866)|Treaty of Prague]] and for the transfer of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] to Italy. In October 1867, he succeeded [[Urbano Rattazzi|Rattazzi]] in the premiership, and was called upon to deal with the difficult situation created by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s invasion of the [[Papal States]] and by the [[battle of Mentana|catastrophe of Mentana]].

Menabrea disavowed Garibaldi and instituted judicial proceedings against him; but in negotiations with the French government he protested against the retention of the temporal power by the pope and insisted on the Italian right of interference in Rome. He was in the secret of the direct negotiations between [[Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel]] and [[Napoleon III]] in June 1869, and refused to entertain the idea of a French alliance unless Italy were allowed to occupy the Papal States, and, on occasion, Rome itself. On the eve of the assembly of the Oecumenical Council at Rome Menabrea reserved to the Italian government its right in respect of any measures directed against Italian institutions.

He withdrew from seminary students in 1860 the exemption from military service which they had hitherto enjoyed. Throughout his term of office he was supported by the finance minister Count [[Cambray Digny]], who forced through parliament the grist tax proposed by [[Quintino Sella]], though in an altered form from the earlier proposal. After a series of changes in the cabinet, and many crises, Menabrea resigned in December 1869 on the election of a new chamber in which he did not command a majority. He was made marquis of Valdora in 1875. His successor in the premiership, [[Giovanni Lanza]], in order to remove him from his influential position as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the king, sent him to London as ambassador, where he remained until in 1882 he replaced [[Enrico Cialdini|General Cialdini]] at the Paris Embassy. Ten years later he withdrew from public life, and died at [[Saint Capin]] on 24 May 1896.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11204">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Magnus expansion''', named after [[Wilhelm Magnus]] (1907&amp;ndash;1990), provides an exponential representation of the solution of a first order homogeneous [[linear differential equation]] for a [[linear operator]]. In particular it furnishes the fundamental matrix  of a system of linear [[ordinary differential equations]] of order {{mvar|n}} with varying coefficients. The exponent is aggregated as an infinite series whose terms involve multiple integrals and  nested commutators.

== Magnus approach and its interpretation ==

Given the {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''}} coefficient matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}}, one wishes to solve the [[initial value problem]] associated with the linear ordinary differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;Y^{\prime}(t)=A(t)Y(t),\qquad\qquad Y(t_0)=Y_{0}&lt;/math&gt;
 
for the unknown {{mvar|n}}-dimensional vector function {{math|''Y''(''t'')}}.

When ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the solution simply reads 
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)= \exp \left( \int_{t_0}^{t}A(s)\,ds \right) Y_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
This is still valid for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 if the matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}} satisfies {{math|''A''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''A''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''A''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  ''A''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for any pair of values of ''t'', ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In particular, this is the case if the matrix {{mvar|A}} is independent of {{mvar|t}}. In the general case, however, the expression above is no longer the solution of the problem.
 
The approach introduced by Magnus, to solve the matrix initial value problem, is to express the solution by means of the exponential of a certain {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n''}} matrix function  
{{math|''Ω''(''t'', ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, 
:&lt;math&gt;  Y(t)=\exp \left( \Omega (t,t_0)\right) \, Y_0  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
which is subsequently constructed as a [[Series (mathematics)|series]] expansion,
::&lt;math&gt;\Omega(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\Omega_{k}(t),&lt;/math&gt;
where, for simplicity, it is customary to write {{math|''Ω''(''t'')}} for  {{math|''Ω''(''t'', ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and to take ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Magnus appreciated that, since {{math|(&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;''dt''&lt;/sub&gt; ''e&lt;sup&gt;Ω&lt;/sup&gt;'')  ''e&lt;sup&gt;−Ω&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} ''A''(''t'')}}, using a [[Derivative of the exponential map|Poincaré−Hausdorff]] matrix identity, he could relate the time-derivative of  {{mvar|Ω}} to the generating function of [[Bernoulli number#Generating function|Bernoulli numbers]] and 
the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint endomorphism]] of {{mvar|Ω}}, 
::&lt;math&gt;\Omega ' = \frac {\operatorname{ad}_\Omega}{\exp(\operatorname{ad}_\Omega)-1}  ~        A~,&lt;/math&gt;
to solve for  {{mvar|Ω}}  recursively in terms of {{mvar|A}}, "in a continuous analog of the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula|CBH expansion]]", as outlined in a subsequent  section.

The equation above constitutes the '''Magnus expansion''' or '''Magnus series'''  for the solution of matrix linear initial value problem. The first four terms of this series read
:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
  \Omega_1(t) &amp;= \int_0^t A(t_1)\,dt_1, \\
  \Omega_2(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t dt_1 \int_0^{t_1} dt_2\ \left[  A(t_1),A(t_2)\right], \\
  \Omega_3(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{6} \int_0^t dt_1 \int_0^{t_1}d t_2 \int_0^{t_2} dt_3
                 \Bigl(\left[A(t_1),\left[A(t_2),A(t_3)\right]\right]+\left[A(t_3),\left[  A(t_2),A(t_{1})\right]\right]\Bigr), \\
  \Omega_4(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{12} \int_0^t dt_1 \int_0^{t_1}d t_2 \int_0^{t_2} dt_3 \int_0^{t_3} dt_4
                 \Bigl(\left[\left[\left[A_1,A_2\right],A_3\right],A_4\right] \\
              &amp;\quad+\left[A_1,\left[\left[A_2,A_3\right],A_4\right]\right]
                    +\left[A_1,\left[A_2,\left[A_3,A_4\right]\right]\right]
                    +\left[A_2,\left[A_3,\left[A_4,A_1\right]\right]\right]\Bigr)
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|[''A'', ''B''] ≡ ''A'' ''B'' − ''B'' ''A''}} is the matrix [[commutator]] of ''A'' and ''B''.

These equations may be interpreted as follows:  {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} coincides exactly with the exponent in the scalar ({{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1) case, but this equation cannot give the whole solution. If one insists in having an exponential representation ([[Lie group]]), the exponent needs to be corrected. The rest of the Magnus series provides that correction systematically: {{mvar|Ω}}  or parts of it are in the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]] on the solution.

In applications, one can rarely sum exactly the Magnus series and one has to truncate it to get approximate solutions. The main advantage of the Magnus proposal is that the truncated series very often shares important qualitative properties with the exact solution, at variance with other conventional [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]] theories. For instance, in [[classical mechanics]] the [[Symplectic geometry|symplectic]] character of the [[time evolution]] is preserved at every order of approximation. Similarly the [[unitary operator|unitary]] character of the time evolution operator in [[quantum mechanics]] is also preserved (in contrast, e.g., to the [[Dyson series]] solving the same problem).

== Convergence of the expansion ==

From a mathematical point of view, the convergence problem is the following: given a certain matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}}, when can the exponent  {{math|''Ω''(''t'')}} be obtained as the sum of the Magnus series?

A sufficient condition for this series to [[convergent series|converge]] for  {{math|''t'' ∈  [0,''T'')}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;   \int_0^T \|A(s)\|_2 ds &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_2&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[matrix norm]]. This result is generic, in the sense that one may construct specific matrices {{math|''A''(''t'')}}  for which the series diverges for any {{math|''t'' &gt; ''T''}}.

== Magnus generator ==

A recursive procedure to generate all the terms in the Magnus expansion utilizes  the matrices {{math| ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}, defined recursively through
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n}^{(j)} =\sum_{m=1}^{n-j}\left[ \Omega_{m},S_{n-m}^{(j-1)}\right],\qquad\qquad  2\leq j\leq n-1  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n}^{(1)} =\left[ \Omega _{n-1},A \right] ,\qquad S_{n}^{(n-1)}= \mathrm{ad} _{\Omega _{1}}^{n-1} (A)  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
which then furnish
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega _{1} =\int_{0}^{t}A (\tau )d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega _{n} =\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\frac{B_{j}}{j!}\int_{0}^{t}S_{n}^{(j)}(\tau)d\tau ,\qquad\qquad n\geq 2.  &lt;/math&gt;

Here, ad&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''Ω''&lt;/sub&gt; is a shorthand for an iterated commutator, (see [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint endomorphism]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ad}_{\Omega}^0 A = A, \qquad \mathrm{ad}_{\Omega}^{k+1} A = [ \Omega, \mathrm{ad}_{\Omega}^k A ], &lt;/math&gt;
while {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  are the [[Bernoulli numbers]] with {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −1/2}}.

Finally, when this recursion is worked out explicitly, it is possible to express  {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}  as a linear combination of ''n''-fold integrals of ''n''−1  nested commutators involving {{mvar|n}} matrices {{mvar|A}},
:&lt;math&gt;    \Omega_n(t) =  \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{B_j}{j!} \,
    \sum_{
            k_1 + \cdots + k_j = n-1 \atop
            k_1 \ge 1, \ldots, k_j \ge 1}
            \, \int_0^t \,
       \mathrm{ad}_{\Omega_{k_1}(\tau )} \,  \mathrm{ad}_{\Omega_{k_2}(\tau )} \cdots
          \, \mathrm{ad}_{\Omega_{k_j}(\tau )} A(\tau ) \, d\tau     \qquad n \ge 2,&lt;/math&gt;
an expression which becomes increasingly intricate with {{mvar|n}}.

== Applications ==

Since the 1960s, the Magnus expansion has been successfully applied as a perturbative tool in numerous areas of physics and chemistry, from [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[molecular physics]] to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]&lt;ref&gt;1.Haeberlen, U. &amp; Waugh, J. S. Coherent Averaging Effects in Magnetic Resonance. Phys. Rev. 175, 453–467 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quantum electrodynamics]].  It has been also used since 1998 as a tool to construct practical algorithms for the numerical integration of matrix linear differential equations. As they inherit from the Magnus expansion the
preservation of qualitative traits of the problem, the corresponding schemes are prototypical examples of [[geometric integrator|geometric numerical integrators]].


In 2015, Magnus expansion has been used to analyze the transient time behavior of electronic oscillators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fatemi |first1=Seyed Mohammadreza |last2=Sharifkhani|first2=Mohammad |last3=Fotowat-Ahmady|first3=Ali |title=A Unified Solution for Super-Regenerative Systems With Application to Correlator-Based UWB Transceivers |journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers |date=2015/4 |volume=62 |issue=4 |page=1033-1041 |doi=10.1109/TCSI.2015.2395592 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7070873 |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, using this approach, a generalized theory is proposed to model the operation of super-regenerative receivers unifying all four modes of operation that was modeled and analyzed separately in the past. In addition, this Magnus expansion based solution models the behavior of a super-regenerative receiver that operates beyond the four conventional modes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fatemi |first1=Seyed Mohammadreza |last2=Sharifkhani|first2=Mohammad |last3=Fotowat-Ahmady|first3=Ali |title=A Unified Solution for Super-Regenerative Systems With Application to Correlator-Based UWB Transceivers |journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers |date=2015/4 |volume=62 |issue=4 |page=1033-1041 |doi=10.1109/TCSI.2015.2395592 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7070873 |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Marc Edward Culler''' (born November 22, 1953) is an American mathematician who works in [[geometric group theory]] and [[low-dimensional topology]]. A native Californian, Culler did his undergraduate work at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] and his graduate work at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] where he graduated in 1978. He is now at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].  Culler is the son of [[Glen Culler|Glen Jacob Culler]] who was an important early innovator in the development of the Internet.

==Work==
Culler specializes in [[group theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~jon.mccammond/geogrouptheory/people.html People in Geometric Group Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; low dimensional topology, [[3-manifolds]], and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Culler frequently collaborates with [[Peter Shalen]] and they have co-authored many papers.&lt;ref&gt;Culler, Marc; Shalen, Peter B. Varieties of group representations and splittings of 3-manifolds. Ann. of Math. (2) 117 (1983), no. 1, 109–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culler, Marc; Gordon, C. McA.; Luecke, J.; Shalen, Peter B. Dehn surgery on knots. Ann. of Math. (2) 125 (1987), no. 2, 237–300&lt;/ref&gt;  Culler and Shalen did joint work that related properties of representation varieties of [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]] groups to decompositions of 3-manifolds.  In particular, Culler and Shalen used the [[Bass–Serre theory]], applied to the function field of the SL(2,C)-[[Character variety]] of a 3-manifold, to obtain information about
[[incompressible surface]]s in the manifold.  Based on this work, Shalen, [[Cameron Gordon (mathematician)|Cameron Gordon]], [[John Edwin Luecke|John Luecke]], and Culler proved the [[cyclic surgery theorem]].

Another important contribution by Culler came in a 1986 paper with [[Karen Vogtmann]] called "Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups".&lt;ref name="CV86"&gt;{{Citation | last = Culler | first = Marc |author2=Vogtmann, Karen | title = Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups | journal = [[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 91–119 | year=1986 | url=http://www.math.cornell.edu/~vogtmann/ScannedPapers/1986.0084.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF01388734 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper introduced an object that came to be known as [[Out(Fn)#Outer space|Culler&amp;ndash;Vogtmann Outer space]].

Culler is one of the authors of a 1994 paper called "Plane curves associated to character varieties of 3-manifolds"&lt;ref&gt;D. Cooper, M. Culler, H. Gillet, D. D. Long and P. B. Shalen.  Plane curves associated to character varieties of 3-manifolds.  Invent. Math., 118(1):47--84, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the A-polynomial of a knot&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evri.com/media/article;jsessionid=x8dlxkdrd423?title=Knot+Table:+A-Polynomial+-+Indiana+University&amp;page=http://www.indiana.edu/~knotinfo/descriptions/a_polynomial.html&amp;referring_uri=/person/marc-culler-0x57c4b9%3Bjsessionid%3Dx8dlxkdrd423&amp;referring_title=Evri The A-polynomial and the FFT], in PDF format&lt;/ref&gt; or, more generally, of a 3-manifold with one torus boundary component.

Culler is an editor of ''[[The New York Journal of Mathematics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/19980128023114/http://emis.math.ecnu.edu.cn/journals/NYJM/Edboard.html  New York Journal of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Sloan Foundation]] Research Fellow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sloan.org/fellowships/list/s/page/25 Sloan Research Fellowships]&lt;/ref&gt; (1986–1988) and a UIC University Scholar&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/uicnews/articledetail.cgi?id=12357 UIC News: 2008 University Scholar Marc Culler]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UIC College awards"&gt;[http://www.math.uic.edu/awards UIC College awards]&lt;/ref&gt; (2008). In 2014, he became a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Math Suks'''" is a song by [[Jimmy Buffett]], from the [[album]] ''[[Beach House on the Moon]]'' ([[1999 in music|1999]]).

The lyrics tell of the author's frustration as a [[mathematics|math]] student. According to the lyrics, the inspiration for the song and title came from a candid interview on TV:

:''I got so bored with my homework''
:''I turned on the TV''
:''The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth"
:''They asked the new Miss America "Hey babe, can you add up all those bucks?"''
:''She looked puzzled then just said, "Math Suks!"''

However, in later interviews Jimmy said that the inspiration actually came from [[graffiti]] on a bridge in [[Key West]] [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="scimag"&gt;{{cite web | title = Irreverent Song Upsets Math Teachers | author = Dana Mackenzie | url = http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1999/603/5 (outdated link) | accessdate = November 2008 | date = June 3, 1999 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science }} (updated link: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5421/1763.2.full)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with its stated theme, the song lyrics are largely an emotional [[catharsis]];  mathematical terms are used only in a very superficial way. Presumably for that reason, the song seems to have little appeal to mathematicians, and even less to mathematics teachers &lt;ref name="scimag"/&gt; (unlike other songs that make fun at mathematics, such as [[Tom Lehrer]]'s "[[Lobachevsky (song)|Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]]" and "[[New Math (song)|New Math]]").  The song was in fact promptly condemned by the [[United States|US]] [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] and the [[National Education Association]] for its alleged negative effect on children's education.&lt;ref name="scimag"/&gt;  [[Jon Stewart]] also criticized the song on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' during a segment called "Math Is Quite Pleasant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-may-24-1999/math-is-quite-pleasant]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|shape with nine sides}}
In [[geometry]], a '''nonagon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɒ|n|ə|g|ɒ|n}}) or '''enneagon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|i|ə|ɡ|ɒ|n}}) is a nine-sided [[polygon]] or 9-gon.

The name "nonagon" is a [[prefix]] hybrid formation, from [[Latin]] (''nonus'', "ninth" + ''gonon''), used equivalently, attested already in the 16th century in French ''nonogone'' and in English from the 17th century. The name "enneagon" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''enneagonon'' (εννεα, "nine" + γωνον (from γωνία = "corner")), and is arguably more correct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[Eric W. Weisstein]] |title=Nonagon |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Nonagon.html |website=[http://mathworld.wolfram.com&gt; MathWorld]--A Wolfram Web Resource |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though less common than "nonagon".

== Regular nonagon==
A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] nonagon'' is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {9} and has [[internal angle]]s of 140°. The area of a regular nonagon of side length ''a'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{9}{4}a^2\cot\frac{\pi}{9}=(9/2)ar = 9r^2\tan(\pi/9) &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= (9/2)R^2\sin(2\pi/9)\simeq6.18182\,a^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the radius ''r'' of the [[inscribed circle]] of the regular nonagon is

:&lt;math&gt;r=(a/2)\cot(\pi/9)&lt;/math&gt;

and where ''R'' is the radius of its [[circumscribed circle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{(a/2)^2 + r^2 }=r\sec(\pi/9).&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
Although a regular nonagon is not [[constructible polygon|constructible]] with [[compass and straightedge]] (as 9 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s), there are very old methods of construction that produce very close approximations.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Berggren, [https://books.google.de/books?id=MPTxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22The+Construction+of+the+Regular+Nonagon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kea3Fz2Q_o&amp;sig=baDTPI6FwF_bHwTSDBsqE_U0fs8&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidzJbdkNTJAhVBsiwKHfQvD2EQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Construction%20of%20the%20Regular%20Nonagon%22&amp;f=false "Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam", p. 82 - 85] Springer-Verlag New York, Inc. 1st edition 1986, retrieved on 11 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be also constructed using [[neusis construction|neusis]], or by allowing the use of an [[Angle trisection|angle trisector]].

==Approximations==
===Approximation I===
: Accuracy (linear): 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- From the text below--&gt;
The following is an ''approximate'' construction of a nonagon using a [[straightedge]] and [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]].

''Example to illustrate the error, when the constructed central angle is 39.99906°:''&lt;br /&gt;
At a circumscribed circle radius r = 100&amp;nbsp;m, the absolute error of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; side would be approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm.
[[File:Approximated Nonagon Inscribed in a Circle.gif|left|509px]]
{{clear}}

===Approximation II===
: Accuracy (linear): 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- From the text below --&gt;

*Downsize the angle JMK (also 60°) with four [[bisections]] of angle and make a thirds of circular arc MON with an approximate solution between bisections of angle w&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and w&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Straight [[auxiliary line]] g aims over the point O to the point N (virtually a ruler at the points O and N applied), between O and N, therefore no auxiliary line.

:Thus, the [[circular arc]] MON is freely accessible for the later intersection point R.

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\angle{}&lt;/math&gt; RMK = 40.0000000052441...°

:360° ÷ 9 = 40°

:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\angle{}&lt;/math&gt; RMK - 40° = 5.2...E-9°

:''Example to illustrate the error'':

:At a circumscribed circle radius

:r = 100,000&amp;nbsp;km, the absolute error of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; side would be approximately 8.6&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Symmetry==
[[File:Regular enneagon symmetries.png|thumb|200px|Symmetries of a regular enneagon. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. Blue mirrors are drawn through vertices, and purple mirrors are drawn through edge. Gyration orders are given in the center.]]

The ''regular enneagon'' has [[dihedral symmetry|Dih&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]], order 18. There are 2 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and 3 [[cyclic group]] symmetries: Z&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

These 6 symmetries can be seen in 6 distinct symmetries on the enneagon. [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] labels these by a letter and group order.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, [[Chaim Goodman-Strauss]], (2008) The Symmetries of Things, {{isbn|978-1-56881-220-5}} (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278)&lt;/ref&gt; Full symmetry of the regular form is '''r18''' and no symmetry is labeled '''a1'''. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices ('''d''' for diagonal) or edges ('''p''' for perpendiculars), and '''i''' when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as '''g''' for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the '''g9''' subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as [[directed edge]]s.

== Tilings==

The regular enneagon can tessellate the euclidean tiling with gaps. These gaps can be filled with regular hexagons and isosceles triangles. In the notation of [[symmetrohedron]] this tiling is called H(*;3;*;[2]) with H representing *632 hexagonal symmetry in the plane.
:[[File:Conway tiling dKH.png|320px]]

==Graphs==
The K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; [[complete graph]] is often drawn as a ''regular enneagon'' with all 36 edges connected. This graph also represents an [[orthographic projection]] of the 9 vertices and 36 edges of the [[8-simplex]].

==Pop culture references==
[[They Might Be Giants]] have a song entitled "Nonagon" on their children's album ''[[Here Come the 123s]]''. It refers to both an attendee at a party at which "everybody in the party is a many-sided polygon" and a dance they perform at this party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmbw.net/wiki/Lyrics:Nonagon TMBW.net]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s logo is also a version of a nonagon, being a nine-pointed star made of three triangles. [[King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard]] have an album titled '[[Nonagon Infinity]]', the album art featuring a nonagonal complete graph.

==Architecture==
Temples of the [[Bahai Temple|Baha'i Faith]] are required to be nonagonal.

The [[U.S. Steel Tower]] is an irregular nonagon.

The '''PPGMAp''', or '''{{lang|pt|Programa de Pós-Graduação em Matemática Aplicada}}''' (Program of Graduation in Applied Mathematics), of the Mathematics Institute of the [[UFRGS|Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] was created in 1995, in Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~ppgmap PPGMAp]&lt;/ref&gt;

PPGMAp offers programs that lead to a M.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/ppgmap/Cursos/mestrado.html M.S.] in Applied Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; or Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/ppgmap/Cursos/doutorado.html Ph.D.] in Applied Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; degree in Applied Mathematics.

The research interests of the program encompass core areas of analysis, numerical analysis, fluid dynamics, scientific computation, mathematical biology, mathematical physics, nonlinear systems, control and signals.

PPGMAp has grants of study from CAPES and CNPq. The selection of the students for the grants is decided after the academic analysis and is subject to disponibility of grants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/ppgmap/admissao/inscricao.html Admission] - Registration&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penelope Maddy''' (born 4 July 1950) is an American philosopher. She is a UCI Distinguished Professor of [[Logic]] and [[Philosophy of Science]] and of [[Mathematics]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]].  She is well known for her influential work in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], where she has worked on [[mathematical realism]] (especially [[set-theoretic]] realism) and [[Naturalized epistemology|mathematical naturalism]].

==Biography==
Maddy received her Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1979.  Her early work, culminating in ''Realism in Mathematics'', defended [[Kurt Gödel]]'s position that mathematics is a true description of a mind-independent realm that we can access through our intuition.  However, she suggested that some mathematical entities are in fact concrete, unlike, notably, Gödel, who assumed all mathematical objects are abstract.  She suggested that sets can be causally efficacious, and in fact share all the causal and spatiotemporal properties of their elements.  Thus, when one sees three cups on a table, one also sees the set.  She used contemporary work in cognitive science and psychology to support this position, pointing out that just as at a certain age we begin to see objects rather than mere sense perceptions, there is also a certain age at which we begin to see sets rather than just objects.

In the 1990s, she moved away from this position, towards a position described in ''Naturalism in Mathematics''.  Her "naturalist" position, like [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s, suggests that since science is our most successful project so far for knowing about the world, philosophers should adopt the methods of science in their own discipline, and especially when discussing science.  As Maddy stated in an interview, "If you’re a ‘naturalist’, you think that science shouldn’t be held to extra-scientific standards, that it doesn’t require extra-scientific ratification."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-stuff-of-proof/ "The stuff of proof"]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, rather than a unified picture of the sciences like Quine's, she has a picture on which mathematics is separate.  This way, mathematics is neither supported nor undermined by the needs and goals of science, but is allowed to obey its own criteria.  This means that traditional [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[epistemology|epistemological]] concerns of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are misplaced.  Like [[Wittgenstein]], she suggests that many of these puzzles arise merely because of the application of language outside its proper domain of significance.

She has been dedicated to understanding and explaining the methods that [[set theory|set theorists]] use in agreeing on [[axiom]]s, especially those that go beyond [[ZFC]].

== Awards ==
The [[German Mathematical Society]] awarded her a [[Gauss Lectureship]] in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11736">In [[number theory]], the '''prime omega function''' &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of ''distinct'' prime factors of a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where the related function &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; counts the ''total'' number of prime factors of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; counting multiplicity (see [[Arithmetic function#Ω(n), ω(n), νp(n) – prime power decomposition|arithmetic function]]). For example, if we have a [[prime factorization]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}&lt;/math&gt; for distinct primes &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;), then each of these respective prime omega functions are given by &lt;math&gt;\omega(n) = k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n) = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_k&lt;/math&gt;. These prime factor counting functions have many important number theoretic relations.

==Known relations and identities==

The functions &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Arithmetic function#Multiplicative and additive functions|additive]] and &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Arithmetic function#Multiplicative and additive functions|completely additive]]. 
If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[squarefree]] then &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the [[Möbius function]] by &lt;ref&gt;This is obvious by the definition of the [[Möbius function]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(n) = (-1)^{\omega(n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is known that the average order of the [[divisor function]] satisfies &lt;math&gt;2^{\omega(n)} \leq d(n) \leq 2^{\Omega(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This inequality is given in Section 22.13 of Hardy and Wright.&lt;/ref&gt;

An asymptotic series for &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;ref&gt;See equation (4) of the ''MathWorld'' reference. The truncation of this series to its main term is also cited below and proved in Section 22.10 of Hardy and Wright.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(n) \sim \log\log n + B_1 + \sum_{k \geq 1} \left(\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \frac{\gamma_j}{j!} - 1\right) \frac{(k-1)!}{(\log n)^k}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_1 \approx 0.26149721&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mertens constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Stieltjes constants]].

The function &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is related to divisor sums over the [[Möbius function]] and the [[divisor function]] including the next sums 
.&lt;ref&gt;Each of these started from the second identity in the list are cited individually on the pages [[Arithmetic function#Dirichlet convolutions|Dirichlet convolutions of arithmetic functions]], [[Arithmetic function#Menon's identity|Menon's identity]], and [[Euler's totient function#Other formulae|other formulas for Euler's totient function]]. The first identity is a combination of two known divisor sums cited in Section 27.6 of the [https://dlmf.nist.gov/27.6  NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\mid n} |\mu(n)| = \sum_{d\mid n} \sum_{r^2 \mid d} \mu(r) = 2^{\omega(n)} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r\mid n} 2^{\omega(r)} = d(n^2) &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{r\mid n} 2^{\omega(r)} d\left(\frac{n}{r}\right) = d^2(n) &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{\stackrel{1\le k\le m}{(k,m)=1}} \gcd(k^2-1,m_1)\gcd(k^2-1,m_2)
=\varphi(n)\sum_{\stackrel{d_1\mid m_1} {d_2\mid m_2}} \varphi(\gcd(d_1, d_2)) 2^{\omega(\operatorname{lcm}(d_1, d_2))},\ m_1, m_2 \text{ odd}, m = \operatorname{lcm}(m_1, m_2)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\stackrel{1\le k\le n}{\operatorname{gcd}(k,m)=1} \!\!\!\! 1 = n \frac {\varphi(m)}{m} + O \left ( 2^{\omega(m)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

A known [[Dirichlet series]] involving &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Riemann zeta function]] is given by &lt;ref&gt;This identity is found in Section 27.4 of the [https://dlmf.nist.gov/27.4  NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{2^{\omega(n)}}{n^s} = \frac{\zeta^2(s)}{\zeta(2s)},\ \Re(s) &gt; 1. &lt;/math&gt;

A partition-related exact identity for &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;ref&gt;This identity is proved in the article by Schmidt cited on this page below.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(n) = \log_2\left[\sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k \left(\sum_{d\mid k} \sum_{i=1}^d p(d-ji) \right) s_{n,k} \cdot |\mu(j)|\right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Partition (number theory)|partition function]], &lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Möbius function]], and the triangular sequence &lt;math&gt;s_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt; is expanded by

:&lt;math&gt;s_{n,k} = [q^n] (q; q)_\infty \frac{q^k}{1-q^k} = s_o(n, k) - s_e(n, k), &lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the infinite [[q-Pochhammer symbol]] and the restricted partition functions &lt;math&gt;s_{o/e}(n, k)&lt;/math&gt; which respectively denote the number of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;'s in all partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; into an ''odd'' (''even'') number of distinct parts.&lt;ref&gt;This triangular sequence also shows up prominently in the [[Lambert series#Factorization theorems|Lambert series factorization theorems]] proved by Merca and Schmidt (2017–2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Average order and summatory functions==

The [[average order of an arithmetic function|average order]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\omega(n) \sim \log\log n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n) \sim \log\log n&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is [[prime]] a lower bound on the value of the function is &lt;math&gt;\omega(p) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[primorial]] then the function is as large as 
&lt;math&gt;\omega(n) \sim \frac{\log n}{\log\log n}&lt;/math&gt; on average order. When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[power of 2]], then &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n) \sim \frac{\log n}{\log 2}&lt;/math&gt; 
.&lt;ref&gt;For references to each of these average order estimates see equations (3) and (18) of the ''MathWorld'' reference and Section 22.10-22.11 of Hardy and Wright.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asymptotics for the summatory functions over &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)^2&lt;/math&gt; 
are respectively computed in Hardy and Wright as &lt;ref&gt;See Sections 22.10 and 22.11 for reference and explicit derivations of these asymptotic estimates.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Actually, the proof of the last result given in Hardy and Wright actually suggests a more general procedure for extracting asymptotic estimates of the [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n)^k&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;k \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; by considering the summatory functions of the [[factorial moment]]s of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\left[\omega(n)\right]!}{\left[\omega(n)-m\right]!}&lt;/math&gt; for more general cases of &lt;math&gt;m \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
     \sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n) &amp; = x \log\log x + B_1 x + o(x) \\ 
     \sum_{n \leq x} \Omega(n) &amp; = x \log\log x + B_2 x + o(x) \\ 
     \sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n)^2 &amp; = x (\log\log x)^2 + O(x \log\log x), 
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; is again the [[Mertens constant]] and the constant &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_2 = B_1 + \sum_{p\text{ prime}} \frac{1}{p(p-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Other sums relating the two variants of the prime omega functions include &lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright Chapter 22.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \leq x} \left\{\Omega(n) - \omega(n)\right\} = O(x), &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\#\left\{n \leq x : \Omega(n) - \omega(n) &gt; \sqrt{\log\log x}\right\} = O\left(\frac{x}{(\log\log x)^{1/2}}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

===Example I: A modified summatory function===

In this example we suggest a variant of the summatory functions &lt;math&gt;S_{\omega}(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n)&lt;/math&gt; estimated in the above results for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We then prove an asymptotic formula for the growth of this modified summatory function derived from the asymptotic estimate of &lt;math&gt;S_{\omega}(x)&lt;/math&gt; provided in the formulas in the main subsection of this article above.&lt;ref&gt;N.b., this sum is suggested by work contained in an unpublished manuscript by the contributor to this page related to the growth of the [[Mertens function]]. Hence it is not just a vacuous and/or trivial estimate obtained for the purpose of exposition here.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be completely precise, let the odd-indexed summatory function be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n) [n\text{ odd}]_{\delta}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;[\cdot]_{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Iverson's convention]]. Then we have that

:&lt;math&gt;S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) = \frac{x}{2} \log\log x + \frac{(2B_1-1)x}{4} + \left\{\frac{x}{4}\right\} - \left[x \equiv 2,3 \bmod{4}\right]_\delta + O\left(\frac{x}{\log x}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of this result follows by first observing that

:&lt;math&gt;
     \omega(2n) = \begin{cases}
                    \omega(n) + 1, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd; } \\ 
                    \omega(n), &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even,}
                  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and then applying the asymptotic result from Hardy and Wright for the summatory function over &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;S_{\omega}(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
S_\omega(x) &amp; = S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) + \sum_{n \leq \left\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\right\rfloor} \omega(2n) \\ 
     &amp; = S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) + \sum_{n \leq \left\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\right\rfloor} \left(\omega(4n) + \omega(4n+2)\right) \\ 
     &amp; = S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) + \sum_{n \leq \left\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\right\rfloor} \left(\omega(2n) + \omega(2n+1) + 1\right) \\ 
     &amp; = S_{\operatorname{odd}}(x) + S_{\omega}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\right\rfloor\right) + \left\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\right\rfloor. 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example II: Summatory functions for so-termed factorial moments of &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;===

The computations expanded in Chapter 22.11 of Hardy and Wright provide asymptotic estimates for the summatory function

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(n) \left\{\omega(n)-1\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

by estimating the product of these two component omega functions as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(n) \left\{\omega(n)-1\right\} = \sum_{\stackrel{pq\mid n} {\stackrel{p \neq q}{p,q\text{ prime}}}} 1 = 
       \sum_{\stackrel{pq\mid n}{p,q\text{ prime}}} 1 - \sum_{\stackrel{p^2\mid n}{p\text{ prime}}} 1.&lt;/math&gt;

We can similarly calculate asymptotic formulas more generally for the related summatory functions over so-termed [[factorial moment]]s of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{expand section|For example, one good demonstrative formula for generalizing the method from Hardy and Wright would be to calculate &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n) \left\{\omega(n)-1\right\} \left\{\omega(n)-2\right\}&lt;/math&gt; explicitly. May prove or conjecture at a general formula for these so-termed factorial moments of the little omega function. Such a formula immediately implies a formula for the power summatory functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \leq x} \omega(n)^k&lt;/math&gt; by inversion formulas converting between powers and [[falling factorial]]s given in terms of the [[Stirling numbers]]. These two generalized results would ''definitely'' be a nice addition to this page!|date=April 2018}}

In [[geometry]], a '''quaternionic polytope''' is a generalization of a [[polytope]] in [[real coordinate space|real space]] to an analogous structure in a [[quaternion]]ic [[module (mathematics)|module]], where each real dimension is accompanied by three [[imaginary number|imaginary]] ones. Similarly to [[complex polytope]]s, points are not ordered and there is no sense of "between", and thus a quaternionic polytope may be understood as an arrangement of connected points, lines, planes and so on, where every point is the junction of multiple lines, every line of multiple planes, and so on. Likewise, each line must contain multiple points, each plane multiple lines, and so on. Since the quaternions are non-[[commutative property|commutative]], a convention must be made for the multiplication of vectors by scalars, which is usually in favour of left-multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XpDbBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=quaternionic+polytope#v=onepage&amp;q=quaternionic%20polytope&amp;f=false |title=The Geometric Vein: The Coxeter Festschrift - Google Books |date= 2012-12-06|accessdate=2016-04-15|isbn=9781461256489 |last1=Davis |first1=C. |last2=Grünbaum |first2=B. |last3=Sherk |first3=F.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case for the complex polytopes, the only quaternionic polytopes to have been systematically studied are the [[regular polytope|regular]] ones. Like the real and complex regular polytopes, their symmetry groups may be described as reflection groups. For example, the regular quaternionic lines are in a one-to-one correspondence with the finite subgroups of ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''H'''): the [[binary cyclic group]]s, [[binary dihedral group]]s, [[binary tetrahedral group]], [[binary octahedral group]], and [[binary icosahedral group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hans Cuypers |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002437959500149L |title=Regular quaternionic polytopes |date= September 1995|accessdate=2016-04-14 |doi=10.1016/0024-3795(95)00149-L |volume=226-228 |pages=311–329 |journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16051">The '''Quine–McCluskey algorithm''' (or '''the method of prime implicants''') is a method used for [[Minimization of Boolean functions|minimization]] of [[Boolean function|Boolean functions]] that was developed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard V. Quine]]&lt;ref name="Quine_1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine_1955"/&gt; and extended by [[Edward J. McCluskey]].&lt;ref name="McCluskey_1956"/&gt; It is functionally identical to [[Karnaugh mapping]], but the tabular form makes it more efficient for use in computer algorithms, and it also gives a deterministic way to check that the minimal form of a Boolean function has been reached. It is sometimes referred to as the tabulation method.

The method involves two steps:
# Finding all [[implicant|prime implicants]] of the function.
# Use those prime implicants in a ''prime implicant chart'' to find the essential prime implicants of the function, as well as other prime implicants that are necessary to cover the function.

==Complexity==
Although more practical than [[Karnaugh mapping]] when dealing with more than four variables, the Quine–McCluskey algorithm also has a limited range of use since the [[Boolean satisfiability problem|problem]] it solves is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | url= | author=W. Masek | title=Some NP-complete set covering problems | publisher=unpublished | location= | pages= | year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type=Master's thesis | url= | author=S. Czort | title=The complexity of minimizing disjunctive normal form formulas | institution=University of Aarhus | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | author1=C. Umans |author2= T. Villa |author3= A.L. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli | title=Complexity of two-level logic minimization | journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems]] | volume=25 | number=7 | pages=1230-1246 | year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[running time]] of the Quine–McCluskey algorithm grows [[exponential growth|exponentially]] with the number of variables. For a function of ''n'' variables the number of prime implicants can be as large as 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;ln(''n''), e.g. for 32 variables there may be over 534 * 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; prime implicants. Functions with a large number of variables have to be minimized with potentially non-optimal [[Heuristic algorithm|heuristic]] methods, of which the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]] was the de-facto standard in 1995.{{update inline|date=May 2017|reason=The reference correctly describes the situation in 1995. We need to expand this to include the changes of the past twenty years, however.}}&lt;ref name="Nelson_1995"/&gt;

Step two of the algorithm amounts to solving the [[set cover problem]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000800069X/pdf?md5=0adeeefb189024849aaf393af8c98634&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S002200000800069X-main.pdf | author=Vitaly Feldman | title=Hardness of Approximate Two-Level Logic Minimization  and PAC Learning with Membership Queries | journal=[[Journal of Computer and System Sciences]] | volume=75 | number= | pages=13-25 | month= | year=2009 }} Here: p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul | title=Boolesche Minimalpolynome und Überdeckungsprobleme | journal=Acta Inform. | volume=4 | number= | pages=321-336 | month= | year=1974 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
===Input===

In this example, the input is a Boolean function in four variables, &lt;math&gt;f :\{0,1\}^4 \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; on the values &lt;math&gt;4,8,10,11,12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;15&lt;/math&gt;, evaluates to an unknown value on &lt;math&gt;9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;14&lt;/math&gt;, and to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; everywhere else (where these integers are interpreted in their binary form for input to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for succinctness of notation).  The inputs that evaluate to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; are called 'minterms'.  We encode all of this information by writing

:&lt;math&gt;f(A,B,C,D) =\sum m(4,8,10,11,12,15) + d(9,14). \,&lt;/math&gt;
This expression says that the output function f will be 1 for the minterms &lt;math&gt;4,8,10,11,12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;15&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by the 'm' term) and that we don't care about the output for &lt;math&gt;9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;14&lt;/math&gt; combinations (denoted by the 'd' term).

===Step 1: finding prime implicants===
First, we write the function as a table (where 'x' stands for don't care):
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
!   !! A !! B !! C !! D !! f
|-
| m0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
| m1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| m2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0
|-
| m3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
| m4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| m5 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| m6 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0
|-
| m7 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 0
|-
| m8 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| m9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || x
|-
| m10 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| m11 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1
|-
| m12 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| m13 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| m14 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 0 || x
|-
| m15 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1
|}

One can easily form the canonical [[sum of products]] expression from this table, simply by summing the [[minterm]]s (leaving out [[Don't-care (logic)|don't-care terms]]) where the function evaluates to one:

:&lt;math&gt;f_{A,B,C,D} = A'BC'D' + AB'C'D' + AB'CD' + AB'CD + ABC'D' + ABCD. \ &lt;/math&gt;

which is not minimal. So to optimize, all minterms that evaluate to one are first placed in a minterm table. Don't-care terms are also added into this table, so they can be combined with minterms:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of 1s !! Minterm !! Binary Representation
|-
| rowspan="2" | 1
| m4 || 0100
|-
| m8 || 1000
|-
| rowspan="3" | 2
| m9 || 1001
|-
| m10 || 1010
|-
| m12 || 1100
|-
| rowspan="2" | 3
| m11 || 1011
|-
| m14 || 1110
|-
|| 4
| m15 || 1111
|}

At this point, one can start combining minterms with other minterms. If two terms vary by only a single digit changing, that digit can be replaced with a dash indicating that the digit doesn't matter. Terms that can't be combined any more are marked with an asterisk (*). When going from Size 2 to Size 4, treat '-' as a third bit value. For instance, -110 and -100 can be combined, as well as -110 and -11-, but -110 and 011- cannot. (Trick: Match up the '-' first.)

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of 1s !! Minterm !! 0-Cube !! colspan = "2" | Size 2 Implicants !! colspan = "2" | Size 4 Implicants
|-
| rowspan="4" | 1
| m4 || 0100 || m(4,12) || -100* || m(8,9,10,11) || 10--*
|-
| m8 || 1000 || m(8,9) || 100- || m(8,10,12,14)  || 1--0*
|-
| {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || m(8,10) || 10-0 ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || m(8,12) || 1-00 ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| rowspan="4" | 2
| m9 || 1001 || m(9,11) || 10-1 || m(10,11,14,15) || 1-1-*
|-
| m10 || 1010 || m(10,11) || 101- ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || m(10,14) || 1-10 ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| m12 || 1100 || m(12,14) || 11-0 ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| rowspan="2" | 3
| m11 || 1011 || m(11,15) || 1-11 ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| m14 || 1110 || m(14,15) || 111- ||colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|-
| rowspan="1" | 4
| m15 || 1111 ||
| {{sdash}}
| colspan = "2" {{sdash}}
|}

Note: In this example, none of the terms in the size 4 implicants table can be combined any further. Be aware that this processing should be continued otherwise (size 8 etc.).

===Step 2: prime implicant chart===
None of the terms can be combined any further than this, so at this point we construct an essential prime implicant table. Along the side goes the prime implicants that have just been generated, and along the top go the minterms specified earlier. The don't care terms are not placed on top—they are omitted from this section because they are not necessary inputs.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
!                 || 4 || 8 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 15 || &amp;rArr; || A || B || C || D
|-
| m(4,12)*        || {{na}} || || || || {{na}} ||   || &amp;rArr; || {{sdash}} || 1 || 0 || 0
|-
| m(8,9,10,11)    || || {{na}} || {{na}} || {{na}} || || || &amp;rArr; || 1 || 0 || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}}
|-
| m(8,10,12,14)   || || {{na}} || {{na}} || || {{na}} || || &amp;rArr; || 1 || {{sdash}} || {{sdash}} || 0
|-
| m(10,11,14,15)* || || || {{na}} || {{na}} || || {{na}} || &amp;rArr; || 1 || {{sdash}} || 1 || {{sdash}}
|}

To find the essential prime implicants, we run along the top row. We have to look for columns with only 1 "X". If a column has only 1 "X", this means that the minterm can only be covered by 1 prime implicant. This prime implicant is ''essential''.

For example: in the first column, with minterm 4, there is only 1 "X". This means that m(4,12) is essential. So we place a star next to it. Minterm 15 also has only 1 "X", so m(10,11,14,15) is also essential. Now all columns with 1 "X" are covered.

The second prime implicant can be 'covered' by the third and fourth, and the third prime implicant can be 'covered' by the second and first, and neither is thus essential. If a prime implicant is essential then, as would be expected, it is necessary to include it in the minimized boolean equation. In some cases, the essential prime implicants do not cover all minterms, in which case additional procedures for chart reduction can be employed. The simplest "additional procedure" is trial and error, but a more systematic way is [[Petrick's method]]. In the current example, the essential prime implicants do not handle all of the minterms, so, in this case, one can combine the essential implicants with one of the two non-essential ones to yield one equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f_{A,B,C,D} = BC'D' + AB' + AC \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Logic_Friday"/&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;f_{A,B,C,D} = BC'D' + AD' + AC \ &lt;/math&gt;

Both of those final equations are functionally equivalent to the original, verbose equation:
:&lt;math&gt;f_{A,B,C,D} = A'BC'D' + AB'C'D' + AB'C'D + AB'CD' + AB'CD + ABC'D' + ABCD' + ABCD. \ &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6642">'''Recurrence period density entropy''' ('''RPDE''') is a method, in the fields of [[dynamical systems]], [[stochastic processes]], and [[time series analysis]], for determining the periodicity, or '''repetitiveness''' of a signal.

== Overview ==
Recurrence period density entropy is useful for characterising the extent to which a time series repeats the same sequence, and is therefore similar to linear [[autocorrelation]] and time delayed [[mutual information]], except that it measures repetitiveness in the [[phase space]] of the system, and is thus a more reliable measure based upon the dynamics of the underlying system that generated the signal. It has the advantage that it does not require the assumptions of [[linear systems|linearity]], [[Normal distribution|Gaussianity]] or dynamical determinism. It has been successfully used to detect abnormalities in biomedical contexts such as [[Speech communication|speech]] signal.&lt;ref name="little06"&gt;M. Little, P. McSharry, I. Moroz, S. Roberts (2006)
[http://www.maxlittle.net/publications/dfafullpath.pdf Nonlinear, Biophysically-Informed Speech Pathology Detection]
in 2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2006. ICASSP 2006 Proceedings.: Toulouse, France. pp. II-1080-II-1083.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="little07"&gt;M.A. Little, P.E. McSharry, S.J. Roberts, D.A.E. Costello, I.M. Moroz (2007) [http://www.maxlittle.net/publications/bmeo.pdf Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection], BioMedical Engineering OnLine, '''6''':23&lt;/ref&gt;

The RPDE value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_\mathrm{norm}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar in the range zero to one. For purely periodic signals, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_\mathrm{norm}=0&lt;/math&gt;, whereas for purely [[i.i.d.]], uniform [[white noise]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_\mathrm{norm} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="little07" /&gt;

[[Image:RPDE ranking.gif|thumb|center|500px|How RPDE ranks signals by their phase space periodicity. The small panels are depictions of the time series, and the large scale in the middle is the RPDE value. It can be seen that purely periodic signals, regardless of harmonic content in a spectral sense, have an RPDE value of zero. Randomly forced periodic oscillation has a higher value, followed by chaotic systems, randomly forced linear resonators, autocorrelated random processes, and at the extreme, uniform random noise has an RPDE value of nearly one.]]

==Method description==
The RPDE method first requires the [[embedding]] of a time series in [[phase space]], which, according to stochastic extensions to Taken's embedding theorems, can be carried out by forming time-delayed vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}_n=[x_n, x_{n+\tau}, x_{n+2\tau}, \ldots, x_{n+(M-1)\tau}]&lt;/math&gt;

for each value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the time series, where ''M'' is the [[embedding dimension]], and τ is the embedding delay. These parameters are obtained by systematic search for the optimal set (due to lack of practical embedding parameter techniques for stochastic systems) (Stark et al. 2003). Next, around each point &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; in the phase space, an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood (an ''m''-dimensional ball with this radius) is formed, and every time the time series returns to this ball, after having left it, the time difference ''T'' between successive returns is recorded in a [[histogram]].  This histogram is normalised to sum to unity, to form an estimate of the '''recurrence period density''' function ''P''(''T''). The normalised [[entropy]] of this density:

:&lt;math&gt;H_\mathrm{norm} = -(\ln{T_\max)}^{-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T_\max} P(t) \ln{P(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the RPDE value, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle T_\max&lt;/math&gt; is the largest recurrence value (typically on the order of 1000 samples).&lt;ref name="little07" /&gt; Note that RPDE is intended to be applied to both deterministic and stochastic signals, therefore, strictly speaking, Taken's original embedding theorem does not apply, and needs some modification.&lt;ref name="stark"&gt;J. Stark, D. S. Broomhead, M. E. Davies and J. Huke (2003) Delay Embeddings for Forced Systems. II. Stochastic Forcing. Journal of Nonlinear Science, '''13'''(6):519-577&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RPDE detail.gif|thumb|center|500px|Pictorial description of the calculations required to find the RPDE value. First, the time series is time delay embedded into a reconstructed phase space. Then, around each point in the embedded phase space, a recurrence neighbourhood of radius &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is created. All recurrences into this neighbourhood are tracked, and the time interval ''T'' between recurrences is recorded in a histogram. This histogram is normalised to create an estimate of the recurrence period density function ''P''(''T''). The normalised [[entropy]] of this density is the RPDE value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_\mathrm{norm}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

==RPDE in practice==
RPDE has the ability to detect subtle changes in natural biological time series such as the breakdown of regular periodic oscillation in abnormal cardiac function which are hard to detect using classical signal processing tools such as the [[Fourier transform]] or [[linear prediction]]. The recurrence period density is a '''sparse representation''' for nonlinear, non-Gaussian and nondeterministic signals, whereas the [[Fourier transform]] is only sparse for purely periodic signals.

[[Image:RPDE real.gif|thumb|center|500px|RPDE values &lt;math&gt;H_{norm}&lt;/math&gt; for normal sinus rhythm ECG, and for ECG from a patient with sleep apnoea. The time series (plots with blue traces) and spectra (plots with black traces) are relatively difficult to distinguish, nonetheless, the RPDE values are sufficiently different that detection of the abnormality is straightforward.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3754">Within a set of positive numbers, a number is small if it is close to zero. A number is smaller if it is [[less than]] another number.

Within a set of positive and negative numbers there is ambiguity, because being closer to zero does not correspond to being less, but to being less in [[absolute value]]. Depending on context a negative number may be called "smaller" if it is closer to zero, or if it is more negative.

This article deals with positive numbers, and is also applicable to negative numbers by taking the absolute value.

'''Small numbers''' are [[number]]s that are small compared with the numbers used in everyday life. Very small numbers often occur in fields such as [[chemistry]], [[electronics]] and [[quantum physics]].

== Fractions ==

As soon as systems of [[weights and measures]] were devised, units were subdivided into smaller units: pounds were divided into ounces, pounds into shillings and pence. Beyond the smallest units, there was a need to use [[vulgar fraction]]s to represent even smaller quantities. In systems such as the [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]-[[Arcminute|minutes]]-[[Arcsecond|seconds]] system, it is possible to represent one [[second of arc]], equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {360 \times 60 \times 60} &lt;/math&gt;

of a circle.

== Tiny numbers in science ==

Even smaller numbers are often found in science, which are so small that they are not easily dealt with using fractions. [[Scientific notation]] was created to handle very small and very large numbers. 

Examples of small numbers describing everyday real-world objects are:
* size of a bit on a computer hard disk
* [[Photolithography#Resolution_in_projection_systems|feature size]] of a structure on a [[microprocessor]] chip
* wavelength of [[green]] light:  5.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; m
* period of a 100 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[FM radio|FM]] [[radio]] wave: 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; s
* time taken by light to travel one meter: roughly 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; s
* radius of a [[hydrogen]] atom:  2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; m
* the charge on an [[electron]]: roughly 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; C (negative)
&lt;!-- please add more to this list--&gt; 

Other small numbers are found in [[particle physics]] and [[quantum physics]]:
* size of the [[atomic nucleus]] of a lead atom: 7.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m
* the [[Planck length]]:  1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; m

==Extremely small numbers==
Extremely small numbers can be described through their reciprocals, extremely [[large numbers]]. The notation is similar, with a minus sign at the first level of exponents, e.g. 

&lt;math&gt;10^{\,\!-10^{10^{10^{10^{4.829*10^{183230}}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Infinitesimals ==

Although all these numbers above are very small, they are all still [[real numbers]] greater than zero. Some fields of mathematics define [[infinitesimal]] numbers. An infinitesimal is a number greater than zero yet smaller than any positive real number. 

Infinitesimal numbers were originally developed to create the differential and integral calculus, but were replaced by systems using limits when they were shown to lack [[theoretical rigor]].  More recent work has restored rigor to infinitesimals, making them once more a legitimate mathematical topic (see [[non-standard analysis]]).

Systems of infinitesimals can be generated in the same way as systems of [[transfinite number]]s can be generated.
Some mathematical systems such as [[surreal number]]s and [[hyperreal number]]s generate elaborate systems of infinitesimals with amazing properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22155">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Weierstrass approximation theorem''' states that every [[continuous function]] defined on a closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be [[uniform convergence|uniformly approximated]] as closely as desired by a [[polynomial]] function. Because polynomials are among the simplest functions, and because computers can directly evaluate polynomials, this theorem has both practical and theoretical relevance, especially in [[polynomial interpolation]]. The original version of this result was established by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in [[#Historical works|1885]] using the [[Weierstrass transform]].

[[Marshall H. Stone]] considerably generalized the theorem {{harv|Stone|1937}} and simplified the proof {{harv|Stone|1948}}.  His result is known as the '''Stone–Weierstrass theorem'''. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem generalizes the Weierstrass approximation theorem in two directions both regressive and progressive: instead of the real interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, an arbitrary [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] {{mvar|X}} is considered, and instead of the [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] of polynomial functions, approximation with elements from more general subalgebras of {{math|C(''X'')}} is investigated.  The Stone–Weierstrass theorem is a vital result in the study of the algebra of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space]].

Further, there is a generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem to noncompact [[Tychonoff space]]s, namely, any continuous function on a Tychonoff space is approximated [[compact-open topology|uniformly on compact sets]] by algebras of the type appearing in the Stone–Weierstrass theorem and described below.

A different generalization of Weierstrass' original theorem is [[Mergelyan's theorem]], which generalizes it to functions defined on certain subsets of the [[complex plane]].

== Weierstrass approximation theorem ==
The statement of the approximation theorem as originally discovered by Weierstrass is as follows:

:'''Weierstrass Approximation Theorem.''' Suppose {{math| ''f'' }} is a continuous real-valued function defined on the real interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. For every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, there exists a polynomial {{math|''p''}} such that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, we have {{math|{{!}} ''f'' (''x'') − ''p''(''x''){{!}} &lt; ''ε''}}, or equivalently, the [[supremum norm]] {{math|{{!!}} ''f''  − ''p''{{!!}} &lt; ''ε''}}.

A constructive proof of this theorem using [[Bernstein polynomial]]s is outlined on that page.

=== Applications ===
As a consequence of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, one can show that the space {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} is [[separable space|separable]]: the polynomial functions are dense, and each polynomial function can be uniformly approximated by one with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients; there are only [[countable|countably many]] polynomials with rational coefficients. Since {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and separable it follows that {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} has [[cardinality]] equal to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} — the same cardinality as the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]].  (Remark: This cardinality result also follows from the fact that a continuous function on the reals is uniquely determined by its restriction to the rationals.)

== Stone–Weierstrass theorem, real version ==
The set {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} of continuous real-valued functions on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, together with the supremum norm {{math|{{!!}} ''f'' {{!!}} {{=}} sup&lt;sub&gt;''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''&lt;/sub&gt; {{!}} ''f'' (''x''){{!}}}}, is a [[Banach algebra]], (that is, an [[associative algebra]] and a [[Banach space]] such that {{math|{{!!}} ''fg''{{!!}} ≤ {{!!}} ''f'' {{!!}}·{{!!}}''g''{{!!}}}} for all {{math| ''f'', ''g''}}). The set of all polynomial functions forms a subalgebra of {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} (that is, a [[linear subspace|vector subspace]] of {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} that is closed under multiplication of functions), and the content of the Weierstrass approximation theorem is that this subalgebra is [[Topology Glossary|dense]] in {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}}.

Stone starts with an arbitrary compact Hausdorff space {{mvar|X}} and considers the algebra {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} of real-valued continuous functions on {{mvar|X}}, with the topology of [[uniform convergence]]. He wants to find subalgebras of {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} which are dense. It turns out that the crucial property that a subalgebra must satisfy is that it ''[[separating set|separates points]]'': a set {{mvar|A}} of functions defined on {{mvar|X}} is said to separate points if, for every two different points {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|X}} there exists a function {{mvar|p}} in {{mvar|A}} with {{math|''p''(''x'') ≠ ''p''(''y'')}}. Now we may state:

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (real numbers).''' Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a compact Hausdorff space and {{mvar|A}} is a subalgebra of {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} which contains a non-zero constant function. Then {{mvar|A}} is dense in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} [[if and only if]] it separates points.

This implies Weierstrass’ original statement since the polynomials on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} form a subalgebra of {{math|C[''a'', ''b'']}} which contains the constants and separates points.

=== Locally compact version ===
A version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is also true when {{mvar|X}} is only [[locally compact]]. Let {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}} be the space of real-valued continuous functions on {{mvar|X}} which [[vanish at infinity]]; that is, a continuous function {{math| ''f'' }} is in {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}} if, for every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, there exists a compact set {{math|''K'' ⊂ ''X''}} such that {{math| {{!}} ''f'' {{!}}  &lt; ''ε''}} on {{math|''X''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''K''}}. Again, {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}} is a [[Banach algebra]] with the [[supremum norm]]. A subalgebra {{mvar|A}} of {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}} is said to '''vanish nowhere''' if not all of the elements of {{mvar|A}} simultaneously vanish at a point; that is, for every {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, there is some {{math| ''f'' }} in {{mvar|A}} such that {{math| ''f'' (''x'') ≠ 0}}. The theorem generalizes as follows:

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (locally compact spaces).''' Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a ''locally compact'' Hausdorff space and {{mvar|A}} is a subalgebra of {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}}. Then {{mvar|A}} is dense in {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''')}} (given the topology of [[uniform convergence]]) if and only if it separates points and vanishes nowhere.

This version clearly implies the previous version in the case when {{mvar|X}} is compact, since in that case {{math|C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''R''') {{=}} C(''X'', '''R''')}}. There are also more general versions of the Stone–Weierstrass that weaken the assumption of local compactness.&lt;ref name=Willard&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Willard |title=General Topology |page=293 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-43479-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Stone–Weierstrass theorem can be used to prove the following two statements which go beyond Weierstrass's result.

* If {{math| ''f'' }} is a continuous real-valued function defined on the set {{math|[''a'', ''b''] × [''c'', ''d'']}} and {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}}, then there exists a polynomial function {{mvar|p}} in two variables such that {{math|{{!}} ''f'' (''x'', ''y'') − ''p''(''x'', ''y'') {{!}} &lt; ''ε''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
* If {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are two compact Hausdorff spaces and {{math|''f'' : ''X'' × ''Y'' → '''R'''}} is a continuous function, then for every {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} there exist {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} and continuous functions {{math| ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' }} on {{mvar|X}} and continuous functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on {{mvar|Y}} such that {{math|{{!!}} ''f'' − ∑&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{!!}} &lt; ''ε''}}. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The theorem has many other applications to analysis, including:

* [[Fourier series]]: The set of linear combinations of functions {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''πinx''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''n'' ∈ '''Z'''}} is dense in {{math|C([0, 1]/{0, 1})}}, where we identify the endpoints of the interval {{math|[0, 1]}} to obtain a circle.  An important consequence of this is that the {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are an [[orthonormal basis]] of the space [[Lp space|{{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([0, 1])}}]] of [[square-integrable function]]s on {{math|[0, 1]}}.

== Stone–Weierstrass theorem, complex version ==
Slightly more general is the following theorem, where we consider the algebra {{math|C(''X'', '''C''')}} of complex-valued continuous functions on the compact space {{mvar|X}}, again with the topology of uniform convergence. This is a [[C*-algebra]] with the *-operation given by pointwise [[complex conjugation]].

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (complex numbers).''' Let {{mvar|X}} be a compact Hausdorff space and let {{mvar|S}} be a subset of {{math|C(''X'', '''C''')}} which [[separating set|separates points]]. Then the complex [[unital algebra|unital]] [[*-algebra]] generated by {{mvar|S}} is dense in {{math|C(''X'', '''C''')}}.

The complex unital *-algebra generated by {{mvar|S}} consists of all those functions that can be obtained from the elements of {{mvar|S}} by throwing in the constant function {{math|1}} and adding them, multiplying them, conjugating them, or multiplying them with complex scalars, and repeating finitely many times.

This theorem implies the real version, because if a sequence of complex-valued functions uniformly approximate a given function {{math| ''f'' }}, then the real parts of those functions uniformly approximate the real part of {{math| ''f'' }}.  As in the real case, an analog of this theorem is true for locally compact Hausdorff spaces.

== Stone–Weierstrass theorem, quaternion version ==
Following {{harvtxt|John C.Holladay|1957}} : consider the algebra {{math|C(''X'', '''H''')}} of quaternion-valued continuous functions on the compact space {{mvar|X}}, again with the topology of uniform convergence. If a quaternion ''q'' is written in the form ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ib'';+&amp;nbsp;''jc''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''kd'' then the '''scalar part''' a is the '''real number''' (''q''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''iqi''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''jqj''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''kqk'')/4. Likewise being the '''scalar part''' of −''qi'', −''qj'' and −''qk'' : b,c and d are respectively the '''real numbers''' (−''qi''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''iq''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''jqk''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''kqj'')/4,
(−''qj''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''iqk''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''jq''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''kqi'')/4 and (−''qk''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iqj''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''jqk''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''kq'')/4.  Then we may state :

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (quaternion numbers).''' Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a compact Hausdorff space and {{mvar|A}} is a subalgebra of {{math|C(''X'', '''H''')}} which contains a non-zero constant function. Then {{mvar|A}} is dense in {{math|C(''X'', '''H''')}} if and only if it [[separating set|separates points]].

== Stone–Weierstrass theorem, C*-algebra version ==
The space of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space ''X'' i.e. C(''X'', '''C''') is the canonical example of a unital [[C*-algebra#Commutative C.2A-algebras|commutative C*-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;. The space ''X'' may be viewed as the space of pure states on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;, with the weak-* topology. Following the above cue, a non-commutative extension of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which has remain unsolved, is as follows:

:'''Conjecture.''' If a unital [[C*-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a C*-subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; which separates the pure states of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A} = \mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1960, Jim Glimm proved a weaker version of the above conjecture.

:'''Stone–Weierstrass theorem (C*-algebras).'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James |last=Glimm |authorlink=James Glimm |title=A Stone–Weierstrass Theorem for C*-algebras |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series |volume=72 |issue=2 |year=1960 |pages=216–244 [Theorem 1] |jstor=1970133 |doi=10.2307/1970133}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a unital C*-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a C*-subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; which separates the pure state space (i.e. the weak-* closure of the pure states) of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{A}= \mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Lattice versions ==
Let {{mvar|X}} be a compact Hausdorff space. Stone's original proof of the theorem used the idea of [[lattice (order)|lattices]] in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}}.  A subset {{mvar|L}} of {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} is called a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] if for any two elements {{math| ''f'', ''g'' ∈ ''L''}}, the functions {{math|max{ ''f'', ''g''}, min{ ''f'', ''g''} }}also belong to {{mvar|L}}. The lattice version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem states:

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (lattices).''' Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and {{mvar|L}} is a lattice in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} with the property that for any two distinct elements {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} of {{mvar|X}} and any two real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} there exists an element {{math| ''f''  ∈ ''L''}} with {{math| ''f'' (''x'') {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math| ''f'' (''y'') {{=}} ''b''}}. Then {{mvar|L}} is dense in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}}.

The above versions of Stone–Weierstrass can be proven from this version once one realizes that the lattice property can also be formulated using the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''f'' {{!}}}} which in turn can be approximated by polynomials in {{math| ''f'' }}. A variant of the theorem applies to linear subspaces of {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} closed under max {{harv|Hewitt|Stromberg|1965|loc=Theorem 7.29}}:

:'''Stone–Weierstrass Theorem.''' Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a compact Hausdorff space and {{mvar|B}} is a family of functions in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}} such that
:# {{mvar|B}} separates points.
:# {{mvar|B}} contains the constant function 1.
:# If {{math| ''f''  ∈ ''B''}} then {{math|''af''  ∈ ''B''}} for all constants {{math|''a'' ∈ '''R'''}}.
:# If {{math| ''f'',  ''g'' ∈ ''B''}}, then {{math| ''f''  + ''g'', max{ ''f'', ''g''} ∈ ''B''}}.
:Then {{mvar|B}} is dense in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}}.

More precise information is available:

:Suppose {{mvar|X}} is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and {{mvar|L}} is a lattice in {{math|C(''X'', '''R''')}}. The function {{math|''φ'' ∈ C(''X'', '''R''')}} belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of {{mvar|L}} if and only if for each pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in {{mvar|X}} and for each {{math|''ε'' &gt; 0}} there exists some {{math| ''f''  ∈ ''L''}} for which {{math|{{!}} ''f'' (''x'') − ''φ''(''x''){{!}} &lt; ''ε''}} and {{math|{{!}} ''f'' (''y'') − ''φ''(''y''){{!}} &lt; ''ε''}}.

== Bishop's theorem ==
Another generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is due to [[Errett Bishop]].  Bishop's theorem is as follows {{harv|Bishop|1961}}:

:Let {{mvar|A}} be a closed subalgebra of the [[Banach space]] {{math|C(''X'', '''C''')}} of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space {{mvar|X}}.  Suppose that {{math| ''f''  ∈ C(''X'', '''C''')}} has the following property:
:: {{math| ''f'' {{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for every maximal set {{math|''S'' ⊂ ''X''}} such that all real functions of {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are constant.
:Then {{math| ''f''  ∈ ''A''}}.

{{harvtxt|Glicksberg|1962}} gives a short proof of Bishop's theorem using the [[Krein–Milman theorem]] in an essential way, as well as the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] : the process of {{harvtxt|Louis de Branges|1959}}.  See also {{harvtxt|Rudin|1973|loc=§5.7}}.

== Nachbin's theorem ==
Nachbin's theorem gives an analog for Stone–Weierstrass theorem for algebras of complex valued smooth functions on a smooth manifold {{harv|Nachbin|1949}}. Nachbin's theorem is as follows {{harv|Llavona|1986}}:

:Let {{mvar|A}} be a subalgebra of the algebra {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}} of smooth functions on a finite dimensional smooth manifold {{mvar|M}}. Suppose that {{mvar|A}} separates the points of {{mvar|M}} and also separates the tangent vectors of {{mvar|M}}: for each point ''m'' ∈ ''M'' and tangent vector ''v'' at the tangent space at ''m'', there is a ''f'' ∈ {{mvar|A}} such that d''f''(''x'')(''v'') ≠ 0. Then {{mvar|A}} is dense in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'')}}.

== See also ==
*[[Müntz–Szász theorem]].
* [[Bernstein polynomial]].
* [[Runge's phenomenon]] shows that finding a polynomial {{mvar|P}} such that {{math| ''f'' (''x'') {{=}} ''P''(''x'')}} for some finely spaced {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a bad way to attempt to find a polynomial approximating {{math| ''f'' }} uniformly.  However, as is shown in [[Walter Rudin]]'s Principles of Mathematical Analysis, one can easily find a polynomial {{mvar|P}} uniformly approximating {{math| ''f'' }} by convolving {{math| ''f'' }} with a polynomial kernel.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">In [[mathematics]], a '''sum-free sequence''' is an increasing [[positive integer]] [[sequence]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\{n_k\}_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; 

such that for each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; cannot be represented as a sum of any subset of the preceding elements of the same sequence. 

The definition of sum-free sequence is different of that of [[sum-free set]], because in a sum-free set only the sums of two elements must be avoided, while a sum-free sequence must avoid sums of larger sets of elements as well.

==Example==
The [[power of two|powers of two]],
:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
form a sum-free sequence: each term in the sequence is one more than the sum of all preceding terms, and so cannot be represented as a sum of preceding terms.

==Sums of reciprocals==
A set of integers is said to be [[Small set (combinatorics)|small]] if the sum of its [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s converges to a finite value. For instance, by the [[prime number theorem]], the [[prime number]]s are not small. {{harvs|first=Paul|last=Erdős|authorlink=Paul Erdős|year=1962|txt}} proved that every sum-free sequence is small, and asked how large the sum of reciprocals could be. For instance, the sum of the reciprocals of the powers of two (a [[geometric series]]) is two.

If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denotes the maximum sum of reciprocals of a sum-free sequence, then through subsequent research it is known that &lt;math&gt;2.0654 &lt; R &lt; 2.8570&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Levine|O'Sullivan|1977}}; {{harvtxt|Abbott|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Yang|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Chen|2013}}; {{harvtxt|Yang|2015}}; .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Density==
It follows from the fact that sum-free sequences are small that they have zero [[Schnirelmann density]]; that is, if &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the number of sequence elements that are less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A(x)=o(x)&lt;/math&gt;. {{harvtxt|Erdős|1962}} showed that for every sum-free sequence there exists an unbounded sequence of numbers &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A(x_i)=O(x^{\varphi-1})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]], and he exhibited a sum-free sequence for which, for all values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\Omega(x^{2/7})&lt;/math&gt;, subsequently improved to &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\Omega(x^{1/3})&lt;/math&gt; by Deshouillers, Erdős and Melfi in 1999 and to  &lt;math&gt;A(x)=\Omega(x^{1/2-\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt; by Luczak and Schoen in 2000, who also proved that the exponent ''1/2'' cannot be furthermore improved.

'''''The Beauty of Fractals''''' is a 1986 book by [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Peter Richter]] which publicises the fields of [[Dynamical system|complex dynamics]], [[chaos theory]] and the concept of [[fractal]]s. It is lavishly illustrated and as a mathematics book became an unusual success.

The book includes a total of 184 illustrations, including 88 full-colour pictures of Julia sets. Although the format suggests a [[coffee table book]], the discussion of the background of the presented images addresses some sophisticated mathematics which would not be found in popular science books. In 1987 the book won an Award for distinguished technical communication.

== Summary ==

The books starts with a general introduction to [[Dynamical system|Complex Dynamics]], [[Chaos theory|Chaos]] and  [[fractal]]s. In particular the [[Mitchell Feigenbaum|Feigenbaum]]  scenario and the relation to [[Julia set]]s and the [[Mandelbrot set]] is discussed. The following special sections provide in depth detail for the shown images: Verhulst Dynamics, Julia Sets and Their Computergraphical Generation, Sullivan's Classification of Critical Points, The Mandelbrot Set, External Angles and Hubbard Trees, Newton's Method for Complex Polynomials: Cayley's Problem, Newtons's Method for Real Equations, A Discrete Volterra-Lotka System, Yang-Lee Zeros, Renormalization (Magnetism and Complex Boundaries).

The book also includes invited Contributions by  [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], [[Adrien Douady]], Gert Eilenberger and [[Herbert W. Franke]], which provide additional formality and some historically interesting detail. Benoit Mandelbrot gives a very personal account of his discovery of fractals in general and the fractal named after him in particular. Adrien Douady explains the solved and unsolved problems relating to the almost amusingly complex Mandelbrot set.

== The images ==

Part of the text was originally conceived as a supplemented catalogue to the exhibition [[Frontiers of Chaos]] of the German Goethe-Institut, first seen in Europe and the United States. It described the context and meaning of these images. The images were created at the "Computer Graphics Laboratory Dynamical Systems" at the University of Bremen in 1984 and 1985. Dedicated software had to be developed to make the necessary computations which at that time took hours of computer time to create a single image. For the exhibit and the book the computed images had to be captured as photographs. Digital image capturing and archiving were not feasible at that time.

The book was cited and its images were reproduced in a number of publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Glieck |first=James |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London |isbn= |pages=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fractals: The Patterns of Chaos.

The cover article of the ''Scientific American'' August 1985 edition showed some the images and provided reference to the book to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A computer microscope zooms in for a close look at the most complicated object in mathematics |last=Dewdney |first=A.K. |authorlink= |date=Aug 1985 |publisher=Scientific American |location= |pages=16&amp;ndash;24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular image sequence of the book is the close up series "seahorse valley". While the first publication of such a close up series was the June 1984 cover article of the Magazine ''Geo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Matematik: Die unendliche Reise |last=Peitgen |first=Heinz-Otto |author2=Richter, Peter  |date=June 1984 |publisher=Geo Verlag Gruner + Jahr AG |location=Hamburg |pages=100&amp;ndash;124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Beauty of Fractals'' provided the first such publication within a book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">In the [[mathematics|mathematical fields]] of the [[calculus of variations]] and [[differential geometry]], the '''variational vector field''' is a certain type of [[vector field]] defined on the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[differentiable manifold]] which gives rise to variations along a vector field in the manifold itself.

Specifically, let ''X'' be a vector field on ''M''.  Then ''X'' generates a [[one-parameter group]] of [[local diffeomorphism]]s ''Fl''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[vector flow|flow]] along ''X''.  The [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] of ''Fl''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; gives, for each ''t'', a mapping

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathrm{Fl}_X^t : TM \to TM &lt;/math&gt;

where ''TM'' denotes the tangent bundle of ''M''.  This is a one-parameter group of local diffeomorphisms of the tangent bundle.  The variational vector field of ''X'', denoted by ''T''(''X'') is the tangent to the flow of ''d Fl''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8293">In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's conjecture''' concerns a relation between the [[domination number]] and the [[cartesian product of graphs]]. 
This conjecture was first stated by {{harvs|first=Vadim G.|last=Vizing|authorlink=Vadim G. Vizing|year=1968|txt}}, and states that, if γ(''G'') denotes the minimum number of vertices in a dominating set for ''G'', then

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma(G\,\Box\,H) \ge \gamma(G)\gamma(H). \, &lt;/math&gt;

{{harvtxt|Gravier|Khelladi|1995}} conjectured a similar bound for the domination number of the [[tensor product of graphs]]; however, a counterexample was found by {{harvtxt|Klavžar|Zmazek|1996}}. Since Vizing proposed his conjecture, many mathematicians have worked on it, with partial results described below. For a more detailed overview of these results, see {{harvtxt|Brešar|Dorbec|Goddard|Hartnell|2012}}.

== Examples ==
[[File:Star product domination.svg|thumb|240px|An optimal five-vertex dominating set in the product of two stars, &lt;math&gt;K_{1,4}\,\Box\,K_{1,4}&lt;/math&gt;. Examples such as this one show that, for some graph products, Vizing's conjecture can be far from tight.]]
A 4-[[cycle graph|cycle]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has domination number two: any single vertex only dominates itself and its two neighbors, but any pair of vertices dominates the whole graph. The product &lt;math&gt;C_4 \,\Box\,C_4&lt;/math&gt; is a four-dimensional [[hypercube graph]]; it has 16 vertices, and any single vertex can only dominate itself and four neighbors, so three vertices could only dominate 15 of the 16 vertices. Therefore, at least four vertices are required to dominate the entire graph, the bound given by Vizing's conjecture.

It is possible for the domination number of a product to be much larger than the bound given by Vizing's conjecture. For instance, for a [[star (graph theory)|star]] K&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, its domination number γ(K&lt;sub&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is one: it is possible to dominate the entire star with a single vertex at its hub. Therefore, for the graph &lt;math&gt; G = K_{1,n}\,\Box\,K_{1,n} &lt;/math&gt; formed as the product of two stars, Vizing's conjecture states only that the domination number should be at least 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. However, the domination number of this graph is actually much higher. It has ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices: ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; formed from the product of a leaf in both factors, 2''n'' from the product of a leaf in one factor and the hub in the other factor, and one remaining vertex formed from the product of the two hubs. Each leaf-hub product vertex in ''G'' dominates exactly ''n'' of the leaf-leaf vertices, so ''n'' leaf-hub vertices are needed to dominate all of the leaf-leaf vertices. However, no leaf-hub vertex dominates any other such vertex, so even after ''n'' leaf-hub vertices are chosen to be included in the dominating set, there remain ''n'' more undominated leaf-hub vertices, which can be dominated by the single hub-hub vertex. Thus, the domination number of this graph is &lt;math&gt; \gamma(K_{1,n}\,\Box\,K_{1,n}) = n+1 &lt;/math&gt; far higher than the trivial bound of one given by Vizing's conjecture.

There exist infinite families of graph products for which the bound of Vizing's conjecture is exactly met.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Payan|Xuong|1982}}; {{harvtxt|Fink|Jacobson|Kinch|Roberts|1985}}; {{harvtxt|Jacobson|Kinch|1986}}; {{harvtxt|Hartnell|Rall|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if ''G'' and ''H'' are both connected graphs, each having at least four vertices and having exactly twice as many total vertices as their domination numbers, then &lt;math&gt; \gamma(G\,\Box\,H)=\gamma(G)\gamma(H)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="fjkr"&gt;{{harvtxt|Fink|Jacobson|Kinch|Roberts|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphs ''G'' and ''H'' with this property consist of the four-vertex cycle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; together with the [[rooted product of graphs|rooted products]] of a connected graph and a single edge.&lt;ref name="fjkr"/&gt;

==Partial results==

Clearly, the conjecture holds when either ''G'' or ''H'' has domination number one: for, the product contains an isomorphic copy of the other factor, dominating which requires at least γ(''G'')γ(''H'') vertices.

Vizing's conjecture is also known to hold for cycles&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|Kinch|1986}}; {{harvtxt|El-Zahar|Pareek|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for graphs with domination number two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barcalkin|German|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Clark|Suen|2000}} proved that the domination number of the product is at least half as large as the conjectured bound, for all ''G'' and ''H''.

==Upper bounds==

{{harvtxt|Vizing|1968}} observed that

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma(G \,\Box\, H) \le \min\{\gamma(G) |V(H)|,\gamma(H)|V(G)|\}. &lt;/math&gt;

A dominating set meeting this bound may be formed as the cartesian product of a dominating set in one of ''G'' or ''H'' with the set of all vertices in the other graph.

{{technical|date=December 2014}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''word problem''' for a set S with respect to a system of finite encodings of its elements is the [[decision problem|algorithmic problem of deciding]] whether two given representatives represent the same element of the set. The problem is commonly encountered in [[abstract algebra]], where given a presentation of an algebraic structure by [[generating set|generators]] and [[relator]]s, the problem is to determine if two expressions represent the same element; a prototypical example is the [[word problem for groups]]. Less formally, the word problem in an algebra is: given a set of identities ''E'', and two expressions ''x'' and ''y'', is it possible to transform ''x'' into ''y'' using the identities in ''E'' as [[rewriting]] rules in both directions? While answering this question may not seem hard, the remarkable (and [[deep result|deep]]) result that emerges, in many important cases, is that the [[undecidable problem|problem is undecidable]].

Many, if not most all, undecidable problems in mathematics can be posed as word problems; see the [[list of undecidable problems]] for many examples.

== Background and motivation ==

Many occasions arise in mathematics where one wishes to use a finite amount of information to describe an element of a (typically infinite) set. This issue is particularly apparent in computational mathematics. Traditional models of computation (such as the [[Turing machine]]) have storage capacity which is unbounded, so it is in principle possible to perform computations with the elements of infinite sets. On the other hand, since the amount of storage space in use at any one time is finite, we need each element to have a finite  representation.

For various reasons, it is not always possible or desirable to use a system of ''unique'' encodings, that is, one in which every element has a single encoding. When using an encoding system without uniqueness, the question naturally arises of whether there is an algorithm which, given as input two encodings, decides whether they represent the same element. Such an algorithm is called a ''solution to the word problem'' for the encoding system.

== The word problem in combinatorial calculus ==
{{main | Combinatory logic#Undecidability of combinatorial calculus}}
The simplest example of an undecidable word problem occurs in [[combinatory logic]]: when are two strings of combinators equivalent? Because combinators encode all possible [[Turing machine]]s, and the equivalence of two Turing machines is undecidable, it follows that the equivalence of two strings of combinators is undecidable.

Likewise, one has essentially the same problem in (untyped) [[lambda calculus]]: given two distinct lambda expressions, there is no algorithm which can discern whether they are equivalent or not; [[Lambda calculus#Undecidability of equivalence|equivalence is undecidable]]. For several typed variants of the lambda calculus, equivalence is decidable by comparison of normal forms.

== The word problem in universal algebra ==

In [[algebra]], one often studies infinite algebras which are generated (under the [[finitary]] operations of the algebra) by finitely many elements. In this case, the elements of the algebra have a natural system of finite encoding as expressions in terms of the generators and operations. The word problem here is thus to determine, given two such expressions, whether they represent the same element of the algebra.

Roughly speaking, the word problem in an algebra is: given a set ''E'' of identities (an [[equational theory]]), and two [[Term (logic)|terms]] ''s'' and ''t'', is it possible to transform ''s'' into ''t'' using the identities in ''E'' as [[rewriting]] rules in both directions?.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Baader]] and [[Tobias Nipkow]], ''Term Rewriting and All That'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--- wrong: The act of discovering such equivalences is known as [[unification (computer science)|unification]]. ---&gt;
A proper extension of the ''word problem'' is known as the ''[[unification (computer science)|unification problem]]'' (a.k.a. the ''equation solving problem'').
While the former asks whether two terms ''are'' equal, the latter asks whether they have ''instances'' that are equal.
As a common example, "&lt;math&gt;2 + 3 \stackrel{?}{=} 8 + (-3)&lt;/math&gt;" is a word problem in the [[Integer#Algebraic properties|integer group ℤ]],
while "&lt;math&gt;2 + x \stackrel{?}{=} 8 + (-x)&lt;/math&gt;" is a unification problem in the same group; since the former terms happen to be equal in ℤ, the latter problem has the [[substitution (logic)|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;\{x \mapsto 3\}&lt;/math&gt; as a solution.

Substitutions may be ordered into a [[partial order]], thus, unification is the act of finding a [[join and meet|join]] on a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. {{clarify|reason=In which lattice precisely? Unification maps two terms to a substitution, while term lattice meet maps two terms to a term, and substitution lattice meet maps two substitutions to a substitution.|date=July 2013}}
In this sense, the word problem on a lattice has a solution, namely, the set of all equivalent words is the [[free lattice]].{{clarify|reason=The solution of a word problem was explained above to be an algorithm, not a set.|date=June 2013}}

One of the most deeply studied cases of the word problem is in the theory of [[semigroup]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. 
There are [[word problem for groups|many groups for which the word problem]] is not [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], in that there is no Turing machine that can determine the equivalence of two ''arbitrary'' words in a finite time.

The word problem on [[ground term]]s is not decidable.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Matijasevich, (1967) "Simple examples of undecidable associative calculi", ''Soviet Mathematics - Doklady'' '''8'''(2) pp 555–557.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=In which algebra? It is certainly decidable in ℤ|date=June 2013}}

The word problem on free [[Heyting algebra]]s is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Johnstone, ''Stone Spaces'', (1982) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, {{isbn|0-521-23893-5}}. ''(See chapter 1, paragraph 4.11)''&lt;/ref&gt;  
The only known results are that the free Heyting algebra on one generator is infinite, and that the free [[complete Heyting algebra]] on one generator exists (and has one more element than the free Heyting algebra).

==Example: A term rewriting system to decide the word problem in the free group==

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Deduktionsssysteme| year=1992| pages=291| publisher=Oldenbourg| editor=K. H. Bläsius and H.-J. Bürckert| accessdate=30 June 2013}}; here: p.126, 134&lt;/ref&gt;
demonstrate the [[Knuth–Bendix algorithm]] on an axiom set for groups. 
The algorithm yields a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] and [[Abstract rewriting system#Termination and convergence|noetherian]] [[rewrite system#Term rewriting systems|term rewrite system]] that transforms every term into a unique [[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]].&lt;ref&gt;Apply rules in any order to a term, as long as possible; the result doesn't depend on the order; it is the term's normal form.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The rewrite rules are numbered incontiguous since some rules became redundant and were deleted during the algorithm run.
The equality of two terms follows from the axioms if and only if both terms are transformed into literally the same normal form term. For example, the terms
:&lt;math&gt;((a^{-1} \cdot a) \cdot (b \cdot b^{-1}))^{-1} \stackrel{R2}{\rightsquigarrow} (1 \cdot (b \cdot b^{-1}))^{-1} \stackrel{R13}{\rightsquigarrow} (1 \cdot 1)^{-1} \stackrel{R1}{\rightsquigarrow} 1 ^{-1} \stackrel{R8}{\rightsquigarrow} 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;b \cdot ((a \cdot b)^{-1} \cdot a) \stackrel{R17}{\rightsquigarrow} b \cdot ((b^{-1} \cdot a^{-1}) \cdot a) \stackrel{R3}{\rightsquigarrow} b \cdot (b^{-1} \cdot (a^{-1} \cdot a)) \stackrel{R2}{\rightsquigarrow} b \cdot (b^{-1} \cdot 1) \stackrel{R11}{\rightsquigarrow} b \cdot b^{-1} \stackrel{R13}{\rightsquigarrow} 1&lt;/math&gt;
share the same normal form, viz. &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;; therefore both terms are equal in every group.
As another example, the term &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot (a \cdot b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot (1 \cdot a)&lt;/math&gt; has the normal form &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Since the normal forms are literally different, the original terms cannot be equal in every group. In fact, they are usually different in [[abelian group|non-abelian groups]].
