      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43877">In [[ballistics]], the '''ballistic coefficient''' ('''BC''') of a body is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 0705.0389|last1 = Courtney|first1 = Michael|title = The Truth About Ballistic Coefficients|last2 = Courtney|first2 = Amy|class = physics.pop-ph|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is [[inversely proportional]] to the negative acceleration: a high number indicates a low negative acceleration—the drag on the vehicle or projectile&lt;!-- or, could say just "body"; but should not say merely "projectile" because this coefficient is not limited merely to projectiles --&gt; is small in proportion to its mass.

==Formulae==

===General===
:&lt;math&gt;BC_{Physics} = \frac{M}{C_d \cdot A} = \frac{\rho \cdot \ell}{C_d}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*''BC&lt;sub&gt;Physics&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ballistic coefficient as used in physics and engineering
*''M'' = mass
*''A'' = cross-sectional area
*''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [[drag coefficient]]
*''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' = [[density]]
*''&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;'' = characteristic body length

===Ballistics===
The formula for calculating the ballistic coefficient for small and large arms projectiles ''only'' is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;BC_{Projectile} = \frac{m}{ d^2 \cdot i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moss, Leeming and Farrar| title = Brassey's Land Warfare Series: Military Ballistics | publisher = Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, UK | year = 1995 |page=86 | isbn = 978-1857530841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:
*''BC&lt;sub&gt;Projectile&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ballistic coefficient as used in point mass trajectory from the Siacci method (less than 20 degrees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cline | first = Donna | title = Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 "Atmosphere" | publisher = Lattie Stone Ballistics | year = 2002 | page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''m'' = mass of bullet
*''d'' = measured cross section (diameter) of projectile 
*''i'' = Coefficient of form

The Coefficient of form (''i'') can be derived by 6 methods and applied differently depending on the  trajectory models used: G Model, Beugless/Coxe; 3 Sky Screen; 4 Sky Screen; Target Zeroing; Doppler radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cline | first = Donna | title = Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 "Atmosphere" | publisher = Lattie Stone Ballistics | year = 2002 | pages=43–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rinker 1999 176"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rinker | first = Robert A.  | title = Understanding Firearm Ballistics; 3rd Edition | publisher = Mulberry House Publishing | year = 1999 |page=176 | isbn = 978-0964559844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are several methods to compute '''''i''''' or '''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''':
:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac{2}{n} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{4n-1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Cline 2002 44"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cline | first = Donna | title = Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 "Atmosphere" | publisher = Lattie Stone Ballistics | year = 2002 | page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rinker 1999 176"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Textbook of Small Arms 1909'' (1909). Great Britain. War Office H.M. Stationery Office. {{ISBN|978-1847914217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:
*''i'' = Coefficient of form. 
*''n'' = number of calibers of the projectile's [[ogive]].

:Where ''n''  is unknown:

::&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{(4 \cdot \ell^2 + 1)}{4}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Cline 2002 44"/&gt;

::Where:
:*''n'' = number of calibers of the projectile's ogive.
:*𝓁 = length of the head (ogive) in number of calibers.

'''or'''

A drag coefficient can also be calculated mathematically: 
:&lt;math&gt; C_{d}= \frac{8}{ \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot \pi \cdot d^2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moss | first =  Leeming and Farrar| title = Brassey's Land Warfare Series: Military Ballistics | publisher = Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, UK | location = Reading | year = 1995 |page=79 | isbn = 978-1857530841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:
*''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' = drag coefficient.
*''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' = density of the projectile.
*''v'' = projectile velocity at range.
* ''[[π]] (pi) ≈ 3.14159
*''d'' = measured cross section (diameter) of projectile

'''or'''

From standard physics as applied to “G” models:
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{C_{p}}{C_{G}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

Where:
*''i'' = Coefficient of form. 
*''C&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  drag coefficient of 1.00 from any “G” model, reference drawing, projectile.&lt;ref&gt;''Reference Notes for Use in the Course in Gunnery and Ammunition'' (1917). Coast Artillery School U.S. Army, p12. ASIN B00E0UERI2&lt;/ref&gt;
*''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = drag coefficient of the actual test projectile at range.

===Commercial Use===
This formula is for calculating the ballistic coefficient within the smalls arms shooting community, but is redundant with '''''BC&lt;sub&gt;Projectile&lt;/sub&gt;''''':
:&lt;math&gt;BC_{Smallarms} = \frac{SD}{i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Berger Bullets Reloading Manual 1st Edition'' (2012), Berger Bullets LLC, p814&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:
*''BC&lt;sub&gt;Smallarms&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Ballistic coefficient  
*''SD'' = [[Sectional density]]
*''i'' = Coefficient of form (form factor &lt;ref&gt;''Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading:Rifle,Pistol Vol. II'' (1973)| Hornady Manufacturing Company, Fourth Printing July 1978, p505&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
===Background===
In 1537,  [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]  did some test firing to determine the maximum angle and range for a [[Projectile|shot]]. His conclusion was near 45 degrees. He noted that the shot [[trajectory]] was continuously [[Parabola|curved]].&lt;ref name=historical&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030808194718/http://www.exteriorballistics.com/ebexplained/4th/30.cfm Historical Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, [[Galileo Galilei]] published results in "Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences". He found that a falling body had a constant [[acceleration]]. This allowed Galileo to show that a bullet's trajectory was a curve.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo, Galilei, ''Dialogues Concerning Two New Science'' , 2010; p. Fourth Day , THE MOTION OF PROJECTILES, Digireads.com {{ISBN|978-1420938159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

Circa 1665, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] derived the [[Drag (physics)|law of air resistance]]. Newton's experiments on drag were through air and fluids. He showed that drag on shot increases proportionately with the density of the air (or the fluid), cross sectional area, and the square of the speed.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt; Newton's experiments were only at low velocities to about {{convert|260|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Bashforth, Francis p. 1"&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; p. 1, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William and Robert Cambers; ''CHAMBERS'S ENCYCLOPAEDIA Vol. VIII'', 1891; p. 438, J.B. Lippincott, USA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pejsa, Arthur, ''New Exact Small Arms Ballistics: The Source Book for Riflemen'', 2008; p. 29,  Kenwood Publishing {{ISBN|978-0974990262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1718, [[John Keill]] challenged the Continental Mathematica, ''“To find the curve that a projectile may describe in the air, on behalf of the  simplest assumption of [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]], and the [[density]] of the medium uniform, on the other hand, in the duplicate ratio of the [[velocity]] of the resistance”''. This challenge supposes that air resistance increases exponentially to the velocity of a projectile.{{vn|date=September 2017}} Keill gave no solution for his challenge. [[Johann Bernoulli]]{{clarify|post-text=The Bernouilli equation is credited to Jacob Bernouilli|date=September 2017}} took up this challenge and soon thereafter solved the problem and air resistance varied as “any power”{{vn|date=November 2017}} of velocity;{{clarify|post-text=It is said above that air resistance was supposed to increase exponentially with velocity.|date=September 2017}} known as the [[Bernoulli differential equation|Bernoulli equation]].{{vn|date=September 2017}} This is the precursor to the concept of the “standard projectile”.&lt;ref name="Bashforth, Francis p. 1"/&gt;

In 1742, [[Benjamin Robins]] invented the [[ballistic pendulum]]. This was  a simple mechanical device that could measure a projectile's velocity. Robins reported muzzle velocities ranging from {{convert|1400|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1700|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. In his book published that same year “New Principles of Gunnery”, he uses numerical integration from [[Euler method|Euler's method]] and found that air resistance varies as the square of the velocity, but insisted that it changes at the [[speed of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pp. 4, 6, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pejsa, Arthur, ''Modern Practical Ballistics 2nd Edition'', 1991; p. 6,  Kenwood Publishing {{ISBN|978-0961277635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1753, [[Leonhard Euler]]  showed how a theoretical trajectories might be calculated using his method as applied to the Bernoulli equation, but only for resistance varying as the square of the velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pg 6, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, the [[Gun chronograph|Electro-ballistic chronograph]] was invented and by 1867 the electro-ballistic chronograph was accurate to within one ten millionth of a second.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; p. 13, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test Firing===
Many countries and their militaries carried out test firings from the mid eighteenth century on using large [[ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] to determine the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] characteristics of each individual projectile. These individual test firings were logged and reported in extensive ballistics tables.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pp. 5–11, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 39"&gt;Cline, Donna, ''Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 “Atmosphere" The “Point-Mass Trajectory: The Siacci Method Ballistic Coefficient'', 2002; p. 39, Lattie Stone Ballistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the test firing, most notably were: Francis Bashforth at Woolwich Marshes &amp; Shoeburyness, England  (1864-1889) with velocities to {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} and M. Krupp (1865–1880) of [[Krupp|Friedrich Krupp AG]] at Meppen, Germany, Friedrich Krupp AG continued these test firings to 1930; to a lesser extent General Nikolai V. Mayevski, then a Colonel (1868–1869) at St. Petersburg, Russia; the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre (1873 to 1889)  at Le Gâvre, France with velocities to {{convert|1830|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} and The [[Royal Artillery|British Royal Artillery]] (1904–1906).&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; p. Protest, 1, H.M Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pp. 13, 135, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; pp. 18,19, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Donna, ''Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 “Atmosphere" The “Point-Mass Trajectory: The Siacci Method Ballistic Coefficient'', 2002; p. 39–40, Lattie Stone Ballistics&lt;/ref&gt;

The test projectiles (shot) used, vary from [[spherical]], [[spheroidal]], [[Ogive|ogival]]; being hollow, solid and cored in design with the elongated ogival-headed projectiles having 1, 1½, 2 and 3 [[caliber]] [[Radius|radii]]. These projectiles varied in size from, {{convert|75|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kg|lbs|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|254|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|187|kg|lbs|1|abbr=on}} &lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; pp. 3–4, H.M Majesty's Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pp. 36, 135, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingalls, James M. p. 19"&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; p. 19, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods and the Standard Projectile===
Many militaries up until the 1860s used [[calculus]] to compute projectile trajectory. The numerical computations necessary to calculate just a single trajectory was lengthy, tedious and done by hand. So, investigations to develop a theoretical drag model began. The investigations led to a major simplification in the experimental treatment of drag. This was the concept of a “standard projectile”. The ballistic tables are made up for a [[Artificiality|factitious]] projectile being defined as: "a factitious weight and with a specific shape and specific dimensions in a ratio of calibers." This simplifies calculation for the ballistic coefficient of a standard model projectile, which could mathematically move through the [[Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] with the same ability as any actual projectile could move through the actual atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; p. 8, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coast Artillery School Press p. 12"&gt;Coast Artillery School Press, ''Reference Notes for Use in the Course in Gunnery and Ammunition'', 1917; p. 12, Coast Artillery School, ASIN:B00E0UERI2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

====The Bashforth Method====
In 1870, Bashforth publishes a report containing his ballistic tables. Bashforth found that the drag of his test projectiles varied with the square of  velocity (v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) from {{convert|830|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|430|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} and with the cube of velocity (v&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) from {{convert|1000|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|830|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. As of his 1880 report, he found that drag varied by v&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  from {{convert|1100|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1040|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. Bashforth used [[Rifling|rifled]] guns of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}};  smooth-bore guns of similar caliber for firing spherical shot and howitzers propelled elongated projectiles having an ogival-head of 1½ caliber radius.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; p. 4, H.M Majesty's Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pp. 135–136, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ingalls, James M. p. 19"/&gt;

Bashforth uses ''b'' as the variable for ballistic coefficient.  When ''b'' is equal to or less than v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''b'' is equal to ''P'' for the drag of a projectile. It would be found that air does not deflect off the front of a projectile in the same direction, when there are of differing shapes. This prompted the introduction of a second factor to ''b'', the coefficient of form (''i''). This is particularly true at high velocities, greater than {{convert|830|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. Hence, Bashforth introduced the “undetermined multiplier” of any power called the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; [[Factor graph|factor]] that compensate for this unknown effects of drag above {{convert|830|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}; &lt;math&gt;k &gt; i &lt;/math&gt;.  Bashforth then integrated &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;K_v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; pp. 3,5–6, H.M Majesty's Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashforth, Francis p. 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; pp. 7–8, 31, 136, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrpogson.com/homepage/ballistics.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bashforth did not conceive the “restricted zone”, he showed mathematically there were 5 restricted zones. Bashforth did not propose a standard projectile, but was well aware of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; pp. 5–6, H.M Majesty's Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Mayevski/Siacci Method====
In 1872, General Mayevski published his report ''Trité Balistique Extérieure'', which included the Mayevski model. Using his ballistic tables along with Bashforth's tables from the 1870 report, Mayevski created an analytical math formula that calculated the air resistances of a projectile in terms of [[Logarithm|log A]] and the [[Variable (mathematics)|value]] ''n''. Although Mayevski's math used a differing approach than Bashforth, the resulting calculations of air resistance was the same. Mayevski proposed the restricted zone concept and found there to be 6 restricted zones for projectiles.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; pg pgvii, Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; pg14,18-31, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayevski, Nikolai V, ''Trité Balistique Extérieure'' , 1872; pp. 58, 133 of the Schedules, Gauthier-Villars, Printer Bookseller office longitudes of the Polytechnic School, (Translated from French )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 40"&gt;Cline, Donna, ''Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 “Atmosphere" The “Point-Mass Trajectory: The Siacci Method Ballistic Coefficient'', 2002; p. 40, Lattie Stone Ballistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 1886, General Mayevski published the results from a discussion of experiments made by M. Krupp (1880). Though the ogival-headed projectiles used varied greatly in caliber, they had essentially the same proportions as the standard projectile, being mostly 3 caliber in length, with an ogive of 2 calibers radius. Giving the standard projectile dimensionally as {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1|kg|lbs|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Ingalls, James M. p. 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayevski, Nikolai V, ''Trité Balistique Extérieure'' , 1872; p. 58, Gauthier-Villars, Printer Bookseller office longitudes of the Polytechnic School, (Translated from French )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siacci, Francesco,''Balistica; Second edition entirely recast'' , 1888; p. 7, Torino F.Casanova, Publisher bookseller Via Academy of Sciences, (Translated from Italian and Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Colonel [[Francesco Siacci]] published his work “Balistica”. Siacci found as did those who came before him that the resistance and density of the air becomes greater and greater as a projectile displaced the air at higher and higher velocities.&lt;ref&gt;Siacci, Francesco,''Balistica; Second edition entirely recast'' , 1888; pg3, Torino F.Casanova, Publisher bookseller Via Academy of Sciences, (Translated from Italian and Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

Siacci's method was for flat-fire trajectories with angles of departure of less than 20 degrees. He found that the angle of departure is sufficiently small to allow for air density to remain the same and was able to reduce the ballistics tables to easily tabulated quadrants giving distance, time, inclination and altitude of the projectile. Using Bashforth's ''k'' and Mayevski's tables, Siacci created a 4 zone model. Siacci used Mayevski's standard projectile. From this method and standard projectile, Siacci formulated a shortcut.&lt;ref&gt;Siacci, Francesco, ''Balistica; Second edition entirely recast'' , 1888; pg5,8, Torino F.Casanova, Publisher bookseller Via Academy of Sciences, (Translated from Italian and Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 39"/&gt;

Siacci found that within a low velocity restricted zone, projectiles of similar shape, and velocity in the same air density behave similar; &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\delta w}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\delta}{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Siacci used the variable &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; for ballistic coefficient.  Meaning, air density is the generally the same for flat-fire trajectories, thus sectional density is equal to the ballistic coefficient and air density can be dropped. Then as the velocity rises to Bashforth's &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for high velocity when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; requires the introduction of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Following within today's currently used ballistic trajectory tables for an average ballistic coeficient: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{m}{d^2} \cdot \tfrac{p_0}{p}&lt;/math&gt; would equal &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{m}{d^2 i}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{SD}{i}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Siacci, Francesco,''Balistica; Second edition entirely recast'' , 1888; p. 4, Torino F.Casanova, Publisher bookseller Via Academy of Sciences, (Translated from Italian and Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 42"&gt;Cline, Donna, ''Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 “Atmosphere" The “Point-Mass Trajectory: The Siacci Method Ballistic Coefficient'', 2002; p. 42, Lattie Stone Ballistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Siacci wrote that within any restricted zone, ''C'' being the same for two or more projectiles, the trajectories differences will be minor. Therefore, ''C'' agrees with an average curve, and this average curve applies for all projectiles. Therefore, a single trajectory can be computed for the standard projectile without having to resort to tedious calculus methods, and then a trajectory for any actual bullet with known ''C'' can be  computed from the standard trajectory with just simple [[algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Siacci, Francesco,''Balistica; Second edition entirely recast'' , 1888; p. 5, Torino F.Casanova, Publisher bookseller Via Academy of Sciences, (Translated from Italian and Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

==== The Ballistic Tables====
The aforementioned ballistics tables are generally: functions, air density, projectile time at range, range, degree of projectile departure, weight and diameter to facilitate the calculation of ballistic [[formula]]e. These formulae produce the projectile velocity at range, drag and trajectories. The modern day commercially published ballistic tables or software computed ballistics tables for small arms, sporting ammunition are [[External ballistics|exterior ballistic]], trajectory tables.&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis; ''Reports on experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1878-1879; H.M Stationery Office, Harrison &amp; Sons, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bashforth, Francis, ''A revised account of the experiments made with the Bashforth chronograph...'', 1890; Cambridge at the University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayevski, Nikolai V, ''Trité Balistique Extérieure'' , 1872; p. i of the Schedules, Gauthier-Villars, Printer Bookseller office longitudes of the Polytechnic School, (Translated from French )&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1870 Bashforth tables were to {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}. Mayevski, using his tables, supplemented by the Bashforth tables (to 6 restricted zones) and the Krupp tables. Mayevski conceived a 7th restricted  zone and extended the Bashforth tables to {{convert|1100|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}.  Mayevski converted Bashforth's data from [[Imperial units|Imperial units of measure]] to [[Metric system|metric units of measure]] (now in [[International System of Units|SI units of measure]]). In 1884, [[James Monroe Ingalls|James Ingalls]] published his tables in the U.S. Army Artillery Circular M using the Mayevski tables. Ingalls extended Mayevski's ballistics tables to {{convert|5000|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} within an 8th restricted zone, but still with the same ''n'' value (1.55) as Mayevski's 7th restricted  zone. Ingalls, converted Mayevski's results back to Imperial units. The British [[Royal Artillery]] results were very similar to those of Mayevski's and extended their tables to {{convert|5000|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}} within the 8th restricted zone changing the ''n'' value from 1.55 to 1.67. These ballistic tables were published in 1909 and almost identical to those of Ingalls. In 1971 the Sierra Bullet company calculated their ballistic tables to 9 restricted zones but only within {{convert|4400|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Ingalls, James M. p. 19"/&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 40"/&gt;

====The G Model====
In 1881, the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre did a comprehensive survey of data available from their tests as well as other countries. After adopting a standard atmospheric condition for the drag data the Gavre drag function was adopted. This drag function was known as the Gavre function and the standard projectile adopted was the Type 1 projectile. Thereafter, the Type 1 standard projectile was renamed by Ballistics Section of [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]] in Maryland, USA as G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; after the Commission d'Experience de Gâvre. For practical purposes the subscript 1 in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is generally written in normal font size as G1.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Donna, ''Exterior Ballistics Explained, Trajectories, Part 3 “Atmosphere" The “Point-Mass Trajectory: The Siacci Method Ballistic Coefficient'', 2002; pg 40, Lattie Stone Ballistics&lt;/ref&gt;

The general form for the calculations of trajectory adopted for the G model is the Siacci method. The standard model projectile is a "fictitious projectile"  used as the mathematical basis for the calculation of actual projectile's trajectory when an initial velocity is known. The G1 model projectile adopted is in dimensionless measures of  2 caliber radius ogival-head and 3.28 caliber in length. By calculation this leaves the body length 1.96 caliber and head, 1.32 caliber long.&lt;ref name="Coast Artillery School Press p. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

Over the years there has been some confusion{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} as to adopted size, weight and radius ogival-head of the G1 standard projectile. This misconception may be explained by Colonel Ingalls in the 1886 publication,  Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire; page 15, ''In the following tables the first and second columns give the velocities and corresponding resistance, in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], to an elongated one inch in diameter and having an ogival head of one and a half calibers. They were deduced from Bashforth's experiments by Professor  A. G. Greenhill, and are taken from his papers published in the Proceedings of the Royal Artillery Institution, No 2, Vol. XIII.'' Further it is discussed that said projectile's [[weight]] was one pound.&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, James M., ''Exterior Ballistics in the Plan Fire'', 1886; p. 15, D. Van Nostrand Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of mathematical convenience for any standard projectile (G) the ''BC'' is 1.00. Where as the projectile's [[sectional density]] (SD) is dimensionless with a mass of 1 divided by the square of the diameter of 1 caliber equaling an SD of 1. Then the standard projectile is assigned a coefficient of form of 1. Following that &lt;math&gt;BC = \tfrac{SD}{i} = \tfrac{1}{1} = 1.00&lt;/math&gt;.  ''BC'', as a general rule, within flat-fire trajectory, is carried out to 2 decimal points. ''BC'' is commonly found within commercial publications to be carried out to 3 decimal points as few sporting, small arms projectiles rise to the level of 1.00 for a ballistic coefficient.&lt;ref name="Coast Artillery School Press p. 12"/&gt;

When using the Siacci method for different G models, the formula used to compute the trajectories is the same. What differs is retardation factors found through testing of actual projectiles that are similar in shape to the standard project reference. This creates slightly different set of retardation factors between differing G models. When the correct G model retardation factors are applied within the Siacci mathematical formula for the same G model ''BC'', a corrected trajectory can be calculated for any G model.

Another method of determining trajectory and ballistic coefficient was developed and published by Wallace H. Coxe and Edgar Beugless of DuPont in 1936. This method is by shape comparison an logarithmic scale as drawn on 10 charts. The method estimates the ballistic coefficient related to the drag model of the Ingalls tables. When matching an actual projectile against the drawn caliber radii of Chart No. 1, it will provide ''i'' and by using Chart No. 2, ''C ''can be quickly calculated. Coxe and Beugless used the variable ''C'' for ballistic coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Coxe, Wallace H. and Bugless, Edgar, ''Exterior Balistics Charts'', 1936; p. Charts 1, 2  Ballistic Engineers of the Burnside Laboratory, of E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Company Inc., Wilmington, Delaware&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;

The Siacci method was abandoned by the end of the [[World War I]] for artillery fire. But the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Ordnance Corps]] continued using the Siacci method into the middle of the 20th century for [[Direct fire|direct (flat-fire)]] tank gunnery. The development of the [[Analog computer|electromechanical analog computer]] contributed to the calculation of aerial bombing trajectories during [[World War II]]. After World War II the advent of the [[Computer|silicon semiconductor based digital computer]] made it possible to create trajectories for the guided missiles/bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles and space vehicles.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 39"/&gt;

Between World War I and II the U.S. Army Ballistics research laboratories at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland, USA developed the standard models for G2, G5, G6. In 1965, [[Olin Corporation|Winchester Western]] published a set of ballistics tables for G1, G5, G6 and GL. In 1971 [[Sierra Bullets|Sierra Bullet Company]] retested all their bullets and concluded that the G5 model was not the best model for their boat tail bullets and started using the G1 model. This was fortunate, as the entire commercial sporting and firearms industries had based their calculations on the G1 model. The G1 model and Mayevski/Siacci Method continue to be the industry standard today. This benefit allows for comparison of all ballistic tables for trajectory within the commercial sporting and firearms industry.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cline, Donna p. 42"/&gt;

In recent years there have been vast advancements in the calculation of flat-fire trajectories with the advent of [[Doppler radar]] and the personal computer and handheld computing devices. Also, the newer [[External ballistics#Pejsa model|methodology]] proposed by Dr. Arthur Pejsa and the use of the G7 model used by Mr. Brian Litz, ballistic engineer for Berger Bullets, LLC for calculating boat tailed spitzer rifle bullet trajectories and [[External ballistics#6 Degrees of Freedom .286 DoF.29 model|6 Dof model based software]] have improved the prediction of flat-fire trajectories.&lt;ref name=historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pejsa, Arthur, ''Modern Practical Ballistics 2nd Edition'', 1991;  Kenwood Publishing {{ISBN|978-0961277635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Berger Bullets Reloading Manual 1st Edition'' 2012; Berger Bullets LLC; p161, {{ISBN|978-0-615-63762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software take for granted that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistic coefficient. Those models do not differentiate between [[wadcutter]], flat-based, [[spitzer bullet|spitzer]], boat-tail, [[very-low-drag bullet|very-low-drag]], etc. bullet types or shapes. They assume one invariable drag function as indicated by the published BC. Several different drag curve models optimized for several standard projectile shapes are available, however.

The resulting drag curve models for several standard projectile shapes or types are referred to as:
* G1 or Ingalls (flatbase with 2 caliber (blunt) nose [[ogive]] - by far the most popular)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shootingsoftware.com/coefficients.htm Exterior Ballistics and Ballistic Coefficients]&lt;/ref&gt;
* G2 (Aberdeen J projectile)
* G5 (short 7.5° boat-tail, 6.19 calibers long [[Nose cone design#Tangent ogive|tangent ogive]])
* G6 (flatbase, 6 calibers long [[Nose cone design#Secant ogive|secant ogive]])
* G7 (long 7.5° boat-tail, 10 calibers tangent ogive, preferred by some manufacturers for very-low-drag bullets&lt;ref&gt;[http://02b0516.netsolhost.com/blog1/?p=62 A Better Ballistic Coefficient by Bryan Litz, Ballistician Berger Bullets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802154317/http://02b0516.netsolhost.com/blog1/?p=62 |date=2009-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* G8 (flatbase, 10 calibers long secant ogive)
* GL (blunt lead nose)

Since these standard projectile shapes differ significantly the G''x'' BC will also differ significantly from the G''y'' BC for an identical bullet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shootersforum.com/ballistics-internal-external/61432-ballistic-coefficient-basics.html Ballistic Coefficient Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;  To illustrate this the bullet manufacturer Berger has published the G1 and G7 BCs for most of their target, tactical, varmint and hunting bullets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergerbullets.com/products/all-bullets/ Berger Bullets Technical Specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; Other bullet manufacturers like Lapua and Nosler also published the G1 and G7 BCs for most of their target bullets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/en/products/reloading Lapua bullets technical information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217120442/http://www.lapua.com/en/products/reloading |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosler.com/Bullets/AccuBond_LongRange.aspx Nosler AccuBond Longe Range technical information]&lt;/ref&gt; How much a projectile deviates from the applied reference projectile is mathematically expressed by the form factor (''i''). The applied reference projectile shape always has a form factor (''i'') of exactly 1. When a particular projectile has a sub 1 form factor (''i'') this indicates that the particular projectile exhibits lower drag than the applied reference projectile shape. A form factor (''i'') greater than 1 indicates the particular projectile exhibits more drag than the applied reference projectile shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergerbullets.com/form-factors-a-useful-analysis-tool/ Form Factors: A Useful Analysis Tool by Bryan Litz, Chief Ballistician Berger Bullets]&lt;/ref&gt; In general the G1 model yields comparatively high BC values and is often used by the sporting ammunition industry.

===The transient nature of bullet ballistic coefficients===
Variations in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the ambient [[air density]] used to compute specific values or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. Also, the BC changes during a projectile's flight, and stated BCs are always averages for particular range-speed regimes. Further explanation about the variable nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the [[external ballistics]] article. The external ballistics article implies that knowing how a BC was determined is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.

For the precise establishment of BCs (or perhaps the scientifically better expressed [[drag coefficient]]s), [[Doppler radar]]-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics enthusiast, however, has no access to such expensive professional measurement devices. Weibel 1000e or Infinition BR-1001 [[Doppler radar]]s are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to obtain exact real-world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.

Doppler radar measurement results for a lathe turned monolithic solid .50 BMG [[very-low-drag bullet]] (Lost River J40 {{convert|0.510|in|disp=flip}}, {{convert|773|gr|disp=flip}} monolithic solid bullet / twist rate 1:{{convert|15|in|disp=flip}}) look like this:

The initial rise in the BC value is attributed to a projectile's always present yaw and [[precession]] out of the bore. The test results were obtained from many shots, not just a single shot. The bullet was assigned 1.062 for its BC number by the bullet's manufacturer, Lost River Ballistic Technologies.

Measurements on other bullets can give totally different results. How different speed regimes affect several 8.6&amp;nbsp;mm (.338 in calibre) rifle bullets made by the Finnish ammunition manufacturer Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/upload/downloads/brochures/2011/lapuaspecialpurpose2011eng.pdf .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927103021/http://www.lapua.com/upload/downloads/brochures/2011/lapuaspecialpurpose2011eng.pdf |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General trends===
Sporting bullets, with a [[caliber|calibre]] ''d'' ranging from {{convert|0.172|to|0.50|in|1|disp=flip}}, have BCs in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00. Those bullets with the higher BCs are  the most aerodynamic, and those with low BCs are the least. [[Very-low-drag bullet]]s with BCs ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on CNC precision lathes out of mono-metal rods, but they often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Englisch/LM-Class-Bullets.htm LM Class Bullets, very high BC bullets for windy long ranges.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219154147/http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Englisch/LM-Class-Bullets.htm |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammunition makers often offer several bullet weights and types for a given cartridge.  Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boattail design have BCs at the higher end of the normal range, whereas lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. The 6&amp;nbsp;mm and 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm cartridges are probably the most well known for having high BCs and are often used in long range target matches of {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} – {{convert|1000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.  The 6 and 6.5 have relatively light recoil compared to high BC bullets of greater caliber and tend to be shot by the winner in matches where accuracy is key. Examples include the [[6mm PPC]], [[6mm Norma BR]], 6x47mm SM, [[6.5×55mm]] Swedish Mauser, [[6.5×47mm Lapua]], [[6.5 Creedmoor]], [[6.5 Grendel]], [[.260 Remington]], and the [[6.5-284]]. The 6.5&amp;nbsp;mm is also a  popular hunting caliber in Europe.

In the United States, hunting cartridges such as the [[.25-06 Remington]] (a 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm caliber), the [[.270 Winchester]] (a 6.8&amp;nbsp;mm caliber), and the [[.284 Winchester]] (a 7&amp;nbsp;mm caliber) are used when high BCs and moderate recoil are desired. The [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[.308 Winchester]] cartridges also offer several high-BC loads, although the bullet weights are on the heavy side.

In the larger caliber category, the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]] and the [[.50 BMG]] are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1,000 meters. Newer chamberings in the larger caliber category are the [[.408 Chey Tac|.375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical]] and the [[.416 Barrett]].

===Information sources===
For many years, bullet manufacturers were the main source of ballistic coefficients for use in trajectory calculations.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, William and Algren, Ted. Sierra Loading Manual, 5th ed., Section 2.5. Examples of Ballistic Coefficient Measurements, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the past decade or so, it has been shown that ballistic coefficient measurements by independent parties can often be more accurate than manufacturer specifications.&lt;ref&gt;Litz, Bryan. Applied Ballistics for Long Range Shooting. Cedar Springs, MI : Applied Ballistics, LLC, 2009a, 2nd Edition, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bohnenkamp, Bradford Hackert, Maurice Motley, and Michael Courtney, Comparing Advertised Ballistic Coefficients with Independent Measurements, DTIC, 2012. http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA554683&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Halloran, Colton Huntsman, Chad Demers, and Michael Courtney, More Inaccurate Specifications of Ballistic Coefficients, DTIC, 2012. http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA555975&lt;/ref&gt;  Since ballistic coefficients depend on the specific firearm and other conditions that vary, it is notable that methods have been developed for individual users to measure their own ballistic coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Elya, Collin Morris, and Michael Courtney.

==Satellites and reentry vehicles==
Satellites in [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO) with high ballistic coefficients experience smaller perturbations to their orbits due to atmospheric drag.

The ballistic coefficient of an [[atmospheric reentry]] vehicle has a significant effect on its behavior. A very high ballistic coefficient vehicle would lose velocity very slowly and would impact the Earth's surface at higher speeds. In contrast, a low ballistic coefficient would reach subsonic speeds before reaching the ground.

In general, reentry vehicles that carry human beings back to Earth from space have high drag and a correspondingly low ballistic coefficient. Vehicles that carry nuclear weapons launched by an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM), by contrast, have a high ballistic coefficient, which enables them to travel rapidly from space to a target on land. That makes the weapon less affected by crosswinds or other weather phenomena, and harder to track, intercept, or otherwise defend against.

The '''Blue Flame''' is a [[rocket]]-powered vehicle that was driven by [[Gary Gabelich]] and achieved the world [[land speed record]] on [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]] on October 23, 1970. The vehicle set the [[FIA]] world record for the flying mile at {{convert|622.407|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} and the flying kilometer at {{convert|630.388|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sirmalcolmcampbell.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirmalcolmcampbell.com/sirmail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019101530/http://www.sirmalcolmcampbell.com/sirmail.html |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
The Blue Flame was constructed in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] by [[Reaction Dynamics]], a company formed by Pete Farnsworth, Ray Dausman and Dick Keller who had developed the first [[hydrogen peroxide]] [[rocket dragster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1970: Blue Flame driven by Gary Gabelich|url=http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/world_land_speed_record_39.htm|publisher=©Copyright 1999-2014 Unique Cars &amp; Parts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  called the X-1 and driven by Chuck Suba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ratliff|first=Franklin|title=Drag Racing Story of the Day - Early History of the Hydrogen Peroxide Rocket Dragster|url=http://www.draglist.com/stories/SOD%20Mar%202002/SOD-031402.htm|publisher=Draglist.com Copyright 1996-2014 by Bilden Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Blue Flame used a combination of [[high-test peroxide]] and [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG), pressurized by helium gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coonce|first=Cole|title=IT WASN’T FOR NOTHING THAT WE DID IT - Transcript of interview with Pete Farnsworth|url=http://infinityoverzero.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/it-wasnt-for-nothing-that-we-did-it/|publisher=INFINITY OVER ZERO Blog at WordPress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The effort was sponsored by the [[American Gas Association]], with technical assistance from the [[Institute of Gas Technology]] of [[Des Plaines, IL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blue Flame Record Car|url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/features/octane_features/262615/the_blue_flame_record_car.html|publisher=Text: Charles Armstrong-Wilson Photos: Richard Keller/American gas association}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DICK KELLER - SPACE AGE SPEEDSTER|url=http://clingonforlife.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/honda-hawk-streamliner-week-post-07.html|publisher=Cling on for dear life Blog on Blogspot.co.uk Monday, 30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaction Dynamics was formed in 1965 and started out as "DFK Enterprises", for Dausman, Farnsworth and Keller. At that time Keller worked part-time as a research assistant into gas technology at the Illinois Institute of Technology, which was the research arm of the American Gas Association. Farnsworth was a [[top alcohol]] dragster racer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coonce|first=Cole|title=THE OTHER X-1 - Transcript of interview with Pete &amp; Leah Farnsworth|url=http://infinityoverzero.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/the-other-x-1/|publisher=INFINITY OVER ZERO Blog at WordPress.com November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The engine of the Blue Flame was designed by Reaction Dynamics,  and some of the components were manufactured by Galaxy Manufacturing  of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda, New York]]. Galaxy Mfg.  was formed in 1966 by Donald J Magro and Gerald Muhs and was principally engaged in flow control systems, cavitating venturi, and precision machining fields.

The Blue Flame's engine is a regeneratively cooled, liquid-propellent engine of the variable thrust type.  It can operate on either a single- or dual-propellant basis.  In operation, the engine permits natural gas use as a liquid or gas or both with a two-stage combustion start.  The oxidizer flow is established first, then LNG enters a heat exchanger where it vaporizes and is brought to combustion temperature. The gas is then injected into the combustion chamber with the oxygen provided by the hydrogen peroxide.  A stable flame front is established and the remaining LNG is injected to bring the engine to full power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Flame - Land Speed Racing History|url=http://hotrod.gregwapling.com/land-speed-racing-history/land-speed-racing-blue-flame.html|publisher=Copyright © 2012 Hot Rods Down Under}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nominal design engine running time was 20&amp;nbsp;seconds at full thrust of {{convert|22,500|lbf}} generating the equivalent of {{convert|58,000|hp|kW|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Stories &gt; Rocket Science - The Blue Flame Record Car|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Rocket+Science+_+The+Blue+Flame+Record+Car-77786.xhtml|publisher=© 2014 AutoTraderClassics.com, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Bruce A.|title=The Blue Flame – Natural Gas Rocket Car|url=http://aoghs.org/petroleum-industry-pioneers/the-blue-flame-natural-gas-rocket-car/|publisher=American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society Copyright © 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Keller stated that the [[Goodyear Tire Company]] restricted their top speed to {{convert|700|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}. Reaction Dynamics subsequently modified the LNG flow in the two-stage LNG injector system to almost halve the maximum thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Richard|title=True Blue Natural Gas - An Energy Blog from the American Gas Association AGA|url=http://www.truebluenaturalgas.org/faster-than-a-blue-flamei-dont-think-so/comment-page-1/#comment-547|publisher=Copyright © American Gas Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual thrust during the record runs was between {{convert|13,000|lbs|kg|abbr=off}} [equivalent of {{convert|35,000|hp|kW|abbr=off}}]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ThrustSSC - History - The Blue Flame|url=http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/History/Blueflame.html|publisher=© SSC Programme Ltd, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and {{convert|15,000|lbs|kg|abbr=off}}. According to  Keller the kilometer timing traps were inside the mile.  The Blue Flame's record runs involved accelerating continuously to the mile midpoint, then coasting through the mile.  The peak speed, of approximately {{convert|650|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} was reached at that point and then the vehicle decelerated the rest of the way.  The kilometer speed trap was biased towards one end of the mile, resulting in the {{convert|8|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} higher speed.

The frame of the Blue Flame is a semi-[[monocoque]] type aluminum, with welded tubular structure in the nose section and with an aluminum "skin." The nose cone and possibly body panels were built by Ray Besasie, a noted Milwaukee fabricator and mechanic in his garage.  The vehicle is {{convert|37|ft|4.6|in|m}} long, {{convert|8|ft|1.5|in|m}} high to the top of the tail fin, {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m}} wide and the wheelbase is {{convert|306|in|m}}. It has an empty weight of {{convert|4,000|lbs|kg|abbr=off}} and is approximately {{convert|6,600|lbs|kg|abbr=off}} fully fueled and loaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ThrustSSC - History - The Blue Flame|url=http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/History/Blueflame.html|publisher=© SSC Programme Ltd, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.]] designed 8:00-25 tires for the vehicle, with an outside diameter of {{convert|34.8|in|mm}} and smooth tire tread surface to help prevent heat buildup using [[nitrogen]] gas at {{convert|350|psi|bar}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coonce|first=Cole|title=THE OTHER X-1 - Transcript of interview with Pete &amp; Leah Farnsworth|url=http://infinityoverzero.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/the-other-x-1/|publisher=INFINITY OVER ZERO Blog at WordPress.com November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:San-miguel-island-caliche.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Caliche Forest on [[San Miguel Island]].]]
'''Caliche''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|iː|tʃ|iː}}) is a [[sedimentary rock]], a hardened natural [[cement]] of [[calcium carbonate]] that binds other materials—such as gravel, sand, clay, and silt. It occurs worldwide, in [[aridisol]] and [[mollisol]] soil orders—generally in [[arid]] or [[semiarid]] regions, including in central and western [[Australia]], in the [[Kalahari Desert]], in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of the western [[United States|USA]], in the [[Sonoran Desert]] and [[Mojave Desert]], and in Eastern Saudi Arabia [[Al-Hasa]]. Caliche is also known as '''calcrete''' or '''kankar''' (in India). It belongs to the [[Duricrust|duricrusts]]. The term ''caliche'' is Spanish and is originally from the [[Latin-language|Latin]] ''calx'', meaning [[Lime (mineral)|lime]].

Caliche is generally light-colored, but can range from white to light pink to reddish-brown, depending on the impurities present. It generally occurs on or near the surface, but can be found in deeper subsoil deposits, as well. Layers vary from a few inches to feet thick, and multiple layers can exist in a single location.

In northern [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], ''caliche'' also refers to mineral deposits that include [[nitrate]] salts.&lt;ref&gt;Chong ''et al''. 2007, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Most Damnable Invention: Dynamite, Nitrates, and the Making of the Modern World, Stephen R. Bown, Macmillan, 2005, {{ISBN|0-312-32913-X}}, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Note: removed ref. to Atacama Desert (which appears below under "Chilean Caliche"), as it lies completely within Chile, doesn't involve Peru --&gt; Caliche can also refer to various claylike deposits in [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]]. In addition, it has been used to describe some forms of [[quartzite]], [[bauxite]], [[kaolinite]], [[laterite]], [[chalcedony]], [[opal]], and [[soda niter]].

A similar material, composed of [[calcium sulfate]] rather than [[calcium carbonate]], is called [[gypcrust]].

==Formation==
Caliche &lt;!--(pronounced kuh-lee-chee)--&gt; generally forms when minerals [[Leaching (pedology)|leach]] from the upper layer of the soil (the [[A horizon]]) and accumulate in the next layer (the [[B horizon]]), at depths around 3 to 10 feet under the surface. It generally consists of carbonates in semiarid regions—in arid regions, less-soluble minerals form caliche layers after all the carbonates have been leached from the soil. The deposited calcium carbonate accumulates—first forming grains, then small clumps, then a discernible layer, and finally, a thicker, solid bed. As the caliche layer forms, the layer gradually becomes deeper, and eventually moves into the [[parent material]], which lies under the upper soil horizons.

However, caliche also forms in other ways. It can form when water rises through [[capillary action]]. In an arid region, rainwater sinks into the ground very quickly. Later, as the surface dries out, the water below the surface rises, carrying up dissolved minerals from lower layers. This water movement forms a caliche that tends to grow thinner and branch out as it nears the surface. Plants can contribute to the formation of caliche, as well. Plant roots take up water through [[transpiration]], and leave behind the dissolved calcium carbonate, which precipitates to form caliche. It can also form on outcrops of [[porous]] rocks or in rock fissures where water is trapped and evaporates. In general, caliche deposition is a slow process, but if enough moisture is present in an otherwise arid site, it can accumulate fast enough to block a drain pipe.

==Examples of natural occurrence==
[[File:Caliche - Sedimentary Rock Ridgecrest Kern County California.jpg|thumb|Caliche&amp;nbsp;— sedimentary rock, Ridgecrest, Kern County, California]]
[[File:Limestone rubble wall with brick quoins.jpg|thumb|Calcrete rubble was widely used for building construction in [[South Australia]] during the 19th century.]]

While the formation of other caliches is relatively well understood, the origin of Chilean caliche is not clearly known. One possibility is that the deposits were formed when a [[prehistoric]] inland sea evaporated. Another theory is that it was deposited due to weathering of the [[Andes]].

One of the world's largest deposits of calcrete is in the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]] in [[Botswana]], where surface calcretes occur at the location of a now-desiccated prehistoric lake.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Makgadikgadi'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&amp;mode=&amp;order=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic uses==

===Building applications===
Caliche is used in construction worldwide. Its reserves in the [[Llano Estacado]] in [[Texas]] can be used in the manufacture of [[Portland cement]]; the caliche meets the chemical composition requirements and has been used as a principal raw material in Portland cement production in at least one Texas plant. Where the calcium carbonate content is over 80%, caliche can also be fired and used as a source of [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], which can then be used for soil stabilization.

[[File:Caliche-5731.jpg|thumb|left|Caliche [[berm]] surrounding a [[stock tank]] in [[Central Texas]]]]
When mixed with small amounts of either [[pozzolanic ash|pozzolan]] or Portland cement, caliche can also be used as a building material that exceeds [[building code]] requirements for unfired [[masonry]] materials. For example, caliche was used to build some of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] buildings in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]]. A dormitory in [[Ingram, Texas]], and a demonstration building in [[Carrizo Springs, Texas]], for the [[United States Department of Energy]] were also built using caliche as part of studies by the [[Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems]].

In many areas, caliche is also used for road construction, either as a surfacing material, or more commonly, as base material. It is one of the most common road materials used in [[Southern Africa]]. Caliche is widely used as a base material when it is locally available and cheap. However, it does not hold up to moisture (rain), and is never used if a hard-rock base material, such as limestone, is available.

===Sugar refining===
A nearly pure source of calcium carbonate is necessary to refine [[sugar]]. It must contain at least 95% calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and have a low magnesium content. In addition, the material must meet certain physical requirements so it does not break down when burned. Although caliche does not generally meet all of the requirements for sugar refining, it is used in areas where another source of calcium carbonate, such as limestone, is not present. While caliche requires [[beneficiation]] to meet the requirements, its use can still be significantly cheaper than shipping in limestone.

===Chilean caliche===
&lt;!-- please see the "Salitre" article in the Spanish Wikipedia: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salitre --&gt;
In the [[Atacama Desert]] in northern [[Chile]], vast deposits of a mixture, also referred to as ''caliche'', are composed of [[gypsum]], [[sodium chloride]] and other salts, and sand, associated to ''[[Nitratine|salitre]]'' ("Chile saltpeter"). ''Salitre'', in turn, is a composite of [[sodium nitrate]] (NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[potassium nitrate]] (KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). ''Salitre'' was an important source of export revenue for Chile until World War I, when Europe began to produce both nitrates industrially in large quantities.

These deposits are the largest known natural source of nitrates in the world, containing up to 25% sodium nitrate and 3% potassium nitrate, as well as iodate minerals, sodium chloride, [[sodium sulfate]], and [[sodium borate]] (borax). The caliche beds are from 0.2 to 5.0 m thick, and they are mined and refined to produce a variety of products, including sodium nitrate (for agriculture or industry uses), potassium nitrate, sodium sulfate, [[iodine]], and iodine derivatives.

==Caliche and gardening==

===Problems caused by caliche===
Caliche beds can cause problems for agriculture. First, an impermeable caliche layer prevents water from draining properly, which can keep roots from getting enough oxygen. Salts can also build up in the soil due to the lack of drainage. Both of these situations are detrimental to plant growth. Second, the impermeable nature of caliche beds prevents plant roots from penetrating the bed, which limits the supply of nutrients, water, and space so they cannot develop normally. Third, caliche beds can also cause the surrounding soil to be [[basic (chemistry)|basic]]. The basic soil, along with calcium carbonate from the caliche, can prevent plants from getting enough nutrients, especially [[iron]]. An [[iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron deficiency]] makes the youngest leaves turn yellow. Soil [[water content|saturation]] above the caliche bed can make the condition worse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30946">'''Carbide-derived carbon''' (CDC), also known as '''tunable nanoporous carbon''', is the common term for carbon materials derived from [[carbide]] precursors, such as binary (e.g. SiC, TiC), or ternary carbides, also known as [[MAX phases]] (e.g., Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlC, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt; CDCs have also been derived from polymer-derived ceramics such as Si-O-C or Ti-C, and carbonitrides, such as Si-N-C.&lt;ref name="a5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a7" /&gt; CDCs can occur in various structures, ranging from amorphous to crystalline carbon, from sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;- to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-bonded, and from highly porous to fully dense. Among others, the following carbon structures have been derived from carbide precursors: [[Microporous material|micro-]] and [[Mesoporous material|mesoporous]] carbon, amorphous carbon, [[carbon nanotube]]s, onion-like carbon, [[Nanodiamond|nanocrystalline diamond]], [[graphene]], and [[graphite]].&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt; Among carbon materials, microporous CDCs exhibit some of the highest reported specific surface areas (up to more than 3000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g).&lt;ref name="a8" /&gt; By varying the type of the precursor and the CDC synthesis conditions, microporous and mesoporous structures with controllable average pore size and pore size distributions can be produced. Depending on the precursor and the synthesis conditions, the average pore size control can be applied at sub-Angstrom accuracy.&lt;ref name="a9" /&gt; This ability to precisely tune the size and shapes of pores makes CDCs attractive for selective sorption and storage of liquids and gases (e.g., hydrogen, methane, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the high electric conductivity and electrochemical stability allows these structures to be effectively implemented in electrical energy storage and capacitive water desalinization.

==History==
The production of SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by high temperature reaction of [[Chlorine]] gas with [[Silicon Carbide]] was first patented in 1918 by Otis Hutchins,&lt;ref name="a10" /&gt; with the process further optimized for higher yields in 1956.&lt;ref name="a11" /&gt; The solid porous carbon product was initially regarded as a waste byproduct until its properties and potential applications were investigated in more detail in 1959 by Walter Mohun.&lt;ref name="a12" /&gt; Research was carried out in the 1960-1980s mostly by Russian scientists on the synthesis of CDC via halogen treatment,&lt;ref name="a13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a14" /&gt; while hydrothermal treatment was explored as an alternative route to derive CDCs in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="a15" /&gt; Most recently, research activities have centered on optimized CDC synthesis and nanoengineered CDC precursors.

==Nomenclature==
Historically, various terms have been used for CDC, such as "mineral carbon" or "nanoporous carbon".&lt;ref name="a12" /&gt; Later, a more adequate nomenclature introduced by [[Yury Gogotsi]]&lt;ref name="a9" /&gt; was adopted that clearly denotes the precursor. For example, CDC derived from silicon carbide has been referred to as SiC-CDC, Si-CDC, or SiCDC. Recently, it was recommended to adhere to a unified precursor-CDC-nomenclature to reflect the chemical composition of the precursor (e.g., B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C-CDC, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CDC, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-CDC).&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

==Synthesis==
CDCs have been synthesized using several chemical and physical synthesis methods. Most commonly, dry chlorine treatment is used to selectively etch metal or metalloid atoms from the carbide precursor lattice.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt; The term "chlorine treatment" is to be preferred over [[halogenation|chlorination]] as the chlorinated product, metal chloride, is the discarded byproduct and the carbon itself remains largely unreacted. This method is implemented for commercial production of CDC by Skeleton in Estonia and Carbon-Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Hydrothermal etching has also been used for synthesis of SiC-CDC which yielded a route for porous carbon films and nanodiamond synthesis.&lt;ref name="a17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a18" /&gt;
[[Image:Figure2CDC2.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of chlorine etching of to produce a porous carbon structure.]]

===Chlorine treatment===
The most common method for producing porous carbide-derived carbons involves high-temperature etching with halogens, most commonly chlorine gas. The following generic equation describes the reaction of a metal carbide with chlorine gas (M: Si, Ti, V; similar equations can be written for other CDC precursors):

:MC(solid) + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas) → MCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(gas) + C(solid)

Halogen treatment at temperatures between 200 and 1000&amp;nbsp;°C has been shown to yield mostly disordered porous carbons with a porosity between 50 and ~80 vol% depending on the precursor. Temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C result in predominantly graphitic carbon and an observed shrinkage of the material due to graphitization.
[[Image:Figure3CDC2.jpg|thumb|right|Different bulk porosity of CDCs derived from different carbide precursors.]]
The linear growth rate of the solid carbon product phase suggests a reaction-driven kinetic mechanism, but the kinetics become diffusion-limited for thicker films or larger particles. A high mass transport condition (high gas flow rates) facilitates the removal of the chloride and shifts the reaction equilibrium towards the CDC product. Chlorine treatment has successfully been employed for CDC synthesis from a variety of carbide precursors, including SiC, TiC, B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, BaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, SrC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, VC, WC, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, ZrC, ternary carbides such as Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlC, Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and carbonitrides such as Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlC&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;.

Most produced CDCs exhibit a prevalence of micropores (&lt; 2&amp;nbsp;nm) and mesopores (between 2 and 50&amp;nbsp;nm), with specific distributions affected by carbide precursor and synthesis conditions.&lt;ref name="a19" /&gt; Hierarchic porosity can be achieved by using polymer-derived ceramics with or without utilizing a templating method.&lt;ref name="a20" /&gt; Templating yields an ordered array of mesopores in addition to the disordered network of micropores.
It has been shown that the initial crystal structure of the carbide is the primary factor affecting the CDC porosity, especially for low-temperature chlorine treatment. In general, a larger spacing between carbon atoms in the lattice correlates with an increase in the average pore diameter.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a21" /&gt; As the synthesis temperature increases, the average pore diameter increases, while the pore size distribution becomes broader.&lt;ref name="a9" /&gt; The overall shape and size of the carbide precursor, however, is largely maintained and CDC formation is usually referred to as a conformal process.&lt;ref name="a19" /&gt;
[[Image:Figure4CDC.jpg|thumb|right|Pore size distributions for different carbide precursors.]]

===Vacuum decomposition===
{{Main|Graphene#Epitaxial growth on silicon carbide|l1=''Epitaxial graphene''}}

Metal or metalloid atoms from carbides can selectively be extracted at high temperatures (usually above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C) under vacuum. The underlying mechanism is incongruent decomposition of carbides, using the high melting point of carbon compared to corresponding carbide metals that melt and eventually evaporate away, leaving the carbon behind.&lt;ref name="a22" /&gt;

Like halogen treatment, vacuum decomposition is a conformal process.&lt;ref name="a19" /&gt; The resulting carbon structures are, as a result of the higher temperatures, more ordered, and carbon nanotubes and graphene can be obtained. In particular, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes films of high tube density have been reported for vacuum decomposition of SiC.&lt;ref name="a23" /&gt; The high tube density translates into a high elastic modulus and high buckling resistance which is of particular interest for mechanical and tribological applications.&lt;ref name="a24" /&gt;

While carbon nanotube formation occurs when trace oxygen amounts are present, very high vacuum conditions (approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; torr) result in the formation of graphene sheets. If the conditions are maintained, graphene transitions into bulk graphite. In particular, by vacuum annealing silicon carbide single crystals (wafers) at 1200–1500&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="a16" /&gt; metal/metalloid atoms are selectively removed and a layer of 1–3 layer graphene (depending on the treatment time) is formed, undergoing a conformal transformation of 3 layers of silicon carbide into one monolayer of graphene.&lt;ref name="a25" /&gt; Also, graphene formation occurs preferentially on the Si-face of the 6H-SiC crystals, while nanotube growth is favored on the c-face of SiC.&lt;ref name="a23" /&gt;

===Hydrothermal decomposition===
The removal of metal atoms from carbides has been reported at high temperatures (300–1000&amp;nbsp;°C) and pressures (2–200 MPa). The following reactions are possible between metal carbides and water:

:{{frac|x|2}}&amp;thinsp;MC + x&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → M&lt;sub&gt;{{frac|x|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|x|2}}&amp;thinsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

: MC + (x+1)&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → MO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + CO + (x+1)&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

: MC + (x+2)&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → MO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + (x+2)&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

: MC + x&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O →	MO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + C + x&amp;thinsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Only the last reaction yields solid carbon. The yield of carbon-containing gases increases with pressure (decreasing solid carbon yield) and decreases with temperatures (increasing the carbon yield). The ability to produce a usable porous carbon material is dependent on the solubility of the formed metal oxide (such as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in supercritical water. Hydrothermal carbon formation has been reported for SiC, TiC, WC, TaC, and NbC. Insolubility of metal oxides, for example TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a significant complication for certain metal carbides (e.g., Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="a19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a26" /&gt;

==Applications==
{{See also|Electric double-layer capacitor|Capa vehicle}}
One application of carbide-derived carbons is as active material in electrodes for electric double layer capacitors which have become commonly known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors. This is motivated by their good electrical conductivity combined with high surface area,&lt;ref name="a27" /&gt; large micropore volume,&lt;ref name="a21" /&gt; and pore size control&lt;ref name="a28" /&gt; that enable to match the porosity metrics of the porous carbon electrode to a certain electrolyte.&lt;ref name="a29" /&gt; In particular, when the pore size approaches the size of the (desolvated) ion in the electrolyte, there is a significant increase in the capacitance. The electrically conductive carbon material minimizes resistance losses in supercapacitor devices and enhances charge screening and confinement,&lt;ref name="a30" /&gt; maximizing the packing density and subsequent charge storage capacity of microporous CDC electrodes.&lt;ref name="a31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a33" /&gt;
[[Image:Figure5CDC.jpg|thumb|right|Confinement of solvated ions in pores, such as those present in CDCs. As the pore size approaches the size of the solvation shell, the solvent molecules are removed, resulting in larger ionic packing density and increased charge storage capability.]]
CDC electrodes have been shown to yield a gravimetric capacitance of up to 190 F/g in aqueous electrolytes and 180 F/g in organic electrolytes.&lt;ref name="a29" /&gt; The highest capacitance values are observed for matching ion/pore systems, which allow high-density packing of ions in pores in superionic states.&lt;ref name="a34" /&gt; However, small pores, especially when combined with an overall large particle diameter, impose an additional diffusion limitation on the ion mobility during charge/discharge cycling. The prevalence of mesopores in the CDC structure allows for more ions to move past each other during charging and discharging, allowing for faster scan rates and improved rate handling abilities.&lt;ref name="a35" /&gt; Conversely, by implementing nanoparticle carbide precursors, shorter pore channels allow for higher electrolyte mobility, resulting in faster charge/discharge rates and higher power densities.&lt;ref name="a36" /&gt;

==Proposed applications==
===Gas storage and carbon dioxide capturing===
TiC-CDC activated with KOH or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; store up to 21 wt.% of methane at 25&amp;nbsp;°C at high pressure. CDCs with subnanometer pores in the 0.50–0.88&amp;nbsp;nm diameter range have shown to store up to 7.1&amp;nbsp;mol CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kg at 1 bar and 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="a37" /&gt; CDCs also store up to 3 wt.% hydrogen at 60 bar and −196&amp;nbsp;°C, with additional increases possible as a result of chemical or physical activation of the CDC materials. SiOC-CDC with large subnanometer pore volumes are able to store over 5.5 wt.% hydrogen at 60 bar and −196&amp;nbsp;°C, almost reaching the goal of the US Department of Energy of 6 wt.% storage density for automotive applications. Methane storage densities of over 21.5 wt.% can be achieved for this material at those conditions. In particular, a predominance of pores with subnanometer diameters and large pore volumes are instrumental towards increasing storage densities.&lt;ref name="a38" /&gt;

===Tribological coatings===
CDC films obtained by vacuum annealing (ESK) or chlorine treatment of SiC ceramics yield a low friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of SiC, which is widely used in tribological applications for its high mechanical strength and hardness, can therefore decrease from ~0.7 to ~0.2 or less under dry conditions.&lt;ref name="a39" /&gt; It’s important to mention that graphite cannot operate in dry environments. The porous 3-dimensional network of CDC allows for high ductility and an increased mechanical strength, minimizing fracture of the film under an applied force. Those coatings find applications in dynamic seals. The friction properties can be further tailored with high-temperature hydrogen annealing and subsequent hydrogen termination of [[dangling bond]]s.&lt;ref name="a40" /&gt;

===Protein adsorption===
Carbide-derived carbons with a mesoporous structure remove large molecules from biofluids. As other carbons, CDCs possess good biocompatibility.&lt;ref name="a41" /&gt; CDCs have been demonstrated to remove cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta from blood plasma. These are the most common receptor-binding agents released into the body during a bacterial infection that cause the primary inflammatory response during the attack and increase the potential lethality of sepsis, making their removal a very important concern.&lt;ref name="a42" /&gt; The rates and levels of removal of above cytokines (85–100% removed within 30 minutes) are higher than those observed for comparable activated carbons.&lt;ref name="a42" /&gt;

===Catalyst support===
{{See also|Catalyst support}}
Pt nanoparticles can be introduced to the SiC/C interface during chlorine treatment (in the form of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The particles diffuse through the material to form Pt particle surfaces, which may serve as catalyst support layers.&lt;ref name="a43" /&gt; In particular, in addition to Pt, other noble elements such as gold can be deposited into the pores, with the resulting nanoparticle size controlled by the pore size and overall pore size distribution of the CDC substrate.&lt;ref name="a44" /&gt; Such gold or platinum nanoparticles can be smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;nm even without employing surface coatings.&lt;ref name="a44" /&gt; Au nanoparticles in different CDCs (TiC-CDC, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-CDC, B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C-CDC) catalyze the oxidation of carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="a44" /&gt;

===Capacitive deionization (CDI)===
{{See also|Capacitive deionization}}
As desalinization and purification of water is critical for obtaining deionized water for laboratory research, large-scale chemical synthesis in industry and consumer applications, the use of porous materials for this application has received particular interest. Capacitive deionization operates in a fashion with similarities to a supercapacitor. As an ion-containing water (electrolyte) is flown between two porous electrodes with an applied potential across the system, the corresponding ions assemble into a double layer in the pores of the two terminals, decreasing the ion content in the liquid exiting the purification device.&lt;ref name="a45" /&gt; Due to the ability of carbide-derived carbons to closely match the size of ions in the electrolyte, side-by-side comparisons of desalinization devices based on CDCs and activated carbon showed a significant efficiency increase in the 1.2–1.4 V range compared to activated carbon.&lt;ref name="a45" /&gt;

==Commercial production and applications==
Having originated as the by-product of industrial metal chloride synthesis, CDC has certainly a potential for large-scale production at a moderate cost. Currently, only small companies engage in production of carbide-derived carbons and their implementation in commercial products. For example, Skeleton, which is located in Tartu, Estonia, and Carbon-Ukraine, located in Kiev, Ukraine,  have a diverse product line of porous carbons for supercapacitors, gas storage, and filtration applications. In addition, numerous education and research institutions worldwide are engaged in basic research of CDC structure, synthesis, or (indirectly) their application for various high-end applications.

'''Chester Hjortur Thordarson''' (May 12, 1867 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1945) — born '''Hjörtur Þórðarson''' — was an [[Icelandic-American]] [[inventor]]  and manufacturer of electrical apparatus who eventually held nearly a hundred technology [[patent]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://washingtonisland-wi.com/chester-thordarson-rock-island/|title= Chester Thordarson &amp; Rock Island |publisher =Washington Island Chamber of Commerce|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://islandheritageconservancy.com/ihc-Thordarson.html
|title= Thordarson |publisher  = Washington Island Heritage Conservancy Corp|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; related to [[transformer]]s, [[inductors]], [[Electromagnetic coil|high voltage coils]], and more.

==Biography==
Thordarson immigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Iceland]] in 1873 with his parents Gudrun Grimsdotter and Thordur Arnason. In 1887, Thordarson took a job in [[Chicago, Illinois]] working for Chicago Edison Co. In 1895, he founded  the Thordarson Electric Manufacturing Company, a  manufacturing company in Chicago that produced industrial and commercial transformers. Thordarson's company is now called Thordarson Meissner, Inc. and has locations in [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]], and [[Henderson, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thordarsonmagnetics.com/history.php|title= Celebrating 120 Years Of Global Technology|publisher= Thordarson Meisner Inc|accessdate= April 25, 2016|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151205074613/http://www.thordarsonmagnetics.com/history.php|archivedate= December 5, 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/voyageur/archive_22_1_rockisland.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070307/http://www.uwgb.edu/voyageur/archive_22_1_rockisland.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was instrumental in the development of the modern energy transmission grid with his work in transformers.  He achieved his first distinction at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 World's Fair]] in St. Louis, where for the [[Purdue University]] exhibit he designed and built the first million-volt transformer. For his efforts he won the fair's gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fori.us/chester.htm|title= Chester H.

==Legacy==

===Rock Island===

In 1910, Thordarson began purchasing property on [[Rock Island (Wisconsin)|Rock Island]], an island off the tip [[Wisconsin]]'s [[Door Peninsula]].  Thordarson  established a private vacation retreat on Rock Island. He was intensely interested in preserving the island’s natural beauty.  In 1965 the state of Wisconsin purchased Rock Island from his heirs. Thordarson's former estate has been designated [[Rock Island State Park (Wisconsin)|Rock Island State Park]]. His buildings, including the [[Water Tower (Washington Island, Wisconsin)|water tower]], were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Thordarson Estate Historic District]] during 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/WI/Door/districts.html|title= Thordarson Estate Historic District  |publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://landmarkhunter.com/191024-thordarson-estate-historic-district/ |title= Thordarson Estate Historic District |publisher =Landmark Hunter |accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jsonline.com/features/travel/94616079.html|title=  Rock Island park offers raw beauty and a past preserved |publisher =   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|author=   Sharyn Alden|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book collection===
Thordarson bequeathed his book collection to the University of Wisconsin. The Thordarson collection was estimated to be worth one million dollars in 1945 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1945}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} and led to the establishment of the rare books room of the University of Wisconsin Memorial Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999931225502121|title=   Thordarson Collection |publisher =  Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System|accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''U.W. Library News'', March 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Jen Christian Bay, a member of the [[Bibliographical Society of America]], commented on the collection in 1929:&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hagedorn, "Bibliotheca Thordarsoniana: The Sequel," in PAPERS of the Bibliographical Society of America, Vo. 44 (Q1, 1950). Dr. Bay's essay later formed a chapter in the Fortune of Books, (Chicago, 1941), 105-121&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Of [[William Copland]], ''The Craft of Grafting'' (1560), two copies are known, one in the Thordarson Collection"
*"Of the greatest [herbal] of all, the ''Hortus Sanitatis'', Mr. Thordarson's copy of the edition of 1561 is a remarkably beautiful copy...."
*[Of the 1540 ''A Boke of the Proertyes of Herbes'':] "This book is one of Mr. Thordarson's discoveries;  no copy is known in any other library."
*[Of H. Baker's ''The Wellspring of Sciences'':] "The [[British Museum]] seemingly possesses no copy with an earlier date then 1574.  Mr Thordarson's copy [of 1564] seems unique."

==Awards==
Among his awards and honors, the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]]  and the [[University of Iceland]]  conferred  honorary doctorate degrees. He was awarded medals from the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in 1904 and the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] in 1916. King [[Christian X of Denmark]] presented Thordarson with the [[Order of the Falcon]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://washingtonisland-wi.com/|title=   Chester Thordarson’s Rock Island  |publisher=  Voyageur|author=    Tim Sweet  |date=  2005  |accessdate= April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport of colloidal particles in surface [[soil]]s and in the [[soil|ground]] can also occur, depending on the [[soil structure]], [[soil compaction]], and the [[Particle size (grain size)|particles size]], but the importance of colloidal transport was only given sufficient attention during the 1980 years.&lt;ref&gt;

Radionuclides, heavy metals, and organic pollutants, easily [[sorption|sorb]] onto colloids suspended in water and that can easily act as contaminant carrier. 

Various types of colloids are recognised: inorganic colloids ([[clay]] particles, silicates, [[ferrihydrite|iron oxy-hydroxide]]s, ...), organic colloids ([[humic acid|humic]] and [[fulvic acid|fulvic]] substances). When heavy metals or radionuclides form their own pure colloids, the term "''[[Eigencolloid]]''" is used to designate pure phases, e.g., Tc(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, U(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Am(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Colloids have been suspected for the long range transport of plutonium on the [[Nevada Test Site|Nevada Nuclear Test Site]]. They have been the subject of detailed studies for many years. However, the mobility of inorganic colloids is very low in compacted [[bentonite]]s and in deep clay formations&lt;ref&gt;

[[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)]] modeling and simulation for [[Phase-change material|phase change materials (PCMs)]] is a technique to analyze the performance and behavior of PCMs. The CFD models have been successful in studying and analyzing the air quality, natural ventilation and stratified ventilation, air flow initiated by buoyancy forces and temperature space for the systems integrated with PCMs. Simple shapes like flat plates, cylinders or annular tubes,fins, macro- and micro-encapsulations with containers of different shape are often modeled in CFD software's to study.

Typically the CFD models generally include [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynold’s Averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS)]] modeling and [[Large eddy simulation|Large Eddy Simulation (LES)]]. Conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy [[Navier–Stokes equations|(Navier – Stokes)]] are linearised, discretised, and applied to finite volumes to obtain a detailed solution for field distributions of air pressure, velocity and temperature for both indoor spaces integrated with PCMs.

==Governing Equations==

===Mass Equation===

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = S_m&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''ρ'' is fluid [[density]],
*''t'' is time,
*'''u''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[vector field]]
*'''S_m''' is a Constant.

===Energy Equation===
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

{\partial(\rho{\mathbf H})\over\partial t}+
{\partial \over\partial x_j}{(\rho*u_j*c_p*{\mathbf T})}= {\partial \over\partial x_j} (\lambda \cdot {\partial{\mathbf T}\over\partial x_j})+\mathbf{S_E}

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''ρ'' is the fluid [[mass density]],
*'''S_E''' is the source term.

===Navier Stokes equation===
&lt;math&gt;\rho\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}+u_j\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} \right)=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i}+\mu\frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j\partial x_j}+f_i &lt;/math&gt;

Here '''f''' represents "other" [[body force]]s (per unit volume), such as [[gravity]] or [[centrifugal force]].  The [[shear stress]] term &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\mathsf{T}}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vector Laplacian]].

=== Boussinesq eddy-viscosity approximation ===
:&lt;math&gt;-\overline{\upsilon_i^\prime \upsilon_j^\prime} = 2\nu_tS_{ij}-\frac{2}{3}K\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations#Derivation of RANS equations|mean rate of strain tensor]]
*&lt;math&gt;\nu_t&lt;/math&gt; is the turbulence eddy viscosity
*&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{2}\overline{\upsilon_i' \upsilon_i'}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[turbulence kinetic energy]]
*and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Assumptions==
commonly used assumptions are
*Incompressible fluid,
*Boussinesq approximation (density is considered constant, except in the gravity forces term).
*Constant thermo-physical properties (properties of solid and liquid states are assumed to be equal)

==Phase Change Model==
Two main thermal characteristics of phase change are the enthalpy-temperature relationship and temperature hysteresis. PCMs tend to have varying enthalpy temperature relationships due to the fact that they are blends of different materials, but pure PCMs have a more localized relationship, which can be approximated by single values for the enthalpy and phase change temperature.

Hysteresis is the phenomenon which causes the PCM to melt and freezes in different temperature ranges and with different enthalpies,which results in a different temperature-enthalpy curve for melting and freezing. Hysteresis is related to the chemical and kinetic properties of the material.

The commonly used enthalpy-porosity model in commercial CFD codes assumes, a linear enthalpy-temperature relationship and ignores hysteresis.[8]

The alternate is to use enthalpy-porosity method. When used to simulate PCM sails and a PCM plate-fin unit it produce reasonable temperature prediction in global space temperature terms. However there are inaccuracies in transient simulations where time dependent PCM and local wall and air temperatures are of interest. This is over come by use of source terms that considers hysteresis and varying enthalpy-temperature relationship. [9][10]

[[CFD-DEM model]] are also used sometimes. Phase motion of discrete solids or particles is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navier–Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).[http://www.cfdem.com/ CFDEMcoupling (DCS Computing GmbH)] is one such open source toolbox for CFD-DEM coupling.
==Process==
The Governing equations are discretized using an explicit Finite Volume Method. The velocity-pressure coupling is resolved by adopting a Fractional Step Method. The adoption of the enthalpy method allows working with a fixed grid instead of an interface tracking method.

The momentum source term intended to model the presence of solid is only needed in the control volumes that contain solid and liquid, not in the pure solid containing volumes.

The final form of the source term coefficient('''S''')depends on the approximation adopted for the behavior of the flow in the “mushy zone” (where mixed solid and liquid states are present). However, in the case of constant phase change temperature, the solid-liquid interface should be of infinitesimal width (although it cannot be thinner than one control volume width in our simulations); therefore,the formulation used for the source term is not very important in a physical sense, as long as it manages to bring the velocity to zero in mostly solid control volumes and to vanish if the volume contains pure liquid.[11]

== Applications ==
*'''CFD applications for latent thermal energy storage in PCM'''
The various CFD codes[1-3]  has been employed for the modeling and simulation of the PCM system to understand the heat transfer mechanism, solidification and melting process, distribution of temperature profile and prediction of the air flow. Various commercial packages have been coupled with the CFD analysis to appreciate the feasibility of evaluating the behavior of PCM integrated system.

*'''CFD modeling in PCM in mobilized thermal energy storage'''
The simulated heat transfer behavior of the PCM in Mobilized Thermal Energy Storage, during the charging process can be successfully conducted by CFD modeling [4] The Volume-Of-Fluid(VOF) method is employed to solve for the temperature distribution in the multiphase, 2-dimensional pressure-based model. It accounts for the heat transfer mechanism, melting time, and the influence of the structure in charging process using Fluent 12.1. The governing equations employed are mass conversion and continuity equations.

*'''CFD analysis on selection of geometry and type of PCM to be used'''
Integral, quasi-1D calculations have been reported [5] mainly for conduction-dominated problem using CFD simulation. It was reported that out of three geometries (cubic, cylindrical and spherical), the spherical capsule will have the maximum heat for the heat transfer fluid. Also it is concluded that salt hydrates based PCMs are the better choice over organic PCMs.

*'''CFD analysis on PCM in shell and tube latent thermal heat storage system'''

The systems are developed in such manner that phase change materials are in the shell portion of the module and passage for the flow of air through the tubes. Conjugate steady state CFD heat transfer analysis has been carried out [6] to analyze the flow and temperature variation of heat transfer fluid in the system. It paves the way for selection and assessment of the geometrical and flow parameters, PCM solidification characteristics for the given boundary conditions

The comparative analysis, to further enhance the effectiveness of shell and tube PCMs has also been accomplished via CFD analysis[7]. Various CFD models with different configuration such as pins embedded on a tube with heat transfer fluid (HTF) flowing in it, with PCM surrounding the tube, fins embedded instead of pins and different configurations of fins on the tube are analyzed, by employing ANSYS code.

'''Crosswind kite power''' is [[power (physics)|power]] derived from a class of airborne wind-energy conversion systems (AWECS, aka AWES) or crosswind kite power systems (CWKPS) characterized by a [[Kite types|kite]] system that has [[energy]]-harvesting parts that fly transverse to the direction of the ambient wind, i.e., to [[crosswind]] mode; sometimes the entire wing set and tether set is flown in crosswind mode. These systems at many scales from toy to power-grid-feeding sizes may be used as [[high-altitude wind power]] (HAWP) devices or low-altitude wind power (LAWP) devices without having to use towers. Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system. A tethered wing, flying in crosswind at many times wind speed, harvests wind power from an area that is many times exceeding the wing’s own area. Crosswind kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines: access to more powerful and stable wind resource, high capacity factor, capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs, and no need for a tower. Additionally, the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency; the movement of crosswinding tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades. However, a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to crosswind and is a form of crosswind kite power. Miles L. Loyd furthered studies on crosswind kite power systems in his work "Crosswind Kite Power"&lt;ref name="Loyd"&gt;M. Loyd, [http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~highwind/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Loyd1980.pdf "Crosswind Kite Power"], J. Energy, vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 106-111, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980.  Some believe that crosswind kite power was introduced by P. Payne and C. McCutchen in their patent No. 3,987,987, filed in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3987987 Peter R. Payne, inventor, Self-erecting windmill]&lt;/ref&gt; however, crosswind kite power was used far before such patent, e.g., in target kites for war-target practice where the crosswinding power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners.&lt;ref&gt;[Target kites|http://robroy.dyndns.info/targetkites/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The crosswind kite power systems shown has a purpose to move the athlete fast downwind, upwind, and sometimes into the air to significant altitudes and distances. The wind is slightly slowed by such activity, as the CWKPS harvests energy from the wind. [[Kitesurfing|Kiteboarding]].]]

==Types of crosswind kite power systems (CWKPS)==
How a system extracts energy from the wind and transfers energy to useful purposes helps to define types of crosswind kite power systems. One typing parameter regards the position of the generator or pump or tasking line or device. Another typing parameter regards how the tethers of the tether set of the kite system are utilized; the tethers holding the kiting wing elements aloft may be used in various ways to form types; tethers may simply hold working wings aloft, or they may be pulling loads on the ground, or multitasking by sending aloft-gained electricity to ground receivers or by pulling loads or by being the tasking device itself as when used for pulling people or things or cutting or grinding things. Some types are distinguished by fast motion transfer or slow motion transfer. Typing of crosswind kite power system also occurs by the nature of the wing set where count of wings and types of wings matter to designers and users; a wing set might be in a train arrangement, stack configuration, arch complex, dome mesh, coordinating family of wings, or just be a simple single-wing with single tether. Types of crosswind kite power devices are also distinguished by scale, purpose, intended life, and cost level. Typing by economic success occurs; is the system effective in the energy or task market or not? Some CWKPS are a type called lifters; they are purposed just for lifting loads, perhaps humans; the type is frequented by the use of autorotating blades that appear then to look like helicopters. A single crosswind kite power system (CWKPS) may be a hybrid complex performing aloft energy generation while also performing ground-based work through tether pulling of loads. The crosswind kite power systems that involve fluttering elements are being explored in several research centers; [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]] is mined for energy conversion in a few ways. Researchers are showing types of CWKPS that are difficult to classify or type.

===Tether pulling of people or goods on boards, in hulls, with skis, etc.===
In the systems of this type of CWKPS, the pulling tether set drives the resisting people and objects to various points on the surface of water bodies or land or points in the atmosphere. In this type of crosswind kite power operation, the design of the resistive objects (people, boards, hulls, boats, ships, water turbines, air turbines, other wings) makes for further types. Crosswinding of the upper flying wings provide power to achieve certain final objectives. The objectives are found in such as kiteboarding, kite windsurfing, snowkiting, yacht kiting, freighter-ship sailing, kite boating,and free-flight soaring and jumping. A collection of researchers have explored the historic free-flight parakite realm to where crosswind flying of the systems' wings would enable free-flight in the atmosphere; fundamentally this is a kite-string set with a wing above and a wing as the resistive anchor set; control of the separate wing set, especially in crosswinding efforts mine the power of winds in different layers of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energykitesystems.net/0/FFAWE/index.html FFAWE Club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://energykitesystems.net/AndreaPapini/AeroKite.GIF Andrea Papini]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US20010025900 System and Method for Wind-powered Flight by Dale C. Kramer; he was not the first to concept of this method of flight, as such was describe in 1967 by Richard Miller in book Without Visible Means of Support; yet &amp;#91;https://archive.org/details/cu31924024020707 Gilbert Totten Woglom&amp;#93; in 1890s described the method primitively in a treatise ''Parakites : a treatise on the making and flying of tailless kites for scientific purposes and for recreation'' (1896).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tether pulling to drive generator or pump shafts===
In the systems of this type, an electrical generator, pump, or tasking line is installed on the ground.  There are two subtypes, with or without a secondary vehicle.
In the subtype without a secondary vehicle,"Yo-Yo" method, the tether slowly unwinds off a drum on the ground, due to the windward pull of the kite system's wing, while the wing travels crosswind, that is, left-right of the wind's ambient direction, along various paths, e.g., a figure-8 flight path, or optimized [[lemniscate]] paths, or circular paths (small or large radius). The turning drum rotates the rotor of the generator or pump through, perhaps, a high-ratio gearbox.  Periodically, the wing is depowered, and the tether is reeled in, or, using the crosswind for a constant pull, the tether is re-connected to a different section of the drum while the wing is traveling in a "downwind" cycle. In some systems two tethers are used instead of one.&lt;ref name="Loyd" /&gt;

In another subtype, a secondary vehicle is used. Such a vehicle can be a carousel, a car, railed cart, wheeled land vehicle, or even a ship on the water.  The electrical generator is installed on the vehicle.  The rotor of the electrical generator is brought in motion by the carousel, the axle of the car, or the screw of the ship, correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kim, C. Park, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2009.11.027 "Wind power generation with a parawing on ships, a proposal"], Energy, Int. J, vol. 35, p. 1425–1432, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onboard generator===
In the systems of this type, one or more flying blades and electrical generators are installed on the wing.  The relative airflow rotates the blades by way of [[autorotation]], an interaction with the wind, which transfer the power to the generators.  Produced electrical energy is transmitted to the ground through an electrical cable laid along the tether&lt;ref name="Loyd" /&gt; or integrated with the tether. The same blades are sometimes used for double purpose where they are propellers positively driven by costed electricity for launching or special landing or calm-air flight-maintaining purpose.

===Fast motion transfer with downwind ground receivers===
In this type, an electrical generator is installed on the ground and a separate cable or belt, trailing behind the wing, transfers the power to a sprocket on the ground, which rotates the rotor of the generator.  The separate belt extends at approximately the speed of the wing.  Because of the high speed of that belt, the gearbox is not required.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;L. Goldstein, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.087 "Theoretical analysis of an airborne wind energy conversion system with a ground generator and fast motion transfer"], Energy, Int. J, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion transfer with upwind ground receivers===
In this type an electrical generator, pump, tasking line set, or lever is installed on the ground upwind of the wing and driven by the operation of two or three or more tethers arranged from a fast-moving crosswinding flying wing set. Examples are found in the research centers of several universities and kite-energy research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSWORXEy3tE OrthoKiteBunch (kite electricity generator, wind kite)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ilG78cBLg Rotokite, wind generator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-041608-165842/unrestricted/Kite_Power_for_Heifer_Internationals_Overlook_Farm_IQP.pdf Kite Power for Heifer International’s Overlook Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lighter-than-air (LTA) assisted twin-coordinating wing sets====
Several research centers are exploring twin wing sets employing tether pulling of upwind ground-based loads where the crosswinding wing sets use lighter-than-air devices to assure flight in case of lulls in the ambient wind.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9bY-w7pRxs Twind]&lt;/ref&gt;

====LTA-kite-balloon-lofted fast-moving autorating bladed turbine with upwind receiver of electricity====
Many in-public-domain patent disclosed teachings and some current research centers are with a focus on using LTA kites to hold bladed turbines using autorotation to drive flown generators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm4Vu-yEswo airborne wind turbine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flutter-based crosswind kite power systems, fast-motion method===
When a wing element in a kite system is designed to have [[Aeroelastic_flutter#Flutter|flutter]] occur, then that fluttering may be harvested for energy to power various loads. In flutter, the wing element travels to crosswind and then reverses to travel to crosswind in a generally opposite direction; the frequency of cycles of reversed direction is high. Flutter in traditional aviation is usually considered a bad and destructive dynamic to be designed out of an aircraft; but in CWKPS, flutter is sometimes designed into the kite system for the specific purpose of converting the wind's kinetic energy to useful purposes; the fast motion of flutter is prized by some kite-energy systems development centers. Harvesting the energy of flutter in kite systems has been done in several ways. One way is to convert the flutter energy into sound, even pleasant sound or music; purposes vary from entertaining one person or a crowd of persons; bird-scaring has been an application. Jerking tether lines by the kite-flown fluttering elements to drive loads to make electricity has been done and is being explored. Pumping fluids by use of flutter-derived energy has been proposed in the kite-energy community. And having the fluttering wing made with appropriate materials and arrangement to be a direct electric-generator part, then electricity can be generated immediately; part of the fluttering wing that is formed to be a [[magnet]] flutters by conductive coils forms the parts of the [[electric generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://energykitesystems.net/KiteLab/flipwings.jpg FlipWings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsguy.org/downloads/FlexorTechnology.pdf Flexor Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://energykitesystems.net/KiteLab/hotwing8.jpg HotWings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triplepundit.com/2009/06/humdinger-wind-energy-what-the-flutter/ Humdinger Wind Energy – What the Flutter?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windmusik.com/html/litratur.htm Bibliography of Kite Musical - / Aeolian Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingfrog.com.au/bird_scarring.htm Bird Scaring]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traction by use of CWKPS===
CWKPS are used to move objects immediately over ice, snow, land, ponds, lakes, or oceans. The movement of objects may be done for various reasons: recreation, sport, commerce, industry, science, travel, mine-clearing, defense, offense, plowing, landscaping, etc. The multitude of kite systems flown to crosswind to move kite boarders, land sailors, kite surfers, kite boaters, yachts, ships, catamarans, kayaks, power kiters, kite buggies, kite skiers, kite water skiers, etc., is keeping kite-wing manufacturers busy. [[SkySails]] is a leader in saving fuel in the shipping industry by using CWKPS.

===Lifters using CWKPS===
In this type of CWKPS the fast-motion of the flying blades or wings harvest the wind's energy to power the lifting capacity of the system. Mass loads are sometimes close-coupled with the wing set; at other times the mass lifted is distributed along the tether set. A military use of this type involved the rotary-wing kites that appear to be helicopters (but are not) tethered by the kite line; a human observer gets lifted to high points for observation purposes; some of these were used in conjunction with submarine operations with the submarine's towing motion providing the apparent wind for the CWKPS. One example is the [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 330]]  Lift-and-place or lift-and-drop uses occur in this type; mass loads are lifted and then placed or dropped; this is done sometimes to overcome barriers or to save ground-transportation fuel costs. When the mass that is lifted is a generator coupled with the crosswinding blades, then the AWES type is changed; this change is the foundation for the focus of some current wind power companies; [http://www.drachen.org/bio/Dave-Lang David Lang] is carefully modelling such AWES in coordination with Grant Calverley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2011087541A2 Rotorcraft power-generation, control apparatus and method]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torque transfer over rotary tether CWKPS===
In this type, rotary cross wind kites drive rings around a guiding tether line. Since the rings are tied together and in tension, torsion can be transferred from the rotating kites to a ground generator. Rotary kite motion around a main lifted tether can rotates either the tether itself, a rotary tether set, or lines fixed across the axis of the main lift tether.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0qQxFlXu7t-X1FPX0phQzlNUlE Open Source Hardware AWES designs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://windswept-and-interesting.co.uk/ Windswept and Interesting]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2015 this method was the first to successfully complete the someawe.org 100*3 challenge &lt;ref&gt;http://www.someawe.org/topic/3/awe-challenge&lt;/ref&gt;
For a prototype demonstration see &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructables.com/id/Enjoy-a-nice-cup-of-kite-powered-tea/ Daisy kite designs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
In all types of the crosswind kite power system, the useful power can be approximately described by the Loyd’s formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P = {2 \over 27} \rho_a A C_L({C_L \over C_D})^2 V^3 &lt;/math&gt;

where P is power; C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; are coefficients of lift and drag, respectively; ρ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the air density at the altitude of the wing; A is the wing area and V is the wind speed.&lt;ref name="Loyd" /&gt; This formula disregards tether drag, wing and tether weights, change of the air density with altitude and angle of the wing motion vector to the plane, perpendicular to the wind.  A more precise formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;P = {2 \over 27} \rho_a A C_L G^2 V^3 &lt;/math&gt;

where G is the effective gliding ratio, taking into account the tether drag.&lt;ref&gt;B. Houska, M. Diehl, [http://cdn.syscop.de/publications/Houska2006.pdf "Optimal Control of Towing Kites"], in Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, San Diego, US, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: a system with a rigid wing, having dimensions 50 m x 2 m and G=15 in the 12&amp;nbsp;m/s wind will provide 40 MW of electric power. 

Where is a citation of the example? The Loyds papers formula does not show it in thowse simple terms. What is CL What is Pa Where does 2/27 come from? How can this be scaled to loyds c5-a example? 

50Mx2M =100m^2 2/27=0.07407407 pa=1.225 kg/m^3 P=9.074074*CL*G^2*V^3 g^2=225 v^3= 1728 P=9.074074*CL*388800 P=3527999.97*CL CL=0.0882

==Control of crosswind-kite-power source==
Depending on the final application of a crosswind-kite-power source, appropriate [[Kite control systems|kite control]] methods are involved. Human control exercised during the full flight session is exampled in crosswind stunt kiting and kiteboarding; the same has been in place for some electricity-producing crosswind-kite-power source, e.g., by [http://flygenkite.com/ Pierre Benhaiem of France]. When the crosswind-kite-power source becomes too large to handle, then companies are building both human-assisted devices and also fully autonomous robotic control systems. Also, there has been demonstrated fully passive crosswind-kite-power source where natural frequencies of a system do permit the absence of human or robot controls; actually, anyone seeing a kited wing toss left and then right in constant motion is seeing a primitive passively controlled crosswind-kite-power source. Advances in computers, sensors, kite steering units, and servo-mechanisms are being applied to attain full autonomy of the launching, flying, and landing of crosswind-kite-power source that are aiming for the utility-scale energy-production market.

==Challenges==
Some sectors of crosswind kite power are already commercially robust; the sport low altitude traction industry is one of those sectors; toy sport crosswind kite power systems kept at low altitude must remain safe. But the sectors of high altitude larger CWKPS aiming for utility-scale electrical production to compete against other forms of energy production must overcome various challenges to achieve mainstream acceptance. Some of the challenges are regulatory permissions, including use of airspace and land; safety considerations; reliable operation in varying conditions (day, night, summer, winter, fog, high wind, low wind, etc.); third-party assessment and certification; lifecycle cost modeling.&lt;ref&gt;F.Felker [http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/49409.pdf  "Engineering Challenges of Airborne Wind Technology"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early the 1800s witnessed George Pocock using control of kite system wings to crosswind to good effect. In early the 1900s Paul Garber would produce high speed wings by two-line controls to give targets for aircraft gunners. Crosswind kite power was brought again into focus when Miles L. Loyd carefully described the mathematics and potential of crosswind kite power in 1980.  In 1980 it was not possible to create an economical automatic control system to control the wings of a kite system, though passive control of crosswinding kite systems had been ancient.  With the advance of computational and sensory resources fine control of the wings of a kite system became not only affordable, but cheap.  In the same time significant progress was made in the materials and wing construction techniques; new types of flexible [[Leading edge inflatable kite|kites with good L/D ratio]] have been invented.  Synthetic materials suitable for the wing and tether became affordable; among those materials are [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]], [[carbon fiber]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PETE]], and [[rip-stop nylon]].  A large number of people became engaged in the sports of [[kitesurfing]], kiteboarding, [[kite buggying]], [[snowkiting]], and [[power kiting]]. Multiple companies and academic teams work on crosswind kite power.  Most of the progress in the field has been achieved in the last 10 years.

==Prospects for crosswind kite power==
Current trends in CWKPS sectors will have their follow-on stories. Enthusiasm seems to be at a high level among over a thousand workers in the crosswind kite power realm that includes scales from toy scale to utility-grid. Speculation for traveling and moving goods without fuel around the world by use of CWKPS is envisioned both by systems staying connected to the ground and some systems fully disconnected from the ground. Objectives for the future discussed in the literature regard CWKPS facing toy, sport, industry, science, commerce, energy for electrical grid, sailing, and a host of other tasking applications. For CWKPS to compete with [[solar energy]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[fossil fuels]], conventional [[wind power]], DWKPS, or other [[renewable energy]] sources, the [[levelized cost of energy]] from CWKPS will need to become competitive, proven, made known, and adopted; during CWKPS march into the future, other competing sectors will be advancing also. The variety of configurations of kite systems that will fly wings to crosswind for the enhanced power is expected to grow; however, for specific purposes and applications, some winning formats are expected to eventually shine. Placing wing elements that fly to crosswind on huge lofted rope-based arches or even net domes is being researched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/kitepowerresearch/ Public Kite Power Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://energykitesystems.net/AWEstakeholders/index.html AWE Stakeholders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents that involve crosswind kite power==
The are two sectors of crosswind kite power patents, those that have placed some technology into the public domain and those that are within protection periods and perhaps have valid claims. Crosswind kite power teachings in each patent are part of what is reviewed by the crosswind kite power research and development community and interested readers.

This patent activity was part of the growing crosswind kite power surge that is still occurring. The inflated leading edge and inflated struts permitted aggressive mining of the wind with crosswind motions and water relauchability.  Similar structure technology is being used in some AWES crosswind kite power research centers around the world.

==Scale of crosswind kite power systems==
Crosswind kite power systems are found in toy [[power kiting|power kites]], sport power kites, and experimental-handy sizes; proposed by research centers are huge utility-grid-power-feeding sizes. The power gained in toy sizes is used to excite product users; two-line and four-line crosswind toy kite-power systems fill kite festival skies. Serious sport crosswind kite power systems drive the movement of athletes around race courses in local and national competitions.  Experimental-handy sizes of crosswind kite power systems are explored while furthering research toward utility-scale systems.

==Timeline of uses and progress of crosswind kite power==
[[File:Aviation in Britain Before the First World War RAE-O979.jpg|thumb|Aviation in Britain Before the First World War RAE-O979. This illustrates a non-CWKPS with harvested energy used to lift a man while the wing set refrains from using crosswind dynamics.]]
Crosswind kite power has been put to various uses throughout history. And the variety of devices that produce crosswind kite power have a historical progression. A simple kite system sitting passively without crosswind kite [[power production]] is contrasted with kite systems that fly crosswind producing greater harvesting of energy from the wind's [[kinetic energy]]. For perspective, a timeline of crosswind kite power uses and device progress may aid in understanding crosswind kite power.
* 2013: In May 2013, Google acquired a California company developing systems with onboard generators flown to crosswind in circular paths using a hybrid aircraft that double-purposes flying blades as turbine blades as well as costed-energy propellers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/inside-googles-secret-lab Inside Google's Secret Lab]&lt;/ref&gt; Their system is designed to operate as a powered aircraft when needed; the blades and generator are then converted to operate as propellers and motor.

* 1980: May–June: Miles L. Loyd of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California, published in the Journal of Energy, Vol. 4, No. 3, Article: No. 80-4075, Crosswind Kite Power.  He focused on flying the wings of kite systems "traverse" to the ambient wind; he noted that the crosswind airspeed of the wings would allow mining the involved kinectic energy for both keeping the wings flying as well as driving other loads for secondary purposes.
* 1820 circa: [[George Pocock (inventor)]] demonstrated control of kite-power system to crosswind to obtain energy to draw vehicle rapidly. Many will later consider him as a father of crosswind kite power that uses the harvested wind energy for traction purposes.

==Distinguish CWKPS from non-CWKPS==
Kite-power systems dedicated to operating without its energy-harvesting elements flying to crosswind are not CWKPS. Examples help to clarify the two branches of kite-power systems. A simple symmetrical two-stick diamond kite let out to downwind flight while the system's tether pulls to turn an at-ground generator shaft is producing energy for use by flying downwind without flying to crosswind; such is a non-CWKPS. Some hefty downwind kite-power systems (DWKPS) are proposed by serious researchers; some DWKPS instruction is found in the patent literature; one trend involves the opening and closing of pilot-kite-lifted opening-and-closing parachutes to drive generators.&lt;ref&gt;ZHANG, Jianjun and his [http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2010129124 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR UMBRELLA POWER GENERATION]&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that some CWKPS, such as Jalbert parafoil working in figure-8 patterns to turn a ground-stationed generator, could be commissioned to operate fully without flying to crosswind, and the resultant kite-power system would then be a DWKPS. Differently, the CWKPS proposed by users of the autorotating blades stay necessarily as CWKPS. Magenn Power's flip-wing kite-balloon is a DWKPS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nampet.org/resources/mars.html Magenn Air Rotor System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231040127/http://www.nampet.org/resources/mars.html |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar flip-wing rotating wings are DWKPS, e.g. that taught in [http://www.google.com/patents/US3079115 Edwards and Evan patent]. [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s legendary pond-crossing by kite power was a simple DWKPS; he was merely dragged downwind by a downwind-flying kite. A non-CWPKS is historically illustrated by a kite-power harvesting system such as was used by [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] for man-lifting with the involved wings set in stable downwind flight without flying to crosswind.

[[File:Baryte-121038.jpg|thumb|Baryte rose from [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma]] (size:10.2 x 7.1 x 5.5 cm)]]
[[File:Desert flower.jpg|thumb|upright|Large desert rose formation in the Tunisian desert]]
'''Desert rose''' is the colloquial name given to [[rose]]-like formations of crystal clusters of [[gypsum]] or [[baryte]] which [[Inclusion (mineral)|include]] abundant sand grains.&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-1268.html Desert rose on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The 'petals' are crystals flattened on the [[Crystallography|''c'' crystallographic axis]], fanning open in radiating flattened crystal clusters.

The rosette [[crystal habit]] tends to occur when the crystals form in arid sandy conditions,&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; such as the evaporation of a shallow salt basin. The crystals form a circular array of flat plates, giving the rock a shape similar to a rose blossom. Gypsum roses usually have better defined, sharper edges than baryte roses. [[Celestine (mineral)|Celestine]] and other bladed [[evaporite]] minerals may also form rosette clusters.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; They can appear either as a single rose-like bloom or as clusters of blooms, with most sizes ranging from [[pea]] sized to {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in diameter.

The ambient sand that is incorporated into the crystal structure, or otherwise encrusts the crystals, varies with the local environment. If [[iron oxides]] are present, the rosettes take on a rusty tone.

The desert rose may also be known by the names: sand rose, rose rock, [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] rose, gypsum rose and baryte (barite) rose.

==Locations==

Rose rocks are found in [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[Egypt]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Spain]] ([[Fuerteventura]], [[Canary Islands]]; [[Canet de Mar]], [[Catalonia]]; [[La Almarcha]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]), the United States (central [[Oklahoma]]; [[Cochise County, Arizona]]; [[Texas]]), [[Mexico]] ([[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), [[Australia]] and [[Namibia]]. Red River Floodway, Winnipeg Manitoba Canada 

===Formations in Oklahoma===
Rose rock in [[Oklahoma]] was formed during the [[Permian]] Period, 250 million years ago, when western and central Oklahoma was covered by a shallow sea.  As the sea retreated, baryte precipitated out of the water and crystallized around grains of quartz sand.  This left behind large formation of reddish [[sandstone]], locally called [[Garber Sandstone]], containing deposits of rose rock.&lt;ref name=okstate /&gt;

The rose rock was selected as the official rock of the US state of Oklahoma in 1968.&lt;ref name=okstate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=RO030 |title=ROSE ROCK |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
The average size of rose rocks are anywhere from {{convert|0.5|in|cm|1}} to {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in diameter. The largest recorded by the Oklahoma Geological Survey was {{convert|17|in|cm|0}} across and {{convert|10|in|cm|0}} high, weighing {{convert|125|lb|kg|0}}. Clusters of rose rocks up to {{convert|39|in|cm|0}} tall and weighing more than {{convert|1000|lb|kg|0}} have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelok.com/article_page/nobleistheroserockcapitaloftheworld |title=Noble is the Rose Rock Capital of the World |publisher=Oklahoma Tourism &amp; Recreation Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drammen Fjernvarme District Heating''' is a [[district heating]] system in [[Drammen]], [[Norway]], a regional capital some 65km west of [[Oslo]].

The heat pump was manufactured by Star Refrigeration in 2011&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31506073 BBC News, UK; Heat pumps extract warmth from ice cold water]&lt;/ref&gt; with 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 [[megawatt]]s to central [[Drammen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Big Interview: Dave Pearson, Star Refrigeration |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/knowledge-for-growth/the-big-interview-dave-pearson-star-refrigeration.1392892118 |date=20 February 2014 |author=Antony Akilade |newspaper=Herald Scotland |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing 85% of hot water needed for the city. The [[district heating]] system is owned and operated by [http://df.no/ Drammen Fjernvarme] who have the rights to the concession area given by the Drammen Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=District heating with 90% Renewable Energy |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/sub/framtidensbyer/the-participating-cities-/drammen/district-heating-with-90-renewable-energ.html?id=548229 |publisher=Kommunal- og moderniseringsdepartementet |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires all new buildings larger than 1000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to be built with a water-based heating system and connected to the district heating system.

The heat pump uses the natural refrigerant [[ammonia]] that has a zero [[global warming potential]] and is not a [[greenhouse gas]]. The heat source is seawater that is taken in around 8 or 9&amp;nbsp;°C from a depth of 18&amp;nbsp;m and is cooled by low pressure liquid [[refrigerant]]. Using a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, the system heats district water from 65&amp;nbsp;°C to 90&amp;nbsp;°C for use in building heating and hot water systems. The system has an average [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) of 3.0 which means 1 unit of electricity is combined with 2 units of heat from the seawater to provide 3 units of heat to the district heating circuit. With the low cost of hydro-based electricity, it is cheaper to run a heat pump than a gas or electric boiler. In addition, the compressor technology used in the Drammen heat pump is the single screw compressor from Vilter (Emerson). Its internal design allows for balanced forces allowing it to perform with a very long bearing life at more than 120,000 hours for normal refrigeration compressors. &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, &amp; Pearson, D. 2011.

Presented at Institute of Refrigeration, 7 April, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat is extracted from a local [[fjord]] whose water temperature is around 8&amp;nbsp;°C. The water is heated from recovered energy at a temperature of 120&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://df.no/dokumenter/content/text_22eef578-b645-45cb-8c08-e5d1ba626be0/1403186536844/tekniske_bestemmelser_df2012.pdf Company Technical document in Norwegian, page 10)]&lt;/ref&gt; A city ordinance requires most new buildings to exploit this form of heating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31506073 BBC News, UK; Heat pumps extract warmth from ice cold water]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AT1402 map.png|thumbnail]]
'''East African mangroves''' are an [[ecoregion]] consisting of [[mangrove]] swamps along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast of East Africa in southern [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]] and southern [[Somalia]].

==Location and description==
The ecoregion consists of two large areas of mangove in the deltas of the [[Zambezi]] in Mozambique and the [[Rufiji River]] in Tanzania, which can extend as far as 50&amp;nbsp;km inland, as well as smaller areas along the coast. This coast experiences two [[monsoon]] seasons each year, strong ocean currents and rising seas up to 5.6m in Mozambique. Rainfall is high especially in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=East African mangroves|id=at1402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The mangroves include tall trees, up to 30m. Compared to [[Central African mangroves]] of West Africa, mangroves of East Africa have a greater variety of vegetation with two distinctive types: the mangroves on the coast itself such as the birdwatching site Mida Creek near the [[Arabuko Sokoke National Park]] and the town of [[Watamu]], and the [[Lamu Archipelago]] both in Kenya, which are fed by constant streams of fresh water; and the mangroves in river inlets where more salt accumulates in the water. East African mangrove species are similar to those found on other coasts around the Indian Ocean. The [[Bazaruto Archipelago]] is an example of offshore mangroves sheltered by coral and intermingled with a mixture of shoreline habitats such as grassy sand dunes and rockpools.

==Fauna==
The mangroves are an important habitat for a variety of wildlife from fish [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusc]]s in the waters to snakes and monkeys such as [[Sykes' monkey]] in the trees and animals including [[antelope]]s, [[elephant]]s and [[African buffalo]] who come to graze on the fringes of the swamps. Larger animals that feed in the swamp waters include [[hippopotamus]], green turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]''), hawksbill turtle (''[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]''), and olive ridley (''[[Lepidochelys olivacea]]'') [[turtle]]s,  [[porpoise]]s and important populations of the endangered [[dugong]]. Located alongside coral reefs, these mangroves are sheltered by the coral from ocean tides and storms, and the swamps provide food for the many fish, shrimps and other marine fauna that shelter in the coral. The swamps are also important feeding grounds for large numbers of migratory birds such as curlew sandpiper (''[[Calidris ferruginea]]''), little stint (''[[Calidris minuta]]'') and Caspian tern (''[[Hydroprogne caspia]]''), waterbirds such as crab-plover (''[[Dromas ardeola]]''), [[yellow-billed stork]] and [[malachite kingfisher]], and seabirds such as roseate tern (''[[Sterna dougallii]]'').

==Threats and preservation==
The mangroves have been harvested for timber for centuries by traders from the nearby [[Arabian Peninsula]]. All along the coast mangrove swamps have been cleared, not only for timber but for urban areas, salt panning and agriculture including rice growing and shrimp cultivation. The habitat is further diminished by pollution of rivers from urban and industrial waste and agrochemicals. Urban areas near the mangroves include: the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] town of [[Lamu]], the beach town of [[Malindi]] and the large port city of [[Mombasa]] in Kenya; the port of [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] in Tanzania; and [[Quelimane]], the large city of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] (famous for its prawns), [[Inhassoro]] and [[Vilankulo]] (the ports for Bazaruto), and [[Maxixe, Mozambique|Maxixe]] in Mozambique. 

Protected areas include [[Watamu Marine National Park]] and Ras Tenewi Marine National Park in Kenya; [[Mafia Island Marine Park]], [[Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park]] and [[Saadani National Park]] in Tanzania; and the Bazaruto Archipelago, [[Inhaca Island|Inhaca]] and Portuguese Island, [[Marromeu Game Reserve]], and Pomene Reserve in Mozambique. Also some areas of mangrove in Kenya and Tanzania are managed as forest reserves.

'''Edward Hubert Cunningham Craig''' (sometimes '''Cunningham-Craig''') [[FRSE]] FGS (1874-1946) was a Scottish geologist and cartographer. He is remembered for extensive mapping as part of [[HM Geological Survey]] 1896 to 1907. He was an expert at finding new oil-fields in the early 20th century and worked across the planet in this role.

==Life==

He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the son of Edward Cunningham Craig and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Pattison,&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/61092&lt;/ref&gt; on 22 April 1874.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/archives/pioneers/pioneers.cfc?method=viewRecord&amp;personId=50&amp;currentTab=tab_C&lt;/ref&gt; His father died shortly before he was born.
He attended [[Glenalmond College]] in [[Perthshire]] and from 1892 studied Geology at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: E H C Craig&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1893.

He received a post mapping for [[HM Geological Survey]] in 1896. He was promoted to head Geologist on 1 April 1901. From 1903  until 1905 he made official maps of the island of [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]] as government geologist. From 1907 until death he worked for the [[Burmah Oil]] Company. His task here was largely on the location of oil fields. He found six especially important oil fields in Persia at Masjed-e-Suleiman in 1908. From 1910 to 1912 he sought oil fields in [[Baluchistan]]. In 1912 he found fields in [[Venezuela]] and in 1913 fields in [[South Africa]]. He also spent time in Canada ([[Manitoba]], [[Alberta]] and [[New Brunswick]]) searching for both oil and coal-fields.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: E H Cunningham Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1916. His proposers were [[John Horne]], [[Ben Peach]], Sir [[John Smith Flett]] and [[James Currie (botanist)|James Currie]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]] he worked with the director of supply for the factory production of poison gas, then, from 1917, was appointed Senior Geologist in petroleum research to the Ministry of Munitions.

After the war he found oil variously and sequentially in [[Egypt]], [[Ecuador]], the [[East Indies]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Estonia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Java]], the [[United States]] and [[Turkey]].

In late life he lived at The Dutch House in [[Beaconsfield]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U224209&lt;/ref&gt;
He died on 24 April 1946 at Kinellan Nursing Home in [[Beaconsfield]].

==Family==

He was married to Anna Irene Cleaver in 1910. They had no children.

'''Ernsthof Solar Park''' is a [[photovoltaic power station]] near Dörlesberg, [[Wertheim am Main|Wertheim]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101000000/http://www.pvresources.com/PVPowerPlants/Top50.aspx |date=January 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a capacity of 34.4&amp;nbsp;MWp making it the largest Solar Park in the state of Baden-Württemberg.  Phase I of 6.88 MWp and covering an area of {{convert|16.6|ha}}, consisted of 31,280 modules by LDK Solar Energy Systems was completed on March 30, 2010. The second phase of 7.25 MWp was completed in December 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecos-energy.de/projekte/solarpark-ernsthof.html Solarpark Ernsthof]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was expanded to 29.5 MW and then to 34.4 MW, with over 120,000 modules being fitted in December. Ernsthof East is 6.8 MW and Ernsthof West is 27.5 MW. The total area is {{convert|85|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}}. Ernsthof is part of the Tauberlandpark, a planned 72 MW solar park consisting of Ernsthof and Solarpark Gickelfeld (28 MW), which has been delayed due to the political uncertainty of solar parks of over 10 MW receiving the [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|FIT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/tauberlandpark-teilprojekte-des-solarparks-ernsthof-in-betrieb-15399 Teilprojekte des Solarparks Ernsthof in Betrieb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tauberlandpark.de/ProjektInformationen.asp?M=2&amp;F=Off Der Tauberlandpark - solare Energie im Einklang mit der Natur]&lt;/ref&gt; They may need, instead, to sign a [[Power Purchase Agreement]] with the [[Electricity sector in Germany#Grid|grid distribution power company]], which is better than subdividing large projects into multiple smaller segments just to qualify for the FIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmlink.com/article.cgi?type=Magazine&amp;title=Going%20Solar%3A%20Why%20Power%20Purchase%20Agreements%20Are%20a%20Low-risk%20Choice&amp;pub=FMJ&amp;id=40674&amp;mode=source Going Solar: Why Power Purchase Agreements Are a Low-risk Choice]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''feller buncher''' is a type of [[harvester (forestry)|harvester]] used in [[logging]]. It is a motorized vehicle with an attachment that can rapidly gather and cut a tree before felling it.

''Feller'' is a traditional name for someone who cuts down trees,&lt;ref&gt;"Feller". def. 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and ''bunching'' is the skidding and assembly of two or more trees.&lt;ref&gt;Dunster, Julian A., and Katherine Jane Dunster. ''Dictionary of natural resource management''. Vancouver, BC: UBC Press, 1996. 157. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard [[heavy equipment]] base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a [[chain-saw]], [[circular saw]] or a [[lopper|shear]]—a pinching device designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a [[skidder]], [[forwarder]], or [[yarder]] for transport to further processing such as [[delimbing]], [[Log bucking|bucking]], loading, or [[woodchipper|chipping]].

Some wheeled feller bunchers lack an articulated arm, and must drive close to a tree to grasp it.

In [[cut-to-length logging]] a harvester performs the tasks of a feller buncher and additionally does delimbing and bucking.

As a result of the programs that were initiated in the Green Energy Hub, the air has become cleaner between the years 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name="canadafarmalamanc"&gt;Canadian Farmer's Almanac - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing levels of greenhouse gases from automobiles have ruined the balance caused by the overall cooling of the Earth's atmosphere in 2011.&lt;ref name="canadafarmalamanc"/&gt; [[Simcoe, Ontario|Simcoe]], an important community located in the Green Energy Hub, is 25 times less likely to face a major smog disaster when compared to major metropolitan cities like [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], and [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]] due to embracing environmental programs in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.simcoechamber.on.ca/community-info/climate.html| title = Climate facts about Simcoe, Ontario | publisher = Simcoe and District Chamber of Commerce| accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Jobs that come to the "Green Energy Hub" would be linked to [[solar power]] panels and the collection of the water that comes from [[rain]].&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"&gt;[http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2881974 "Communities buy into Green Energy Hub."] [http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/ Brantford Expositor]. Accessed February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This hub helps to respect the environment and brings benefits to those who participate in the movement.&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt; Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent in Norfolk County alone to assure a "greener" world for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolkbusiness.ca/key-sectors/green-energy-hub/ Green Energy Hub] at Norfolk Business&lt;/ref&gt; Norfolk County mayor Dennis Travale is one of the participants in the "Green Energy Hub.&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt;" [[Research and development]] jobs may emerge in the hub; replacing low-technology jobs that were eliminated in the 2000s due to the rising cost of Canadian labor. The purpose behind the Green Energy Hub program is to stop the exploitation of [[natural resource]]s so that future generations can enjoy them without the threat of 20-year droughts that [[global warming]] could bring to Southern Ontario.

At least 60% of the unemployed in the "Green Energy Hub" are under the age of 30.&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt; They have to go to larger cities such as [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Toronto]] in order to find well-paying jobs that allow them to support a household. While manufacturing jobs have disappeared from the local area within the past 20 years, there are promising careers in construction and a variety of technical vocations that may attract current Green Energy Hub residents to the Hamilton area.&lt;ref name=WHEREJOBS&gt;{{cite press release| title =Hamilton Next, Focus on the Future City: "Where the jobs are"| publisher =The Hamilton Spectator- Souvenir Edition page HN11| date = October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education and jobs are vital to sustain the needs of the youth who reside within the hub.&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt; Approximately 50,000 [[green-collar worker|green collar]] jobs may be created within the next five years; possibly replacing [[blue-collar worker|blue collar]] jobs.&lt;ref name="neighborsget"/&gt; Land in Ontario that is traditionally for [[Agricultural land|agricultural use]] may be affected by the "Green Energy Hub.&lt;ref name="neighborsget"/&gt;" This hub may become the central component in the [[sustainable energy]] grid of the future.&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt; As people learn to dispose less and sustain more of the environment around them, youthful businessmen will learn to take advantages of the economic potentials of the Green Energy Hub; allowing them to escape the welfare programs that currently entraps their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegreenhub.ca/brantford-brant-county-green-energy-hub.php About the ''Green Energy Hub''] at TheGreenHub.ca&lt;/ref&gt; These new jobs will be especially found in [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]];&lt;ref name="communitiesbuy"/&gt; where access to an established [[Brantford railway station|railroad link]] and future [[GO Transit]] terminus may guarantee the economic future of the region. Access to GO Transit service will be available by 2020;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotransit.com/public/en/docs/publications/Strategic_Plan_GO_2020_lowres.pdf |title=GO 2020 |author=GO Transit |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitating the flow of people who work in jobs related to the Green Energy Hub in addition to interurban trade to cities like [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Montreal]], Quebec.

Service sector jobs in the area generally are [[accounting|accountable]] for nature's services and integrate more easily with [[state services]] under a [[globalization|globalized trade system]].

===Economic recovery===
2,600 people have officially joined the Norfolk County workforce between June 2012 and June 2013. Businesses have been expanding throughout Norfolk County again; often hiring people two at a time. Innovative business running measures are also improving the quality of life for Norfolk County residents who are members of the workforce. The economy of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] along with the rest of the world may become further interconnected with the changing economy of the Green Energy Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/06/12/optimism-being-felt-in-norfolk |title=Optimism being felt in Norfolk |author=Daniel Pearce |date=June 2013 |work= |publisher=Simcoe Reformer |accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion jobs done at Toyotetsu Canada will add up to 100 Canadian jobs to a dying industry like manufacturing; bringing 500 local people into the labor force between 2006 and 2013. People throughout Canada have been buying [[Toyota]] vehicles more often considering that their MPG rating is greater than [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] vehicles. This serves as a positive sign for the Toyotetsu plant in addition to the Toyota plants in Cambridge and Woodstook; as the demand for Toyota parts increase dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/05/30/major-expansion-at-toyotetsu-plant-in-simcoe |title=Toyotetsu to begin expansion at Simcoe plant |author=Daniel Pearce |date=June 2013 |work= |publisher=Simcoe Reformer |accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most employers that are actually hiring people for jobs tend to shun people under the age of 25 in addition to certain male personality types, as they see them lacking in "proper" [[work experience]]. People who haven't worked in years likely haven't updated their [[résumé]]s in years; relegating them to "occasional worker" status and accepting jobs that pay very little compared to their old employment. New employment opportunities are not labelled for students; indicating the preference for local employers to hire "mature" people and/or females into their service sector jobs.

However, economic recovery has been complicated somewhat by Norfolk County banning the building of new wind turbines. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming "industrialized" and "unnatural." Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the surrounding area as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/05/14/norfolk-seeks-end-to-turbine-development| title = Norfolk Seeks End to Turbine Development| accessdate = 2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar panels on house roof winter view.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A grid-connected, residential [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|solar rooftop system]] near [[Boston]], USA]]

A '''grid-connected photovoltaic power system''', or '''grid-connected PV power system''' is an [[electricity]] generating [[photovoltaic system|solar PV power system]] that is connected to the [[utility grid]]. A grid-connected PV system consists of [[solar panel]]s, one or several [[solar inverter|inverter]]s, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment. They range from small residential and commercial [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop system]]s to large utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s. Unlike [[stand-alone power system]]s, a grid-connected system rarely includes an [[rechargeable battery|integrated battery solution]], as they are still very expensive. When conditions are right, the grid-connected PV system supplies the excess power, beyond consumption by the connected load, to the [[utility grid]].&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elhodeiby|first1=A.S.|last2=Metwally|first2=H.M.B|last3= Farahat|first3=M.A|date=March 2011|title=PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF 3.6 KW ROOFTOP GRID CONNECTED PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM IN EGYP|journal=International Conference on Energy Systems and Technologies (ICEST 2011)|pages=151–157|url=http://www.physicsegypt.org/icest2011web/icest11019.pdf|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Giant photovoltaic array.jpg|thumb|[[Photovoltaic power station]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], United States]]

Residential, grid-connected [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop system]]s which have a capacity more than 10 kilowatts can meet the load of most consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grid Connected PV Systems|url=http://en.acmepoint.com/products/grid-connected-pv-systems|publisher=Acmepoint Energy Services|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can feed excess power to the grid where it is consumed by other users. The feedback is done through a meter to monitor power transferred. Photovoltaic wattage may be less than average consumption, in which case the consumer will continue to purchase grid energy, but a lesser amount than previously. If photovoltaic wattage substantially exceeds average consumption, the energy produced by the panels will be much in excess of the demand. In this case, the excess power can yield revenue by selling it to the grid. Depending on their agreement with their local grid energy company, the consumer only needs to pay the cost of electricity consumed less the value of electricity generated. This will be a negative number if more electricity is generated than consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeowners Guide to Financing a Grid-Connected Solar Electric System|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/48969.pdf|publisher=DOE Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in some cases, cash incentives are paid from the grid operator to the consumer.

Connection of the photovoltaic power system can be done only through an interconnection agreement between the consumer and the utility company. The agreement details the various safety standards to be followed during the connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powernaturally.org/programs/solar/PhotoVoltaic.asp?i=1|title=Grid Connected Solar Electric - Photovoltaic (PV) Systems|publisher=powernaturally.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Solar energy gathered by photovoltaic solar panels, intended for delivery to a power grid, must be conditioned, or processed for use, by a grid-connected inverter. Fundamentally, an [[Power inverter|inverter]] changes the DC input voltage from the PV to AC voltage for the grid. This inverter sits between the solar array and the grid, draws energy from each, and may be a large stand-alone unit or may be a collection of small inverters, each physically attached to individual solar panels. See [[AC Module]]. The inverter must monitor grid voltage, waveform, and frequency. One reason for monitoring is if the grid is dead or strays too far out of its nominal specifications, the inverter must not pass along any solar energy. An inverter connected to a malfunctioning power line will automatically disconnect in accordance with safety rules, for example UL1741, which vary by jurisdiction. Another reason for the inverter monitoring the grid is because for normal operation the inverter must synchronize with the grid waveform, and produce a voltage slightly higher than the grid itself, in order for energy to smoothly flow outward from the solar array.

==Anti-islanding==
[[Image:PV-system urban home1.png|thumb|Diagram of a residential grid-connected PV system]]
{{Main|Islanding}}

[[Islanding]] is the condition in which a [[distributed generation|distributed generator]] continues to power a location even though power from the [[electric utility]] grid is no longer present. Islanding can be dangerous to utility workers, who may not realize that a circuit is still powered, even though there is no power from the [[Electric power transmission|electrical grid]]. For that reason, distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately stop producing power; this is referred to as anti-islanding.

In the case of a utility [[Power outage|blackout]] in a grid-connected PV system, the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as the sun is shining. In this case, the supply line becomes an "island" with power surrounded by a "sea" of unpowered lines. For this reason, [[solar inverter]]s that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them. In intentional islanding, the generator disconnects from the grid, and forces the distributed generator to power the local circuit. This is often used as a power backup system for buildings that normally sell their power to the grid.

There are two types of anti-islanding control techniques:

* ''Passive:'' The voltage and/or the frequency change during the grid failure is measured and a [[positive feedback]] loop is employed to push the voltage and/or the frequency further away from its nominal value. Frequency or voltage may not change if the load matches very well with the inverter output or the load has a very high quality factor (reactive to real power ratio). So there exists some ''Non Detection Zone'' (NDZ).
* ''Active:'' This method employs injecting some error in frequency or voltage. When grid fails, the error accumulates and pushes the voltage and/or frequency beyond the acceptable range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.wayne.edu/user_files/374/file/Quick_Upload/Grid_Interactive%20Solar%20Inverters_Anil%20Tuladhar.pdf|title=Grid-interactive Solar Inverters and Their Impact on Power System Safety and Quality|publisher=eng.wayne.edu|accessdate=2011-06-10|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Systems such as [[Net Metering]] and [[Feed-in Tariff]] which are offered by some system operators, can offset a customers electricity usage costs. In some locations though, grid technologies cannot cope with distributed generation feeding into the grid, so the export of surplus electricity is not possible and that surplus is earthed.
* Grid-connected PV systems are comparatively easier to install as they do not require a battery system.&lt;ref name=egypt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soe-townsville.org/data/Gridconnected_photovoltaic_systems.pdf|title=Grid-connected photovoltaic system|publisher=soe-townsville.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grid interconnection of photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems has the advantage of effective utilization of generated power because there are no storage losses involved.&lt;ref name=iea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=9&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=383|title=International Guideline For The Certification Of Photovoltaic System Components and Grid-Connected Systems|publisher=iea-pvps.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A photovoltaic power system is carbon negative over its lifespan, as any energy produced over and above that to build the panel initially offsets the need for burning fossil fuels. Even though the sun doesn't always shine, any installation gives a reasonably predictable average reduction in carbon consumption.

==Disadvantages==
* Grid-connected PV can cause issues with [[voltage regulation]]. The traditional grid operates under the assumption of one-way, or radial, flow. But electricity injected into the grid increases voltage, and can drive levels outside the acceptable bandwidth of ±5%.&lt;ref name="Challenges for Distribution Feeder Voltage Regulation with Increasing Amounts of PV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenges for Distribution Feeder Voltage Regulation with Increasing Amounts of PV|last1=Steffel|first1=Steve|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/hpsp_grid_workshop_2012_steffel_pepco.pdf|publisher=DOE Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grid-connected PV can compromise [[power quality]]. PV’s [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] nature means rapid changes in voltage. This not only wears out voltage regulators due to frequent adjusting, but also can result in voltage flicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Study on the Future of the Electric Grid|url=https://mitei.mit.edu/system/files/Electric_Grid_5_Impact_Distributed_Generation_Electric_Vehicles.pdf|website=MIT Energy Initiative|publisher=MIT|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connecting to the grid poses many protection-related challenges. In addition to islanding, as mentioned above, too high levels of grid-connected PV result in problems like relay desensitization, nuisance tripping, interference with automatic reclosers, and [[Ferroresonance in electricity networks|ferroresonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaur|first1=Gurkiran|title=Effects of Distributed Generation (DG) Interconnections on Protection of Distribution Feeders|journal=Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2006.|date=2006|doi=10.1109/PES.2006.1709551|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1709551|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4620">The '''Ground-Mobile Command Center''' was, or is, a [[U.S. Army]] program to develop and deploy hardened and secure, mobile command posts for use by the [[President of the United States]] to command retaliation and counterattack by the U.S. armed forces in response to a catastrophic assault against North America.

==Development and purpose==
The Ground-Mobile Command Center program was initiated in 1981. A predecessor program, the National Mobile Land Command Post (NMLCP), had been considered as far back as the 1960s, but was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priest|first1=Karl|title=Ghosts of the East Coast: Doomsday Ships|url=http://www.coldwar.org/museum/doomsday_ships.asp|website=coldwar.org|publisher=[[Cold War Museum]]|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by [[TRW Inc.]] under a government contract awarded during the administration of [[Ronald Reagan]], ground-mobile command centers were, or are, an army counterpart to the better-known "Nightwatch", the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[National Emergency Airborne Command Post]], a fleet of hardened aircraft designed to allow the president to remain airborne and mobile during a severe crisis to minimize the possibility of a [[decapitation strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coakley|first1=Thomas|title=Command and Control for War and Peace|date=1992|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0788108255|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrQtiwiRKZMC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pitt"/&gt; Ground-mobile command centers were, or are, 18-wheel [[tractor-trailers]] outfitted with defensive systems and sophisticated communications equipment that permits the president or his successor to directly command American nuclear retaliation against another nation while "on the road" in an irradiated and devastated post-attack environment. They were, or are, hardened to protect against [[electromagnetic pulse]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Force Modernization Programs: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Strategic and Theater Nuclear Forces of the Committee on Armed Services|date=1981|publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

Colloquially known as "doomsday trucks",&lt;ref name="pitt"/&gt; ground-mobile command centers were reportedly put into service and positioned in locations around the United States that were considered unlikely to be targeted in an initial nuclear volley launched by a warring state. According to one report these locations were in [[Colorado]] and [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="pitt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=MX Missile Basing|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=1428924507|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would be supported by co-located fuel depots and spare parts. As intended, the vehicles would not be the primary transportation mode for the president, but would rather be used only after the air evacuation of the [[National Command Authority]] from an area of danger at which point they would "gradually take over full command operations in the post-attack period".&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trucks Tested as Nuclear Strike Posts|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19850927&amp;id=JxwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kmIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7054,5945323&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|agency=Associated Press|date=27 September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar programs==
The [[United States Northern Command]] (USNORTHCOM) operates a "mobile consolidated control center" (MCCC) for use by the [[combatant commander]] (CCDR) as an "alternative HQ" for coordination of emergency and counteroffensive operations following a [[mainland invasion of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walter|first1=Sharp|title=Joint Publication 3–26.1: Homeland Defense|date=2005|publisher=[[United States Northern Command]]|page=B-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCCC consists of a convoy of trucks described as a "survivable, road-mobile backup" from which the CCDR can command U.S. military forces in repelling an attack, should primary and secondary facilities be destroyed or overrun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Critchlow|first1=Robert|title=CRS Report for Congress|date=2006|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/poni/060503_nuclear_command.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heptanoic acid''', also called '''enanthic acid''', is an [[organic compound]] composed of a seven-carbon chain terminating in a [[carboxylic acid]].  It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, [[Rancidification|rancid]] odor.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;  It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils.  It is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether.

==Production==
[[File:Ricinoleic acid.svg|thumb| left|[[Ricinoleic acid]] is the main precursor to heptanoic acid.]]
The methyl ester of [[ricinoleic acid]], obtained from [[castor bean oil]], is the main commercial precursor to heptanoic acid.  It is pyrolyzed to the methyl ester of [[10-undecenoic acid]] and [[heptanal]], which is then air oxidized to the carboxylic acid.  Approximately 20,000 tons were consumed in Europe and US in 1980.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J.

==Uses==
Heptanoic acid is used in the preparation of [[ester]]s, such as [[ethyl heptanoate]], which are used in fragrances and as artificial flavors.  Heptanoic acid is used to [[esterification|esterify]] steroids in the preparation of drugs such as [[testosterone enanthate]], [[trenbolone enanthate]], [[drostanolone enanthate]], and [[methenolone enanthate]] (Primobolan).

The [[triglyceride]] ester of heptanoic acid is the [[triheptanoin]], which is used in certain medical conditions as a nutritional supplement.

A '''hook echo''' is a pendant or hook-shaped [[weather radar]] signature as part of some [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]s.

== History ==

The hook echo was recognized as a sign of tornado development early in the history of weather radar. In 1949, E. M Brooks had referred to circulations having radii of approximately 8–16&amp;nbsp;km with supercells thunderstorms and named them tornado cyclones.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Brooks | first= E. M. |year = 1949 | title= The tornado cyclone | journal = [[Weatherwise]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 32–33 | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00431672.1949.9930047#.Ub4wNNjqR9M | doi= 10.1080/00431672.1949.9930047 | accessdate= Jun 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented tracking of a hook echo associated with a tornado was on April 9, 1953 by the Illinois State Water Survey near Urbana-Champaign. An experimental radar unit designed to measure rainfall was being tested by Donald Staggs, an electrical engineer, after Staggs had performed some work on the equipment. Staggs noticed an unusual echo associated with a local severe thunderstorm and began recording the incoming data. Later, it was found that a tornado had been present at the location corresponding to the echo.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, F.A., H.W. Hiser, and S.G. Bigler, 1954: [http://www.isws.illinois.edu/pubdoc/RI/ISWSRI-22.pdf Study of an Illinois tornado using radar, synoptic weather and field survey data].

[[Ted Fujita]] documented hook echoes associated with other supercells on the same day as Huff team made their observations. He inferred the concept of thunderstorm rotation from viewing the evolution of the hook echoes, which he studied in detail.&lt;ref name=Fujita&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Fujita | first= T.

Fulks was the first to hypothesize on the formation of hook echoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Fulks | first = J.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Supercell-above.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of air current in a supercell]]
Hook echoes are a reflection of the movement of air inside and around a supercell thunderstorm. Ahead of the base of the storm, the inflow from the environment is sucked in by the instability of the airmass. As it moves upward, it cools slower than the cloud environment, because it mixes very little with it, creating an echo free tube which ends at higher levels to form a [[bounded weak echo region]] or BWER.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

At the same time, a mid-level flow of cool and drier air enters the thunderstorm cloud. Because it is drier than the environment, it is less dense and sinks down behind the cloud and forms the [[rear flank downdraft]], drying the mid level portion of the back of the cloud. Those two currents have a rotation, due to the vertical windshear, and interact to form a [[mesocyclone]]. Tightening of the rotation due to the interaction of those two air currents near the surface will create the tornado.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

[[File:05june-dow7-wide.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Doppler on Wheels]] image of a tornadic thunderstorm near [[La Grange, Wyoming]] (USA) captured during the [[VORTEX2]] project. In the velocity image on the left, Blues/green represent winds moving towards the radar, and reds/yellows indicate winds moving away from the radar. In the reflectivity image on the right, the main body of the storm can be seen, with the appendage on the bottom of the storm being a hook echo.]]
Near the interaction zone at the surface, there will be a dry slot caused by the updraft on one side and the cloudy area below the rear flank downdraft on the other side. This is the source of the hook echo seen on radar near the surface. Hook echoes are thus a relatively reliable indicator of tornadic activity, however, they merely indicate the presence of a larger mesocyclone structure in the tornadic storm rather than directly detecting a tornado.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; During some destructive tornadoes, debris lofted from the surface may be detected as a "[[debris ball]]" on the end of the hook structure.

Not all thunderstorms exhibiting hook echoes produce tornadoes, and not all tornado-producing supercells contain hook echoes. Also, especially preceding the advent of the more advanced [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler weather radars]], by the time a hook echo could be detected a tornado had often already formed—especially when the storm was far away from the location of the radar.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The use of Doppler weather radar systems, such as [[NEXRAD]], allows for the detection of strong, low-level mesocyclones that produce tornadoes even when the hook echo is not present and also grant greater certainty when a hook echo is present. By detecting [[hydrometeor]]s moving toward and away from the radar location, the relative velocities of air flowing within different parts of a storm are revealed. These areas of tight rotation known as "velocity couplets" are now the primary trigger for the issuance of a tornado warning. The [[tornado vortex signature]] is an algorithm-based detection of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |  last = Paul Schlatter, Warning Decision Training Branch| title = WSR-88D Distance Learning Operations Course; Topic 5, Lesson 19| location = Online| accessdate = June 16, 2013| date = September 2009| url = http://www.wdtb.noaa.gov/courses/dloc/topic5/lesson19/player.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observational limitation ==

Hook echoes are not always obvious. Particularly in the [[Southern United States]], thunderstorms tend to take on a structure of more precipitation surrounding a mesocyclone, which leads to the high precipitation (HP) variation supercell that obscures the hook shape. HP supercells instead often have a high reflectivity pendent or front flank notch (FFN), appearing like a  "kidney bean" shape. Another limiting factor is radar resolution. Prior to 2008, [[NEXRAD]] had a range resolution of 1000m, while the processes which lead to a hook echo happen on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NWS Louisville: Supercell Structure and Dynamics|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/soo/docu/supercell.php|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid mechanics]] or more generally [[continuum mechanics]], '''incompressible flow''' ([[isochoric process|isochoric flow]]) refers to a [[fluid flow|flow]] in which the material [[density]] is constant within a [[fluid parcel]]—an [[infinitesimal]] volume that moves with the [[flow velocity]].  An equivalent statement that implies '''incompressibility''' is that the [[divergence]] of the flow velocity is zero (see the derivation below, which illustrates why these conditions are equivalent).

Incompressible flow does not imply that the fluid itself is incompressible.  It is shown in the derivation below that (under the right conditions) even [[compressible fluid]]s can – to a good approximation – be modelled as an incompressible flow.  Incompressible flow implies that the density remains constant within a parcel of fluid that moves with the flow velocity.

==Derivation==

The fundamental requirement for incompressible flow is that the density, &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;, is constant within a small element volume, ''dV'', which moves at the flow velocity '''u'''.   Mathematically, this constraint implies that the [[material derivative]] (discussed below) of the density must vanish to ensure incompressible flow.  Before introducing this constraint, we must apply the [[conservation of mass]] to generate the necessary relations.  The mass is calculated by a [[volume integral]] of the density, &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {m} = {\iiint\limits_V\! \rho \,\mathrm{d}V}. &lt;/math&gt;

The conservation of mass requires that the time derivative of the mass inside a control volume be equal to the mass flux, '''J''', across its boundaries.  Mathematically, we can represent this constraint in terms of a [[surface integral]]:

:{{oiint | preintegral = &lt;math&gt;{\partial m \over \partial t} = - &lt;/math&gt; | intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; | integrand = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; }}

The negative sign in the above expression ensures that outward flow results in a decrease in the mass with respect to time, using the convention that the surface area vector points outward.  Now, using the [[divergence theorem]] we can derive the relationship between the flux and the partial time derivative of the density:

:&lt;math&gt; {\iiint\limits_V {\partial \rho \over \partial t} \,\mathrm{d}V} =  {- \iiint\limits_V\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}\right) \, \mathrm{d}V}, &lt;/math&gt;

therefore:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \rho \over \partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}. &lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of the density with respect to time need not vanish to ensure incompressible ''flow''.  When we speak of the partial derivative of the density with respect to time, we refer to this rate of change within a control volume of ''fixed position''.  By letting the partial time derivative of the density be non-zero, we are not restricting ourselves to incompressible ''fluids'', because the density can change as observed from a fixed position as fluid flows through the control volume.  This approach maintains generality, and not requiring that the partial time derivative of the density vanish illustrates that compressible fluids can still undergo incompressible flow.  What interests us is the change in density of a control volume that moves along with the flow velocity, '''u'''.  The flux is related to the flow velocity through the following function:

:&lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{J}} = {\rho \mathbf{u}}.&lt;/math&gt;

So that the conservation of mass implies that:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + {\nabla \cdot \left(\rho \mathbf{u} \right)} = {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + {\nabla \rho \cdot \mathbf{u}} + {\rho \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \right)} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The previous relation (where we have used the appropriate [[vector calculus identities|product rule]]) is known as the [[Navier–Stokes equations#Equation of continuity|continuity equation]].  Now, we need the following relation about the [[total derivative]] of the density (where we apply the [[chain rule]]):

:&lt;math&gt; {\mathrm{d}\rho \over \mathrm{d}t} = {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + {\partial \rho \over \partial x} {\mathrm{d}x \over \mathrm{d}t} + {\partial \rho \over \partial y} {\mathrm{d}y \over \mathrm{d}t} + {\partial \rho \over \partial z} {\mathrm{d}z \over \mathrm{d}t}. &lt;/math&gt;

So if we choose a control volume that is moving at the same rate as the fluid (i.e. (''dx''/''dt'',&amp;nbsp;''dy''/''dt'',&amp;nbsp;''dz''/''dt'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''u'''), then this expression simplifies to the [[material derivative]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {D \rho \over Dt} = {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + {\nabla \rho \cdot \mathbf{u}}. &lt;/math&gt;

And so using the continuity equation derived above, we see that:

:&lt;math&gt; {D \rho \over Dt} = {- \rho \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;

A change in the density over time would imply that the fluid had either compressed or expanded (or that the mass contained in our constant volume, ''dV'', had changed), which we have prohibited.  We must then require that the material derivative of the density vanishes, and equivalently (for non-zero density) so must the divergence of the flow velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; {\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

And so beginning with the conservation of mass and the constraint that the density within a moving volume of fluid remains constant, it has been shown that an equivalent condition required for incompressible flow is that the divergence of the flow velocity vanishes.

==Relation to compressibility==

In some fields, a measure of the incompressibility of a flow is the change in density as a result of the pressure variations. This is best expressed in terms of the [[compressibility]]

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = {\frac{1}{\rho}} {\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the compressibility is acceptably small, the flow is considered incompressible.

==Relation to solenoidal field==
An incompressible flow is described by a [[solenoidal]] flow velocity field.  But a solenoidal field, besides having a zero [[divergence]], also has the additional connotation of having non-zero [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] (i.e., rotational component).

Otherwise, if an incompressible flow also has a curl of zero, so that it is also [[irrotational field|irrotational]], then the flow velocity field is actually [[Laplacian field|Laplacian]].

== Difference from material ==
As defined earlier, an incompressible (isochoric) flow is the one in which 
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0. \, &lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to saying that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the [[Substantive derivative|material derivative]] of the density is zero. Thus if we follow a material element, its mass density remains constant. Note that the material derivative consists of two terms. The first term &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt; describes how the density of the material element changes with time. This term is also known as the ''unsteady term''. The second term, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho&lt;/math&gt; describes the changes in the density as the material element moves from one point to another. This is the ''advection term'' (convection term for scalar field). For a flow to be incompressible the sum of these terms should be zero.

On the other hand, a '''homogeneous, incompressible material''' is one that has constant density throughout. For such a material, &lt;math&gt;\rho = \text{constant} &lt;/math&gt;. This implies that, 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt; ''independently''.
From the continuity equation it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0 \Rightarrow \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
Thus homogeneous materials always undergo flow that is incompressible, but the converse is not true.

It is common to find references where the author mentions incompressible flow and assumes that density is constant. Even though this is technically incorrect, it is an accepted practice. One of the advantages of using the incompressible material assumption over the incompressible flow assumption is in the momentum equation where the kinematic viscosity (&lt;math&gt;\nu = \tfrac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;) can be assumed constant. The subtlety above is frequently a source of confusion. Therefore, many people prefer to refer explicitly to ''incompressible materials'' or ''isochoric flow'' when being descriptive about the mechanics.
&lt;!-- 
Some references where prominent authors have made this mistake. (Please do not remove this comment from this section.)
F. M. White in his book "Viscous fluid flow" (2nd Ed.) refers to flow of constant density fluid as incompressible flow (on page 62). 
J. D. Anderson Jr. in his book "Fundamental of aerodynamics" (3rd Ed.) define an incompressible flow as one with constant density (on page 56).

== Related flow constraints ==

In fluid dynamics, a flow is considered incompressible if the divergence of the flow velocity is zero. However, related formulations can sometimes be used, depending on the flow system being modelled. Some versions are described below:

# ''Incompressible flow'': &lt;math&gt; {\nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0} &lt;/math&gt;. This can assume either constant density (strict incompressible) or varying density flow. The varying density set accepts solutions involving small perturbations in [[density]], pressure and/or temperature fields, and can allow for pressure [[atmospheric stratification|stratification]] in the domain.
# ''Anelastic flow'': &lt;math&gt; {\nabla \cdot \left(\rho_{o}\mathbf u\right) = 0} &lt;/math&gt;. Principally used in the field of [[atmospheric sciences]], the anelastic constraint extends incompressible flow validity to stratified density and/or temperature as well as pressure. This allows the thermodynamic variables to relax to an 'atmospheric' base state seen in the lower atmosphere when used in the field of meteorology, for example. This condition can also be used for various astrophysical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= D.R. | last=Durran | title=Improving the Anelastic Approximation | journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences | year=1989 | volume=46 | issue=11 | pages=1453–1461 | url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0469/46/11/pdf/i1520-0469-46-11-1453.pdf | doi= 10.1175/1520-0469(1989)046&lt;1453:ITAA&gt;2.0.CO;2 | format= |bibcode = 1989JAtS...46.1453D | issn= 1520-0469 }} {{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Low Mach-number flow / Pseudo-incompressibility'': &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left(\alpha \mathbf u \right) = \beta&lt;/math&gt;. The low [[Mach number|Mach-number]] constraint can be derived from the compressible Euler equations using scale analysis of non-dimensional quantities. The restraint, like the previous in this section, allows for the removal of acoustic waves, but also allows for ''large'' perturbations in density and/or temperature. The assumption is that the flow remains within a Mach number limit (normally less than 0.3) for any solution using such a constraint to be valid. Again, in accordance with all incompressible flows the pressure deviation must be small in comparison to the pressure base state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=A.S. |last1=Almgren | first2=J.B.| last2=Bell | first3=C.A. | last3=Rendleman | first4=M. | last4=Zingale | title=Low Mach Number Modeling of Type Ia Supernovae.

These methods make differing assumptions about the flow, but all take into account the general form of the constraint &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left(\alpha \mathbf u \right) = \beta&lt;/math&gt; for general flow dependent functions &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Numerical approximations==

The stringent nature of the incompressible flow equations means that specific mathematical techniques have been devised to solve them. Some of these methods include:
# The [[Projection method (fluid dynamics)|projection method]] (both approximate and exact)
# Artificial compressibility technique (approximate)
# Compressibility pre-conditioning

'''Jeremy Rifkin''' (born January 26, 1945) is an American economic and [[Social theory|social theorist]], writer, public speaker, [[political advisor]], and activist. Rifkin is the author of 20 books about the impact of scientific and technological changes on the economy, the workforce, society, and the environment. His most recent books include ''The Zero Marginal Cost Society'' (2014), ''[[The Third Industrial Revolution (book)|The Third Industrial Revolution]]'' (2011), ''[[The Empathic Civilization]]'' (2010), and ''[[The European Dream]]'' (2004).

Rifkin has been an unpaid advisor to the European Union since 2000. He has advised the current president and the past two presidents of the European Commission and their leadership teams. Rifkin has also served as an unpaid advisor to the leadership of the European Parliament and prominent European heads of state - including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany - on issues related to the economy, climate change, and energy security.

Rifkin is the principal architect of the Third Industrial Revolution long-term economic sustainability plan to address the triple challenge of the global economic crisis, energy security, and climate change.&lt;ref name="Belin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belin|first=Hughes|title=The Rifkin vision|journal=European Energy Review|date=July–August 2008|pages=40–46|url=http://www.europeanenergyreview.eu/data/docs/eer5/EER5-40-46-Rifkin%20interview.pdf|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Industrial Revolution was formally endorsed by the European Parliament in 2007 and is now being implemented by various agencies within the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurmai|first=Zita|date=May 14, 2007|title=Written declaration on establishing a green hydrogen economy and a third industrial revolution in Europe through a partnership with committed regions and cities, SMEs and civil society organisations|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+WDECL+P6-DCL-2007-0016+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=April 4, 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin has been advising the leadership of the People's Republic of China in recent years. ''The Huffington Post'' reported from Beijing in October 2015 that "Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has not only read Jeremy Rifkin's book, ''The Third Industrial Revolution'', but taken it to heart", he and his colleagues having incorporated ideas from this book into the core of the country's [[Five-year plans of China#Thirteenth Plan .282016.E2.80.932020.29|thirteenth Five-Year Plan]].&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; According to EurActiv, "Jeremy Rifkin is an American economist and author whose best-selling ''Third Industrial Revolution'' arguably provided the blueprint for Germany's transition to a [[low-carbon economy]], and China's strategic acceptance of climate policy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/sections/cities-and-regions-against-climate-change/jeremy-rifkin-whats-missing-un-climate-talks-new&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin has taught at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]]'s Executive Education Program at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] since 1995, where he instructs CEOs and senior management on transitioning their business operations into sustainable economies. Rifkin is ranked #123 in the WorldPost / HuffingtonPost 2015 global survey of "The World's Most Influential Voices." He is also listed among the top 10 most influential economic thinkers in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoughtleaders.world/en/2015-2/global/|title=Rangliste Global 2015 — Thought Leaders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rifkin has lectured before many [[Fortune 500]] companies, and hundreds of governments, civil society organizations, and universities over the past thirty five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights 2012|url=http://foet.org/current-activities.html|publisher=Foet.org|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin is also the President of the TIR Consulting Group, LLC,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/masterPlan.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with a wide range of industries including [[renewable energy]], power transmission, architecture, construction, IT, electronics, transport, and logistics. TIR's global economic development team is working with cities, regions, and national governments to develop the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) infrastructure for a [[Commons-based peer production|Collaborative Commons]] and a Third Industrial Revolution.

== Biography ==

===Youth and education===
Rifkin was born in [[Denver, Colorado]], to Vivette Ravel Rifkin, daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants to [[Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-08-15/news/0708140775_1_books-blind-started|title=Vivette R. Rifkin: 1911 – 2007|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune | date=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Milton Rifkin, a plastic-bag manufacturer. He grew up on the southwest side of Chicago. He was president of the graduating class of 1967 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a Bachelor of Science in Economics at the [[Wharton School]] of Finance and Commerce. Rifkin was also the recipient of the University of Pennsylvania's General Alumni Association's Award of Merit 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foet.org/img/University%20Of%20Pennsylvania%20Student%20Award%20of%20Mert.jpg |title=The University of Pennsylvania Student Award of Merit |publisher=Foet.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325193639/http://foet.org/img/University%20Of%20Pennsylvania%20Student%20Award%20of%20Mert.jpg |archivedate=March 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an epiphany when one day in 1967 he walked past a group of students protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and picketing the administration building and was amazed to see, as he recalls, that "my frat friends were beating the living daylights out of them. I got very upset." He organized a freedom-of-speech rally the next day. From then on, Rifkin quickly became an active member of the [[Vietnam War protests|peace movement]]. He attended the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]] (MA, International Affairs, 1968) where he continued anti-war activities. Later he joined [[Volunteers in Service to America]] (VISTA).

===1970s===
In 1973, Rifkin organized a mass protest against oil companies at the commemoration of the 200th Anniversary of the [[Boston Tea Party]] at Boston's Harbor. Thousands joined the protest, as activists dumped empty oil barrels into Boston's Harbor.  The protest came in the wake of the increase in gasoline prices in the fall of 1973, following the [[OPEC]] oil embargo.&lt;ref name="Trillin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trillin|first=Calvin|title=U.S. Journal: Boston Parallels|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1974/01/21/1974_01_21_067_TNY_CARDS_000305675|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=January 21, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later called "Boston Oil Party" by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/01/21/u-s-journal-boston-parallels|title=U.S. JOURNAL: BOSTON PARALLELS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, with [[Ted Howard (author)|Ted Howard]], he founded the Foundation on Economic Trends (FOET), which is active in both national and international public policy issues related to the environment, the economy, and climate change.  FOET examines new trends and their impacts on the environment, the economy, culture and society, and engages in litigation, public education, coalition building and grassroots organizing activities to advance their goals. Rifkin became one of the first major critics of the nascent [[biotechnology]] industry with the 1978 publication of his book, ''Who Should Play God?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rifkin|first=Jeremy|title=Who Should Play God? The Artificial Creation of Life and What it Means for the Future of the Human Race (with Ted Howard)|year=1977|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-440-19504-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Rifkin's 1981 book ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'' discusses how the physical concept of [[entropy]] applies to nuclear and solar energy, urban decay, military activity, education, agriculture, health, economics, and politics. It was called "A comprehensive worldview" and "an appropriate successor to ... ''[[Silent Spring]]'', ''The Closing Circle'', ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''," by the ''Minneapolis Tribune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foet.org/books/entropy.html |title=Jeremy Rifkin &amp;#124; The Foundation on Economic Trends &amp;#124; Books |publisher=Foet.org |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rifkin's work was heavily influenced by the ideas expressed by [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] in his 1971 book ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process''. In Rifkin's 1989 revised edition of ''Entropy:...'', entitled ''Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World'', the "Afterword" was written by Georgescu-Roegen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rifkin|first1=Jeremy|last2=Howard|first2=Ted|title=Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=44RRAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|isbn=0553347179|publisher=Bantam Books|accessdate=6 December 2017|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Rifkin brought together climate scientists and environmental activists from 35 nations in Washington, D.C. for the first meeting of the Global Greenhouse Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/4559-1 |title=The Global Greenhouse Network – C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=October 10, 1988 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Rifkin did a series of Hollywood lectures on global warming and related environmental issues for a diverse assortment of film, television and music industry leaders,{{Clarify|date=August 2011}} with the goal of organizing the Hollywood community for a campaign. Shortly thereafter, two Hollywood environmental organizations, Earth Communications Office (ECO) and [[Environmental Media Association]], were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brownstein|first=Ronald|title=Hollywood Hardball|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/mother%20jones/904Y-000-007.html|publisher=Mother Jones|date=January–February 1991|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In 1993, Rifkin launched the Beyond Beef Campaign, a coalition of six environmental groups including [[Greenpeace]], [[Rainforest Action Network]], and [[Public Citizen]], with the goal of encouraging a 50% reduction in the consumption of beef, arguing that [[methane emissions]] from cattle has a warming effect 23 times greater than carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi, Young|first=Takahashi, Bruce, A.|title=Greenhouse Gases and Animal Agriculture|year=2002|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-444-51012-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burros|first=Marian|title=Agriculture Dept.

Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis: Summary for Policy Makers: Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1995 book, ''[[The End of Work]]'', is credited by some with helping shape the current global debate on [[automation]], technology displacement, corporate [[Layoff|downsizing]] and the future of jobs. Reporting on the growing controversy over automation and technology displacement in 2011, ''[[The Economist]]'' pointed out that Rifkin drew attention to the trend back in 1996 with the publication of his book ''The End of Work''. ''The Economist'' asked "what happens... when machines are smart enough to become workers? In other words, when capital becomes labor." ''The Economist'' noted that "this is what Jeremy Rifkin, a social critic, was driving at in his book, "The End of Work," published in 1996... Mr. Rifkin argued prophetically that society was entering a new phase, one in which fewer and fewer workers would be needed to produce all the goods and services consumed. 'In the years ahead,' he wrote, 'more sophisticated software technologies are going to bring civilisation ever closer to a near-workerless world. The process has already begun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=V|first=N|title=Difference Engine: Luddite legacy|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/artificial-intelligence|accessdate=April 2, 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1998 book, ''The Biotech Century'', addresses issues accompanying the new era of genetic commerce. In its review of the book, the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' observed that "Rifkin does his best work in drawing attention to the growing inventory of real and potential dangers and the ethical conundrums raised by genetic technologies...At a time when scientific institutions are struggling with the public understanding of science, there is much they can learn from Rifkin's success as a public communicator of scientific and technological trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krimsky|first=Sheldon|title=All Aboard The Biotech Express|journal=Nature|date=May 7, 1998|volume=393|issue=6680|pages=31–32|doi=10.1038/29911|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6680/full/393031a0.html|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Biotech Century'' Rifkin argues that 'Genetic engineering represents the ultimate tool.' 'With genetic technology we assume control over the hereditary blueprints of life itself. Can any reasonable person believe for a moment that such unprecedented power is without substantial risk?'&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy, ''The Biotech Century'': the coming age of Genetic Commerce (London, 1998), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the changes he highlights are: replication partially replacing reproduction; and 'Genetically customized and mass-produced animal clones could be used as chemical factories to secrete—in their blood and milk—large volumes of inexpensive chemicals and drugs for human use.'&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy, ''The Biotech Century'': the coming age of Genetic Commerce (London, 1998), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Rifkin's work in the biological sciences includes advocacy of [[animal rights]] and animal protection around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/16/animalwelfare.world “Man and Other Animals: Our Fellow Creatures Have Feelings – So We Should Give Them Rights Too,” in ''The Guardian'' (16 August 2003)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vep0YbndO14 Video for the Stop Vivisection campaign (10 July 2013)]. Transcription: [http://equivita.it/index.php/it/comunicati/2-non-categorizzato/568-jeremy-rifkin-opinion-piece-en “Opinion Piece on Stop Vivisection - Moving Beyond Animal Experimentation Across the European Union,” in ''Equivita.it''].&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Rifkin's book, ''The Age of Access'', published in the year 2000, was the first to introduce the idea that society is beginning to move from ownership of property in markets, to access to services in networks, giving rise to the Sharing Economy. According to the Journal of Consumer Research, "the phenomenon of access was first documented in the popular business press by Rifkin (2000), who primarily examines the business-to-business sector and argues that we are living in an age of access in which property regimes have changed to access regimes characterized by short-term limited use of assets controlled by networks of suppliers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/203789/Access-Based-Consumption.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.nl/en/file/21381/download?token=yV2nHJUn.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of ''The Hydrogen Economy'' (2002), Rifkin worked both in the U.S. and Europe to advance the political cause of renewably generated hydrogen. In the U.S., Rifkin was instrumental in founding the Green Hydrogen Coalition, consisting of thirteen environmental and political organizations (including [[Greenpeace]] and [[MoveOn.org]]) that are committed to building a [[Hydrogen economy|renewable hydrogen based economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/cmep/article_redirect.cfm?ID=10703 |title=Public Citizen Climate and Energy |publisher=Citizen.org |date=December 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2004 book, ''[[The European Dream]]'', was an international bestseller and winner of the 2005 [[Corine Literature Prize|Corine International Book Prize]] in Germany for the best economics book of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books: European Dream|url=http://www.foet.org/books/european-dream.html|publisher=Foet.org|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Winners|url=http://www.corine.de/chronik/index.php|publisher=Corine Internationaler Buchpreis|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 and 2012===
In 2011, Rifkin published ''[[The Third Industrial Revolution (book)|The Third Industrial Revolution; How Lateral Power is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World]]''.  The book was a ''New York Times'' best-seller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Sellers – October 23, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-10-23/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 5, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into 19 languages. By 2014, approximately 500,000 copies were in print in China alone.

Rifkin delivered a keynote address at the Global Green Summit 2012 on May 10, 2012. The conference was hosted by the [[Government of the Republic of Korea]] and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in association with the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). President [[Lee Myung-bak]] of South Korea also gave a speech at the conference and embraced the Third Industrial Revolution to advance a green economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyun-kyung |first=Kang |title=Lee Pledges Green Growth Cluster |url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/07/113_110723.html |publisher=The Korea Times |date=May 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000614/http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/07/113_110723.html |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' reported that the newly elected premier of China, [[Li Keqiang]] is a fan of Rifkin and had "told his state scholars to pay close attention" to Rifkin's book, ''The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloomberg News |title=China's New Leaders Burnish Image by Revealing Personal Details |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-12-24/china-s-new-leaders-burnish-image-by-revealing-personal-details |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=December 24, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602190520/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-12-24/china-s-new-leaders-burnish-image-by-revealing-personal-details |archivedate=June 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifkin received the ''America Award'' of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America Prize – 2012 Edition|url=http://www.italiausa.org/index.php?c=premio_america|publisher=Fondazione Italia USA|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently works out of an office in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], a suburb of Washington, D.C.

===2014===
In April 2014, Rifkin published ''The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism''.&lt;ref&gt;http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5558&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ssir.org/book_reviews/entry/no_value&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
Rifkin was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hasselt University in Belgium in the spring of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhasselt.be/UH/general/About-UHasselt/About-UHasselt-University/Honorary-Doctorates.html|title=Honorary Doctorates|first=|last=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rifkin also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Liege in Belgium in the Fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://events.ulg.ac.be/ra2015/dhc/&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the Huffington Post reported from Beijing that "Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has not only read Jeremy Rifkin's book, The Third Industrial Revolution, and taken it to heart.

According to The "European Energy Review" "Perhaps no other author or thinker has had more influence on the EU's ambitious [[climate and energy]] policy than the famous American 'visionary' Jeremy Rifkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foet.org/press/interviews/EuropeanEnergyReview06-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002055/http://foet.org/press/interviews/EuropeanEnergyReview06-08.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, he has testified before numerous congressional committees and has had success in litigation to ensure responsible government policies on a variety of environmental, scientific and technology related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vjolt.net/vol5/issue2/v5i2a5-Naik.html#3b2 |title=Biotechnology Through the Eyes of an Opponent |publisher=Virginia Journal of Law and Technology Association |last=Naik |first=Paul |date=Spring 2000 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312060718/http://www.vjolt.net/vol5/issue2/v5i2a5-Naik.html#3b2 |archivedate=March 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] has cited some of Rifkin's publications as useful references for consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/ucs/cg-chapter-1.pdf |title=The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices |format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115129/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/ucs/cg-chapter-1.pdf |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The [[New York Times]]'' once stated that "others in the scholarly, religious, and political fields praise Jeremy Rifkin for a willingness to think big, raise controversial questions, and serve as a social and ethical prophet"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/11/us/working-profile-jeremy-rifkin-an-activist-takes-on-genetic-engineering.html|title=AN ACTIVIST TAKES ON GENETIC ENGINEERING|date=April 11, 1984|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Rifkin's work has also been controversial. Opponents have attacked the lack of scientific rigor in his claims as well as some of the tactics he has used to promote his views. The Harvard scientist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] characterized Rifkin's 1983 book ''Algeny'' as "a cleverly constructed tract of anti-intellectual propaganda masquerading as scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Gould, "Integrity and Mr. Rifkin", ''Discover Magazine'', January 1985; reprinted in Gould's essay collection ''An Urchin in the Storm'', 1987, Penguin Books, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article about Rifkin's activist methods (entitled "The Most Hated Man in Science") details reactions by scientists, especially geneticists, of that decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Dick |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959181,00.html |title=The Most Hated Man in Science: To some 'The Abominable No Man,' Gadfly Jeremy Rifkin Warns of the Dangers of Uncontrolled Experiments with New Technologies |publisher=Time.com |date=December 4, 1989 |accessdate=July 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220020702/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C959181%2C00.html |archivedate=December 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lecithin''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|ɪ|θ|ɪ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|ə|θ|ɪ|n}}, from the Greek ''lekithos'', "egg yolk") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues, which are [[amphiphilic]] – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both [[hydrophilic]] and [[lipophilic]]), and are used for smoothing food textures, dissolving powders (emulsifying), homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lecithin Lecithin] (Merriam Webster Dictionary online)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=_2Vgsk7o9LsC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lecithins: Sources, Manufacture &amp; Uses], Bernard F. Szuha, Pub: The American Oil Chemist's Society, {{ISBN|0-935315-27-6}}, Chapter 7, page 109. (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lecithins are mixtures of [[glycerophospholipid]]s including [[phosphatidylcholine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylinositol]], [[phosphatidylserine]], and [[phosphatidic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jim|editor2-last=Hong-Shum|editor2-first=Lily|title=Food additives data book|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=9781444397734|page=334|edition=2nd|quote=Complex mixture of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, glycolipids, etc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist [[Theodore Nicolas Gobley|Theodore Gobley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as [[hexane]], [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], [[petroleum ether]], [[benzene]], etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as [[soy]]beans, eggs, milk, marine sources, [[rapeseed]], cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent [[emulsifier]]. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either [[liposome]]s, bilayer sheets, [[micelle]]s, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of [[surfactant]] that usually is classified as [[amphipathic]]. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in [[non-stick cooking spray|nonstick cooking spray]].

==Biology==
Lecithin, as a food additive, is also a dietary source of several active compounds: [[Choline]] and its metabolites are needed for several physiological purposes, including cell membrane signaling and cholinergic neurotransmission,&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie M Fischer |author2=Kerry-Ann da Costa |author3=Lester Kwock |author4=Joseph Galanko |author5=Steven H Zeisel | title=Dietary choline requirements of women: effects of estrogen and genetic variation | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=2010 | volume=92 | issue=5 | pages=1113–1119 | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/92/5/1113.full | doi=10.3945/ajcn.2010.30064 | pmid=20861172 | pmc=2954445}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its exact function has not been determined, and the involvement of choline in long-term health and development of [[medicine|clinical]] disorders, such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[dementia|cognitive decline]] in aging and regulation of [[blood lipid]] levels, has not been well defined, and remains under research as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nutr Rev|year=2015|volume=73|issue=8|pages=500–22|doi=10.1093/nutrit/nuv010|title=Effects of choline on health across the life course: a systematic review|author=Leermakers ET|pmid=26108618|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While lecithin is also a rich source of a variety of types of dietary fats, the small amounts of lecithin typically used for food additive purposes mean it is not a significant source of fats. Lecithin is a source for methyl groups via its [[metabolite]], [[trimethylglycine]] (betaine) although this is mostly consumed from plants (and is abundant in sugar beets for example).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3R0Yeu79jfQC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;lpg=PA348 Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism], Sareen S. Groper and Jack L. Smith, Wadsworth pub., 2005, {{ISBN|9781133104056}}, p. 348 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphatidylcholine]] occurs in all cellular organisms, being one of the major components of the phospholipid portion of the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline choline ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of [[phospholipid]]s in [[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]]. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is [[soybean oil]]. Because of the [[European Union|EU]] requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding [[genetically modified crops]], a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (e.g., [[sunflower oil]]) is taking place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The main phospholipids in lecithin from soya and sunflower are [[phosphatidyl choline]], [[phosphatidyl inositol]], [[phosphatidyl ethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylserine]], and [[phosphatidic acid]]. They often are abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially.

===Hydrolysed lecithin===
To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by [[phospholipase]]. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the [[fatty acid]] at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called [[fractionation]]. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually [[ethanol]]. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction.

===Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin===
As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) [[protein]] or [[DNA]] from the original [[Genetically-modified crops|GM crop]] from which it is derived often is undetectable &amp;ndash; in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops.&lt;ref name=MarxDissertation&gt;Gertruida M Marx, Dissertation submitted in fulfillment of requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Free State, South Africa. December 2010.

[http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Danisco-emulsifier-to-subsitute-non-GM-soy-lecithin-as-demand-outstrips-supply Danisco emulsifier to substitute non-GM soy lecithin as demand outstrips supply]&lt;/ref&gt; This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the [[European Union]] in 2000, when Commission Regulation ([[European Commission|EC]]) 50/2000 was passed&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=32000R0050&amp;model=guichett Regulation (EC) 50/2000]&lt;/ref&gt; which required [[Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms#Labeling and traceability|labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs]], including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in [[Europe]] to use a meticulous, but essential system of [[identity preservation]] (IP).&lt;ref name=MarxDissertation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Davison, Yves Bertheau (2007) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228628711_EU_regulations_on_the_traceability_and_detection_of_GMOs_difficulties_in_interpretation_implementation_and_compliance EU regulations on the traceability and detection of GMOs: difficulties in interpretation, implementation, and compliance] CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition, and Natural Resources 2(77)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and applications==
[[File:Lecitina de soja en Montevideo.jpg|thumb|Soy lecithin for sale at a grocery store in Uruguay]]
Lecithin has [[emulsion|emulsification]] and [[lubricant]] properties, and is a [[surfactant]]. It can be totally [[metabolism|metabolized]] (see [[Inositol]]) by humans, so is well tolerated by humans and [[nontoxic]] when ingested; some other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the [[kidney]]s {{Citation needed| date=October 2018}}.

The major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Composition of Soybean Lecithin |url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/26685/PDF |first=C.R. |last=Scholfield |journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society |volume=58 |number=10 |date=October 1981 |pages=889–892 |via=[[USDA]] |accessdate=2014-08-21 |doi=10.1007/bf02659652}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 33–35% Soybean oil
* 20–21% [[Phosphatidylinositol]]s
* 19–21% [[Phosphatidylcholine]]
* 8–20% [[Phosphatidylethanolamine]]
* 5–11% Other [[phosphatide]]s
* 5% Free [[carbohydrate]]s
* 2–5% [[Sterol]]s
* 1% Moisture

Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications.

Applications include:
* In the [[pharmaceutical industry]], it acts as a wetting, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsifications and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use.
* In [[compound feed|animal feed]], it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization.
* In the [[paint]] industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and [[printing ink]], has [[antioxidant]] properties, helps as a [[rust]] inhibitor, is a colour-intensifying agent, [[catalyst]], conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and [[wetting agent]], helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several [[pigment]]s, helps in grinding of [[metal oxide]] pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates [[foam]] in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of [[latex]]-based paints.
* Lecithin also may be used as a [[release agent]] for [[plastic]]s, an antisludge additive in motor lubricants, an antigumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries.

===Food additive===
The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as an additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant.

In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of [[chocolate]], helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high [[fat]] content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces &lt;abbr title="splashing and scattering of oil droplets"&gt;spattering&lt;/abbr&gt; during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=INZa6WmqDA8C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340rgarine&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Food Uses of Oils and Fats] The Lipid Handbook, Frank D. Gunstone, John L. Harwood and Albert J. Dijkstra, CRC Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8493-9688-3}}, page 340 (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[dough]]s and bakery, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], increases volume, protects [[yeast]] cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of [[hydrophilic]] powders (e.g., low-fat proteins) and [[lipophilic]] powders (e.g., cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water.&lt;ref name="applications"&gt;[http://www.focuswish.com/lecithin-dispersion/ Dispersion of oil into water using lecithin-Tween 80 blends: The role of spontaneous emulsification]&lt;/ref&gt; Lecithin keeps [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]] and [[cocoa butter]] in a [[candy bar]] from separating. It can be used as a component of [[cooking spray]]s to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent.

Lecithin is approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] for [[human]] consumption with the status "[[generally recognized as safe]]".

'''Low-carbon power''' comes from processes or technologies that produce power with substantially lower amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions than is emitted from conventional [[fossil fuel]] [[power generation]]. It includes low carbon power generation sources such as [[wind power]], [[solar power]], [[hydropower]] and [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00472.x | volume=16 | title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Electricity Generation | journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology | pages=S73–S92 | last1 = Warner | first1 = Ethan S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2010_setplan_brochure.pdf|title=The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan SET-Plan Towards a low-carbon future|date=2010|quote=... nuclear plants ... currently provide 1/3 of the EU’s electricity and 2/3 of its low-carbon energy.|page=6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211100220/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2010_setplan_brochure.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term largely excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources, and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating fossil fuel power systems, specifically, those that are successfully coupled with a [[flue gas]] [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) system.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/innovation-funding-for-low-carbon-technologies-opportunities-for-bidders Innovation funding for low-carbon technologies: opportunities for bidders. "Meeting the energy challenge and government programme names nuclear power in the future energy mix, alongside other low-carbon sources, renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS)."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Over the past 30 years,{{when|date=December 2013}} significant findings regarding [[global warming]] highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions. From this, the idea for low-carbon power was born. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), established by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) in 1988, set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low-carbon power. The IPCC has continued to provide scientific, technical and socio-economic advice to the world community, through its periodic assessment reports and special reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/about/about.htm|title=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Web site|author=|date=|website=IPCC.ch|access-date=1 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825110811/http://www.ipcc.ch/about/about.htm|archivedate=25 August 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, the most prominent{{According to whom|date=October 2017}} early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which came into force on February 16, 2005, under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions. The historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low-carbon power technology.

On a social level, perhaps the biggest factor{{According to whom|date=October 2017}} contributing to the general public’s awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies, including low carbon power, came from the documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming.

== Power sources by carbon dioxide emissions ==
{{Main article|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}

=== Vattenfall study ===
[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|300px|right|The Vattenfall study found nuclear, hydro, and wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity. The result of the study  concluded that the grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per kWh of electricity by source are nuclear (5), hydroelectric (9), wind (15), natural gas (503), peat (636), coal (781).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://corporate.vattenfall.com/globalassets/corporate/sustainability/reports/life_cycle_assessment.pdf|title=vattenfall.com|author=|date=|website=Vattenfall.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovacool life cycle study survey===
[[Image:Sovacool 2008 life-cycle study.png|thumb|right|Sovacool said that the mean value of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for nuclear power over the life cycle of a plant was 66.08 g/kWh.]]

A 2008 [[meta analysis]], "Valuing the use Gas Emissions from Nuclear Power: A Critical Survey,"&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey] ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, pp. 2940-2953.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants. The studies surveyed included the 1997 Vattenfall comparative emissions study, among others. Sovacool's analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 g/kWh. Comparative results for [[wind power]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[solar thermal power]], and [[solar photovoltaic]], were 9-10 g/kWh, 10-13 g/kWh, 13 g/kWh and 32 g/kWh respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/sovacool_nuclear_ghg.pdf Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey]. ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, p. 2950.&lt;/ref&gt; Sovacool's analysis has been criticized for poor methodology and data selection.&lt;ref&gt;Jef Beerten, Erik Laes, Gaston Meskens, and William D’haeseleer [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421509005102 Greenhouse gas emissions in the nuclear life cycle: A balanced appraisal] ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 37, Issue 12, 2009, pp. 5056–5068.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yale University life cycle analysis of nuclear power ===
A 2012 [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) review by [[Yale University]] said that "depending on conditions, median life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions [for nuclear electricity generation technologies] could be 9 to 110 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh by 2050."  It stated:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{Quote|"The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."}} 
It added that for the most common category of reactors, the [[Light water reactor]] (LWR):
{{Quote|"Harmonization decreased the [[median]] estimate for all LWR technology categories so that the [[median]]s of [[Boiling water reactor|BWRs]], [[Pressurized water reactor|PWRs]], and all LWRs are similar, at approximately 12 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh"}}

== Differentiating attributes of low-carbon power sources ==
There are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions. Some options, such as wind power and solar power, produce low quantities of total life cycle carbon emissions, using entirely renewable sources. Other options, such as nuclear power, produce a comparable amount of carbon dioxide emissions as renewable technologies in total life cycle emissions, but consume non-renewable, but sustainable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/chowdhury2/|title=Is Nuclear Energy Renewable Energy?|author=|date=|website=large.Stanford.edu|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; materials ([[uranium]]). The term ''low-carbon power'' can also include power that continues to utilize the world’s natural resources, such as natural gas and coal, but only when they employ techniques that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel, such as the, as of 2012, pilot plants performing [[Carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/05/120522-carbon-capture-and-storage-economic-hurdles/|title=Amid Economic Concerns, Carbon Capture Faces a Hazy Future|author=|date=23 May 2012|website=NationalGeographic.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the single [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|largest emitter]] of carbon dioxide in the United States, the electric-power industry accounted for 39% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2004, a 27% increase since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0406/p03s03-sten.html|title=New case for regulating CO2 emissions|first=Mark|last=Clayton|date=6 April 2006|publisher=|access-date=1 October 2017|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.&lt;ref name=issues&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issues.org/23.3/apt.html|title=Promoting Low-Carbon Electricity Production - Issues in Science and Technology|author=|date=|website=www.Issues.org|access-date=1 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927013232/http://www.issues.org/23.3/apt.html|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales. Together, they account for roughly 28% of all U.S. electric-power production, with nuclear power representing the majority (20%), followed by hydroelectric power (7%).&lt;ref name=issues /&gt; However, demand for power is increasing, driven by increased population and per capita demand, and low-carbon power can supplement the supply needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/electricity/ex__summary.cfm|title=The U.S. Electric Power Sector and Climate Change Mitigation - Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|author=|date=|website=www.PewClimate.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uncorrected for their [[intermittency]]("unbuffered") EROEI for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festkoerper-kernphysik.de/Weissbach_EROI_preprint.pdf|title=Energy intensities, EROIs, and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants. pg 29|author=|date=|website=Festkoerper-Kernphysik.de|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Dailykos]] - GETTING TO ZERO: Is renewable energy economically viable? by Keith Pickering MON JUL 08, 2013 AT 04:30 AM PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; While the buffered (corrected for their intermittency) EROEI stated in the paper for all low-carbon power sources, with the exception of nuclear and biomass, were yet lower still. As when corrected for their weather intermittency/"buffered", the EROEI figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished – a reduction of EROEI dependent on [[capacity factor|how reliant they are on back up energy sources]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report identifies nuclear, wind, solar and hydroelectricity in suitable locations as technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectric power ===
[[File:Hoovernewbridge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] when completed in 1936 was both the world's largest electric-power generating station and the world's largest concrete structure.]]

[[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation. Large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in today’s energy market, even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation.&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet''] (PDF), OECD, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However there are typically low greenhouse gas emissions with [[reservoir]]s, and possibly high emissions in the tropics.

Hydroelectric power is the world’s largest low carbon source of electricity, supplying 16.6% of total electricity in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electricity sector in China#Hydropower|China]] is by far the world's largest producer of [[hydroelectricity]] in the world, followed by [[Electricity sector in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Hydroelectric power in Canada|Canada]].

However, there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems: dislocation, if people are living where the reservoirs are planned, release of [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane]] during construction and flooding of the reservoir, and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Graham-Rowe. [https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046 Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed] ''New Scientist'', 24 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources, which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

=== Nuclear power ===

[[Nuclear power]], with a 10.6% share of world electricity production as of 2013, is the second largest low-carbon power source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf pg25&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power, in 2010, also provided two thirds(2/3) of the twenty seven nation [[European Union]]'s low-carbon energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2010_setplan_brochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211100220/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2010_setplan_brochure.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-11 |df= }}  The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan SET-Plan Towards a low-carbon future 2010. Nuclear power provides "2/3 of the EU's low carbon energy" pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt; with some EU nations sourcing a large fraction of their electricity from nuclear power; for example [[Nuclear power in France|France derives 79% of its electricity from nuclear]].

According to the [[IAEA]] and the [[European Nuclear Society]], worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/pris/|title=PRIS - Home|author=|date=|website=www.IAEA.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euronuclear.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm|title=Nuclear power plants, world-wide|last=Society|first=Author: Marion Bruenglinghaus, ENS, European Nuclear|date=|website=www.EuroNuclear.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction, as of 2013, with plans to build many more,&lt;ref name="euronuclear.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html|title=China Nuclear Power - Chinese Nuclear Energy - World Nuclear Association|author=|date=|website=www.World-Nuclear.org|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the US the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name="Nuclear Power in the USA"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf41.html#licence | title= Nuclear Power in the USA |date=June 2008 |work= | publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] | access-date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration.&lt;ref name="matt2010"&gt;Matthew L.

[[File:Net US Electric Generation for 2009.jpg|thumb|350px|This graph illustrates [[nuclear power]] is the United States's largest contributor of non-greenhouse-gas-emitting electric power generation, comprising nearly three-quarters of the non-emitting sources.]]
Nuclear power's capability to add significantly to future low carbon energy growth depends on several factors, including the economics of new reactor designs, such as [[Generation III reactor]]s, public opinion and national and regional politics.

The 104 U.S. nuclear plants are undergoing a [[Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program]], to sustainably extend the life span of the U.S. nuclear fleet by a further 20 years. With further US power plants under construction in 2013, such as the two [[AP1000]]s at [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]]. However the [[Economics of new nuclear power plants]] are still evolving and plans to add to those plants are mostly in flux.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col/new-reactor-map.html Location of Projected New Nuclear Power Reactors]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 German installed capacity surpassed the U.S. and led until once again overtaken by the U.S. in 2008. China has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the U.S. in 2010 to become the world leader.

At the end of 2011, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 238 [[gigawatt]]s (GW), growing by 40.5 GW of nameplate capacity over the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-energy-global-status/|title=Global status overview|publisher=GWEC|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2010 the average annual growth in new installations was 27.6 percent.

=== Solar power ===
{{Main article|Solar power}}
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower.jpg|thumb|right|The [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats on a central tower.]]
Solar power is the conversion of [[sunlight]] into electricity, either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s.  The 354 MW [[SEGS]] CSP installation is the largest solar power plant in the world, located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of California.  Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150 MW) and the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150 MW), both in Spain. The over 200 MW [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] in the United States, and the 214 MW [[Charanka Solar Park]] in India, are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world’s largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]]s. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;

=== Geothermal power ===
{{Main article|Geothermal electricity}}
Geothermal electricity is [[electricity generation|electricity generated]] from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power plants, flash steam power plants and binary cycle power plants. Geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries&lt;ref name=gea2010&gt;Geothermal Energy Association.

=== Tidal power ===
[[Tidal power]] is a form of [[hydropower]] that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power. The first large-scale tidal power plant (the [[Rance Tidal Power Station]]) started operation in 1966. Although not yet widely used, tidal power has potential for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power.

=== Carbon capture and storage ===
{{See also|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}
[[Carbon capture and storage]] captures carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] of power plants or other industry, transporting it to an appropriate location where it can be buried securely in an underground reservoir. While the technologies involved are all in use, and carbon capture and storage is occurring in other industries (e.g., at the [[Sleipner gas field]]), no large scale integrated project has yet become operational within the power industry.

Improvements to current carbon capture and storage technologies could reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately the next decade, while new technologies under development promise more substantial cost reduction.&lt;ref name="netl" /&gt;

As a percentage of all anthropogenic [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) accounts for 72 percent (see [[Greenhouse gas]]), and has increased in concentration in the atmosphere from 315 parts per million (ppm) in 1958 to more than 375 ppm in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/mlo145e_thrudc04.pdf|title=Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), the primary climate-change data and information analysis center of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)|author=|date=|website=ORNL.gov|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the transportation sector there are moves away from fossil fuels and towards electric vehicles, such as [[mass transit]] and the [[electric car]]. These trends are small, but may eventually add a large demand to the electrical grid.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Domestic and industrial heat and hot water have largely been supplied by burning fossil fuels such as fuel oil or natural gas at the consumers' premises. Some countries have begun heat pump rebates to encourage switching to electricity, potentially adding a large demand to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/domestic/air-source-heat-pumps|title=Air source heat pumps|author=|date=|website=EnergySavingTrust.org.uk|access-date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''megatsunami''' is a very large wave created by a large, sudden displacement of material into a body of water.

Megatsunamis have quite different features from other, more usual types of [[tsunami]]s. Most tsunamis are caused by underwater [[plate tectonics|tectonic activity]] (movement of the earth's plates) and therefore occur along plate boundaries and as a result of [[earthquake]] and rise or fall in the [[seabed|sea floor]], causing water to be displaced. Ordinary tsunamis have shallow waves out at sea, and the water piles up to a [[wave height]] of up to about 10 metres (33 feet) as the sea floor becomes shallow near land. By contrast, megatsunamis occur when a very large amount of material [[rockfall|suddenly falls into water]] or anywhere near water (such as via a [[meteor impact]]), or are caused by volcanic activity. They can have extremely high initial wave heights of hundreds and possibly thousands of metres, far beyond any ordinary tsunami, as the water is "splashed" upwards and outwards by the impact or displacement. As a result, two heights are sometimes quoted for megatsunamis – the height of the wave itself (in water), and the height to which it surges when it reaches land, which depending upon the locale, can be several times larger.

Modern megatsunamis include the one associated with the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa#Tsunamis and distant effects|1883 eruption of Krakatoa]] ([[volcanic eruption]]), the [[1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami]] ([[landslide]] into a bay), and the wave resulting from the [[Vajont Dam]] landslide (caused by human activity destabilizing sides of valley). Prehistoric examples include the [[Storegga Slide]] (landslide), and the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]], [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater|Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Eltanin impact|Eltanin]] meteor impacts.

== Overview ==
{{Unsourced section|date=September 2018}}
A megatsunami is a tsunami—a large wave due to displacement of a body of water—with an initial [[wave]] [[amplitude]] ([[wave height|height]]) measured in several tens, hundreds, or possibly thousands of metres.

Normal tsunamis generated at sea result from movement of the sea floor. They have a small wave height offshore, are very long (often hundreds of kilometres), and generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a slight swell usually of the order of {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} above the normal sea surface. When they reach land, the wave height increases dramatically as the base of the wave pushes the water column above it upwards.

By contrast, megatsunamis are caused by giant landslides and other [[impact event]]s. This could also refer to a [[meteorite]] hitting an ocean. Underwater [[earthquake]]s or [[types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] do not normally generate such large tsunamis, but [[landslide]]s next to bodies of water resulting from earthquakes can, since they cause a large amount of [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]]. If the landslide or impact occurs in a limited body of water, as happened at the [[Vajont Dam]] (1963) and [[1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami|Lituya Bay]] (1958) then the water may be unable to disperse and one or more exceedingly large waves may result.

A way to visualize the difference, is that an ordinary tsunami is caused by sea floor changes, somewhat like pushing up on the floor of a large tub of water to the point it overflows, and causing a surge of water to "run off" at the sides. In this analogy, a megatsunami would be more similar to dropping a large rock from a considerable height into the tub, at one end, causing water to splash up and out, and overflow at the other end.

Two heights are sometimes quoted for megatsunamis – the height of the wave itself (in water), and the height to which it surges when it reaches land, which depending upon the locale, can be several times larger.

== Recognition of the concept of megatsunami==
{{main|1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami}}

[[Geologist]]s searching for oil in [[Alaska]] in 1953 observed that in [[Lituya Bay]], mature tree growth did not extend to the shoreline as it did in many other bays in the region. Rather, there was a band of younger trees closer to the shore. Forestry workers, glaciologists, and geographers call the boundary between these bands a [[trim line]]. Trees just above the trim line showed severe scarring on their seaward side, whilst those from below the trim line did not. The scientists hypothesized that there had been an unusually large wave or waves in the deep inlet. Because this is a recently deglaciated [[fjord]] with steep slopes and crossed by a major fault, one possibility was a landslide-generated tsunami.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

On 9 July 1958, a 7.8 {{M|w}} [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] earthquake in southeast Alaska caused 90 million tonnes of rock and ice to drop into the deep water at the head of Lituya Bay. The block fell almost vertically and hit the water with sufficient force to create a [[1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami|wave]] that surged up the opposite side of the head of the bay to a height of 1720 feet (524 m), and was still many tens of metres high further down the bay, when it carried eyewitnesses Howard Ulrich and his son Howard Jr. over the trees in their fishing boat. They were washed back into the bay and both survived.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

== Analysis of mechanism==
The mechanism giving rise to megatsunamis was analysed for the Lituya Bay event in a study presented at the Tsunami Society in 1999;&lt;ref name="PC_Model"&gt;[http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Tsunami1958LituyaB.html The Mega-Tsunami of July 9, 1958 in Lituya Bay, Alaska:  Analysis of Mechanism] – George Pararas-Carayannis, Excerpts from Presentation at the Tsunami Symposium of Tsunami Society of May 25–27, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA&lt;/ref&gt; this model was considerably developed and modified by a second study in 2010.

Although the earthquake which caused the megatsunami was considered very energetic, and involving strong ground movements, several possible mechanisms were not likely or able to have caused the resulting megatsunami. Neither water drainage from a lake, nor landslide, nor the force of the earthquake itself led to the megatsunami, although all of these may have contributed.

Instead, the megatsunami was caused by a massive and sudden [[impulse (physics)|impulsive]] impact when about 40 million cubic yards of rock several hundred metres above the bay was fractured from the side of the bay, by the earthquake, and fell "practically as a monolithic unit" down the almost vertical slope and into the bay.&lt;ref name="PC_Model" /&gt; The rockfall also caused air to be "dragged along" due to [[viscosity]] effects, which added to the volume of displacement, and further impacted the [[sediment]] on the floor of the bay, creating a large crater. The study concluded that:

{{quote|The giant wave runup of 1,720 feet (524 m.) at the head of the Bay and the subsequent huge wave along the main body of Lituya Bay which occurred on July 9, 1958, were caused primarily by an enormous subaerial rockfall into Gilbert Inlet at the head of Lituya Bay, triggered by dynamic earthquake ground motions along the Fairweather Fault.

The large mass of rock, acted as a monolith (thus resembling high-angle asteroid impact), struck with great force the sediments at bottom of Gilbert Inlet at the head of the bay. The impact created a large crater and displaced and folded recent and Tertiary deposits and sedimentary layers to an unknown depth. The displaced water and the displacement and folding of the sediments broke and uplifted 1,300 feet of ice along the entire front of the Lituya Glacier at the north end of Gilbert Inlet. Also, the impact and the sediment displacement by the rockfall resulted in an air bubble and in water splashing action that reached the 1,720 foot (524 m.) elevation on the other side of the head of Gilbert Inlet. The same rockfall impact, in combination with the strong ground movements, the net vertical crustal uplift of about 3.5 feet, and an overall tilting seaward of the entire crustal block on which Lituya Bay was situated, generated the giant solitary gravity wave which swept the main body of the bay.

This was the most likely scenario of the event – the "PC model" that was adopted for subsequent mathematical modeling studies with source dimensions and parameters provided as input. Subsequent mathematical modeling at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Mader, 1999, Mader &amp; Gittings, 2002) supported the proposed mechanism – as there was indeed sufficient volume of water and an adequately deep layer of sediments in the Lituya Bay inlet to account for the giant wave runup and the subsequent inundation. The modeling reproduced the documented physical observations of runup.}}

A 2010 model examined the amount of infill on the floor  of the bay, which was many times larger than that of the rockfall alone, and also the energy and height of the waves, and the accounts given by eyewitnesses, concluded that there had been a "dual slide" involving a rockfall, which also triggered a release of 5 to 10 times its volume of sediment trapped by the adjacent Lituya Glacier, as an almost immediate and many times larger second slide, a ratio comparable with other events where this "dual slide" effect is known to have happened.&lt;ref name="2010model"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 =Steven N.  | last2 =Day | first2 =Simon  | year = 2010 | title = Lituya Bay Landslide and Tsunami — A Tsunami Ball Approach | url = http://es.ucsc.edu/~ward/papers/Lituya.pdf | journal = Journal of Earthquake and Tsunami | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 285–319 | doi = 10.1142/S1793431110000893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 1980, the upper 460 metres (1,509 feet) of [[Mount St. Helens]] collapsed, creating a massive [[landslide]]. This released the pressure on the magma trapped beneath the summit bulge which exploded as a [[lateral eruption|lateral blast]], which then released the pressure on the magma chamber and resulted in a [[plinian eruption]].

One lobe of the avalanche surged onto [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]], causing a megatsunami which pushed the lake waters in a series of surges, which reached a maximum height of 260 metres (853&amp;nbsp;feet)&lt;ref name=Voight&gt;{{harvnb|Voight|Jandra|Glicken|Douglass|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; above the pre-eruption water level (~975 m asl/3,199&amp;nbsp;ft). Above the upper limit of the tsunami, trees lie where they were knocked down by the [[pyroclastic surge]]; below the limit, the fallen trees and the surge deposits were removed by the megatsunami and deposited in Spirit Lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Projects/H2O+Volcanoes/Frozen/Geology/MSH/MSH.tsunami.html [[USGS]] Website].

== Potential future megatsunamis ==
In a BBC television documentary broadcast in 2000, experts said that they thought that a massive landslide on a volcanic ocean island is the most likely future cause of a megatsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/mega_tsunami_transcript.shtml ''Mega-tsunami: Wave of Destruction'']. Transcript. BBC Two television programme, first broadcast 12 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The size and power of a wave generated by such means could produce devastating effects, travelling across oceans and inundating up to {{convert|25|km|0}} inland from the coast. This research, however, was later found to be flawed.&lt;ref name=MegatsunamiStudyFlawed/&gt; The documentary was produced before the experts' scientific paper was published and before responses were given by other geologists. There have been megatsunamis in the past,&lt;ref name=PastCanaryIslesMegatsunami/&gt; and future megatsunamis are possible but current geological consensus is that these are only local. A megatsunami in the Canary Islands would diminish to a normal tsunami by the time it reached the continents.&lt;ref name=LaPalmaMegatsunamipropagation/&gt; Also, the current consensus for La Palma is that the region conjectured to collapse is too small and too geologically stable to do so in the next 10,000 years, although there is evidence for past megatsunamis local to the Canary Isles thousands of years ago. Similar remarks apply to the suggestion of a megatsunami in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=NationalGeographicNoMegatsunami/&gt;

=== British Columbia ===
Some geologists consider an unstable rock face at [[Mount Breakenridge]], above the north end of the giant fresh-water fjord of [[Harrison Lake]] in the [[Fraser Valley]] of southwestern [[British Columbia]], Canada, to be unstable enough to collapse into the lake, generating a megatsunami that might destroy the town of [[Harrison Hot Springs]] (located at its south end).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/ffip/Evans_SG1994.pdf|title=Landslides in the Vancouver-Fraser Valley-Whistler region|last=Evans|first=S.G.|author2=Savigny, K.W.|year=1994|work=Geological Survey of Canada|publisher=Ministry of Forests, Province of British Columbia|pages=36 p.|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canary Islands ===
Geologists Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Neal Ward consider that a megatsunami could be generated during an eruption of [[Cumbre Vieja]] on the volcanic ocean island of [[La Palma]], in the [[Canary Islands]], Spain.&lt;ref name="Day et al."&gt;{{harvnb|Day|Carracedo|Guillou|Gravestock|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward and Day"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Day|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, this volcano erupted at its Duraznero, Hoyo Negro and Llano del Banco vents, and there was an earthquake with an epicentre near the village of [[Jedey]]. The next day [[Juan Bonelli Rubio]], a local geologist, visited the summit area and found that a fissure about {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} long had opened on the east side of the summit. As a result, the west half of the volcano (which is the volcanically active arm of a triple-armed rift) had slipped about {{convert|2|m|ft}} downwards and {{convert|1|m|ft}} westwards towards the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Bonelli Rubio, J.M.,"&gt;{{harvnb|Bonelli|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumbre Vieja is currently dormant, but will almost certainly erupt again. Day and Ward hypothesize&lt;ref name="Day et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward and Day"/&gt; that if such an eruption causes the western flank to fail, a mega-tsunami could be generated.

[[La Palma]] is currently the most volcanically active island in the [[Canary Islands]] [[Archipelago]]. It is likely that several eruptions would be required before failure would occur on Cumbre Vieja.&lt;ref name="Day et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward and Day"/&gt; However, the western half of the volcano has an approximate volume of {{convert|500|km3|cumi}} and an estimated mass of {{convert|1.5|e12MT|ST}}. If it were to catastrophically slide into the ocean, it could generate a wave with an initial height of about {{convert|1000|m}} at the island, and a likely height of around {{convert|50|m|0}} at the [[Caribbean]] and the Eastern [[North America]]n seaboard when it runs ashore eight or more hours later. Tens of millions of lives could be lost in the cities and/or towns of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],  [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Miami]], [[Havana]] and the rest of the Eastern Coasts of the United States and Canada, as well as many other cities on the Atlantic coast in Europe, South America and Africa.&lt;ref name="Day et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward and Day" /&gt; The likelihood of this happening is a matter of vigorous debate.&lt;ref name="Pararas-Carayannis"&gt;{{harvnb|Pararas-Carayannis|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last eruption on the Cumbre Vieja occurred in 1971 at the Teneguia vent at the southern end of the [[subaerial|sub-aerial]] section without any movement. The section affected by the 1949 eruption is currently stationary and does not appear to have moved since the initial rupture.&lt;ref&gt;As per Bonelli Rubio&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologists and [[Volcanology|volcanologist]]s are in general agreement that the initial study was flawed. The current geology does not suggest that a collapse is imminent.

=== Hawaii ===
Sharp cliffs and associated ocean debris at the [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala Volcano]], [[Lanai]] and [[Molokai]] indicate that landslides from the flank of the [[Kilauea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] volcanoes in [[Hawaii]] may have triggered past megatsunamis, most recently at 120,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McMurtry, Gary M. |author2=Fryer, Gerard J. |author3=Tappin, David R. |author4=Wilkinson, Ian P. |author5=Williams, Mark |author6=Fietzke, Jan |author7=Garbe-Schoenberg, Dieter |date=1 September 2004 |title=Megatsunami deposits on Kohala volcano, Hawaii, from flank collapse of Mauna Loa |journal=Geology |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=741 |doi=10.1130/G20642.1 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/full/32/9/741|bibcode = 2004Geo....32..741M |last8=Watts |first8=Philip |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/SOEST_News/PressReleases/Megatsunami/ |title=A Gigantic Tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands 120,000 Years Ago|first=Gary M. |last=McMurtry |first2=Gerard J. |last2=Fryer |first3=David R.|last3=Tappin|first4=Ian P.|last4=Wilkinson|first5=Mark|last5=Williams|first6=Jan|last6=Fietzke|first7=Dieter|last7=Garbe-Schoenberg|first8=Philip|last8=Watts|date=September 1, 2004|work=Geology |volume=32|publisher=SOEST Press Releases|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McMurtry, G.

There, hundreds of thousands of people could be killed as the tsunami could level Honolulu and travel {{convert|25|km|mi}} inland. Also, the West Coast of America and the entire Pacific Rim could potentially be affected.

However, other research suggests that such a single large landslide is not likely. Instead, it would collapse as a series of smaller landslides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drgeorgepc.com/TsunamiMegaEvaluation.html |title=Evaluation of the threat of mega tsunami generation from postulated massive slope failures of island volcanoes on La Palma, Canary Islands, and on the island of Hawaii|last=Pararas-Carayannis |first=George |year=2002 |publisher=drgeorgepc.com |accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, shortly after the beginning of the [[2018 lower Puna eruption]], a [[National Geographic]] article responded to such claims with "Will a monstrous landslide off the side of Kilauea trigger a monster tsunami bound for California? Short answer: No."&lt;ref name=NationalGeographicNoMegatsunami&gt;[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/05/kilauea-volcano-tsunami-explosive-hawaii-myths-explained-science/ "No, Hawaii's Volcano Won't Trigger a Mega-Tsunami"], National Geographic, Sarah Gibbons, May 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same article, geologist [[Mika McKinnon]] stated:&lt;ref name=NationalGeographicNoMegatsunami/&gt;

{{quote|there are submarine landslides, and submarine landslides do trigger tsunamis, but these are really small, localized tsunamis. They don't produce tsunamis that move across the ocean. In all likelihood, it wouldn't even impact the other Hawaiian islands.}}

Another volcanologist, [[Janine Krippner]], added:&lt;ref name=NationalGeographicNoMegatsunami/&gt;

{{quote|People are worried about the catastrophic crashing of the volcano into the ocean. There's no evidence that this will happen. It is slowly—really slowly—moving toward the ocean, but it's been happening for a very long time.}}

Steep cliffs on the [[Cape Verde Islands]] have been caused by catastrophic [[debris avalanche]]s. These have been common on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes and more can be expected in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Image:MWDA.png|thumb|right|Former logo of the Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority]]

The formerly named '''Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority''' (MWDA) is a statutory [[Waste Disposal Authority]] that manages the [[municipal solid waste]] produced in [[Merseyside]], [[England]]. MWDA was established in 1986 following the abolition of Merseyside County Council, to undertake the waste disposal for local authorities across Merseyside – Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton, Wirral and St Helens. MWDA takes a lead in advocating waste minimisation, recycling and the safe and effective disposal of waste for Merseyside’s residents and operates 14 Household Waste Recycling Centres. Veolia Environmental Services is the current contractor for the Authority's major waste services contract.

The Authority's Revenue Budget for 2010/2011 was set at £70.9m and is funded by way of a levy on each of the Merseyside District Councils which is apportioned on a waste tonnage basis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051219221109/http://www.merseysidewda.gov.uk/about/index.asp?id=45&amp;Level=3&amp;ParentID=1&amp;MenuItemID=29 MRWA About us]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Authority is also responsible for the aftercare of a number of closed landfill sites, which historically had been operated by the Authority or its predecessors. These include the former landfill sites at Bidston Moss and Sefton Meadows.

MWDA is made up of nine elected Members representing the five constituent district councils in the Merseyside area and consists of five Labour councillors, three Liberal Democrat councillors and one Conservative councillor.

As of Wednesday, December 7th, 2011, the MWDA was renamed the '''Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority''' (MRWA) &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103044059/http://www.merseysidewda.gov.uk/about/index.asp?id=229&amp;Level=4&amp;ParentID=29&amp;MenuItemID=239 Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; and a new corporate logo with slogan "Merseyside ... A place where nothing is wasted" was introduced to replace the former corporate MWDA logo.

The report '''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific Synthesis'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/MetalStocks/tabid/56054/Default.aspx ''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific synthesis''], 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[UNEP]]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of six scientific assessments on global [[metal]]s to be published by the [[International Resource Panel]] (IRP) of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:
* the volume of selected [[raw material]] reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used
* the lifecycle-long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe
* options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources.

==About the report==
Metals were an early priority for the [[International Resource Panel]], since little was known about them, their impacts, their economic importance or their scarcity. The report aimed to calculate the amount of metals present in society and assess the potential for utilising in-use stock to offset demand from virgin metal. Knowing how much metal stock there is in use, and how long the lifespan of the metal is, can help planners know when these metal stocks will enter recycling or waste streams.  It suggested that these 'mines above ground' had growing potential for future metals supply; the authors found that there is about 50&amp;nbsp;kg of above-ground [[copper]] for every person on earth, and more than two tons of [[iron]] per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/un-metals-idUKN1321607320100513 ''UN panel sees future shortage of specialty metals''] Patrick Worsnip, Reuters, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they noted that enormous disparities in global metals stocks existed between developed and developing nations including Brazil, China and India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/2564826/Copper-all/UN-report-highlights-disparities-in-global-metals-stocks.html ''UN report highlights disparities in global metal stocks''], Metal Bulletin, 19 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating ‘anthropogenic stocks’ of metals already in use in society is a precursor to stimulating efforts to increase [[recycling]]. The authors reported that very little information is presently known about different metals, making it difficult for policy makers to develop and plan recycling systems. However, what is known is that recycling can not only reduce negative impacts on the environment but also save energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make [[aluminium]] from [[bauxite]] ore is saved by using recycled material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2008/feb/22/aluminiumsrubbishrecyclingr ''Aluminium’s rubbish recycling rate''], Carolyn Fry, Tread Lightly, The Guardian, 22 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors quantified per capita stocks of the following metals, for some countries (stocks were mostly quantified for developed countries but data was also available for some developing nations).
* ''Major engineering metals:'' aluminium, copper, iron, [[lead]], [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[zinc]]
* ''Precious metals:'' [[gold]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[silver]]
* ''Specialty metals:'' [[antimony]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]]

==Reasons for recycling==
Some primary stocks of rare but useful metals are already running low. For example, [[rhenium]] only occurs at seven parts per billion in the Earth’s crust, making it one of the rarest elements on the planet. However, its high melting point of 3,186&amp;nbsp;°C makes it valuable in the manufacture of jet engines. Demand for the metal is rising, with increasing air travel, but its rarity means increasing extraction is not simple. This is where recycling comes in; rhenium is one of the few metals that has witnessed a rise in recycling rates. It is likely that recycling will become a more viable option than extraction for other metals in future, saving energy, cutting greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere and reducing negative impacts on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Babbage: Rare metals, Recycling [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/05/rare_metals ‘’The Economist’’] 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neutron bomb''', officially defined as a type of '''enhanced radiation weapon''' (ERW), is a low yield [[thermonuclear weapon]] designed to maximize lethal [[neutron radiation]] in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself. The neutron release generated by a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components.&lt;ref name="The Neutron Bomb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Fusion/Fusion5.shtml |title=The Neutron Bomb |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103000020/http://www.atomicarchive.com/Fusion/Fusion5.shtml |archivedate=2018-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neutron radiation|neutron burst]], which is used as the primary destructive action of the warhead, is able to penetrate enemy armor more effectively than a conventional warhead, thus making it more lethal as a tactical weapon.

The concept was originally developed by the US in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was seen as a "cleaner" bomb for use against massed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] armored divisions. As these would be used over allied nations, notably [[West Germany]], the reduced blast damage was seen as an important advantage.&lt;ref name="waynebiddle.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waynebiddle.com/neutron-bomb-an-explosive-issue/ |title=Neutron bomb an explosive issue, 1981 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228144147/http://waynebiddle.com/neutron-bomb-an-explosive-issue/ |archivedate=2015-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muller, Richard A. |title=Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines |publisher=W.W.

ERWs were first operationally deployed for [[anti-ballistic missile]]s (ABM). In this role the burst of neutrons would cause nearby warheads to undergo partial fission, preventing them from exploding properly. For this to work, the ABM would have to explode within ca. {{convert|100|m|ft|-2}} of its target. The first example of such a system was the [[W66]], used on the [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] missile used in the US's [[Nike-X]] system. It is believed the Soviet equivalent, the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]]'s [[53T6]] missile, uses a similar design.&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnqN-1UaNI4C&amp;pg=PA67|title=Soviet Ballistic Missile Defense and the Western Alliance|first=David Scott|last=Yost|date=2 February 1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780674826106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/gazelle.htm|title=53T6 Gazelle|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603130207/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/gazelle.htm|archivedate=2015-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapon was once again proposed for tactical use by the US in the 1970s and 1980s, and production of the [[W70]] began for the [[MGM-52 Lance]] in 1981. This time it experienced a firestorm of protest as the growing [[anti-nuclear]] movement gained strength through this period. Opposition was so intense that European leaders refused to accept it on their territory. President [[Ronald Reagan]] bowed to pressure and the built examples of the W70-3 remained stockpiled in the US until they were retired in 1992. The last W70 was dismantled in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Y-12 completes dismantlement of W70 nuclear weapons system components |date=21 October 2011 |website=Oak Ridge National Lab |url=http://www.oakridger.com/article/20111021/NEWS/310219994 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215536/http://www.oakridger.com/article/20111021/NEWS/310219994 |archivedate=3 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept==
In a standard thermonuclear design, a small [[fission bomb]] is placed close to a larger mass of thermonuclear fuel. The two components are then placed within a thick [[hohlraum|radiation case]], usually made from [[uranium]], [[lead]] or steel. The case traps the energy from the fission bomb for a brief period, allowing it to heat and compress the main thermonuclear fuel. The case is normally made of [[depleted uranium]] or [[natural uranium]] metal, because the thermonuclear reactions give off massive numbers of high-energy [[neutron]]s that can cause fission reactions in the casing material. These can add considerable energy to the reaction; in a typical design as much as 50% of the total energy comes from fission events in the casing. For this reason, these weapons are technically known as fission-fusion-fission designs.

In a neutron bomb, the casing material is selected either to be transparent to neutrons or to actively enhance their production. The burst of neutrons created in the thermonuclear reaction is then free to escape the bomb, outpacing the physical explosion. By designing the thermonuclear stage of the weapon carefully, the neutron burst can be maximized while minimizing the blast itself. This makes the lethal radius of the neutron burst greater than that of the explosion itself. Since the neutrons disappear from the environment rapidly, such a burst over an enemy column would kill the crews and leave the area able to be quickly reoccupied.

Compared to a pure [[fission bomb]] with an identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about ten times&lt;ref name=Kistiakovsky&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kistiakovsky |first=George |title=The folly of the neutron bomb|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=Sep 1978 |volume=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAoAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 February 2011 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, at sea level, the total radiation pulse energy which is composed of both [[gamma ray]]s and neutrons is approximately 5% of the entire energy released; in neutron bombs it would be closer to 40%, with the percentage increase coming from the higher production of neutrons. Furthermore, the neutrons emitted by a neutron bomb have a much higher average energy level (close to 14 M[[Electronvolt|eV]]) than those released during a fission reaction (1–2 MeV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hafemeister, David W. |title=Physics of societal issues: calculations on national security, environment, and energy |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-387-95560-5 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LT4MSqv9QUIC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, every low yield nuclear weapon is a radiation weapon, including non-enhanced variants. Up to about 10 kilotons in yield, all nuclear weapons have prompt neutron radiation&lt;ref name="fas.org" /&gt; as their furthest-reaching lethal component, after which point the lethal blast and thermal effects radius begins to out-range the lethal [[ionizing radiation]] radius.&lt;ref name="Mock up"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remm.nlm.gov/RemmMockup_files/radiationlethality.jpg |title=Mock up |publisher=Remm.nlm.gov |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607091341/http://www.remm.nlm.gov/RemmMockup_files/radiationlethality.jpg |archivedate=2013-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nukgr1.gif |title=Range of weapons effects |publisher=Johnstonsarchive.net |accessdate=2013-11-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108000905/http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nukgr1.gif |archivedate=2016-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/54981?o=R  |title=Weapon designer Robert Christy discussing scaling laws, that is, how injuries from ionizing radiation do not linearly scale in lock step with the range of thermal flash injuries, especially as higher and higher yield nuclear weapons are used|publisher=Webofstories.com|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhanced radiation weapons also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield.

==History and deployment to present==
The conception of neutron bombs is generally credited to [[Samuel T. Cohen]] of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], who developed the concept in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Robert D. McFadden]] |coauthors= |title=Samuel T.

Development of two production designs for the army's [[MGM-52 Lance]] short-range missile began in July 1964, the [[W63]] at Livermore and the [[W64]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Both entered phase three testing in July 1964, and the W64 was cancelled in favor of the W63 in September 1964. The W63 was in turn cancelled in November 1965 in favor of the [[W70]] (Mod 0), a conventional design.&lt;ref name=data&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas |last1=Cochran |first2=William |last2= Arkin |first3=Milton |last3=Hoenig |title= Nuclear Weapons Databook: U.S. nuclear warhead production.

Both entered phase three testing in October 1965, but the W65 was cancelled in favor of the W66 in November 1968. Testing of the W66 was carried out in the late 1960s, and entered production in June 1974,&lt;ref name=data/&gt; the first neutron bomb to do so.

According to the [[Cox Report]], as of 1999 the United States had never deployed a neutron weapon. The nature of this statement is not clear; it reads "The stolen information also includes classified design information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the "neutron bomb"), which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has ever deployed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report Of The Select Committee On U.S. National Security And Military/Commercial Concerns With The People's Republic Of China:  Chapter 2 - PRC Theft Of U.S. Thermonuclear Warhead Design Information |url=http://www.house.gov/coxreport/chapfs/ch2.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121324/http://www.house.gov/coxreport/chapfs/ch2.html |archivedate=2015-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fact that neutron bombs had been produced by the US was well known at this time and part of the public record. Cohen suggests the report is playing with the definitions; while the US bombs were never deployed ''to Europe'', they remained stockpiled in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Samuel |last=Cohen |journal=Insight on the News |date=9 August 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55426724.html |title=Check Your Facts: Cox Report Bombs |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409134020/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55426724.html |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 1999, the Indian government disclosed that India was capable of producing a neutron bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB934836102919955535|title=India Discloses It Is Able To Build a Neutron Bomb|last=Journal|first=Jonathan Karp Staff Reporter of The Wall Street|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123001427/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB934836102919955535|archivedate=2017-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no country is currently known to deploy them in an offensive manner, all thermonuclear [[dial-a-yield]] warheads that have about 10 kiloton and lower as one dial option, with a considerable fraction of that yield derived from fusion reactions, can be considered able to be neutron bombs in use, if not in name. The only country definitely known to deploy dedicated (that is, not dial-a-yield) neutron warheads for any length of time is the Soviet Union/[[Russia]],&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"/&gt; which inherited the USSR's neutron warhead equipped [[ABM-3 Gazelle]] missile program. This ABM system contains at least 68 neutron warheads with a 10 kiloton yield each and it has been in service since 1995, with inert missile testing approximately every other year since then (2014). The system is designed to destroy incoming ''endoatmospheric'' level nuclear warheads aimed at [[Moscow]] and other targets and is the lower-tier/last umbrella of the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system]] (NATO reporting name: ABM-3).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

Neutron bombs are purposely designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons. Since neutrons are scattered and absorbed by air,&lt;ref name="fas.org" /&gt; neutron radiation effects drop off rapidly with distance in air. As such, there is a sharper distinction, relative to thermal effects, between areas of high lethality and areas with minimal radiation doses.&lt;ref name="The Neutron Bomb"/&gt; All high yield (more than c.&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;[[kiloton]]) nuclear bombs, such as the extreme example of a device that derived 97% of its energy from fusion, the 50 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] [[Tsar Bomba]], are not able to radiate sufficient neutrons beyond their lethal blast range when detonated as a surface burst or low altitude [[air burst]] and so are no longer classified as neutron bombs, thus limiting the yield of neutron bombs to a maximum of about 10 kilotons. The intense [[Pulse (physics)|pulse]] of high-energy neutrons generated by a neutron bomb is the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast.

The inventor of the neutron bomb, Sam Cohen, criticized the description of the W70 as a neutron bomb since it could be configured to yield 100 kilotons:

{{quote|the W-70 ... is not even remotely a "neutron bomb." Instead of being the type of weapon that, in the popular mind, "kills people and spares buildings" it is one that both kills and physically destroys on a massive scale. The W-70 is not a discriminate weapon, like the neutron bomb—which, incidentally, should be considered a weapon that "kills enemy personnel while sparing the physical fabric of the attacked populace, and even the populace too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Effects===
[[File:House 1953 Nevada Nuclear Test 5 psi.jpg|thumb|Wood frame house in 1953 nuclear test, 5 pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure, full collapse.]]

Upon detonation, a near-ground [[air burst|airburst]] of a 1 kiloton neutron bomb would produce a large blast wave and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and [[ionizing radiation]], and non-ionizing radiation in the form of fast (14.1&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause [[third degree burn]]s to unprotected skin out to approximately 500 meters. The blast would create pressures of at least 4.6&amp;nbsp;psi out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures. At the conventional effective combat range against modern [[main battle tank]]s and [[armored personnel carrier]]s (&lt;&amp;nbsp;690–900&amp;nbsp;m), the blast from a 1&amp;nbsp;kt neutron bomb would destroy or damage to the point of non-usability of almost all un-reinforced civilian buildings.

Because liquid-filled objects like the human body are resistant to gross overpressure, the 4–5&amp;nbsp;psi blast [[overpressure]] would cause very few direct casualties at a range of c.&amp;nbsp;600&amp;nbsp;m. The powerful winds produced by this overpressure, however, could throw bodies into objects or throw debris at high velocity, including window glass, both with potentially lethal results. Casualties would be highly variable depending on surroundings, including potential building collapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf |title=1) Effects of blast pressure on the human body |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127040629/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pulse of neutron radiation would cause immediate and permanent incapacitation to unprotected outdoor humans in the open out to 900 meters,&lt;ref name="Kistiakovsky" /&gt; with death occurring in one or two days.

The questionable effectiveness of ER weapons against modern tanks is cited as one of the main reasons that these weapons are no longer fielded or [[Nuclear stockpile|stockpiled]]. With the increase in average tank armor thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, it was argued in the March 13, 1986 ''New Scientist'' magazine, that tank armor protection, approaches the level where tank crews are now almost fully protected from radiation effects. Thus, for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation, the weapon must now be detonated at such a close proximity to the tank that the [[nuclear explosion]]'s blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYVNkaEJpz4C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22main+battle+tank%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22main%20battle%20tank%22&amp;f=false |title=New Scientist March 13, 1986 pg 45 |publisher= |date=1986-03-13 |accessdate=2012-10-12|author1=Information |first1=Reed Business }}&lt;/ref&gt; However this assertion was regarded as dubious in the 12 June, 1986 ''[[New Scientist]]'' reply by C.S.

===Use against ballistic missiles===
As an anti-ballistic missile weapon, the first fielded ER warhead, the W66, was developed for the Sprint missile system as part of the Safeguard Program to protect United States cities and [[missile silo]]s from incoming Soviet warheads.

A problem faced by Sprint and similar ABMs was that the blast effects of their warheads change greatly as they climb and the atmosphere thins out. At higher altitudes, starting around {{convert|60,000|feet}} and above, the blast effects begin to drop off rapidly as the air density becomes very low. This can be countered by using a larger warhead, but then it becomes too powerful when used at lower altitudes. An ideal system would use a mechanism that was less sensitive to changes in air density.

Neutron-based attacks offer one solution to this problem. The burst of neutrons released by an ER weapon can induce fission in the fissile materials of primary in the target warhead. The energy released by these reactions may be enough to melt the warhead, but even at lower fission rates the "burning up" of some of the fuel in the primary can cause it to fail to explode properly, or "fizzle".&lt;ref name=w47&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6m43DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA323 |title= British Nuclear Weapons and the Test Ban 1954–1973 |first= John |last=Walker |publisher= Routledge |date= 2016 |page=23, 323-325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a small ER warhead can be effective across a wide altitude band, using blast effects at lower altitudes and the increasingly long-ranged neutrons as the engagement rises.

The use of neutron-based attacks was discussed as early as the 1950s, with the US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] mentioning weapons with a "clean, enhanced neutron output" for use as "antimissile defensive warheads."&lt;ref name=bomarc&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/cf-aerospace-warfare-centre/elibrary/journal/2014-vol3-iss4-08-secrets-of-the-bomarc-part-2.page#note47 |title= Secrets of the BOMARC: Re-examining Canada's Misunderstood Missile |date=Fall 2014 |first= Sean |last=Maloney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying, improving and defending against such attacks was a major area of research during the 1950s and 60s. A particular example of this is the US [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris A-3]] missile, which delivered three warheads travelling on roughly the same trajectory, and thus with a short distance between them. A single ABM could conceivably destroy all three through neutron flux. Developing warheads that were less sensitive to these attacks was a major area of research in the US and UK during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=w47/&gt;

Some sources claim that the neutron flux attack was also the main design goal of the various nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft weapons like the [[AIM-26 Falcon]] and [[CIM-10 Bomarc]]. One [[F-102]] pilot noted:

{{quote|GAR-11/AIM-26 was primarily a weapon-killer. The bomber(s, if any) was collateral damage. The weapon was proximity-fused to ensure detonation close enough so an intense flood of neutrons would result in an instantaneous nuclear reaction (NOT full-scale) in the enemy weapon’s pit; rendering it incapable of functioning as designed...[O]ur first “neutron bombs” were the GAR-11 and MB-1 Genie.&lt;ref name=bomarc/&gt;}}

It has also been suggested that neutron flux's effects on the warhead electronics are another attack vector for ER warheads in the ABM role. [[Ionization]] greater than 5,000 rads in [[silicon chips]] delivered over seconds to minutes will degrade the function of [[semiconductors]] for long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/radiation.htm |title=FAS Nuclear Weapon Radiation Effects |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721195639/http://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/radiation.htm |archivedate=2013-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while such attacks might be useful against guidance systems which used relatively advanced electronics, in the ABM role these components have long ago separated from the warheads by the time they come within range of the interceptors. The electronics in the warheads themselves tend to be very simple, and hardening them was one of the many issues studied in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=w47/&gt;

[[Lithium hydride|Lithium-6 hydride]] (Li6H) is cited as being used as a countermeasure to reduce the vulnerability and "harden" nuclear warheads from the effects of externally generated neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq12.html |title=Section 12.0 Useful Tables Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions |quote=Due to moderating ability and light weight, used to harden weapons against outside neutron fluxes (especially in combination with Li-6) ...The very high cross section of this reaction for thermalized neutrons, combined with the light weight of the Li-6 atom, make it useful in the form of lithium hydride for hardening of nuclear weapons against external neutron fluxes. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224033350/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq12.html |archivedate=2011-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/forms.jsp?formurl=document/rdd-1/drwcrtf4.html |title=''Restricted Data Declassification Policy, 1946 to the Present RDD-1'' |quote=The fact that Li6H is used in unspecified weapons for hardening |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020234426/https://www.osti.gov/opennet/forms.jsp?formurl=document%2Frdd-1%2Fdrwcrtf4.html |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Radiation hardening]] of the warhead's electronic components as a countermeasure to high altitude neutron warheads somewhat reduces the range that a neutron warhead could successfully cause an unrecoverable [[glitch]] by the ''transient radiation effects on electronics'' (TREE) effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |title=The Nuclear Matters Handbook, F.13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302091606/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_F.htm |archivedate=2013-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA302734 |title=Transient Radiation Effects on Electronics (TREE) Handbook Formerly Design Handbook for TREE, Chapters 1-6 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506094200/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA302734 |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At very high altitudes, at the edge of the atmosphere and above it, another effect comes into play. At lower altitudes, the [[x-ray]]s generated by the bomb are absorbed by the air and have [[mean free path]]s on the order of meters. But as the air thins out, the x-rays can travel further, eventually outpacing the area of effect of the neutrons. In exoatmospheric explosions, this can be on the order of {{convert|10|km}} in radius. In this sort of attack, it is the x-rays promptly delivering energy on the warhead surface that is the active mechanism; the rapid ablation (or "blow off") of the surface creates shock waves that can break up the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nm_book_5_11/appendix_G.htm |title=Nuclear Matters Handbook |quote=Nuclear weapon-generated X-rays are the chief threat to the survival of strategic missiles in-flight above the atmosphere and to satellites ...

===Use as an area denial weapon===
In November 2012, during the planning stages of [[Operation Hammer of God]], British Labour peer [[Lord Gilbert]] suggested that multiple enhanced radiation reduced blast (ERRB) warheads could be detonated in the mountain region of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to prevent infiltration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/26/lord-gilbert-neutron-bomb_n_2190607.html|title=Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129031522/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/26/lord-gilbert-neutron-bomb_n_2190607.html|archivedate=2012-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed to warn the inhabitants to evacuate, then irradiate the area, making it unusable and impassable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/03/lord-gilbert |title=Lord Gilbert obituary, by Andrew Roth, 3 June 2013. "Nobody lives up in the mountains on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan except for a few goats and a handful of people herding them," he observed. "If you told them that some ... warheads were going to be dropped there and that it would be a very unpleasant place to go, they would not go there." |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306215444/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/03/lord-gilbert |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Used in this manner, the neutron bomb(s), regardless of burst height, would release [[neutron activation|neutron activated]] casing materials used in the bomb, and depending on burst height, create radioactive soil [[neutron activation|activation products]].

In much the same fashion as the [[area denial]] effect resulting from fission product (the substances that make up most [[fallout]]) contamination in an area following a conventional [[surface burst]] nuclear explosion, as considered in the Korean War by [[Douglas MacArthur]], it would thus be a form of [[radiological warfare]]—with the difference that neutron bombs produce half, or less, of the quantity of fission products relative to the same-yield pure [[fission bomb]]. Radiological warfare with neutron bombs that rely on [[Teller-Ulam design|fission primaries]] would thus still produce fission fallout, albeit a comparatively ''cleaner'' and shorter lasting version of it in the area than if air bursts were used, as little to no fission products would be deposited on the direct immediate area, instead becoming diluted global [[fallout]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices with a higher proportion of yield derived from this reaction would be more efficient in the stand-off [[asteroid impact avoidance]] role, due to the [[mean free path|penetrative depth of fast-neutrons]] and the resulting higher [[momentum transfer]] that is produced in this "scabbing" of a much larger mass of material free from the main body, as opposed to the shallower surface penetration and [[ablation]] of [[regolith]], that is produced by thermal/soft X-rays.]]
However the most effective use of a neutron bomb with respect to area denial would be to encase it in a thick shell of material that could be neutron activated, and use a surface burst. In this manner the neutron bomb would be turned into a ''[[salted bomb]]''; a case of [[Isotopes of zinc|zinc-64]], produced as a byproduct of [[depleted zinc oxide]] enrichment, would for example probably be the most attractive for military use, as when activated, the zinc-65 so formed is a gamma emitter, with a half life of 244 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6 |title=1.6 Cobalt Bombs and other Salted Bombs, Nuclear Weapons Archive, Carey Sublette |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69TyCaTAG?url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.6 |archivedate=2012-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Neutron bombs-[[warhead]]s require considerable maintenance for their abilities, requiring some [[tritium]] for [[Boosted fission weapon|fusion boosting]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and tritium in the [[Teller-Ulam|secondary stage]] (yielding more neutrons), in amounts on the order of a few tens of grams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kalinowski, Martin|title=International control of tritium for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-31615-6|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YThIeCSxVZ4C&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (10–30 grams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zerriffi, Hisham |date=January 1996 |title=Tritium: The environmental, health, budgetary, and strategic effects of the Department of Energy's decision to produce tritium |url=http://ieer.org/resource/reports/tritium-environmental-health-budgetary-strategic-effects/#return-note-1465-4 |publisher=[[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113124620/http://ieer.org/resource/reports/tritium-environmental-health-budgetary-strategic-effects/#return-note-1465-4 |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated). Because tritium has a relatively short [[half-life]] of 12.32 years (after that time, half the tritium has decayed), it is necessary to replenish it periodically to keep the bomb effective. (For instance: to maintain a constant level of 24 grams of tritium in a warhead, about 1.3 grams per bomb per year&lt;ref&gt;After a year the initial amount of 24 grams of tritium decays to 2^(-1/12.32)x 24=22.68 grams.&lt;/ref&gt; must be supplied.) Moreover, tritium [[decay product|decays]] into [[helium-3]], which absorbs neutrons&lt;ref&gt;When absorbing neutrons, helium-3 produces back some tritium, but it comes too late in the reaction for fusion boosting and does not compensate for the decayed tritium missing at the reaction start.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will thus further reduce the bomb's neutron yield.

== Hypothetical effects of a pure fusion bomb ==
{{see also|Inertial confinement fusion}}
With considerable overlap between the two devices, the prompt radiation effects of a [[pure fusion weapon]] would similarly be much higher than that of a pure-fission device: approximately twice the initial radiation output of current standard fission-fusion-based weapons. In common with all neutron bombs that must presently derive a small percentage of trigger energy from fission, in any given yield a 100% pure fusion bomb would likewise generate a more diminutive atmospheric blast wave than a ''pure''-fission bomb. The latter fission device has a higher kinetic energy-ratio per unit of reaction energy released, which is most notable in the comparison with the D-T fusion reaction. A larger percentage of the energy from a D-T fusion reaction, is inherently put into uncharged neutron generation as opposed to charged particles, such as the [[alpha particle]] of the D-T reaction, the primary species, that is most responsible for the [[coulomb explosion]]/fireball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of Societal Issues - Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-68909-8|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-387-95560-5|url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1339081|format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sack Paper manufacturing==
{{Main|Kraft process|Paper machine}}
[[Wood pulp]] for sack paper is made from [[softwood]] by the [[kraft process]]. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added [[wet strength|wet strength chemicals]] to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a [[paper machine]] from the wood pulp. The paper is [[Crêpe paper|microcrepped]] to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in cross direction before busting.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; The paper may be coated with [[polyethylene]] (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against [[moisture]], [[petroleum|grease]] and [[bacteria]]. A paper sack can be made of several layers of sack paper depending on the toughness needed.

==Properties==
{{Main|Brown paper}}
''Paper sacks'' are usually made of [[Kraft paper]] having the advantage of being soft and strong at the same time.  The stretch or [[Deformation (mechanics)|elongation]] increases the energy required to break the material. They easily carry and protect products up to 50&amp;nbsp;kg, and adapt easily to the nature of their contents and to handling constraints. At the same time sacks are provide an excellent media for promotional messages and sophisticated printing designs.

''Paper sacks'' capacity is variable, each country sets a maximum ground rules such as [[job security]], it comes in a variety of calipers, basis weights, and treatments.

==Applications==
Plastic hazard free ''paper sacks'' also called ''multiwall paper sacks'' are used for cement, food, chemicals, consumer goods, flour bags etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8032">In [[physics]], a '''ponderomotive force''' is a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] [[force]] that a charged particle experiences in an inhomogeneous oscillating [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] field.

The ponderomotive force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\text{p}}=&lt;/math&gt;[[charged particle|&lt;math&gt;-\frac{e^2}{4 m \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;]][[del|&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;]][[amplitude|&lt;math&gt;(E^2)&lt;/math&gt;]]
which has units of newtons (in SI units) and where ''e'' is the [[electric charge|electrical charge]] of the particle, ''m'' is its mass, ''&amp;omega;'' is the [[angular frequency]] of oscillation of the field, and ''E'' is the [[amplitude]] of the electric field. At low enough amplitudes the magnetic field exerts very little force.

This equation means that a charged particle in an inhomogeneous oscillating field not only oscillates at the frequency of ''&amp;omega;'' of the field, but is also accelerated by '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; toward the weak field direction. This is a rare case where the sign of the charge on the particle does not change the direction of the force ((-e)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=(+e)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The mechanism of the ponderomotive force can be understood by considering the motion of a charge in an oscillating electric field. In the case of a homogeneous field, the charge returns to its initial position after one cycle of oscillation. In the case of an inhomogeneous field, the force exerted on the charge during the half-cycle it spends in the area with higher field amplitude points in the direction where the field is weaker. It is larger than the force exerted during the half-cycle spent in the area with a lower field amplitude, which points towards the strong field area. Thus, averaged over a full cycle there is a net force that drives the charge toward the weak field area.

==Derivation==
The derivation of the ponderomotive force expression proceeds as follows.

Consider a particle under the action of a non-uniform electric field oscillating at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in the x-direction. The equation of motion is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=g(x)\cos(\omega t),&lt;/math&gt;
neglecting the effect of the associated oscillating magnetic field.

If the length scale of variation of &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is large enough, then the particle trajectory can be divided into a slow time motion and a fast time motion:&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Plasma Theory'', second edition, by Nicholson, Dwight R., Wiley Publications (1983), {{ISBN|0-471-09045-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=x_0+x_1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the slow drift motion and &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; represents fast oscillations. Now, let us also assume that &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ll x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Under this assumption, we can use Taylor expansion on the force equation about &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, to get:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_0+\ddot{x}_1=\left[g(x_0)+x_1 g'(x_0)\right]\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_0 \ll \ddot{x}_1&lt;/math&gt;, and because &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; is small, &lt;math&gt; g(x_0) \gg x_1 g'(x_0) &lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_1=g(x_0)\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

On the time scale on which &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; oscillates, &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is essentially a constant. Thus, the above can be integrated to get:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1=-\frac{g(x_0)}{\omega^2} \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this in the force equation and averaging over the &lt;math&gt;2\pi / \omega&lt;/math&gt; timescale, we get,
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_0=-\frac{g(x_0)g'(x_0)}{2 \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \ddot{x}_0=-\frac{1}{4 \omega^2}\left.\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)^2\right]\right|_{x=x_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have obtained an expression for the drift motion of a charged particle under the effect of a non-uniform oscillating field.

==Time averaged density==
Instead of a single charged particle, there could be a gas of charged particles confined by the action of such a force. Such a gas of charged particles is called [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The distribution function and density of the plasma will fluctuate at the applied oscillating frequency and to obtain an exact solution, we need to solve the [[Vlasov Equation]]. But, it is usually assumed that the time averaged density of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] can be directly obtained from the expression for the force expression for the drift motion of individual charged particles:&lt;ref&gt;V. B. Krapchev, ''Kinetic Theory of the Ponderomotive Effects in a Plasma'', Phys. Rev. Lett. 42, 497 (1979), ''http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v42/i8/p497_1''&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{n}(x)=n_0 \exp \left[-\frac{e}{\kappa T} \Phi_{\text{P}} (x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\text{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ponderomotive potential and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\text{P}} (x)=\frac{ m}{4 \omega^2} \left[g (x)\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized ponderomotive force==
Instead of just an oscillating field, a permanent field could also be present. In such a situation, the force equation of a charged particle becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=h(x)+g(x)\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

To solve the above equation, we can make a similar assumption as we did for the case when &lt;math&gt;h(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a generalized expression for the drift motion of the particle:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}_0=h(x_0)-\frac{g(x_0)g'(x_0)}{2 \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The idea of a ponderomotive description of particles under the action of a time-varying field has applications in areas like:
*[[Combined rf trap]]
*[[High harmonic generation]]
*[[Plasma acceleration]] of particles
*[[Plasma propulsion engine]] especially the [[Electrodeless plasma thruster]]
*[[Quadrupole ion trap]]
*[[Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]] as a source of high energy THz radiation in laser-induced air plasmas

The ponderomotive force also plays an important role in laser induced plasmas as a major density lowering factor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4347">'''Power-line flicker''' is a visible change in brightness of a lamp due to rapid fluctuations in the voltage of the power supply. The [[voltage drop]] is generated over the source [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the grid by the changing load current of an equipment or facility. These fluctuations in time generate flicker. The effects can range from disturbance to [[epilepsy|epileptic attacks]] of [[light sensitivity|photosensitive]] persons. Flicker may also affect sensitive electronic equipment such as [[television]] receivers or industrial processes relying on constant electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;''IEEE Standard 519 Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems'' section 10.5 ''Flicker''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Flicker may be produced, for example, if a [[steel mill]] uses large [[electric motor]]s or [[arc furnace]]s on a distribution network, or frequent starting of an [[elevator]] motor in an office building, or if a rural residence has a large water pump starting regularly on a long feeder system. The likelihood of flicker increase as the size of the changing load becomes larger with respect to the [[prospective short-circuit current]] available at the point of common connection.

==Measurement of flicker==
The requirements of a flicker measurement equipment are defined in the international electro-technical standard IEC 61000-4-15.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61000-4-15, Testing and measurement techniques – Flickermeter – Functional and design specifications, Edition 1.1, 2003-03&lt;/ref&gt;

A flicker meter is composed of several function blocks which simulate a 230 V/60 W [[incandescent lamp]] (reference lamp) and the human perception system (eye-brain model).

From the resulting momentary value of flicker the short term flicker "perceptibility" value Pst is calculated according to a statistical process over a standardized 10-minute observation interval. Long term flicker Plt is calculated as the [[cubic mean]] of several Pst values over a standardized two-hour period.

The perceptibility value calculation and scaling algorithm were chosen such that a P value of 1.0 corresponds to a level at which 50% of test subjects found the flicker to be both noticeable and irritating.

In the standard IEC 61000-3-3 the observation intervals and the limiting values for Pst and Plt are specified:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Value|| Observation Interval || Limiting Value
|-
|Pst   || 10 min || 1.0
|-1
|Plt   || 2 h || 0.65
|}

==Operating condition of the EUT==
The IEC-flicker standard states that the EUT (Equipment Under Test) has to be operated during the test in a way which is the worst case state with respect to flicker.
If the EUT is operated in a (relatively) constant fashion during the whole test, Plt = Pst will result. If this state is feasible and realistic this means Pst has to fulfill the limits for Plt (which are lower).

==Estimation==
A purely analytical calculation of Pst is almost impossible. In the standard&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61000-3-3, Limits – Limitation of voltage changes, voltage fluctuations and flicker in public low-voltage supply systems, for equipment with rated current ≤16 A per phase and not subject to conditional connection, Edition 2.0, 2008-06&lt;/ref&gt; there are formulas which allow the estimation of the Pst values to be expected.

==Flicker mitigation==
Flicker is generated by load changes. Only the amplitude of the load change is relevant, not the absolute value. A reduction in flicker can be attained through making less frequent load changes, or smaller load changes. If the load is changed gradually (for example, by the help of [[power electronics]]) instead of step fashion, this also makes flicker less perceptible.

The relationship between amplitude of load changes and Pst is linear, i.e. halving the switched load results in half the Pst. The relationship between number of load changes per time (n/ Tp) and Pst is non-linear. A halving of load changes reduces Pst by only about 20%. In order to have half the Pst, the number of load changes must be reduced by a factor of 9.

The '''Prandtl–Glauert transformation''' is a mathematical technique which allows solving certain [[Compressible flow|compressible]] flow problems by [[Incompressible flow|incompressible]]-flow calculation methods.  It also allows applying incompressible-flow data to compressible-flow cases.

== Mathematical formulation ==
[[File:Prandtl-glauert-transform.png|thumb|Plot of the inverse [[Prandtl–Glauert factor]] &lt;math&gt;1/\beta&lt;/math&gt; as a function of freestream [[Mach number]].  Notice the infinite limit at Mach 1.]]

Inviscid compressible flow over slender bodies is governed by linearized compressible small-disturbance potential equation:&lt;ref&gt;Kuethe, A.M. and Chow, C.Y., Foundations of Aerodynamics, Wiley, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{xx} \,+\, \phi_{yy} \,+\, \phi_{zz} \;=\; M_\infty^2 \phi_{xx} \;\;\;\; \mbox{(in flowfield)}
&lt;/math&gt;

together with the small-disturbance flow-tangency boundary condition.

&lt;math&gt;
V_\infty \, n_x \,+\, \phi_y \, n_y \,+\, \phi_z \, n_z \;=\; 0 \;\;\;\; \mbox{(on body surface)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the freestream Mach number, and &lt;math&gt;n_x, n_y, n_z&lt;/math&gt; are the surface-normal vector components.  The unknown variable is the perturbation potential &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;, and the total velocity is given by its gradient plus the freestream velocity &lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt; which is assumed here to be along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
\vec{V} \;=\; \nabla \phi  + V_\infty \hat{x} \;=\; (V_\infty + \phi_x) \,\hat{x} \,+\, \phi_y \,\hat{y} \,+\, \phi_z \,\hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above formulation is valid only if the small-disturbance approximation applies
,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.H., Compressible Fluid Flow I, Wiley, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
| \nabla \phi | \ll V_\infty
&lt;/math&gt;

and in addition that there is no transonic flow, approximately stated by the requirement that the local Mach number not exceed unity.

&lt;math&gt;
\left[1 + (\gamma+1) \frac{\phi_x}{V_\infty} \right] M_\infty^2 \;&lt;\; 1
&lt;/math&gt;

The Prandtl–Glauert (PG) transformation uses the Prandtl–Glauert factor &lt;math&gt;\beta \equiv \sqrt{1 - M_\infty^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  It consists of scaling down all ''y'' and ''z'' dimensions and angle of attack by the factor of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the potential by &lt;math&gt;\beta^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''x'' component of the normal vectors by &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{x} &amp;=&amp; x \\
\bar{y} &amp;=&amp; \beta y \\
\bar{z} &amp;=&amp; \beta z \\
\bar{\alpha} &amp;=&amp; \beta \alpha \\
\bar{\phi} &amp;=&amp; \beta^2 \phi
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; geometry will then have normal vectors whose x components are reduced by &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; from the original ones:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{n}_{\bar{x}} &amp;=&amp; \beta n_x \\
\bar{n}_{\bar{y}} &amp;=&amp;  n_y \\
\bar{n}_{\bar{z}} &amp;=&amp;  n_z
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The small-disturbance potential equation then transforms to the Laplace equation,

&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\phi}_{\bar{x}\bar{x}} \,+\, \bar{\phi}_{\bar{y}\bar{y}} \,+\, \bar{\phi}_{\bar{z}\bar{z}} \;=\; 0  \;\;\;\; \mbox{(in flowfield)}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the flow-tangency boundary condition retains the same form.

&lt;math&gt;
V_\infty \, \bar{n}_{\bar{x}} \,+\, \bar{\phi}_{\bar{y}} \, \bar{n}_{\bar{y}} \,+\, \bar{\phi}_{\bar{z}} \, \bar{n}_{\bar{z}} \;=\; 0  \;\;\;\; \mbox{(on body surface)}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the incompressible potential-flow problem about the transformed &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; geometry. It can be solved by incompressible methods, such as thin airfoil theory, vortex lattice methods, panel methods, etc.  The result is the transformed perturbation potential &lt;math&gt;\bar{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; or its gradient components 
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\phi}_{\bar{x}},\bar{\phi}_{\bar{y}},\bar{\phi}_{\bar{z}}&lt;/math&gt; in the transformed space. 
The physical linearized pressure coefficient is then obtained by the inverse transformation

&lt;math&gt;
C_p \;=\; - 2 \frac{\phi_x}{V_\infty} \;=\;
-\frac{2}{\beta^2} \frac{\bar{\phi}_{\bar{x}}}{V_\infty}
\;=\; \frac{1}{\beta^2} \bar{C}_p
&lt;/math&gt;

which is known as Göthert's rule &lt;ref&gt;Göthert, B.H. Plane and Three-Dimensional Flow at High Subsonic Speeds (Extension of the Prandtl Rule). NACA TM 1105, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
For '''two-dimensional flow''', the net result is that &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; and also the lift and moment coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_l, c_m&lt;/math&gt; are increased by the factor &lt;math&gt;1/\beta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_p &amp;= \displaystyle \frac{C_{p0}} {\beta} \\
c_l &amp;= \displaystyle \frac{c_{l0}} {\beta} \\
c_m &amp;= \displaystyle \frac{c_{m0}} {\beta}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{p0}, c_{l0}, c_{m0}&lt;/math&gt; are the incompressible-flow values for the '''original''' (unscaled) &lt;math&gt;xyz&lt;/math&gt; geometry.  This 2D-only result is known as the Prandtl Rule.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Truckenbrodt: Fluidmechanik Band 2, 4. Auflage, Springer Verlag, 1996, p. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

For '''three-dimensional flows''', these simple &lt;math&gt;1/\beta&lt;/math&gt; scalings do NOT apply.  Instead, it is necessary to work with the scaled &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; geometry as given above, and use the Göthert's Rule to compute the &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; and subsequently the forces and moments.  No simple results are possible, except in special cases.  For example, using [[Lifting-line theory|Lifting-Line Theory]] for a flat elliptical wing, the lift coefficient is

:&lt;math&gt; C_L = \frac{2 \pi \alpha}{\beta + 2/AR} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''AR'' is the wing's aspect ratio. Note that in the 2D case where ''AR'' → ∞ this reduces to the 2D case, since in incompressible 2D flow for a flat airfoil we have &lt;math&gt;c_{l0} = 2 \pi \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, as given by [[Airfoil|Thin airfoil theory]].

== Limitations ==
The PG transformation works well for all freestream Mach numbers up to 0.7 or so, or once transonic flow starts to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.H., Compressible Fluid Flow I, Wiley, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Ludwig Prandtl]] had been teaching this transformation in his lectures for a while, however the first publication was in 1928 by [[Hermann Glauert]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Glauert, The Effect of Compressibility on the Lift of an Aerofoil. Proc. Roy. Soc. London. VOL. CXVIII, 1928, p. 113–119.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of this relation allowed the design of aircraft which were able to operate in higher subsonic speed areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dglr.de/literatur/publikationen/pfeilfluegel/Kapitel1.pdf Meier, H.-U.: Die Entwicklung des Pfeilflügels, eine technische Herausforderung, Ludwig Prandtl memorial lecture, GAMM 2005, March 28th - April 1st 2005, Universität Luxemburg, Kapitel 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally all these results were developed for 2D flow.  B.H. Göthert&lt;ref&gt;Göthert, B.H. Plane and Three-Dimensional Flow at High Subsonic Speeds (Extension of the Prandtl Rule). NACA TM 1105, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; then pointed out that the geometry distortion of the PG transformation renders the simple 2D Prandtl Rule invalid for 3D, and properly stated the full 3D problem as described above.

The PG transformation was extended by [[Jakob Ackeret]] to supersonic-freestream flows.  Like for the subsonic case, the supersonic case is valid only if there are no transonic effect, which requires that the body be slender and the freestream Mach is sufficiently far above unity.

== Singularity ==
{{Main|Prandtl–Glauert singularity}}
Near the sonic speed &lt;math&gt;M_\infty \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt; the PG transformation features a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]]. The singularity is also called the [[Prandtl–Glauert singularity]], and the flow resistance is calculated to approach infinity. In reality, aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations get amplified strongly near the sonic speed, but a singularity does not occur.  An explanation for this is that the linearized small-disturbance potential equation above is not valid, since it assumes that there are only small variations in Mach number within the flow and absence of compression shocks and thus is missing certain nonlinear terms. However, these become relevant as soon as any part of the flow field accelerates above the speed of sound, and become essential near &lt;math&gt;M_\infty \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  
The more correct nonlinear equation does not exhibit the singularity.

The '''radius of outermost closed isobar''' ('''ROCI''') is one of the quantities used to determine the size of a [[tropical cyclone]].  It is determined by measuring the radii from the center of the storm to its outermost closed [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobar]] in four quadrants, which is then averaged to come up with a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value.  It generally delimits the outermost extent of a tropical cyclone's wind circulation.&lt;ref&gt;FRÉDÉRIC MOUTON and OLA NORDBECK.

Active databases of ROCI are maintained by the [[National Hurricane Center]] for systems tracked in the eastern north Pacific and north Atlantic basins, within a database known as the Extended Best Track Database.

==Variation==
Tropical cyclones tend to be smaller during the mid-summer, and largest in October in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].  As tropical cyclones initially develop, the size of their ROCI initially contracts.&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt; Once tropical cyclones reach maturity, their isobaric patterns increase in size.  During the mature stage, the broadening pressure pattern leads to some reduction in their [[maximum sustained wind]], but the extent of their tropical storm and hurricane-force winds is the most extensive within the storm's life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlantic Hurricanes|author=Gordon E. Dunn and Banner I.

'''Renewable energy law''' is a particular kind of [[energy law]], and relates primarily to the transactional legal and policy issues that surround the development, implementation, and commercialization of [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]], such as solar, wind, geothermal and tidal. Renewable energy, (RE) law also relates to the land use, siting, and finance issues encountered by developers of renewable energy projects.

==Renewable energy support laws==
Renewable energy law also encompasses policies that relate to renewable energy and legislative instruments that further encourage its growth. 
===Feed-in tariffs===
One such form of legislation is [[feed-in tariffs]], which provide economic incentives to the developers of renewable energy projects by setting a fixed price for the sale of energy produced from renewable sources.  Feed-in tariff laws also provide financial certainty, are more cost effective and less bureaucratic than other support schemes such as investment or production tax credits, quota based renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and auction mechanisms.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;EC, 2005; Morris, 2007; Butler &amp; Neuhoff, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Competitive auction mechanisms for the promotion renewable energy technologies: The case of the 50 MW photovoltaics projects in Cyprus|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114008399|work=Angeliki Kylili, Paris A. Fokaides|publisher=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|accessdate=30 October 2014|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.10.022|volume=42|pages=226–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the feed-in tariff generates more competition, more jobs, and more rapid deployment for manufacturing; it also does not pick technological winners, for instance between more mature [[wind power]] technology versus [[solar photovoltaics]] technology.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;
===Renewable Portfolio standards===
This type of law is in force in 37 of the States within the United States, as well as Australia and a minority of European nations. It works by fixing the quantity of renewable electricity that must be produced, and leaving it to the market at what price this extra renewable electricity will be produced. This form of legislation typically employs a tradeable certificates mechanism, where 1 Megawatt Hour of electricity is equivalent to 1 renewable energy certificate.
===Auctions and tenders===
This form of renewable energy incentive is established by legislation and regulations and is increasingly popular throughout the world as a policy choice for governments. The details of the auction need to be carefully designed to prevent sub-optimal outcomes.

== Sector Regulation ==
The '''Role of the Sector Regulator''' is specified in the enabling legislation. For example, regulatory oversight of [[feed-in tariff]] programs is essential, whether the price is based on a predetermined number (and with some maximum capacity), an [[auction]]/[[bidding]] process, or avoided cost.  In each case, the regulator monitors activities to ensure abuses do not arise. How external (environmental and health) costs are factored into program evaluation is partly dependent on the enabling legislation (or executive order). If the law establishes Renewable Portfolio Standards, the energy regulator will need to oversee the system and evaluate its effectiveness in meeting RE objectives.  Generally, some other agency is responsible for certifying the generators and handling the certification system.

The sector regulator has a number of roles and responsibilities for operationalizing and implementing RE. The policy instruments include those oriented towards prices and quantities.  The former (such as Feed-in Tariffs) provide the supplier with certainty regarding price, but the volume depends on whether that price is high or relatively low.  The latter includes renewable portfolio standards that require distribution companies to purchase specific quantities of [[Electricity generation|electricity generated]] by renewable technologies.

In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. [[Policymakers]], however, may choose to delegate these decisions, or a subset of them, to regulators; on the other hand, they may choose to remain silent on such issues. In the former case, of course, regulators have the power to exercise their discretion. In the latter case, the scope of regulatory discretion depends on what the legal system provides.  In either case, the internal practices followed by the regulator need to provide legitimacy for regulatory rulings related to RE. Such practices include transparency and evidence-based decision-making.&lt;ref name="PURC"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable energy lawyers ==
'''Renewable energy lawyers''' focus their practice on serving the legal needs of renewable energy project developers and companies that develop clean technologies (see [[clean tech law]]).

==Renewable energy laws by country==

===Germany===

==Renewable energy laws by technology==
Renewable energy laws can either be 'technology neutral' or provide specific assistance to particular selected groupings of renewable energy technology. 
Other aspects of land use planning law can have particular application to the implications of particular energy technologies, such as wind power.

=== Hydroelectric energy law ===

Conventional hydroelectric dams in most countries are highly regulated, with environmental reviews before construction and operational limits afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p63919/99173E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ferc.gov/industries/hydropower/gen-info/regulation/hydro-prog.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Operation normally places river conditions before power interest, ie: power generation may not be needed at night while rivers are kept flowing.

=== Geothermal energy law ===

'''SGN''' (previously known as '''Scotia Gas Networks''') is a UK gas distribution company which manages the network that distributes natural and [[green gas]] to 5.9 million homes and businesses across Scotland and the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sgn.co.uk/About-SGN/ SGN "About Us"]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014/15 SGN operates more than 71,000&amp;nbsp;km of pipes. In the same period SGN spent £500 million on upgrading the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/network-regulation-riio-model/network-performance-under-riio/riio-gd1-performance-data|title = Ofgem RIIO model performance|date = 05/10/2015|accessdate = 2015-11-20|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was formed in 2005 as Scotia Gas Networks. In September 2014 they changed their name to SGN. The rebrand was driven by a desire to present with a greater unity between the two distinct geographic areas of its business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ENA - Gas distribution map|url = http://www.energynetworks.org/info/faqs/gas-distribution-map.html|website = www.energynetworks.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those are Scotland and the south of England, where SGN owns and maintains the gas network.  The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought a 16.7% equity stake in SGN in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.swfinstitute.org/swf-article/adia-acquires-minority-stake-in-scotia-gas-networks/|title = ADIA Acquires Minority Stake in Scotia Gas Networks|publisher = Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute|accessdate = 2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, '''Scotia Gas Networks''', '''Scotland Gas Networks''' and '''Southern Gas Networks''' were rebranded to '''SGN'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smarternetworks.org/Files/Opening_up_the_Gas_Market_141014154845.pdf|title = Energy Networks Association: Smarter Networks|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company believed the previous names did not represent the business as "bright, forward thinking experts", and that the name "SGN" would be better for customers to understand what SGN does as a company.

The logo was also changed. From 2005, the logo was originally red and blue dots forming a shape of the United Kingdom. The red dots covered Scotland and the southern area on the "Scotia Gas Networks" logo, just Scotland for the "Scotland Gas Networks" logo and just the southern area for "Southern Gas Networks". This was to highlight where works are carried out by the company. The new logo shows a cylinder filled with orange, blue and purple dots.

== Funding for Innovation ==
In 2014 SGN was awarded funding from the industry regulator, [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets|Ofgem]], to develop two projects. Opening up the Gas Market is an investigation into whether the British Gas Safety Regulations could be changed to accept different types of gas. Robotics is a project to develop technology for repairing steel mains without interrupting the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/network-regulation-riio-model/network-innovation/gas-network-innovation-competition/sgn|title = Ofgem Gas Network Innovation Competition|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate Social Responsibility ==
A partnership between [[Girlguiding]] and SGN is designed to encourage young women into male dominated industries and also spread a message about gas safety and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SGN - Scotia Gas Network|url = http://new.girlguiding.org.uk/what-is-girlguiding/our-partners/partner-profile-sgn|website = new.girlguiding.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; SGN also works with [http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/ Royal Voluntary Service] to produce a leaflet for winter safety, targeting the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Royal Voluntary Service {{!}} Corporate partners {{!}} SGN|url = http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/fundraise/corporate-fundraising/corporate-partners/sgn|website = www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1511">A '''slushflow''' is rapid mass movement of [[water]] and [[snow]], and is categorized as a type of [[debris flow]]. Slushflows are caused when water reaches a critical concentration in the [[snowpack]] due to more water inflow than outflow. The high water concentration weakens the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] of the snow crystals and increases the weight of the snowpack. A slushflow is released when the component of the force of gravity parallel to the slope generates a [[hydraulic]] pressure gradient exceeding the tensile strength and basal friction of the snowpack. 

While frequently compared to an [[avalanche]], they have some key differences. Slushflows are lower in frequency than avalanches, have higher water content, are more [[laminar flow|laminar]] in flow, and have lower [[velocity]]. They most commonly occur at higher [[latitude]]s in the winter during high [[precipitation]] and in the spring during high snowmelt. Because of their high water content, they can flow down gentle slopes of only a few degrees at low altitudes. They are a significant hazard in [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;US National Research Council (1990) [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1571&amp;page=12 ''Snow Avalanche Hazards and Mitigation in the United States''] National Academies Press {{ISBN|978-0-309-04335-9}} pg 12&lt;/ref&gt; and are responsible for the deaths of dozens of people as well as the destruction of buildings and the closure of roads.

== History ==
Solar cells started in 1876 with William Grylls Adams along with an undergraduate student of his. A French scientist, by the name of [[Edmond Becquerel]], first discovered the photovoltaic effect in the summer of 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belessiotis &amp; Papanicolaou|first=V.G &amp; E.|date=2012|title=History of Solar Energy|url=|journal=Comprehensive Renewable Energy|volume=3|pages=85–102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that certain elements on the periodic table, such as silicon, reacted to the exposure of sunlight in very unusual ways. [[Solar power]] is created when solar radiation is converted to heat or electricity. English electrical engineer [[Willoughby Smith]], between 1873 and 1876, discovered that when selenium is exposed to light, it produced a high amount of electricity. The use of selenium was highly inefficient, but it proved Becquerel’s theory that light could be converted into electricity through the use of various semi-metals on the periodic table, that were later labeled as [[Photoconductivity|photo-conductive]] material. By 1953, Calvin Fuller, Gerald Pearson, and Daryl Chapin, discovered the use of silicon to produce solar cells was extremely efficient and produced a net charge that far exceeded that of selenium. Today solar power has many uses, from heating, electrical production, thermal processes, water treatment and storage of power that is highly prevalent in the world of renewable energy.

== Background ==
       By the 1960’s solar power was the standard for powering space-bound satellites. Early 1970’s solar cell technology became cheaper and more available ($20/watt). Between 1970 and 1990, solar power became more commercially operated. Railroad crossings, oil rigs, space stations, microwave towers, aircraft, etc. Now, houses and businesses all over the world use solar cells to power electrical devices with a wide variety of uses. Solar power is the dominant technology in the renewable energy field, primarily due to its high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By the early 90’s, photovoltaic conversion had reached an unprecedented new height. Scientists used solar cells constructed of highly conductive photovoltaic materials such as gallium, indium, phosphide and gallium arsenide that increased total efficiency by over 30%. By the end of the century, scientists created a special type of solar cells that converted upwards of 36% of the sunlight it collected into usable energy. These developments built tremendous momentum for not only solar power, but for [[Renewable energy|renewable]] energy technologies around the world.

== Electricity Production ==
Photovoltaics (PV) use silicon solar cells to convert the energy of sunlight into electricity. They operate under the photoelectric effect which results in the emission of electrons. Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses lenses or mirrors and tracking devices to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Solar power is anticipated to be the world’s largest source of electricity by 2050. Solar power plants, such as Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert, produce over 392MW of power. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW (1 billion watts) are in development and are anticipated to be the future of solar power in the US.

== Thermal Energy ==
The heat collected by the sun is highly intensive and radioactive. The sun bombards the earth with billions of charged nanoparticles with an immense amount of energy stored in them. This heat can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation. Many [[Steam generator (boiler)|steam generation]] systems have adapted to using sunlight as a primary source for heating feed water, a development that has greatly increased the overall efficiency of boilers and many other types of waste heat recovery systems. Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and [[pasteurization]]. Solar distillation is used for water treatment processes to create potable drinking water, which has been an extremely powerful player in providing countries in need with relief efforts through the use of advancing technology.

== Economic Development ==
Very cost-effective technology. Solar installations are becoming cheaper and more readily available to countries where energy demand is high, but supply is low due to economic circumstances. Provide areas affected by natural disaster with cheap, clean energy. 1 Gigawatt solar power plants can produce almost 10 times as much power as a fossil fuel combustion power plant for more than half the cost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=The environmental and cost implications of solar energy preferences in Renewable Portfolio Standards|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300069|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=86|pages=250–261|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2015.06.039|issn=0301-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projected to be the leader of energy production by the year 2050.

[[File:Steam-powered fire engine.jpg|thumb|Preserved British steam-powered [[fire engine]]&amp;nbsp;– an example of a mobile [[steam engine]]. This is a [[horse-drawn vehicle]]: the [[steam engine]] drives the [[water pump]]]]
'''Steam pumper fire engines''' were used roughly from 1840 to 1920 to pump water on city fires. Large urban [[fire departments]]  would invest in fire brigades, or engine companies, to assist in fire fighting. Concomitant with the [[steam engine]] would be a house, horses and dalmatian dogs (used to guide and calm the horses).  The growing cities in the US west would invest in steam pumpers usually after a devastating fire that would destroy large parts of the wooden frontier town.

The first steam pumper was built by Braithwaite and Ericcson in England in 1829. In the following decades, European cities invested in steam powered fire equipment.

The vertical fast firing boilers, while heavy, was an effective fire fighting equipment. For a few years, c. 1910-20, the horses were retired and the steam pumper was hauled by a gas tractor.

Small two wheel units for hand movement were built in [[England]] to help fight incendiary fires during the [[Luftwaffe]] [[The Blitz|Blitz]].

A few builders were American: [[Waterous Engine Works Co. Ltd.|Waterous]], Amoskeag; [[Merryweather &amp; Sons|Merryweather]] and [[Shand Mason]] were London-based fire engine manufacturers.

A topological insulator (TI) is a material that has a nontrivial [[symmetry]], protected by a [[Topological sorting|topological ordering]] at the surface whiles the interior behaves as an insulator. This ordering is observed when electrons that are subject to strong external magnetic field, exhibit electronic excitation gap in the sample bulk and metallic conduction at the boundaries or surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=D.|last2=Qian|first2=D.|last3=Wray|first3=L.|last4=Xia|first4=Y.|last5=Hor|first5=Y.

== Prediction and discovery ==

The predictions that led to the [[Topological insulator|discovery of topological insulators]] date back in the 1980s. It was discovered that electrons that are confined to two dimensions and subject to strong magnetic field show a different topological ordering, which underlies the quantum Hall effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The effect of this topological ordering results in the emergence of particles with fractional charges and non-[[dissipation]] transport. The distinguishing features of topological materials stems in the fact that they are insulating (have energy gaps) in the bulk but have a "protected" metallic properties (gapless) at the edge or surface state [5]. These "protected" gapless states are governed by the [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]] and the band structure of the material.

== Experimental realization ==

The first topological insulator to be realized experimentally was [[Bismuth antimonide|Bi&lt;sub&gt;1 − x&lt;/sub&gt; Sb &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasan|first=M.

'''Molecular Beam Epitaxial (MBE) growth of topological insulators'''

MBE is an [[epitaxy]] method for the growth of a crystalline material on a crystalline substrate to form an ordered layer.  MBE is performed in [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] or [[ultra-high vacuum]]. In solid states, the elements are heated in different electron beam evaporators until they [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublime]]. The gaseous elements then condense on the wafer where they react with each other to form [[single crystal]]s.  In the growth of [[thin film]] layers on a substrate, the reaction is through vapor deposition.  By heating the elemental source material, the vapor pressure increases, reaching a critical value that leads

to the deposition of the source material onto the substrate.  Both crystals then react with each other for the source material to form layered thin films on the substrate.  MBE is an appropriate technique

for the growth of high quality single-crystal films.  In order to avoid a huge [[Lattice constant#Lattice matching|lattice mismatch]] and [[Crystallographic defect|defects]] at the interface, the substrate and thin film are expected to have similar lattice constants.  MBE has an advantage over other methods due to the fact that the synthesis is performed in high vacuum hence resulting in less contamination.  Additionally,  lattice defect is reduced due to the ability to influence the growth rate and the ratio of species of source materials present at the substrate interface.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heremans|first=Joseph P.|last2=Cava|first2=Robert J.|last3=Samarth|first3=Nitin|date=2017-09-05|title=Tetradymites as thermoelectrics and topological insulators|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats201749|journal=Nature Reviews Materials|language=En|volume=2|issue=10|pages=17049|doi=10.1038/natrevmats.2017.49|issn=2058-8437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,  in MBE,  samples can be grown layer by layer which results in flat surfaces with smooth interface for engineered heterostructures.  Moreover,  MBE synthesis technique benefits from the ease of moving a topological insulator sample from the growth chamber to a characterization chamber such as  angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or [[Scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM) studies.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Topological+Insulators:+Fundamentals+and+Perspectives-p-9783527337026|title=Topological Insulators: Fundamentals and Perspectives|date=2015-06-29|website=Wiley.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bismuth-based topological insulators ==
Thus far, the field of topological insulators has been focused on bismuth and antimony [[chalcogenide]] based materials such as Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or [[Bismuth antimonide|Bi&lt;sub&gt;1 − x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] .  The choice of chalcogenides is related to the Van der Waals relaxation of the lattice matching strength which restricts the number of materials and substrates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Bismuth chalcogenides have been studied extensively for TIs and their applications in [[thermoelectric materials]].  The Van der Waals interaction in TIs exhibit important features due to low surface energy.  For instance, the surface of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is usually terminated by Te due to its low surface energy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Bismuth chalcogenides have been successfully grown on different substrates. In particular, Si has been a good substrate for the successful growth of  Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; . However, the use of sapphire as substrate has not been so encouraging due to a large mismatch of about 15%.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ginley|first=Theresa P.|last2=Wang|first2=Yong|last3=Law|first3=Stephanie|date=2016-11-23|title=Topological Insulator Film Growth by Molecular Beam Epitaxy: A Review|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/6/11/154|journal=Crystals|language=en|volume=6|issue=11|pages=154|doi=10.3390/cryst6110154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of appropriate substrate can improve the overall properties of TI. The use of buffer layer can reduce the lattice match hence improving the electrical properties of TI.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be grown on top of various  Bi&lt;sub&gt;1 − x&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; buffers.  Table 1 shows Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  on different substrates and the resulting lattice mismatch. Generally,  regardless of the substrate

used, the resulting films have a textured surface that is characterized by pyramidal single-crystal domains with quintuple-layer steps. The size and relative proportion of these pyramidal domains vary with factors that include film thickness, lattice mismatch with the substrate and interfacial chemistry-dependent film nucleation. The synthesis of thin films have the stoichiometry problem due to the high vapor pressures of the elements. Thus, binary tetradymites are extrinsically doped  as n-type (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ) or p-type (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Characterization of topological insulators==
The first step of topological insulators characterization takes place right after synthesis, meaning without breaking the vacuum and moving the sample to an atmosphere. It is important because a possible chemical reaction on the surface with the atmosphere can change the surface states. That could be done by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Further measurements includes structural and chemical probes such as X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy but depending on the sample quality, the lack of sensitivity could remain. The most effective metric is the electrical transport measurements of resistivity, Hall effect, and magnetoresistance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Future developments ==
It should be noted that the field of topological insulators still needs to be developed. The best bismuth chalcogenide topological insulators have about 10 meV bandgap variation due to the charge change. Further development should focus on the examination of both: the presence of high-symmetry electronic bands and simply synthesized materials. One of the promising candidates is [[Heusler compound|half-Heusler compounds]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These crystal structures can consist of a large number of elements. Band structures and energy gaps are very sensitive to the valence configuration; because of the increased likelihood of intersite exchange and disorder, they are also very sensitive to specific crystalline configurations. A nontrivial band structure that exhibits band ordering analogous to that of the known 2D and 3D TI materials was predicted in a variety of 18-electron half-Heusler compounds using first-principles calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-04-01|title=Prediction of topological insulating behavior in inverse Heusler compounds from first principles|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025612007367|journal=Computational Materials Science|language=en|volume=70|pages=145–149|doi=10.1016/j.commatsci.2012.12.013|issn=0927-0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornado outbreak sequences tend to dominate the tornado statistics for a year and often cause a spike in tornado numbers for the entire year. Not all periods of active tornado occurrences are outbreak sequences, there must be no break in the activity to satisfy the definition. Active periods happen from every year to every several years whereas continuously active periods are less common and can be rare depending on the parameters applied to define a sequence.

The '''Toronto propane explosion''' (also known as the '''Sunrise Propane incident''') was a series of [[explosion]]s and ensuing [[Conflagration|fire]] that took place on the morning of August 10, 2008, in [[Downsview]], [[North York]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/475696 |title=Firefighter dies, thousands flee propane plant blasts |accessdate=2008-08-11 |author=Freeman, Sunny |author2=Taylor, Bill  |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2008-08-10}}&lt;!-- Was this published in the Sunday Star?

== History ==
Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases was a company that sold [[propane]] for commercial and home purposes, in addition to other gases such as [[helium]] and [[acetylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.propanecanada.com/about.php |title=Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases |accessdate=2009-08-14|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j68cyUbL?url=http://www.propanecanada.com/about.php|archivedate=2009-08-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has operated under a number of names since at least 1999. In 2002, a company named Sunrise Petroleum was successfully sued by First Choice Petroleum Inc., an [[oil]] and [[lubricant]]s supplier, that claimed the company owed them C$54,063.73 in products and that Sunrise had forged a document to avoid settling their account.&lt;ref name="star propane issues"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/476648 |publisher=TheStar.com |title=Propane firm had many names |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2009-08-14|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j68dOv35?url=http://www.thestar.com/article/476648|archivedate=2009-08-17|deadurl=no | location=Toronto | first=Nicole | last=Baute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, it was found that Sunrise had forged the signature of a First Choice employee named Thomas Tims in a 1999 document, which stated Sunrise Petroleum would be taken over by a new company called Sunrise Petroleum Lubricants, and that Sunrise Petroleum would thereby not be responsible for any outstanding, unpaid, or unsettled accounts. However, Tims would not have signed the document because he was listed on it as "Tim Toms", rather than Tom Tims. As a result of the case, Sunrise was forced to pay the account owed plus interest, totalling C$93,389.54, and an additional C$34,284.71 in legal fees. Court documents also revealed a third name, Sunrise Propane &amp; Petroleum, that the company had previously used.&lt;ref name="star propane issues" /&gt;

An Ontario corporate profile states the facility was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 2004, though a Sunrise corporate solicitor and spokesperson is uncertain how long the facility was in operation.&lt;ref name="star propane issues" /&gt; The facility was built in a residential neighbourhood in the North York area of Toronto. Toronto mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] stated that the facility was allowed to be built in the neighbourhood under zoning that was in place for over a decade.&lt;ref name="built"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/08/10/explosion-residents.html |title=Residents say propane facility had no place near houses |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility had previously been warned by Ontario's Technical Standards and Safety Authority for its lack of safety by not stopping truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities. During the investigation following the explosions, investigators found that truck-to-truck transfers were common at the facility. Truck-to-truck transfers are prohibited in Ontario because they increase the risk of a [[gas leak]] or a fire.&lt;ref name="illegal transfer" /&gt;

== Incident ==
[[Image:Propane Explosion in North Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The explosion seen from the Keele overpass]]
At approximately 03:50 ET on the morning of August 10, 2008, a large explosion occurred at Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases, located near Murray Road and Spalding Road. This was followed by a series of explosions which sent large fireballs and clouds of smoke billowing into the sky. Large pieces of metal from the exploding propane tanks were ejected onto nearby streets and properties. Many homes and offices were damaged, windows were shattered, and doors were ripped from their hinges. About 200 firefighters battled the [[Multiple-alarm fire|seven-alarm fire]] that resulted from the explosions.&lt;ref name="firefighter death" /&gt;

The threat of further blasts and concerns about the air quality forced the police to conduct a voluntary [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of a large area in the surrounding community. Residents living within a {{convert|1.6|km|0}} radius were told to leave their homes in the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_25625.aspx |title=Firefighter Found Without Vital Signs Succumbs Following Massive Blast |work=CityNews |publisher=Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813035812/http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_25625.aspx |archivedate=2008-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto Transit Commission]] buses were used to evacuate them to [[Downsview Park]] and then to [[York University]].&lt;ref name="star" /&gt;

The explosions rocked the area and also caused the closure of part of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]], between highways [[Ontario Highway 404|404]] and [[Ontario Highway 400|400]], for over 12 hours.&lt;ref name="ctvnews"&gt;{{cite episode |title=CTV News |network=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] |station=[[CFTO-TV|CTV Toronto]] |airdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency crews feared another major explosion as two rail [[tank car|tankers]] continued to burn more than five hours after the initial explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/Front/9007904.html |title=Thousands evacuated in Toronto after explosions at propane facility |publisher=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular commercial air traffic was allowed to continue in and out of [[Pearson International Airport]] while smaller, privately owned aircraft were restricted from flying over the area.&lt;ref name="firefighter death" /&gt;

Six people were sent to the hospital, 18 people admitted themselves to emergency clinics, and Emergency Medical Services treated 40 people on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080811/to_explo_080812/20080812?hub=TopStories |publisher=[[CTV News]] |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2008-08-12 |title=Coroner investigates after body found at blast site}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the emergency response to the scene, a Toronto [[firefighter]] was found lifeless by emergency crews. [[Paramedic]]s and firefighters tried to revive him but were unsuccessful. He was then rushed to a [[hospital]] where he was pronounced dead. The firefighter was identified as Bob Leek, a 55-year-old district chief of emergency planning and a 25-year veteran.&lt;ref name="firefighter death" /&gt; Leek, who was off duty that night, had been asked to bring some equipment to aid the activities of his colleagues, which he gladly did. He just happened to have had a heart attack at that time. Sunrise employee Parminder Saini was unaccounted for. On August 11, a [[Dead body|body]] was found at the scene. On September 3, the body was confirmed to be that of Saini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080810/to_explo_080810?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title=Thousands returning home after massive T.O. fire |publisher=[[CTV News]] |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/14/saini-propane.html |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |title=Employee missing from propane plant is student from India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause and investigation ==
The Ontario Fire Marshal's Office handled the investigation of the explosions.&lt;ref name="firefighter death" /&gt; While the cause of the explosions has not yet been determined, on August 21, 2008, Ontario's independent safety regulator for fuels, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, released a statement saying that just before the explosion, a truck driver was illegally transferring propane from one truck to another. The agency also reported that in November 2006, Sunrise Propane was warned about its lack of safety by not stopping the truck-to-truck transfers at the company's facilities, and that truck-to-truck transfers were a frequent and routine operating practice at the facility.&lt;ref name="illegal transfer" /&gt; An investigator with the Ontario Fire Marshal's Office stated that it could take months before the cause of the explosions could be determined. [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[Dalton McGuinty]] also said that the province was willing to provide financial aid to residents whose homes were damaged by the explosions.&lt;ref name="length"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/18/fmo-propane.html |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |title=Determining cause of propane blast could take months}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2010, the [[Toronto Star]] reported that the massive Sunrise propane explosion in 2008 was caused by an illegal "tank-to-tank transfer" along with a gas hose leak.  The report said that liquid propane was released from a hose after a "tank-to-tank transfer" was completed.  The Star reports that Sunrise didn't have the right licence to perform those types of transfers, and it was previously barred from doing so by the [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority]] in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100804/100804_sunrise_cause/20100804/?hub=CP24Home&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/843631--sunrise-blast-caused-by-illegal-tank-to-tank-transfer-report-says?bn=1 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jasmeet | last=Sidhu | title=Sunrise blast caused by illegal ‘tank-to-tank transfer,' report says | date=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Environment Ministry]] has argued that Sunrise failed "to show that there was a proper preventative maintenance system in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/12/sunrise-propane-must-be-penalized-for-massive-downsview-explosion-government-lawyer/ | location=Toronto | work=The National Post | first=Megan | last=O'Toole | title=Sunrise Propane must be penalized for massive Downsview explosion: government lawyer | date=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Adler, Sunrise's lawyer, argued that the event was an unforeseeable accident because Sunrise kept their equipment in good order and cannot be held responsible for a hose failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/crime/article/1209697--sunrise-propane-trial-fatal-explosion-a-tragic-accident-defence-says-in-closing-arguments | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Valerie | last=Hauch | title=Sunrise Propane trial: Fatal explosion a "tragic accident," defence says in closing arguments | date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimlawcanada.com/media/adler "Leo Adler in the Media"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Evacuated Highway 401 Color.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401]] was closed due to its proximity to the explosion.]]
Due to its proximity to the site, [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] was shut down from [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]] to [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]], and the local [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre|Yorkdale Mall]] was closed for part of the day.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; [[Toronto Transit Commission]] routes and the [[York Region Transit]] [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]] [[Viva Orange|Orange]] route were affected as a result of evacuation zone. Bus routes were diverted and a section of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina]] subway line between [[Downsview Station]] and [[Lawrence West (TTC)|Lawrence West Station]] was shut down for part of the day. [[GO Transit]] services to [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal]] were also suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080810/080810_explosion_closures/20080810/?hub=CP24Home |title=List of closures as a result of the explosions |work=CP24.com |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 15 hours after the first explosions, some residents were given the go-ahead to return to their homes. However, many people returning to their homes were stopped at police checkpoints and turned back, or not permitted to take their vehicles into the immediate area.&lt;ref name="ctvnews"/&gt; Approximately 100 of the 12,000 evacuated homes were left uninhabitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080810/to_explo_080811/20080811/?hub=TorontoNewHome |title=100 homes uninhabitable after blast: T.O. police |work=CTV News |publisher=[[CTV News]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc aug 11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/11/tto-fire.html |title=Almost all Toronto residents back home after propane blast |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, almost all residents who had to be evacuated were allowed back, though about 35 families had to wait while tests by health officials were conducted over concerns about airborne [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="cbc aug 11" /&gt;

As a result of the explosion, Toronto officials plan on reviewing all industrial areas that could pose a potential threat to residential neighbourhoods to prevent similar situations. As part of its investigation, TSSA officials and the Ontario Fire Marshal are reviewing past inspections of the facility to determine the cause of the explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/11/propane-fire.html |title=Toronto to review zoning bylaws after propane explosion, fire |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion caused damage to one of Toronto's oldest Jewish [[cemetery|cemeteries]], the Mount Sinai Memorial Park. The cemetery is over 100 years old and has more than 11,000 graves, of which at least 20 were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/11/mount-sinai.html |title=Historic Jewish cemetery closed by propane accident |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various residents were angry because the municipal government allowed Sunrise to build a propane facility in a residential area. Some residents claim that the community was not consulted or notified about the facility when it was being built. However, [[Shelley Carroll]], Toronto's acting deputy mayor, suggested that the facility had been zoned before many of the homes were built.&lt;ref name="built" /&gt;

The Technical Standards and Safety Authority, the agency that regulates fuel safety in Ontario, originally said that it had only inspected Sunrise once since it opened in 2005. They later contradicted this by stating that they had issued stop work orders in 2006 and 2007 over safety violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/14/tssa-propane.html |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |title=Propane plant cited for violations in 2006 and 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, nine days after the explosions, Sunrise issued a short news release, stating that the company regrets the loss of life and that they were co-operating with authorities' investigations. The news release also said that they would not be making any more public comments in the near future to prevent speculation and misinformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/19/propane-sunrise.html |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |title=Propane company urges public not to rush to judgment}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 2008 the TSSA issued a notice that Sunrise Propane should immediately have its authorization revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sse.gov.on.ca/mcs/en/Pages/Propane_Safety_Update.aspx |title=An Update On Propane Safety In Ontario |publisher=Ministry of Consumer Services, Province of Ontario |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402051213/http://www.sse.gov.on.ca/mcs/en/Pages/Propane_Safety_Update.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other propane facilities in the province have been shut down as a result of an audit prompted by the explosions. Facilities in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[Ottawa]], and two in Toronto have been ordered to shut down after failing to show that their employees were properly trained at the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080822/propane_folo_080822/20080822?hub=Canada |publisher=CTV |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-22 |title=Investigators find possible cause of propane blast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parminder Saini's father was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to travel from Punjab to Canada to aid in the investigation, although Parminder's brother and mother were denied by the Canadian Consulate. This decision was later changed after the Department of Citizenship and Immigration was informed of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/08/27/saini-propane.html |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |title=Family of missing Sunrise Propane employee given visas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felipe De Leon, an employee at Sunrise, stated that he had completed an illegal propane transfer when he noticed smoke at the north end of the facility. De Leon said he then went inside the facility's office to warn Saini to flee the building, but he refused. De Leon then fled from the facility while Parminder walked towards the smoke.&lt;ref name="illegal transfer" /&gt;

Cleaning up the result of the explosion cost the city of Toronto $CAD 1.8 million, half of which was paid by the province of Ontario.&lt;ref name="cbc 08/09" /&gt;

== Charges laid ==
On August 5, 2009, the [[Ontario Ministry of Labour]] laid two charges in the incident. One of the charges relates to the failure of protecting Saini. The other charge alleges that the company failed to operate within mandatory industry standards. If convicted, the company could be fined up to C$1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090805/090805_sunrise_propane/20090805/?hub=CP24Home Police charge Sunrise Propane after last year's deadly explosion] www.cp24.com, published August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the residents filed a $300 million lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/Toronto+propane+company+faces+charges+explosion/1864276/story.html Toronto Propane Company Faces Charges For Explosion] www.canada.com, published August 5, 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5464">{{About|used petroleum-based or synthetic oil|used vegetable oil|Vegetable oil used as fuel}}
'''Waste oil''' is defined as any [[petroleum]]-based or [[synthetic oil]] that, through contamination, has become unsuitable for its original purpose due to the presence of impurities or loss of original properties.&lt;ref name="EPA1" /&gt;

==Differentiating between "waste oil" and "used oil"==
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] defines the term "used oil" as any petroleum or synthetic oil that has been used, and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/usedoil/ |title=Used Oil Management Program &amp;#124; Common Wastes &amp; Materials &amp;#124; US EPA |work=epa.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Used oil" is a precise regulatory term.  "Waste oil" is a more  generic term for oil that has been contaminated with substances that may or may not be hazardous.&lt;ref name = "EPA1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/usedoil/usedoil.htm |title=Managing Used Oil: Advice for Small Businesses &amp;#124; Common Wastes &amp; Materials &amp;#124; US EPA |work=epa.gov |year=2012 |quote=waste |accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any oil contaminated with hazardous waste may itself be a hazardous waste, and if so, must be managed subject to hazardous waste management standards. Both used oil and waste oil require proper recycling or disposal to avoid creating an environmental problem. 

==Products used as waste oil==
Some examples of types of products that after use, can be labeled as used oil are: [[hydraulic oil]], transmission oil, brake fluids, [[motor oil]], [[crankcase]] oil, [[gear box]] oil, [[synthetic oil]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/wasteoil/wasteoil.htm State of Maine (www.maine.gov)]&lt;/ref&gt; and grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 [[fuel oil]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Disposal of waste oil==
Waste oil can be disposed of in different ways, including sending the used oil off-site (some facilities are permitted to handle the used oil such as your local garages and local waste disposal facilities), burning used oil as a fuel (some used oil is not regulated by burner standards, but others that are off-specification used oil can only be burned in either industrial furnaces, certain boilers, and permitted hazardous waste incinerators), and marketing the used oil (claims are made that the used oil is to be burned for energy recovery, it is then shipped to a used oil burner who burns the used oil in an approved industrial furnace or boiler).
Oils that are off-specification typically contain: Arsenic 5 ppm, Cadmium 2 ppm, Chromium 10 ppm, Lead 100 ppm, [[Flash point]] 100°F, minimum (i.e., fp must be greater than 100°F), Total Halogens &gt;4,000 ppm &lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2007-04-05
|year=1993
|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Guidance
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and handling of waste oil==
For on-site burning of used oil, the oil must be stored in tanks or containers, above or underground. The containers must be in good condition with no leaks, the tanks/containers must be labeled with the words “used oil”, and there must be a [[Oil spill#Prevention|spill prevention plan]] (or a control and countermeasures plan).

===Used Oil Management===
In 1984 the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) implemented a used oil management program under Sections 403.75 through 403.769, Florida Statutes. Florida’s Used Oil Recycling Program has grown to become one of the most successful in the United States and has received national recognition.

===Waste oil furnaces and boilers===
Waste oil furnace is a type of [[furnace]] used for heating purposes and is fueled by used oil that is free of hazardous contaminants, as described by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. Waste-oil-fueled [[boilers]] can be used for various industrial purposes as well as heating.

A '''Williamson amplifier''' refers to a type of [[valve amplifier|vacuum tube (valve) amplifier]] whose circuit design uses the same principles as a design published by [[David Theodore Nelson Williamson|D.T.N. Williamson]]. Williamson proposed the standard which became generally accepted as the target figure for high-quality audio power amplifiers, for less than 0.1% total harmonic distortion at full rated power output.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

== Design==

In April and May 1947, the British magazine ''[[Wireless World]]'' published a pair of articles by D.T.N. Williamson, under the title "Design for a High-quality Amplifier."&lt;ref name=ww&gt;[http://www.sowter.co.uk/pdf/Williamson%20Amplifier.pdf] D.T.N. Willamson, The Williamson Amplifier - A collection of articles reprinted from Wireless world, (Reprint 1994).  Original articles appeared in ''Wireless World'' for April and May 1947, and an updated version with minor changes in August 1949, pp.282-287, with additions in October 1949 at p.365, and November 1949 at p.423.&lt;/ref&gt;  The design, which became known as the "Williamson Amplifier", was an early  example of [[high fidelity]] in an [[sound reproduction|audio]] amplifier (the commercial [[LEAK]] "Point One" Type 15 amplifier of 1945 pre-dates it).  The design became widely known for the notably high quality of its audio reproduction, and many Williamson amplifiers were built, both for own use and for sale; follow-up articles were published, with a slightly revised design&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

The simplicity of the design shows in the circuit diagram.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; The overall negative feedback is clearly seen to be applied by the resistor R25 from the secondary of the [[Transformer#Output transformer|output transformer]] to the cathode of the input V1. While the output transformer is represented simply by the appropriate [[circuit symbol]], it is a component which must be designed with great care.

[[Printed circuit boards]] (PCBs) were rarely used at the time (they were less necessary than they became for complex semiconductor circuits, due to the relative simplicity of circuits and the use of large socketed components); [[point-to-point wiring]] was used.

== Description ==

The Williamson amplifier was of symmetric [[push-pull output|push-pull]] design and used [[negative feedback]] and a specially designed output transformer to produce lower levels of [[distortion]] than previous designs.

The design used [[triode]]s as phase inverters and drivers.  The original output stages used triode-connected [[KT66]] [[tetrode]]s, although a [[6L6]], with slightly lower output, could be used.

A notable characteristic of the design was the use of a [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]] loop enclosing the whole amplifier, including the output transformer, rather than separate feedback around individual stages.  This approach to feedback requires care to be taken to avoid excessive phase-shift around the feedback loop (the transformer being a particular problem), to avoid the feedback becoming positive at any frequency, which would cause undesirable [[oscillator|oscillation]].

Earlier designs used transformers to couple the output signal from one stage to the next. A transformer with a centre-tapped secondary was used as a simple method to drive the push-pull output valves in anti-phase from the previous single-ended stage.

Signal transformers are a source of distortion; if the transformers are not included in the feedback loop, this distortion is not corrected. They also produce large, frequency-dependent phase shifts at higher frequencies, making feedback loops including the transformers problematical.

Williamson eliminated all transformers except the output transformer (unavoidable for matching the high valve impedance to the low loudspeaker impedance) by using capacitor coupling between stages, and a split-load valve voltage amplifier stage ("[[phase splitter]]"), again capacitor-coupled, to provide antiphase signal inputs to the symmetrical push-pull output stages.  There was thus a single signal transformer in the circuit; with careful design of the transformer and the feedback network significant negative feedback could be used before the onset of instability. A 1993 book by [[John Linsley Hood|Linsley Hood]] discusses the characteristics of the Williamson amplifier design and its performance compared to earlier and later designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Linsley Hood]], "The Art of Linear Electronics", (publ. Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1993) esp. ch.9, pages 144-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Williamson design demonstrates the maturity that tube amplification had reached by the late 1940s. Other than the British [[Mullard 5-10]] circuit and David Hafler's [[Dynaco]] ST-70, there was little improvement in the fundamentals. One improvement that was widely used was an output transformer with additional taps allowing use of [[Alan Blumlein|Blumlein's]]  distributed load or [[Ultra-Linear|ultra-linear]] technique, which allowed the output stage, before applying feedback, to operate at a power intermediate between that available from a triode and the significantly higher power from a pentode or [[beam tetrode]], with distortion better than either.

=== Valve lineup ===
The [[vacuum tube|valve]]s used in the original 1947 design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=May 1947|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; were four single triodes (the L63), a directly heated U52 rectifier, and a pair of KT66 beam tetrodes, all from the [[Marconi-Osram Valve|Marconi-Osram Valve (MOV)]] Company. In D.T.N. Williamson's 1949 update in Wireless World several small changes to the circuit were suggested along with a list of alternative triodes and the more significant change in rectifier to the indirectly heated Cossor 53KU or 5V4 to prevent "a damaging voltage surge when the amplifier is switched on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=August 1949|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson said there "is no exact equivalent for the Osram type KT66, and its use is recommended where possible. When the equipment is to be used overseas, the KT66 may be difficult to obtain, and the 6L6 glass and metal types may be regarded as direct replacements, with the proviso that the total anode and screen dissipation should be reduced from 25 W to 21.5 W by reducing the total current from 125&amp;nbsp;mA to 110&amp;nbsp;mA by adjustment of R&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=D.T.N.|journal=Wireless World|date=January 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Follow-up articles in Wireless World from October 1949 to May 1952 included circuits for Tone controls, Radio Feeder Unit, and modifications for High-impedance Pickups and Long-playing record equalisation. The valves used are:

== Historical significance ==
Even two decades later, the Williamson amplifier's performance was a standard of comparison for innovative successor developments, including well-known semiconductor audio amplifiers such as Linsley Hood's transistor "Simple Class-A Amplifier", published in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sound.whsites.net/jll_hood.htm John Linsley Hood, ''Wireless World'' for April 1969, pp.148-153.]&lt;/ref&gt; with explicit discussion of Williamson's criterion.
