The '''Abakada alphabet''' was an "indigenized" [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] adopted for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog-based]] [[Filipino language|Filipino national language]]  in 1940. ''

The alphabet, which contains 20 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], was introduced in the grammar book developed by [[Lope K. Santos]] for the newly-designated national language based on Tagalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan |title=Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet was officially adopted by the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|Institute of National Language]] ({{lang-fil|Surián ng Wikang Pambansâ}}). 

The Abakada alphabet has since been superseded by the modern [[Filipino alphabet]] adopted in 1987. 

==Order/collation of the Abakada==
The collation of letters in the Abakada closely follows those of other Latin-based spelling systems, with the digraph ''ng'' inserted after ''n''. 

When spelling or naming each consonant, its sound is always pronounced with an "a" at the end (e.g. "ba", "ka", etc). This is also the reason for the system’s name.

==History==
{{main|Tagalog language#Writing system}}

During the [[History of the Philippines (Before 1521)|pre-Hispanic era]], [[Tagalog language|Old Tagalog]] was written using the [[Kawi script|Kawi]] or the [[Baybayin]] script. 
For three centuries Tagalog was written following, to some extent, the Spanish phonetic and orthographic rules.

Dr. [[José Rizal]], was one of several proponents (including [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]]) of reforming the orthographies of the various Philippine languages in the late 19th-century. Like other proponents, he suggested to "indigenize" the alphabet of the Philippine languages by replacing the letters ''C'' and ''Q'' with ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf#search=%22siuala%22/ |title=Kapampángan or Capampáñgan: Settling the Dispute on the Kapampángan Romanized Orthography |last=Pangilinan |first=Michael Raymon |accessdate=2010-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821142028/http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf#search=%22siuala%22/ |archive-date=2006-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these reforms were not broadly adopted when they were proposed but gradually became popular into the early 20th century. 

Following the establishment of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] in 1935, the government selected Tagalog as basis for a "national language" (i.e. Filipino). Following this, the development of a dictionary and grammar book for this "national language" started. In 1939, Lope K. Santos developed the ''Ang Balarila ng Wikang Pambansa'' (The Grammar of the National Language) which, apart from containing grammar rules, contained the 20-letter alphabet designated as ''Abakada''.

The Abakada was replaced in 1976 with an expanded alphabet containing an additional 11 letters (C, CH, F, J, LL, Ñ, Q, RR, V, X, and Z) which was in turn replaced with the current 28-letter modern alphabet. At present, all [[languages of the Philippines]] may be written using the modern [[Filipino alphabet]] (officially adopted in 1987), which includes all the letters of the Abakada.

'''Albert Étienne Jean-Baptiste Terrien de Lacouperie''' (23 November 1844 &amp;ndash; 11 October 1894)&lt;ref name=br&gt;[http://recherche.archivesdepartementales76.net/?id=viewer&amp;doc=accounts%2Fmnesys_ad76%2Fdatas%2Fir%2Fserie_E_seigneuries_familles_notaires_etat_civil%2FFRAD076_IR_E_etat_civil%2Exml&amp;page_ref=1903403&amp;lot_num=1&amp;img_num=1&amp;index_in_visu=  Ingouville Birth registry 1844 4E090878 entry no394 Archives 76 online p203]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB00" /&gt; was a French [[oriental studies|orientalist]], specialising in [[comparative philology]]. He published a number of books on early Asian and Middle-Eastern languages, initially in French and then in English. Lacouperie is best known for his studies of the [[Yi Ching]] and his argument, known as [[Sino-Babylonianism]], that the important elements of ancient civilization in ancient China came from [[Mesopotamia]] and that there were resemblances between [[Chinese characters]] and Akkadian hieroglyphics.

The American sinologist [[E. Bruce Brooks]] writes that Lacouperie "gained a sufficiently accurate view of the Spring and Autumn period that he realized, half a century before [[Qian Mu|Chyen Mu]] and [[Owen Lattimore]], that the 'Chinese' territory of that period was in fact honeycombed with non-Sinitic peoples and even states." Brooks concluded that the "whole trend of Lacouperie's thought still provokes a collective allergic reaction in Sinology and its neighbor sciences; only now are some of the larger questions he raised, and doubtless mishandled, coming to be hesitantly askable."&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;

Terrien died in London at his residence, 136 Bishop's Road, [[Fulham]], leaving a widow.&lt;ref name="DNB00" /&gt;

==Early life and name==
Biographical detail on Terrien is scant, some notices drawing on [[Royal Asiatic Society]] records and prefaces. He was born in November 1844&lt;ref name="sinologie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=27143|title=Terrien De Lacouperie, Albert Étienne Jean Baptiste|origyear=2004|year=2005|last=Carlyle|first=Edward Irving|last2=Ryan|first2=Janette}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;{{cite web| date = 9 June 2004 | url=http://www.umass.edu/wsp/resources/profiles/lacouperie.html|title=Albert Terrien de Lacouperie|last=Brooks|first=E. Bruce|work=Sinologists (biography project)|publisher= [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Ingouville]], [[Le Havre]], [[Normandy]]. He was a descendant of the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] family of Terrien, which emigrated in the 17th century during the [[English Civil War]], and acquired the property of [[La Couperie]] in Normandy. Some bibliographies append "Baron" to his name&lt;ref name="HackerMoore2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacker|first1=Edward A.|last2=Moore|first2=Steve|last3=Patsco|first3=Lorraine|title=I Ching – An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5hLpfFiMCQC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 November 2010|year=2002| publisher= [[Psychology Press]] (via [[Google Books]]) |isbn=978-0-415-93969-0|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears he published under the name '''Albert Étienne Jean-Baptiste Terrien de Lahaymonnais Peixotte de Poncel, Baron de La Couperie''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Subject Index of Modern Works Added to the Library of B.M. in Years 1880-1885 ... |date=1886 |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WFWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=Peixotte+de+Poncel,+Baron+de+La+Couperie |accessdate=14 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Desmet |first1=Piet |title=La linguistique naturaliste en France (1867-1922): nature, origine et évolution du langage |date=1996 |publisher=Peeters Publishers |isbn=9789068318784 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDY5Jny4tbkC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Baron+de+Lacouperie |accessdate=14 July 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no record of the family being ennobled. His father was a merchant, and Albert received a business education.

==Career==
In early life he settled at Hong Kong, where he soon turned his attention from commerce to the study of oriental languages, and he acquired an especially intimate knowledge of the Chinese language. In 1867, he published a [[philological]] work, ''Du Langage, Essai sur la Nature et l'Étude des Mots et des Langues'' (Paris, 8 volumes), which attracted considerable attention. Soon after, his attention was attracted by the progress made in deciphering [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] inscriptions, and by the resemblance between the Chinese characters and the early [[Akkadian language]] hieroglyphics.

The comparative philology of the two languages occupied most of his later life, and he was able to show an early affinity between them. In 1879, he went to London, was elected a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, and began to write works in English. In 1884, he became professor of comparative philology, as applied to the languages of South-Eastern Asia, at [[University College, London]].

In the 1880s, he was also employed on several short-term contracts to work on the East-Asian coin collection at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Wang|Wang, Helen]]. "A History of the Japanese Coin Collection at the British Museum", in Sakuraki et al., ''Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre-Meiji) at the British Museum'', British Museum Research Publication 174, 2010 {{ISBN|978-086159-174-9}}, pp. 1–12; Wang, Helen. "How did Kutsuki Masatsuna's Coins Come to the British Museum", ''ibid'', pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he published his ''Catalogue of Chinese Coins from the VIIth Century BC to AS 621 including the Series in the British Museum'', for which the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], France, awarded him the [[prix Stanislas Julien|Stanislas Julien Prize]], worth 1,500 [[French franc]]s, "for the best work relating to China".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'' 1893 (July), p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Wang, "A Short History of Chinese Numismatics in European Languages", Early China vols 35-36 (2012-2013). https://www.dartmouth.edu/~earlychina/docs/2012-2013/publorderonline2012-13.html&lt;/ref&gt;

His last years were largely occupied by a study of the I Ching, or ''[[Book of Changes]]''. Its meaning had long proved a puzzle both to native and to foreign scholars. Terrien demonstrated that the basis of the work consisted of fragmentary notes, chiefly lexical in character, and noticed that they bore a close resemblance to the [[syllabaries]] of [[Chaldaea]]. In 1892, he published the first part of an explanatory treatise ''The Oldest Book of the Chinese'' (London, 8 volumes), in which he stated his theory of the nature of the I Ching, and gave translations of passages from it. The treatise, however, was not completed before his death.

In recognition of his services to oriental study he received a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]]. He also enjoyed for a time a small pension from the French government, and after that had been withdrawn an unsuccessful attempt was made by his friends to obtain him an equivalent from the English ministry. He was twice awarded the ''[[prix Stanislas Julien]]'' by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] for his services to oriental philology.

==Evaluations of Lacouperie's theories==
Lacouperie's translations and [[Sino-Babylonianism|Sino-Babylonian]] theories that the origins of Chinese civilization lay in Mesopotamia impressed the public but were criticised or dismissed by sinologists then and in following years. [[James Legge]], whose translations of the Chinese Classics appeared at the same time as Terrien's and are still considered standard, questioned Terrien's sinological competence. Legge's review of Lacouperie's translation of the [[I Ching]] charged that only "hasty ignorance" could have led to the mistakes, which included failing to consult the basic reference, the [[Kangxi Dictionary]]. Another reviewer at the time labelled Terrien a "specious wonder-monger." But the final decline of Lacouperie's comparativist theories of the origins of Chinese civilisation was marked by the attacks of [[University of Leiden]] sinologist, [[Gustav Schlegel]]. Schlegel and following Orientalists insisted on the independent origin and growth of Chinese civilisation. In particular, these scholars pointed out that monosyllabic [[Chinese characters]] could not be equated to polysyllabic Chaldean words; that in any case, Assyriological knowledge was "dangerously uncertain" and too unreliable to make such claims; and that it had not even been established that Babylonian civilization was earlier than Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J. Girardot, ''The Victorian Translation of China: James Legge's Oriental Pilgrimage'' (Berkeley: University of California Press,  2002), 388–390. Girardot describes the controversies in detail, pp. 382–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacouperie's theory on the Babylonion origins of the sixty year [[ganzhi]] cyclical calendar system has fared little better, as the two systems differed both in concept and function: the Babylonion decimal system was used to count up to 60, where the cycle started again, while the Chinese system combined a cycle of twelve and a cycle of ten.&lt;ref&gt;Endymion Wilkinson, ''Chinese History: A New Manual'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,  2013), pp. 497–498.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacouperie's ideas received attention from some Chinese intellectuals and nationalists, in support of [[anti-Manchuism|anti-Manchu]] racist theories (founded on those of [[Herbert Spencer]] and the ''Yellow Book'') that were current at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Furth, "Intellectual Change, 1895–1920,in {{cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Twitchett|first2=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge History of China: Republican China, 1912–1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk0qxSh88_AC&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=23 November 2010|volume=12|year=1983|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-23541-9|pages=355–6|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of a Western origin of Chinese civilization had reached Japan around the same time, the academic refutation did not stop it becoming a prevalent and populist notion.&lt;ref name="Yoshihiro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/15/15ishikawa7-26.pdf|title=Anti-Manchu Racism and the Rise of Anthropology in Early 20th century China|last=Yoshihiro|first=Ishikawa|year=2003|work=Sino-Japanese Studies|publisher=chinajapan.org|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for a mythical script, native to [[Formosa]], was founded on a formulation of the author, though he also noted the paucity in quality of information from that region.&lt;ref name="LubotskySchaeken2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lubotsky|first1=Alexander|last2=Schaeken|first2=Jos|last3=Wiedenhof|first3=Jeroen|title=Evidence and Counter-Evidence: Essays in Honour of Frederik Kortlandt.

A more durable contribution to scholarship was Lacouperie's identification of the ancient names of the Indian [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] and [[Kharosthi]] scripts from research in Chinese sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=Harry|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|date=1993|publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag|pages=84–85,106|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alessandro Duranti''' (born September 17, 1950 in [[Rome]], Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/duranti/|title=Professor Alessandro Duranti|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and served as Dean of Social Sciences at [[UCLA]] from 2009-2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailybruin.com/2009/05/31/new-dean-college/&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Education==
Duranti was trained in linguistics at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] (laurea, 1974), where he studied general linguistics and [[ethnolinguistics]] with [[:it:Giorgio Raimondo Cardona|Giorgio Raimondo Cardona]] (1943-1988), and at the University of Southern California (PhD, 1981), where he specialized in [[Bantu languages]] under [[Larry Hyman]] while working with [[Elinor Ochs]] on the conversational foundations of Italian word order patterns.&lt;ref&gt;A. Duranti and Elinor Ochs. 1979. "Left-dislocation in Italian Conversation." In ''Syntax and Semantics, vol. 12: Discourse and Syntax,'' ed by T. Givon, 377-416. New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;  His dissertation, ''The Fono: A Samoan Speech Event'', based on 13 months of fieldwork in the (then Western) [[Samoa]]n community of Falefā, on the island of ‘[[Upolu]], focused on the language and social organization of the meeting of the local ‘council’ (fono) that he analyzed by extending [[Dell Hymes]]’ Speech Event Model to include speechmaking across speakers and situations.

==Overview==
Duranti fully embraced an anthropological perspective on language through his collaboration with Elinor Ochs during and after their fieldwork in (then Western) Samoa in 1978-79 and 1981. In 1980-81, Duranti was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Australian National University]] where he was part of a Working Group on Language and Context under the direction of [[Roger Keesing]]. In 1980-81, the core group, which met regularly throughout the year, included Elinor Ochs, John B. Haviland, [[Penelope Brown]], [[Steven Levinson]], and [[Robert Van Valin, Jr.]] In 1983-84, Duranti was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC)]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], directed by Michael Cole. After teaching at the University of Rome, [[Pitzer College]], and the University of California at San Diego, Duranti joined the Anthropology Department at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1988. In the 1990s, he carried out fieldwork among Samoan immigrants in Southern California to study, in collaboration with Elinor Ochs, how second generation Samoan children were being socialized in the context of a bicultural, bilingual environment. 

In 1987 Duranti (in collaboration with [[Bambi Schieffelin]]) founded the journal IPrA Papers in Pragmatics, later renamed Pragmatics. In 1992, he co-edited with Charles Goodwin ''Rethinking Context: Language as an Interactive Phenomenon'', a collection of essays that continues to be widely read and cited as one of the key references on the study of the relationship between language and context. In 1994, Duranti published ''From Grammar to Politics: Linguistic Anthropology in a Western Samoan Village'' (University of California Press), an ethnography of Samoan ways of speaking that integrates the analysis of the spatio-temporal dimensions of speech events with the detailed analysis of the grammatical patterns used in political arenas and in more informal interaction to manage what Duranti called “the moral flow of discourse.” This was the beginning of his interest in how agency is
expressed and enacted through language, a topic that he has since explored in a number of publications. In 1995-96, using a combination of participant-observation and videography, Duranti documented the political campaign for the U.S. Congress of [[Walter Capps]], then Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  In support of this project, in 1999 he received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. After completing a treatise on the field of [[linguistic anthropology]] for the Cambridge University Press series in linguistics (Duranti 1997), he dedicated himself to editing a number of collections to make recent research on language and culture accessible to a wider range of students and scholars (Duranti 2001a, 2001b, 2004). 

In 2002, Duranti started a collaboration with legendary jazz guitarist [[Kenny Burrell]], with the goal of documenting jazz culture and teaching jazz aesthetics to students in the social sciences. One product of their collaboration is a course on the culture of jazz aesthetics, where jazz musicians are invited to play and talk about their music. The video recording of their class, student concerts, and other events in which jazz is taught, played, and discussed at the university and elsewhere has produced hundreds of hours of audio visual documentation of the contemporary jazz scene in Los Angeles.

Since the late 1980s, Duranti has also had an active role in editing journals and books. In 1990-1994, he was an associate editor of ''American Ethnologist'' and in 1999-2001 he was editor of the ''Journal of Linguistic Anthropology''. 

Duranti’s most recent work, ''The Anthropology of Intentions: Language in a World of Others''&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Duranti 2015. ''The Anthropology of Intentions: Language in a World of Others''.  Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;, investigates his long-held interests on the limits of focusing on speakers’ intentions for understanding language as action.  His earlier critique of [[speech act theory]] is here expanded to a broader discussion of intentionality and intersubjectivity inspired by [[Edmund Husserl]]’s writings and supported by examples drawn from three of his research projects: his ethnographic study of Samoan ways of speaking, the audio-visual documentation of the 1995-96 political campaign of Walter Capps for the U.S. Congress, and a study of the culture of jazz aesthetics and improvisation. Duranti demonstrates how “cognitive, emotional, and embodied dispositions [are] always embedded in an intersubjective world of experience.”&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 2015: 16&lt;/ref&gt; Duranti introduces into anthropological theory the novel concept of the ''intentional continuum'' to describe “a range of graded ways of being disposed or mentally (and sensorially) connected with some entity in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 2015: 290&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review of the book, the developmental psychologist Martin J. Packer demonstrates how the intentional continuum is a necessary expansion to the standard theory of mind found in [[John Searle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The standard components of theory of mind—beliefs, desires, and goals—capture only a small part of this continuum. Searle’s (1983) attempt to reduce all points on the continuum to the fundamental Intentional states of belief and desire seems less than satisfying…When we understand another person’s actions, or grasp the meaning of their words, we are paying attention to one part or another of this continuum, “seeing as” in ways that have been shaped by the culture in which we live.&lt;ref&gt; Martin J. Packer 2017. "Promises, Promises." ''Mind, Culture, and Activity'', 24:1, 81-84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her review of the book, the anthropologist and linguist [[Jane H. Hill]] writes that “Duranti aims here to move away from homogeneous characterizations of whole cultures as inattentive or attentive to ''mens rea'' toward richer and more deeply contextualized accounts of exactly when, by whom, and how such attention is given or withheld.”&lt;ref&gt;Jane H. Hill 2016. "Alessandro Duranti, The Anthropology of Intentions: Language in a World of Others." ''Language in Society'' 45(04): 611&lt;/ref&gt; Duranti’s book is the subject of a 2017 Book Symposium in [[HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/pages/view/hauapp|title=The HAU App|website=www.haujournal.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which includes response from Eve Danziger, [[Shaun Gallagher]] and the authors of the other featured book, ''The Concept of Action''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=oC42DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+concept+of+action&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMwP-d5YDXAhWHqFQKHcZ0DdgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20concept%20of%20action&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, N.J Enfield and Jack Sidnell.

The '''Apache OpenNLP''' library is a [[machine learning]] based toolkit for the [[natural language processing|processing of natural language]] text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as [[Language identification|language detection]], [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], [[Sentence boundary disambiguation|sentence segmentation]], [[part-of-speech tagging]], [[Named entity recognition|named entity extraction]], [[Shallow parsing|chunking]], [[Syntactic parsing|parsing]] and [[coreference|coreference resolution]]. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opennlp.apache.org/index.html Apache OpenNLP Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/OpenNLPProposal Apache OpenNLP Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maryda Patral 2.jpg|thumb|300px|2nd Page of Letter of Conduct written by Jain Swetamber Terapanth First Spiritual Head Acharya Bhiksu in Rajasthani Language nearly 200 years ago]]

'''Acharya Bhikshu''' (1726–1803) was the founder and first spiritual head of the [[Svetambar Terapanth]] sect of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dundas|first=Paul|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA254|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-26606-8|page= 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh |first=Narendra |title=Encyclopaedia of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoDUPJpb63UC&amp;pg=PA5188|year=2001|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-0691-3|chapter=Acahrya Bhikshu and Terapanth|page= 5184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a disciple of [[Mahavira]]. In the initial phase of his spiritual revolution, he moved out from the group of [[Sthanakvasi]] Acharya Raghunath. That time he had 13 saints, 13 followers and 13 the basic rules. This coincidence results in the name of "Terapanth" (Thirteen Path).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shashi|first=S. S.|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Origin and development of Indus civilization (Volume 1)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5_n00RqRc0C&amp;pg=PA948|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-7041-859-3|page=945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vallely|first=Anne |title=Guardians of the transcendent: an ethnography of a Jain ascetic community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eI4PAY9rDmQC&amp;pg=PA150|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-8415-X|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various beliefs and teachings of the religious orders of those times greatly influenced his thinking. He studied and analysed the various disciplines of the Jain religion and on this basis he compiled his own ideologies and principles of the Jain way of life. Based on the doctrines propagated, Acharya Bhikshu rigorously followed the principles. It was this way of life that was demonstrated by Acharya Bhikshu which became the foundation principle of Terapanth. The Letter of Conduct was written by him is still followed in the same manner with due respect with slight changes as per the time &amp; situation. The original copy of letter written in Rajasthani language is still available. His followers piously referred to this monk as 'Swamiji'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Acharya Bhikshu visualised a systematic, well established and orderly religious sect and saw it taking shape through ''Terapanth''. To organise and stabilise this religious order he propagated the ideology of one guru and brought to an end the concept of self discipleship.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In this way his ideology of one Acharya, one principle, one thought and similar thinking became the ideal for other religious sects. Acharya Bhikshu said the common man should understand and practise true religion which would take him to the path of salvation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Life==
Acharya Bhikshu (aka Bhikhanji) was born in Kantaliya  in Rajasthan in 1726. He belonged to a merchant class named Bisa Oswal. He was initiated as a monk by a Sthanakvasi Acarya Ragunathji in 1751. He broke away from Sthanakvasi sect after receiving complaints from numerous lay followers in 1759. Upon reading the scriptures, he found that the order of monks have wandered away from true teachings of Jainism; Ragunathji seconded the same but was unwilling to bring the same in the sect as they were hard to follow by the other monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dundas|first=Paul|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA254|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-26606-8|page= 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution ==
In the middle of the 18th century, Acharya Bhikshu led a reformist movement. A philosopher, writer, poet and social reformer, he wrote 38,000 "shlokas", now compiled in two volumes as "Bhikshu Granth Ratnakar". His "Nav Padarth Sadbhav", which advocated a society free from exploitation, and is regarded{{who|date=July 2015}} as a significant philosophical composition that deals exhaustively with the nine gems of Jain philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Postage stamp==
On 30 June 2004, the vice-president,{{specify|VP of what?|date=July 2015}} Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had released a special commemorative postage stamp in memory of Jain saint Acharya Shri Bhikshu on the occasion of the "nirvana" bicentenary. The stamp issued by the Department of Posts is in Rs. 5 denomination. Two special functions were organised to release this Rs. 5/- stamp. The first function was organised at the residence of Vice-President of India, Shri Bhairo Singh Shekhavat at New Delhi. Second release function was organised at [[Siriyari]] (Distt. Pali, Rajasthan) where Acharya Bhikshu had attained Nirvana.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

There are two main translations of the [[Bible]] into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] widely in use today—the [[Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible|New Interconfessional Version]] ([[:ja:新共同訳聖書|新共同訳聖書]]) and the New Japanese Bible ([[:ja:新改訳聖書|新改訳聖書]]). Both are published by the [[Japan Bible Society]] but with different translation goals. The New Japanese Version aims to be used as a literal translation using modern Japanese while the New Interconfessional Version aims to be [[ecumenical]]ly used by all [[Christian]] denominations and must therefore conform to various theologies. [[Evangelical Protestant|Protestant Evangelicals]] most often use the New Japanese Version but the most widely distributed Bible and the one used by the [[Catholic Church]], the United Church of Christ, Lutheran Church factions and many Anglicans in Japan is the New Interconfessional Version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeanet.org/ {{Nihongo2|日本福音同盟}} - Japan Evangelical Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;日本福音同盟『日本の福音派』Japan Evangelical Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;新改訳聖書刊行会『聖書翻訳を考える』&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;中村敏『日本における福音派の歴史』{{ISBN|4264018269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;尾山令仁『聖書翻訳の歴史と現代訳』&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesuit missions==
Japanese Bible translation began when Catholic missionaries (''[[Kirishitan]]'') entered Japan in 1549, and [[Jesuits]] published portions of the New Testament in [[Kyoto]], in 1613, though no copy survives. Exactly how much was translated by the Jesuit Mission is not confirmed. It would seem that at least Gospels for the Sundays of the year and other Bible pericopes were translated.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Christianity in Japan:  Mark Mullins - 2003 Among these writings were the Gospels for the Sundays of the year and other Bible pericopes, such as Passion ... Captain [[John Saris]], an English adventurer who spent about two years in Japan, made the following entry in his diary while in Kyoto on 9 October 1613: In this cittie of Meaco, the Portingall Jesuitts haue a verie statelie Colledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bible translator 18 United Bible Societies - 1967 "In his diary for October 9th, when he visited Miako (Kyoto), we find the entry : In this cittie of Meaco, the Portingall Iesuitts ... which identifies one volume as 'A Japanese New Testament printed in Miako by the Jesuits in 1613'."&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, however, Christianity was banned and all the missionaries were exiled. That translation of the Bible is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'' (In Japanese). Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant missionaries==
Work on translation started outside Japan in the 19th century by Protestant missionaries interested in Japan. [[Karl Gutzlaff]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] translated the [[Gospel of John]] in [[Macau]] in 1837, referring to the Chinese version of [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] (Chinese ''Shentian Shengshu'' 神天聖書). [[Bernard Jean Bettelheim]], who had been a missionary in the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] ([[Okinawa]]) and who had been exiled, translated the Bible to Ryūkyūan and published the [[Gospel of Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]], [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Epistle to the Romans]] in [[Hong Kong]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 3&lt;/ref&gt; Japan re-opened in 1858, and many missionaries came into the country. They found that intellectuals could read Chinese texts easily, so they used Chinese Bibles at first. However, the proportion of intellectuals was only in the region of 2%{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and in order to spread their religion across the country more effectively, a Japanese Bible became necessary. Incidentally, a second reversion of Bettelheim's Luke was published in 1858, intercolumnated with the [[Bible translations into Chinese#Delegates Version|Chinese Delegates' version]], and designed for missionary use in Japan. This version, with its heavy Ryūkyūan flavor, proved just as unsuitable as Chinese-only Bibles. After leaving Asia and immigrating to the United States, Bettelheim continued work on his translations, and newly revised editions of Luke, John, and the Acts, now closer to Japanese than Ryūkyūan, were published posthumously in Vienna in 1873-1874 with the assistance of [[August Pfizmaier]].

===Meiji Version, 1887===
[[File:James Curtis Hepburn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|100px|James Curtis Hepburn]]
A translation was done by [[James Curtis Hepburn]], of the Presbyterian Mission,  and [[Samuel Robbins Brown]], of the [[Reformed Church of America]]. It is presumed that Japanese intellectual assistants helped translate Bridgman and Culbertson's Chinese Bible (1861) into Japanese, and Hepburn and Brown adjusted the phrases. The Gospels of Mark, Matthew and John were published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn's project was taken over by a Missionary Committee, sponsored by the [[American Bible Society]], [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] and the [[Scottish Bible Society]] in Tokyo. Their [[New Testament]] and [[Old Testament]], called the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] Version (明治元訳 ''meiji genyaku'', "Meiji era Original Translation"), was published in 1880 and 1887 respectively. They translated from a Greek text as well as the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James version]].&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 6,7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'', (In Japanese) Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, Section 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Tastement as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},pp.620-621&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taisho Revised Version, 1917===
A revision of the New Testament, the ''Taisho Revised Version'' (大正改訳聖書 ''taisho kaiyaku seisho'', "Taisho era Revised Translation of Scripture") appeared in 1917 during the [[Taishō period]]. This version was widely read even outside of Christian society. Its phrases are pre-modern style, but became popular in Japan. This was based on the Nestle-Aland Greek Text and the English [[Revised Version]] (RV).&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'', (In Japanese) Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, Section 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Tastement as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},p.622&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible, Japanese Colloquial, 1954, 1955, 1975, 1984, 2002===
After World War II, the {{Nihongo|[[Japan Bible Society]]|[[:ja:日本聖書協会|日本聖書協会]]|nihon seisho kyōkai}} translated the "{{Nihongo|Bible, Japanese Colloquial|[[:ja:口語訳聖書|口語訳聖書]]|kōgoyaku seisho}}". The New Testament being ready in 1954 and the Old Testament in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bible.or.jp/e/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by certain Protestant churches but never became really popular, perhaps because of its poor literary style. This translation was based on the [[Revised Standard Version]] (RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'', (In Japanese) Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, Section 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Testament as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},p.623-633&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese Living Bible, 1977, 1993, 2016===
Based on the [[New Living Translation]] this translation has an informal literary style which attempts to capture the meaning of the original texts in modern Japanese. Revised version released in 2016 by Word of Life press.

1977 version available online in PDF form from [http://www.biblica.com/bibles/japanese/ Biblica] and at [https://www.bible.com/bible/83/gen.1 bible.com]

===New Japanese Bible, 1965, 1970, 1978, 2003, 2017===
In 1970 the {{Nihongo|[[Nnihon Seisho Kankōkai|NSK]]|[[:ja:日本聖書刊行会|日本聖書刊行会]]|nihon seisho kankōkai}} - different from the {{Nihongo|[[Japan Bible Society]]|[[:ja:日本聖書協会|日本聖書協会]]|nihon seisho kyōkai}} - released the first edition of the {{Nihongo|[[New Japanese Bible]]|[[:ja:新改訳聖書|新改訳聖書]]|shin kaiyaku seisho|"New Revised Version of the Bible"}} which was translated from Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek ([[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]] and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Quote|新約はネストレの校訂本二四版、旧約はキッテルの三版以後のものに基づき、訳業を進めたが、||The {{Interlanguage link multi|New Japanese Bible|ja|3=新改訳聖書}} Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shin Kaiyaku'' endeavors to translate theologically difficult passages in a way that is linguistically accurate to the source texts, to strike a balance between [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|word-for-word and thought-for-thought]] but erring toward a literal translation.

The latest edition was released in 2017.

===New Interconfessional Translation, 1987, 1988===
The [[Second Vatican Council]] decided to promote [[ecumenism]] and emphasized respect for the Bible. Consortia between the Catholic and the Protestant churches were organized and translation projects started in many countries, including Japan. The collaboration committee published the {{Nihongo|[[Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible#Interconfessional Translation Bible|Interconfessional Translation Bible]]|[[:ja:共同訳聖書|共同訳聖書]]|kyōdō yaku seisho}} of the New Testament in 1978, but it was not widely supported by both congregations, Catholic and Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'', (In Japanese) Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, pp.148-168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Tastement as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},pp.651-661&lt;/ref&gt; The committee then published a revised version in 1987, the {{Nihongo|[[Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible|New Interconfessional Translation Bible]]|[[:ja:新共同訳聖書|新共同訳聖書]]|shin kyōdō yaku seisho}}, which included the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Norihisa Suzuki, ''Japanese in the Bible: A History of Translation'', (In Japanese) Iwanamishoten, 2006, {{ISBN|4-00-023664-4}}, pp.168-177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Testament as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},pp.661-692&lt;/ref&gt; It has been distributed well by various organisations such as [[Gideons International]], the next edition is planned to be released in 2016.

==Other translators==
There are many other Japanese translations of the Bible by various organizations and individuals.

===Catholic versions===
In the Catholic Church, [[Emile Raguet]] of the MEP translated the New Testament from the [[Vulgate]] Latin version and published it in 1910. It was treated as the standard text by Japanese Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Arimichi Ebizawa, "Bible in Japan  --A History of Japanese Bible Translation,"(In Japanese) Kodansha, 1989, {{ISBN|4-06-158906-7}}, Section 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Barbaro]] colloquialized it (published in 1957). He went on to translate the Old Testament in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Testament as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},pp.648-649&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franciscans]] completed a translation of the whole Bible, based on the Greek and Hebrew text, in 1978. This project was inspired by the [[Jerusalem Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenzo Tagawa, "New Tastement as a Text," (In Japanese) Keisoshobou, 1997, {{ISBN|4-326-10113-X}},pp.649-650&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox versions===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">In [[politics]], a '''cartel party''' or '''cartel political party''' is a party which uses the [[resource]]s of the state to maintain its position within the [[political system]]. [[Richard S. Katz|Katz]] and [[Peter Mair|Mair]] argue that "parties in [[Western Europe]] have adapted themselves to declining levels of participation and involvement in party activities by not only turning to resources provided by the state but by doing so in a collusive manner".&lt;ref&gt;K Detterbeck, Cartel Parties in Western Europe?, Party Politics, Vol. 11, No. 2, p173-191 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the cartel party was first proposed in 1992 as a means of drawing attention to the patterns of inter-party collusion or cooperation rather than competition; and as a way of emphasising  the influence of the state on party development.  In definitional terms, the cartel party is a type of party that emerges in advanced democratic polities and that is characterised by the interpenetration of party and state and by a pattern of inter-party collusion.  With the development of the cartel party, the goals of politics become self-referential, professional and technocratic, and what little inter-party competition remains becomes focused on the efficient and effective management of the polity. The election campaigns that are conducted by cartel parties are capital-intensive, professionalized and centralized, and are organized on the basis of a strong reliance on the state for financial subventions and for other benefits and privileges. Within the party, the distinction between party members and non-members becomes blurred, in that through primaries, electronic polling, and so on, the parties invite all of their supporters, members or not, to participate in party activities and decision-making.  Above all, with the emergence of cartel parties, politics becomes increasingly depoliticised.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S Katz and Peter Mair, Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: the emergence of the cartel party, Party Politics, Vol. 1, No. 1, p 5-31 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9467">{{About|a noun phrase that lauds an admirable person, team, or organization||Class Act (disambiguation)}}

A '''class act''' is a performance or personal trait or behavior that is distinctive and of high quality.  As a [[noun phrase]], it is typically used to refer to a single person, a team – such as a performing artists working together – or an organization.

== Usage and contemporary etymology ==
=== In sports ===
In sports, a "class act" would be an athlete who not only performs exceptionally well, but also exhibits a range of other admirable qualities, on and off the field.

=== In dance ===
In dance during the [[jazz age]] and the [[swing era]] (the first half of the [[20th century]]) – [[tap dance]] in particular – a class act was, and still is, a complimentary reference to a dance team that exhibits precision, elegant dress, detached coolness, flawless execution, and dignity.&lt;ref name="Atkins 2001" /&gt; In 1946, after serving in the Army, [[Charles "Honi" Coles]] and [[Cholly Atkins]] collaborated as a dance duo that became highly acclaimed.  British dance critic Edward Thorpe, in his 1989 book, ''Black Dance,'' described Coles and Atkins as {{nowrap| ... }}

{{cquote|the ultimate example of what other protagonists of American vernacular dance call "a class act," and there can be no higher praise than that.&lt;ref name="Thorpe 1990" /&gt;|25px|25px|}}

For black dancers of the [[jazz age]] and the [[swing era]], the noun phrase, "class act," had a more nuanced meaning.  According to [[Cholly Atkins]], some performers and managers harbored [[stereotypical]] preferences of how black male dancers and musical comedy dance teams should dress and perform.  To those performers and managers, a class act was more apropos for white male entertainers.  Black entertainers who did it were likely to be perceived as defiant. [[Cholly Atkins|Atkins]], in his 2001 book, ''Class Act'' (co-authored with Jacqui Malone), stated that,

{{cquote|If they ''[white dancers]'' were singers or comics, they didn't like the fact that we were also doing those things as part of our act.|25px|25px|Cholly Atkins (2001)&lt;ref name="Atkins 2001" /&gt;}}

Against the backdrop of dance teams working in the [[blackface]] tradition, Atkins was one in a long list of virtuoso black male dance artists who rejected the [[minstrel-show]] [[stereotypes]] of the grinning-and-dancing clowns {{nowrap| ... }} lazy, incompetent [[Fool (stock character)|fools]] {{nowrap| ... }} and [[dandy|dandies]] who thought only of flashy clothes, flirtatious courting, new dances, and good looks.&lt;ref name="Seibert 2016" /&gt;  Atkins' and his peers aspired to pure artistic expression driven by a desire for respectability and equality on the American concert stage.&lt;ref name="PerformingArtsEnclopedia 1977" /&gt;

==== Class act syles, in tap ====
[[Marshall Stearns]], in the 1964 film-made-for-TV, ''Over the Top to Bebop,'' stated that the class act "started with the [[Tap dance|soft-shoe]] and the sand and the [[Tap dance technique|shuffle]]; and it grew up and became a dance in which you showed elegance and dignity and precision. And every class act in the thirties and forties had their own [[Tap dance|soft-shoe]]."&lt;ref name="Film-Over-the-Top 1965" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DanceResearchJournal Summer 1988" /&gt;

== Selected "class acts" ==

=== In vaudeville ===
* [[J. Rosamond Johnson|Rosamond Johnson]] and [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]], [[vaudeville]] duo that began in 1902&lt;ref name="Wintz-Finkelman 2004" /&gt;

'''Colonisation''' or '''colonization''' is the process in [[biology]] by which a [[species]] spreads to new areas. Colonisation often refers to ''successful'' [[immigration]] where a population becomes integrated into a [[community (ecology)|community]], having resisted initial local [[extinction]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

One classic [[Scientific modelling|model]] in [[biogeography]] posits that species must continue to colonize new areas through its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] (called a ''taxon cycle'') in order to achieve [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1962) The nature of the Taxon Cycle in Melanesian ant fauna {{cite web |url=http://www.zoology.siu.edu/sears/Wilson1961.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720044645/http://www.zoology.siu.edu/sears/Wilson1961.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }} The American Naturalist&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, colonisation and extinction are key components of [[island biogeography]], a theory that has many applications in [[ecology]], such as [[metapopulation]]s.

==Scales==
Colonisation occurs on several scales:
*[[biofilm]] scales: the formation of communities of [[microorganism]]s on surfaces&lt;ref&gt;1. O’Toole, G., Kaplan, H. B. &amp; Kolter, R. Biofilm Formation as Microbial Development. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 54, 49–79 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;.
*small scales: colonising new sites, perhaps as a result of [[environmental change]].
*large scales: where a species expands its [[range (biology)|range]] to encompass new areas. This can be via a series of small encroachments or by  long-distance [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]]. The term '''range expansion''' is often used&lt;ref&gt;Yackulic, Charles B.; Nichols, James D.; Reid, Janice; Der, Ricky. 2015. To predict the niche, model colonization and extinction. Ecology. 96(1): 16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Means==
The term is generally only used to refer to the spread into new areas by ''natural'' means, as opposed to introduction or translocation by humans, which are called [[introduced species]] and sometimes becoming [[invasive species]].

==Species colonisation events==
Some large-scale notable colonisation events in the 20th Century are:

=== Birds ===
* the colonisation of the [[New World]] by the [[cattle egret]] and the [[little egret]].
* the colonisation of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the [[little egret]]
* the colonisation of western North America by the [[barred owl]],&lt;ref&gt;Livezey KB. 2009a. Range expansion of Barred Owls, part I: chronology and distribution. American Midland Naturalist 161:49–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezey KB. 2009b. Range expansion of Barred Owls, part 2: facilitating ecological changes. American Midland Naturalist 161:323–349.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the colonisation of the [[Atlantic Seaboard|East Coast]] of [[North America]] by the [[Brewer's blackbird]]
* the colonisation-westwards spread across [[Europe]] of the [[collared dove]]
* the spread across the eastern USA of the [[house finch]]
* the expansion into the southern and western areas of [[South Africa]] by the [[Hadeda Ibis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">The '''Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination''' is a [[human rights]] proclamation issued by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], outlining that body's views on [[racism]]. It was adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1904 (XVIII), November 20, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration was an important precursor to the legally binding [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]].

==Summary==
The Declaration follows the structure of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a preamble followed by eleven articles.

'''Article 1''' declares that [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], colour or [[ethnicity]] is "an offence to human dignity" and condemns it as a violation of the principles underlying the [[United Nations Charter]], a violation of [[human rights]] and a threat to peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Article 2''' calls on states, institutions, groups and individuals not to discriminate on the basis of race in human rights. It calls on states to end support for discrimination, and to take [[affirmative action]] where necessary to correct it.

'''Article 3''' calls for particular efforts to end racial discrimination in civil rights, housing, employment, education, and calls for everyone to have free access to public places and services regardless of race.

'''Article 4''' calls on states to review policies and repeal laws which discriminate on the basis of race.

'''Article 5''' calls for an end to [[racial segregation]] and [[Crime of apartheid|apartheid]].

'''Article 6''' calls for an end to racial discrimination in [[civil and political rights|political rights]], in particular the [[right to vote]] and stand for public office.

'''Article 7''' declares that everyone has the right to [[equality before the law]] and to equal justice before the law regardless of race. It calls for everyone to have an effective remedy, enforceable through the courts, for harm suffered through racial discrimination.

'''Article 8''' calls for education to promote [[Toleration|tolerance]] and racial understanding.

'''Article 9''' condemns propaganda and organisations based on the idea of racial [[supremacism]]. It calls for incitements to racial violence, or [[hate speech]] to be criminalised, and for racist organisations to be outlawed.

'''Article 10''' calls on the [[United Nations]] to study the causes of racial discrimination so as to better combat it.

'''Article 11''' calls on every state to promote respect of fundamental human rights and the principles of this declaration and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).

As a declaration rather than a [[treaty]], the document is non-binding.

The diversity of [[species diversity|species]] and [[genetic diversity|genes]] in [[community ecology|ecological communities]] affects the functioning of these communities. These '''ecological effects of biodiversity''' in turn are affected by both [[climate change]] through enhanced [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[Particulate|aerosols]] and loss of land cover{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of [[ecosystem]]s and [[extinction]]s of [[species]] and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a [[extinction event|mass extinction]], with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past.&lt;ref name="Vitousek et al. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vitousek |first=P. M. |last2=Mooney |first2=H. A. |last3=Lubchenco |first3=J. |display-authors=etal |year=1997 |title=Human domination of Earth's ecosystems |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=277 |issue=5325 |pages=494–499 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability.&lt;ref name="Hines et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hines |first=J. |first2=W. H. |last2=van der Putten |first3=G. B. |last3=De Deyn |first4=C. |last4=Wagg |first5=W. |last5=Voigt |first6=C. |last6=Mulder |first7=W. |last7=Weisser |first8=J. |last8=Engel |first9=C. |last9=Melian |first10=S. |last10=Scheu |first11=K. |last11=Birkhofer |first12=A. |last12=Ebeling |first13=C. |last13=Scherber |first14=N. |last14=Eisenhauer |year=2015 |chapter=Towards an integration of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning and food-web theory to evaluate connections between multiple ecosystem services |editor-first=Guy |editor-last=Woodward |editor2-first=David A. |editor2-last=Bohan |title=Ecosystem Services: From Biodiversity to Society, Part 1 |volume=53 |series=Advances in Ecological Research |location=UK |publisher=Academic Press |pages=161–199 |isbn=978-0-12-803885-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of [[biomass]] production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations.

Also animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate.

==Definitions==
In order to understand the effects that changes in [[biodiversity]] will have on ecosystem functioning, it is important to define some terms. Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of [[gene]]s, species, and ecosystems in a [[region]]. This definition includes [[genetic diversity]], or the diversity of genes within a species, [[species diversity]], or the diversity of species within a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region.

Two things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and [[ecological stability|stability]]. Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground [[biomass]] of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity.

Stability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the [[statistical variability|variability]] of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time.&lt;ref name="Doak 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doak |first=D. F. |last2=Bigger |first2=D. |last3=Harding |first3=E. K. |display-authors=etal |year=1998 |title=The statistical inevitability of stability-diversity relationships in community ecology |journal=Am. Nat. |volume=151 |issue= |pages=264–276 |doi=10.2307/2463348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an [[Homeostasis#Ecological|equilibrium]] after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that does not.&lt;ref name="McCann_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCann |first=K. S. |year=2000 |title=The diversity-stability debating |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=228–233 |doi=10.1038/35012234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity and stability as indicators of [[ecosystem health]]==
The importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like [[farm|cropland]], and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the [[economics|economic]] success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="Fridley 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fridley |first=J. D. |year=2001 |title=The influence of species diversity on ecosystem productivity: how, where, why? |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=514–526 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.930318.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems.

Beyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential [[food]]s, [[medicine]]s, industrial products, and [[tourism]], all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives.&lt;ref name="Wilson 1992"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Osborne Wilson |last=Wilson |first=E. O. |year=1992 |title=The Diversity of Life |publisher=Harvard Univ. Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=0-674-21298-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on community productivity==
* '''Complementarity''' Plant species coexistence is thought to be the result of [[ecological niche|niche]] partitioning, or differences in resource requirements among species. By complementarity, a more diverse plant community should be able to use resources more completely, and thus be more productive.&lt;ref name = "Fridley 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tilman et al. 1997a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = Knops | first2 = J. | last3 = Wedin | first3 = D. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1997a | title = The influence of functional diversity and composition on ecosystem processes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = | pages = 1300–1302 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5330.1300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called niche differentiation, this mechanism is a central principle in the [[Functional group (ecology)|functional group]] approach, which breaks species diversity down into functional components.&lt;ref name = "Tilman et al. 1997b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = Lehman | first2 = C.L. | last3 = Thomson | first3 = K.T. | year = 1997b | title = Plant diversity and ecosystem productivity: theoretical considerations | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 1857–1861 | doi=10.1073/pnas.94.5.1857| pmc = 20007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Tilman 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D | year = 1999 | title = The ecological consequences of changes in biodiversity: a search for general principles | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 1455–1474 | doi=10.2307/176540}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Facilitation ''' [[Ecological facilitation|Facilitation]] is a mechanism whereby certain species help or allow other species to grow by modifying the environment in a way that is favorable to a co-occurring species.&lt;ref name = "Vandermeer 1989"&gt;Vandermeer, J. H. 1989. The ecology of intercropping. Cambridge Univ. Press., Cambridge, England.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants can interact through an intermediary like nitrogen, water, temperature, space, or interactions with weeds or herbivores among others. Some examples of facilitation include large desert perennials acting as nurse plants, aiding the establishment of young neighbors of other species by alleviating water and temperature stress,&lt;ref name = "Turner et al. 1966"&gt;Turner, R.M., Alcorn, S.M., Olin, G. and Booth, J.A. 1966. The influence of shade, soil, and water on saguaro seedling establishment.Bot. Gaz. 127: 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrient enrichment by nitrogen-fixers such as legumes.
* '''The Sampling Effect ''' The sampling effect of diversity can be thought of as having a greater chance of including a species of greatest inherent productivity in a plot that is more diverse. This provides for a composition effect on productivity, rather than diversity being a direct cause. However, the sampling effect may in fact be a compilation of different effects. The sampling effect can be separated into the greater likelihood of selecting a species that is 1) adapted well to particular site conditions, or 2) of a greater inherent productivity. Additionally, one can add to the sampling effect a greater likelihood of including 3) a pair of species that highly complement each other, or 4) a certain species with a large facilitative effect on other members of the community.

===Review of data===
Field experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have had variable results, but many long term studies in [[grassland]] ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems.&lt;ref name ="Tilman et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = Wedin | first2 = D | last3 = Knops | first3 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Productivity and sustainability influenced by biodiversity in grassland ecosystems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 379 | issue = | pages = 718–720 | doi=10.1038/379718a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Naeem et al. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naeem | first1 = S. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = L.J. | last3 = Lawler | first3 = S.P | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1994 | title = Declining biodiversity can alter the performance of ecosystems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 368 | issue = | pages = 734–737 | doi=10.1038/368734a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hooper and Vitousek 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooper | first1 = D. | last2 = Vitousek | first2 = P. | year = 1997 | title = The effect of plant composition and diversity on ecosystem processes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = | pages = 1302–1305 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5330.1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, evidence of this relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. The differing results between studies may partially be attributable to their reliance on samples with equal species diversities rather than species diversities that mirror those observed in the environment.&lt;ref name=Zavaleta&gt;{{cite journal|title=Realistic variation in species composition affects grassland production, resource use and invasion resistance|doi=10.1007/s11258-006-9146-z|url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~zavaleta/pubs/plant_ecology_07.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2006|last1=Zavaleta|first1=E. S.|last2=Hulvey|first2=K. B.|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=188|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 experiment utilizing a realistic variation in species composition for its grassland samples found a positive correlation between increased diversity and increased production.&lt;ref name=Zavaleta/&gt;

However, these studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Specifically, a diversity in the functional roles of the species may be a more important quality for predicting productivity than the diversity in species number.&lt;ref name=Zavaleta/&gt; Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] rates and spatial [[heterogeneous|heterogeneity]] of the environment,&lt;ref name ="Cardinale et al. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cardinale | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K. | last3 = Palmer | first3 = M.A. | year = 2000 | title = Linking species diversity to the functioning of ecosystems: on the importance of environmental context | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat's carrying capacity can cause differing relationships.&lt;ref name ="Aarssen et al. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aarssen | first1 = L.W. | last2 = Laird | first2 = R.A. | last3 = Pither | first3 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Is the productivity of vegetation plots higher or lower when there are more species?

The current consensus holds at least that certain combinations of species provide increased community productivity.&lt;ref name=Hooper&gt;{{cite journal|title=EFFECTS OF BIODIVERSITY ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING: A CONSENSUS OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE|doi=10.1890/04-0922|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/04-0922|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2005|last1=Hooper|first1=D.

A.|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=75|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future research===
In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects.

Relative amounts of [[overyielding]] (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily.&lt;ref name = "Fridley 2001"/&gt;

==Effects on community stability==
* '''Averaging Effect''' If all species have differential responses to changes in the ecosystem over time, then the averaging of these responses will cause a more temporally stable ecosystem if more species are in the ecosystem.&lt;ref name ="Doak 1998"/&gt; This effect is a [[statistics|statistical]] effect due to summing [[randomness|random]] [[variable (math)|variable]]s.
* '''Negative Covariance Effect''' If some species do better when other species are not doing well, then when there are more species in the ecosystem, their overall [[variance]] will be lower than if there were fewer species in the system. This lower variance indicates higher stability.&lt;ref name ="Tilman et al. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tilman |first=D. |last2=Lehman |first2=C. L. |last3=Bristow |first3=C. E. |year=1998 |title=Diversity-stability relationships: statistical inevitability or ecological consequence |journal=Am. Nat. |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=264–276 |doi=10.1086/286118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is a consequence of [[competition]] as highly competitive species will negatively [[covariance|covary]].
* '''Insurance Effect''' If an ecosystem contains more species then it will have a greater likelihood of having [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] stabilizing species, and it will have a greater number of species that respond to perturbations in different ways. This will enhance an ecosystem's ability to [[wiktionary:Buffer|buffer]] perturbations.&lt;ref name ="Naeem and Li 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naeem |first=S. |last2=Li |first2=S. |year=1997 |title=Biodiversity enhances ecosystem reliability |journal=Nature |volume=390 |issue=6659 |pages=507–509 |doi=10.1038/37348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Resistance to Invasion''' Diverse communities may use resources more completely than simple communities because of a diversity effect for complementarity. Thus [[bioinvader|invaders]] may have reduced success in diverse ecosystems, or there may be a reduced likelihood that an invading species will introduce a new property or process to a diverse ecosystem.&lt;ref name ="Tilman 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Elton 1958"&gt;{{cite book |last=Elton |first=C. S. |year=1958 |title=The ecology of invasions by animals and plants |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Chapin et al. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapin |first=F. S. III |last2=Walker |first2=B. H. |last3=Hobbs |first3=R. J. |display-authors=etal |year=1997 |title=Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=277 |issue=5325 |pages=500–504 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5325.500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Resistance to Disease''' A decreased number of competing plant species may allow the abundances of other species to increase, facilitating the spread of diseases of those species.&lt;ref name ="Elton 1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chapin et al. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mitchell et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitchell |first=C. E. |last2=Tilman |first2=D. |last3=Groth |first3=J. V. |title=Effects of grassland plant species diversity, abundance, and composition on foliar fungal disease |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=1713–1726 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1713:EOGPSD]2.0.CO;2 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Review of temporal stability data===
Models have predicted that [[empirical]] relationships between [[time|temporal]] variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against.&lt;ref name = "Doak 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tilman et al. 1996"/&gt; Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.

===Review of resistance and resilience stability data===
This area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a [[correlation]] between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite.&lt;ref name = "Dukes 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dukes |first=J. S. |year=2001 |title=Biodiversity and invisibility in grassland microcosms |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=563–568 |doi=10.1007/s004420000549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it.&lt;ref name ="Mitchell et al. 2002"/&gt;

===Future research===
In order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998&lt;ref name = "Doak 1998"/&gt;) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in [[conservation ethic|conservation]] management.

More importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day.

==Theory and preliminary effects from examining food webs==
One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single [[trophic level]]. That is, they are concerned with only one level of the [[food web]], namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see [[keystone species]]). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak [[interaction]]s between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable.&lt;ref name ="McCann_2000" /&gt; If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less [[biomass]] in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first.&lt;ref name ="Duffy 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duffy |first=J. E. |year=2002 |title=Biodiversity and ecosystem function: the consumer connection |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=201–219 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990201.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, it has recently been shown that [[predator|consumers]] can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone.&lt;ref name ="Worm and Duffy 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worm |first=B. |last2=Duffy |first2=J. E. |year=2003 |title=Biodiversity, productivity and stability in real food webs |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=628–632 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2003.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.

[[Verb]]s constitute one of the main [[word class]]es in the [[English language]]. Like other types of words in the language, '''English verbs''' are not heavily [[inflection|inflected]]. Most combinations of [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]] are expressed [[periphrasis|periphrastically]], using constructions with [[auxiliary verb]]s.

Generally, the only inflected forms of an English verb are a third person singular [[present tense]] form in ''-s'', a [[past tense]] (also called [[preterite]]), a [[past participle]] (which may be the same as the past tense), and a form ending in ''[[-ing]]'' that serves as a [[present participle]] and [[gerund]]. Most verbs inflect in a simple [[regular verb|regular]] fashion, although there are about 200 [[English irregular verbs|irregular verbs]]; the irregularity in nearly all cases concerns the past tense and past participle forms. The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb ''be'' has a larger number of different inflected forms, and is highly irregular.

For details of the uses of particular verb tenses and other forms, see the article [[Uses of English verb forms]]. For certain other specific topics, see the articles listed in the adjacent box.

===Principal parts===
A [[regular verb|regular]] English verb has only one [[principal parts|principal part]], from which all the forms of the verb can be derived. This is the base form or [[dictionary form]]. For example, from the base form ''exist'', all the inflected forms of the verb (''exist'', ''exists'', ''existed'', ''existing'') can be predictably derived. The base form is also called the bare [[infinitive]]; another common way of referring to verbs is to use the [[Uses of English verb forms#To-infinitive|''to''-infinitive]], e.g. "to exist".

Most [[English irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] have three principal parts, since the [[simple past (English)|simple past]] and [[past participle]] are unpredictable. For example, the verb ''write'' has the principal parts ''write'' (base form), ''wrote'' (past), and ''written'' (past participle); the remaining inflected forms (''writes'', ''writing'') are derived regularly from the base form. Note that some irregular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms (as the regular verbs do), as with ''send–sent–sent''.

The verbs ''do'', ''say'' and ''have'' additionally have irregular third person singular present tense forms (see [[#Third person singular present|below]]). The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]r verb ''be'' is highly irregular, with the forms ''be'', ''am'', ''is'', ''are'', ''was'', ''were'', ''been'' and ''being''. On the other hand, [[modal verb]]s (such as ''can'' and ''must'') are [[defective verb]]s, being used only in a limited number of forms. For details on the forms of verbs of these types, see {{slink||Copular, auxiliary and defective verbs}} below.

=== Base form ===
The base form or ''plain form'' of a verb is not marked by any inflectional ending. There are certain derivational [[suffix]]es that are frequently used to form verbs, such as ''-ate'' (''formulate''), ''-fy'' (''electrify''), and ''-ise/ize'' (''realise/realize''). Many verbs also contain [[prefix]]es, such ''un-'' (''unmask''), ''out-'' (''outlast''), ''over-'' (''overtake''), and ''under-'' (''undervalue'').&lt;ref name=carter-mccarthy-p301&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|McCarthy|2006|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some verbs are formed from nouns and adjectives by [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]], as with the verbs ''snare'', ''nose'', ''dry'', and ''calm''.

The base form is used in the following ways:
*It serves as the bare [[infinitive]], and is used in the ''to''-infinitive (e.g. ''to write''); for uses see {{slink||Non-finite forms}} below.
*It serves as the [[simple present]] tense, except in the third person singular: ''I/you/we/they '''write''' regularly'' (and except for the copula).
*It is used as an [[imperative mood|imperative]]: '''''Write''' these words.''
*It is used as a [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]]: ''I suggested that he '''write''' a novel.''
For the verb ''be'', which uses different forms for the simple present, and modal verbs, which are not used in the infinitive, imperative or subjunctive, see {{slink||Copular, auxiliary and defective verbs}} below.

=== Third person singular present ===
Almost all verbs have a third person singular present indicative form with the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-[e]s''. In terms of [[English orthography|spelling]], it is formed in most cases by adding ''-s'' to the verb's base form: ''run'' → ''runs''. However if the base form ends in one of the [[sibilant]] sounds ({{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, {{IPAslink|ʃ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}}, {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, {{IPAslink|dʒ}}) and its spelling does not end in a [[silent E|silent ''e'']], then ''-es'' is added: ''buzz'' → ''buzzes''; ''catch'' → ''catches''. Verbs ending in a consonant plus ''o'' also typically add ''-es'': ''veto'' → ''vetoes''. Verbs ending in a consonant plus ''y'' add ''-es'' after changing the ''y'' to an ''i'': ''cry'' → ''cries''.

In terms of [[English phonology|pronunciation]], the ending is pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|z}} after [[sibilant]]s (as in ''lurches''), as {{IPAc-en|s}} after [[voiceless consonant]]s other than sibilants (as in ''makes''), and as {{IPAc-en|z}} otherwise (as in ''adds''). These are the same rules that apply to the pronunciation of the regular noun [[English plural|plural suffix]] ''-[e]s'' and the [[English possessive|possessive]] ''-'s''. The spelling rules given above are also very similar to those for the plural of nouns.

The third person singular present of ''have'' is irregular: ''has'' {{IPA|/hæz/}} (with the [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]] {{IPA|/həz/}} when used as an auxiliary, also [[contraction (linguistics)|contractable]] to ''-'s''). The verbs ''do'' and ''say'' also have irregular forms, ''does'' {{IPA|/dʌz/}} and ''says'' {{IPA|/sɛz/}}, which however look like regular forms in writing.

For the verb ''be'', modal verbs and other auxiliaries, see {{slink||Copular, auxiliary and defective verbs}} below.

The form described in this section is used with third person singular subjects as the [[simple present]] tense (in the [[indicative mood]]): ''He '''writes''' novels all the time.'' (This tense has other uses besides referring to present time; for example, in ''I'll be glad if he writes'', it refers to future time.)

=== Past tense ===
{{Main article|Simple past}}
The past tense, or [[preterite]], may be formed regularly or irregularly.

With regular verbs, the past tense is formed (in terms of spelling) by adding ''-ed'' to the base form (''play'' → ''played''). Normal rules for adding suffixes beginning with a vowel apply: If the base form ends in ''e'' then only ''d'' is added (''like'' → ''liked''); if the base form ends in a consonant followed by ''y'' then the ''y'' is changed to ''i'' before adding the ending (''try'' → ''tried''; an exception is the verb ''[[wikt:sky#Verb|sky]]'' (a ball), which can form ''skied'' or ''skyed'').

Various rules apply for [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled consonants|doubling final consonants]].  If the base form ends in a single vowel followed by a single consonant (except ''h'', silent ''t'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y''), then unless the final syllable is completely [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]], the consonant is doubled before adding the ''-ed'' (''ship'' → ''shipped'', but ''fathom'' → ''fathomed'').  For most base forms ending in ''c'', the doubled form used is ''ck'', and this is used regardless of stress (''panic'' → ''panicked''; exceptions include ''zinc'' → ''zincked'' or ''zinced'', ''arc'' → usually ''arced'', ''spec'' → ''specced'' or ''spec'ed'', ''sync'' → sometimes ''synched'').  In [[British English]], the doubling of ''l'' occurs regardless of stress (''travel'' → ''travelled''; but ''paralleled'' is an exception), and when two separately-pronounced vowels precede the ''l'' (''dial'' → ''dialled'', ''fuel'' →  ''fuelled'').

If the final syllable has some partial stress, especially for compound words, the consonant is usually doubled: ''backflip'' → ''backflipped'', ''hobnob'' → ''hobnobbed'', ''kidnap'' →  ''kidnapped'' etc.  In some cases both alternatives are acceptable, e.g. ''dialog'' → ''dialogued'' or ''dialogged'', ''gambol'' → ''gambolled'', ''hiccup'' → ''hiccupped'' or ''hiccuped'', ''program'' → ''programed'' or ''programmed''.  Note however ''catalog'' → ''cataloged'', ''pyramid'' →  ''pyramided'', ''format'' →  ''formatted'' (but ''combat'' →  ''combat(t)ed'').  Other variations not entirely consistent with these rules include ''bus'' → ''bused'' or ''bussed'', ''bias'' →  ''biased'' or ''biassed'' and ''focus'' → ''focused'' or ''focussed'', .

The pronunciation of the past tense ending follows similar rules to those for the third person present tense ending described above: if the base form ends in {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} then a new syllable {{IPA|/ɪd/}} or {{IPA|/əd/}} is added (as in ''drifted'', ''exceeded''); if the base form ends in an [[unvoiced consonant]] sound other than {{IPA|/t/}} then the ending is pronounced {{IPA|/t/}} (as in ''capped'', ''passed''); otherwise the ending is pronounced {{IPA|/d/}} (as in ''buzzed'', ''tangoed''). Consequently, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the latter two pronunciations were routinely spelled ''-'d'', but ''-ed'' was later restored.

For the past tense of irregular verbs, see [[English irregular verbs]]. Some of these can be classed as [[Germanic strong verb]]s, such as ''sing'' (past ''sang''), while others are weak verbs with irregularly pronounced or irregularly spelt past forms, such as ''say'' (past tense ''said'' {{IPA|/sɛd/}}).

The verb ''be'' has two past tense forms: ''was'' (first and third person singular) and ''were'' (plural and second person).

The past tense (preterite) form is used in what is called the [[simple past]], in sentences such as ''We '''lit''' the fire'' and ''He '''liked''' to dance''. One of the uses of this tense is to refer not to a past situation, but to a hypothetical (present or future) situation in a [[dependent clause]]: ''If I '''knew''' that, I wouldn't have to ask.'' This is sometimes called the "past subjunctive", particularly in the case of ''were'', which can replace ''was'' in such sentences; see [[English subjunctive]].

=== Past participle ===
The [[past participle]] of regular verbs is identical to the preterite (past tense) form, described in the previous section.

For irregular verbs, see [[English irregular verbs]]. Some of these have different past tense and past participle forms (like ''sing–sang–sung''); others have the same form for both (like ''make–made–made''). In some cases the past tense is regular but the past participle is not, as with ''show–showed–shown''.

For uses of the past participle, see {{slink||Non-finite forms}} below.

=== Present participle ===
The [[present participle]] form, which is also used for the [[gerund]], is formed by adding the suffix ''[[-ing]]'' to the base form: ''go'' → ''going''. A final [[silent E|silent ''e'']] is dropped (''believe'' → ''believing''); final ''ie'' changes to ''y'' (''lie'' → ''lying''), and consonant doubling applies as for the past tense (see [[#Past tense|above]]): ''run'' → ''running'', ''panic'' → ''panicking''.

Some exceptions include forms such as ''singeing'', ''dyeing'', ''ageing'', ''rueing'', ''cacheing'' and ''whingeing'', where the ''e'' may be retained to avoid confusion with otherwise identical words (e.g. ''singing''), to clarify pronunciation (for example to show that a word has a soft ''[[g]]'' or ''ch''), or for aesthetic reasons.

In standard English the ending is pronounced {{IPA|/ɪŋ/}}, although in many regional dialects the final consonant sound is pronounced {{IPA|/n/}}, sometimes represented in [[eye dialect]] by spellings such as ''huntin''' (see [[G-dropping|''g''-dropping]]).

For uses of the present participle and gerund, see {{slink||Non-finite forms}} below.

===Copular, auxiliary and defective verbs===
The [[copular verb]] ''be'' has multiple irregular forms in the present tense: ''am'' for first person singular (which together with the subject pronoun is often [[English contractions|contracted]] to ''I'm''), ''is'' for third person singular (often contracted to '' 's''), and ''are'' for plural and second person (often contracted to '' 're'' chiefly after the pronouns ''you'', ''we'', ''they''). It also has two past tense forms: ''was'' for first and third person singular, and ''were'' for plural and second person (also used as a past subjunctive with all persons; see [[English subjunctive]]). The past participle is ''been'', and the present participle and gerund is the regular ''being''. The base form ''be'' is used regularly as an infinitive, imperative and (present) subjunctive. For archaic forms, see the next section.

English has a number of [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] which generally do not inflect (most of them are surviving [[preterite-present verb]]s), and so have only a single form, used as a [[finite verb]] with subjects of all persons and numbers. These verbs are ''can'', ''could'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''would'', ''must'', ''ought (to)'', as well as ''need'' and ''dare'' (when used with a bare infinitive), and in some analyses ''used (to)'' and ''had better''. (The forms ''could'', ''might'', ''should'' and ''would'' are considered to be the past tenses of ''can'', ''may'', ''shall'' and ''will'' respectively, although they are not always used as such.) These verbs do not have infinitive, imperative or participle forms, although in some cases there exists a synonymous phrase that can be used to produce such forms, such as ''be able to'' in the case of ''can'' and ''could''. The negation of ''can'' is the single word ''cannot''. There are contracted forms '' 'll'' and '' 'd'' for ''will'' and ''would'' (in some cases possibly considered to be from ''shall'' and ''should'').

Other verbs used as [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]] include ''have'', chiefly in perfect constructions (the forms ''has'', ''have'' and ''had'' can contract to '' 's'', '' 've'' and '' 'd''), and ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') in emphatic, inverted and negated constructions (see [[do-support|''do''-support]]).

For more detail of the above, including contractions of negated forms (''isn't'', ''won't'', etc.), see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]].

Another example of a [[defective verb]] is ''beware'', which is used only in those forms in which ''be'' remains unchanged, namely the infinitive, subjunctive and imperative.

Formerly, particularly in the [[Old English]] period, the English language had a far greater degree of verb inflection than it does now (other [[Germanic languages]] generally retain a greater variety of inflected forms than English does). Some of the forms used in [[Early Modern English]] have now fallen out of use, but are still encountered in old writers and texts (e.g. [[Shakespeare]], the [[King James Bible]]) and in [[archaism]]s.

One such form was the third person singular form with the suffix ''-eth'' {{IPA|[əθ]}}, pronounced as a full syllable. This was used in some dialects rather than the modern ''-s'', e.g. ''he maketh'' ("he makes"), ''he runneth'' ("he runs"), ''he goeth'' ("he goes").  In some verbs, a shortened form ''-th'' appears: ''he hath'' ("he has"), ''he doth'' ("he does"; pronounced as if written ''duth''), ''he saith'' or ''he sayeth'' ("he says"). The forms ''hath'' and ''doth'' are found in some proverbs ("[[Hell hath no fury (disambiguation)|Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned]]", "[[The lady doth protest too much, methinks|The lady doth protest too much]]").

Another set of forms are associated with the archaic second person singular pronoun ''[[thou]]'', which often have the ending ''-est'', pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. ''thou makest'' ("you make"), ''thou leadest'' ("you lead").  In some verbs, a shortened form ''-st'' appears: ''thou hast'' ("you have"), ''thou dost'' ("you do"; rhymes with ''must''). In the case of the verb ''be'', such forms included ''art'' (present tense), ''wast'' (past), ''wert'' (past subjunctive) and ''beest'' (present subjunctive; pronounced as two syllables). In all other verbs, the past tense is formed by the base past tense form of the word (e.g. ''had'', ''did'', ''listened'') plus''-'st'', not pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. ''thou had'st'' ("you had"), ''thou did'st'' ("you did"), ''thou listened'st'' ("you listened"). Modal verbs except ''must'' also have ''-t'' or ''-st'' added to their form, e.g. ''thou canst'' ("you can"), ''thou wilt'' ("you will"), ''thou wouldst'' ("you would"), ''thou mightst'' ("you might"), except ''may'', which is ''thou mayest'' ("you may").

For example, several such forms (as well as other archaic forms such as ''yea'' for "yes", ''thy'' for "your", and ''mine enemies'' for "my enemies") appear in [[Psalm 23]] from the [[King James Bible]]:

: The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
: He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
: He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
: Yea, though I walk through the [[Valley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)|valley of the shadow of death]], I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; [[My Cup Runneth Over|my cup runneth over]].
: Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

For more information see [[Old English verb]]s, [[English subjunctive]], and [[Indo-European copula]] (for the history of the verb ''be'').

==Syntactic constructions==

===Expressing tenses, aspects and moods===
Apart from the simple past tense described above, English verbs do not have synthetic ([[inflection|inflected]]) forms for particular [[verb tense|tense]]s, [[verb aspect|aspect]]s or [[mood (grammar)|moods]]. However, there are a number of [[periphrastic]] (multi-word) constructions with verb forms that serve to express tense-like or aspect-like meanings; these constructions are commonly described as representing certain verb tenses or aspects (in [[English language teaching]] they are often simply called tenses). For the usage of these forms, see {{slink||Use of verb forms}} below. More detail can be found in the article [[Uses of English verb forms]].

====Simple and progressive====
The [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (or continuous) aspect is expressed with a form of ''be'' together with the present participle of the verb. Thus [[present progressive]] (present continuous) constructions take forms like ''am writing'', ''is writing'', ''are writing'', while the [[past progressive]] (past continuous, also called ''[[imperfect]]'') is ''was writing'', ''were writing''. There is a progressive infinitive ''(to) be writing'' and a progressive [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]] ''be writing''. Other progressive forms, made with compound forms of ''be'', are described below.

The basic present and past tenses of the verb are called [[simple present]] (present simple) and [[simple past]] (past simple), to distinguish them from progressive or other compound forms. Thus the simple present of the above verb is ''write'' or ''writes'', and the simple past (also called [[preterite]]) is ''wrote''.

====Perfect====
The [[perfect aspect]] is expressed with a form of the auxiliary ''have'' together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the [[present perfect]] is ''have written'' or ''has written'', and the [[past perfect]] (pluperfect) is ''had written''. The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the [[present perfect progressive]] (continuous) ''have/has been writing'' and the [[past perfect progressive]] (continuous) ''had been writing''. There is a perfect infinitive ''(to) have written'' and a perfect progressive infinitive ''(to) have been writing'', and corresponding present participle/gerund forms ''having written'' and ''having been writing''. A perfect [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]] (''have written'') is also sometimes used. Future and conditional perfect forms are given below.

====Future and conditional====
What is often called the [[future tense]] of English is formed using the auxiliary ''will''. The simple future is ''will write'', the future progressive (continuous) is ''will be writing'', the [[future perfect]] is ''will have written'', and the future perfect progressive (continuous) is ''will have been writing''. Traditionally (though now usually in formal English only) ''shall'' is used rather than ''will'' in the first person singular and plural; see [[shall and will|''shall'' and ''will'']].

The [[conditional mood|conditional]], or "[[future-in-the-past]]", forms are made analogously to these future forms, using ''would'' (and ''should'') in place of ''will'' (and ''shall'').

===Expressing passive voice===
The [[passive voice]] in English is normally expressed with a form of the copula verb ''be'' (or sometimes ''get'') together with the past participle of the main verb. In this context ''be'' is not a stative verb, so it may occur in progressive forms. Examples:
*''The house '''was built''' last year.''
*''The house '''is being built''' at the moment.''
*''The house '''will be built''' by our firm.'' (a prepositional phrase with ''by'' expresses the performer of the action)
*''I '''was given''' a blueprint.'' (here the subject of the passive corresponds to the indirect object of the active)
*''He '''was said''' to know the house's dimensions.'' (special construction related to [[indirect speech]])

For details, see [[English passive voice]].

===Imperatives===
[[Imperative mood|Imperative]]s are expressed with the base form of the verb, normally with no subject: ''Take this outside! Be good!'' It is possible to add the second person pronoun ''you'' for emphasis: ''You be good!''

More details can be found in the article [[Imperative mood]].

===Questions, negation, inversion and emphasis===
Questions are formed by [[subject–auxiliary inversion]] (unless the interrogative word is part of the subject). If there is otherwise no auxiliary, the verb ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is used as an auxiliary, enabling the inversion. This also applies to negation: the negating word ''not'' must follow an auxiliary, so ''do'' is used if there is no other auxiliary.

Inversion is also required in certain other types of sentences, mainly after negative adverbial phrases; here too ''do'' is used if there is no other auxiliary.

The construction with ''do'' as auxiliary is also used to enable emphasis to be added to a sentence.

For details of the above constructions, see [[do-support|''do''-support]].

==Use of verb forms==
This section describes how the verb forms introduced in the preceding sections are used. More detail can be found in the article [[Uses of English verb forms]] and in the articles on the individual tenses and aspects.

===Finite forms===
In referring to an action taking place regularly (and not limited to the future or to the past), the [[simple present]] is used: ''He brushes his teeth every morning''. For an action taking place at the present time, the [[present progressive]] construction is used: ''He is brushing his teeth now''. With some verbs expressing a present [[stative verb|state]], particularly the copula ''be'' and verbs expressing a mental state, the present simple is generally used: ''They are here''; ''I know that''. However other state verbs use the present progressive or present simple depending on whether the state is considered temporary or permanent: ''The pen is lying on the table''; ''Paris lies on the Seine''.

For past actions or states, the [[simple past]] is generally used: ''He went out an hour ago''; ''Columbus knew the shape of the world''. However, for completed actions for which no past time frame is implied or expressed, the [[present perfect]] is normally used: ''I have made the dinner'' (i.e. the dinner is now ready). For an action in the course of taking place, or a temporary state existing, at the past time being referred to (compare uses of the present progressive above), the [[past progressive]] is used: ''We were sitting on the beach when...'' For an action that was completed before the past time being referred to, the [[past perfect]] is used: ''We had sat down on the blanket when...''

For actions or events expected to take place in the future, the construction with ''will'' can be used: ''The president will arrive tomorrow.'' Future events are also often expressed using the ''[[going-to future|be going to]]'' construction: ''She is going to arrive tomorrow.'' Planned events can also be referred to using the present progressive (''She is arriving tomorrow'') or, if precisely scheduled, the simple present (''She arrives tomorrow''). The future progressive and future perfect can be used analogously to the past equivalents: ''We will be sitting on the beach this afternoon''; ''We will have left the house by 4 o'clock''. However, in subordinate clauses expressing a condition or a time reference, present forms are used rather than the forms with ''will'': ''If/When you get'' (not ''will get'') ''there...''

When expressing actions or events lasting up to a specified time, the appropriate perfect construction is used (with the progressive if expressing a temporary state that would generally be expressed with a progressive form): ''We have been having some problems lately''; ''I have lived here for six years''; ''We had been working since the previous evening''; ''We will have been working for twelve hours by the time you arrive''.

The use of tense and aspectual forms in condition and conditional clauses follows special patterns; see [[conditional mood]]. For use of tenses in [[indirect speech]], see [[sequence of tenses]]. For the use of subjunctive forms, see [[English subjunctive]].

===Non-finite forms===
{{hatnote|For details, see {{slink|Uses of English verb forms|Uses of non-finite verbs}}.}}
The bare [[infinitive]], identical to the base form of the verb, is used as a complement of most modal verbs and certain other verbs (''I can '''write'''''; ''They made him '''write'''''; ''I saw you '''write'''''), including in negated and inverted sentences formed using [[do-support|''do''-support]] (''He doesn't '''write'''''; ''Did you '''write'''?'').

Preceded by ''to'', it forms the ''to''-infinitive, which has a variety of uses, including as a [[noun phrase]] ('''''To write''' is '''to learn''''') and as the complement of many verbs (''I want '''to write'''''), as well as with certain adjectives and nouns (''easy '''to ride'''''; ''his decision '''to leave'''''), and in expressions of purpose (''You did it '''to spite me''').

The past participle has the following uses:
*It is used with the auxiliary ''have'' in [[perfect tense|perfect]] constructions: ''They '''have written'''''; ''We '''had written''' before we heard the news''. (With verbs of motion, an archaic form with ''be'' may be found in older texts: ''he '''is come'''''.)
*It is used as a [[passive participle]], with ''be'' or ''get'', to form the [[passive voice]]: ''This book '''was written''' last year''; ''Trees sometimes '''get gnawed''' down by beavers.''
*It is used to form passive [[participial phrase]]s, which can be used adjectivally or adverbally (''a letter '''written on his computer'''''; '''''Beaten to a pulp''', he was carried away'') and as complements of certain verbs (''I got my car '''mended'''''; ''They had me '''placed on a list''''').
*It may be used as a simple [[adjective]]: as a passive participle in the case of [[transitive verb]]s (''the '''written''' word'', i.e. "the word that is written"), and as a perfect active participle in the case of some intransitive ones (''a '''fallen''' tree'', i.e. "a tree that has fallen").

The present participle has the following uses:
*It is used with forms of ''be'', in progressive ([[continuous tense|continuous]]) constructions: ''He '''is writing''' another book''; ''I intend '''to be sitting''' on the beach''. 
*It can form [[participial phrase]]s, which can be used adjectivally or adverbally: ''The man '''sitting over there''' is drunk''; '''''Being a lawyer''', I can understand this''; ''I saw her '''sitting by the tree'''''.
*It can serve as a simple adjective: ''It is a '''thrilling''' book.''

The same form used as a gerund has the following uses:
*It forms verbal phrases that are then used as nouns: '''''Lying in bed''' is my favorite hobby.''
*It forms similar phrases used as a complement of certain verbs: ''He tried '''writing''' novels''.

The logical subject of a phrase formed with a gerund can be expressed by a [[possessive]], as in ''I do not like'' '''''your/Jim's''''' ''drinking wine'', although a non-possessive noun or pronoun is often used instead, especially in informal English: ''I do not like'' '''''you/Jim''''' ''drinking wine''. The latter usage, though common, is sometimes considered ungrammatical or stylistically poor; it is given names like ''fused participle''&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Fowler, ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; and ''geriple''&lt;ref name="geriple"&gt;''Penguin guide to plain English'', Harry Blamires (Penguin Books Ltd., 2000) {{ISBN|978-0-14-051430-8}} pp.144-146&lt;/ref&gt; since it is seen to confuse a participle with a gerund. For more information see [[fused participle]].

Gerund forms are often used as plain [[verbal noun]]s, which function grammatically like common nouns (in particular, by being qualified by adjectives rather than adverbs): ''He did some excellent writing'' (compare the gerund: ''He is known for writing excellently''). Such verbal nouns can function, for instance, as [[noun adjunct]]s, as in ''a writing desk''.

== Objects and complements ==
Verbs are used in certain patterns which require the presence of specific [[argument (linguistics)|argument]]s in the form of [[object (grammar)|object]]s and other [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s of particular types. (A given verb may be usable in one or more of these patterns.)

A verb with a direct object is called a [[transitive verb]]. Some transitive verbs have an indirect object in addition to the direct object. Verbs used without objects are called [[intransitive verb|intransitive]]. Both transitive and intransitive verbs may also have additional complements that are not considered objects.

A single (direct) object generally follows the verb: ''I love '''you'''''. If there is an indirect object, it precedes the direct object  (''I gave '''him''' the book''), although an indirect object can also be expressed with a [[prepositional phrase]] following the direct object (and this method is usual when the direct object is a personal pronoun): ''I gave the book '''to John'''''; ''I bought them '''for you'''.

Other complements may include prepositional phrases, [[non-finite clause]]s and [[content clause]]s, depending on the applicable verb pattern. These complements normally follow any objects. For example:
*''I insist '''on coming'''.'' (this use of the verb ''insist'' involves a prepositional phrase with ''on'')
*''I expect '''to arrive tomorrow'''.'' (this use of ''expect'' involves a to-infinitive phrase)
*''I asked him '''whether he was coming'''.'' (this use of ''ask'' involves a direct object ''(him)'' and an interrogative content clause)

More examples can be found at [[Gerund#Verb_patterns_classified_as_.22gerund.22_use|Verb patterns with the gerund]].

English has a number of [[ergative verb]]s: verbs which can be used either intransitively or transitively, where in the intransitive use it is the subject that is receiving the action, and in the transitive use the direct object is receiving the action while the subject is causing it. An example is ''sink'': ''The ship '''sank''''' (intransitive use); ''The explosion '''sank''' the ship'' (transitive use). Other common examples include ''open, sink, wake, melt, boil, collapse, explode, freeze, start, sell''.

For more details on how verbs are built up into clauses, see [[English clause syntax]].

==Phrasal verbs==
{{main article|Phrasal verb}}
Many English verbs are used in particular combinations with adverbial modifiers such as ''on'', ''away'', ''out'', etc. Often these combinations take on independent meanings. They are referred to as [[phrasal verb]]s. (This term may also include verbs used with a complement introduced by a particular preposition that gives it a special meaning, as in ''take to (someone)''.)

The adverbial particle in a phrasal verb generally appears close after the verb, though it may follow the object, particularly when the object is a pronoun: ''Hand over the money'' or ''Hand the money over'', but ''Hand it over''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4463">The '''European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages''' ('''EBLUL''') was a [[non-governmental organisation]] that was set up to promote [[linguistic diversity]] and [[language]]s. It was founded in 1982 and discontinued in 2010. The organisation had close ties with both the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of Europe]], and was funded by both the [[European Commission]] and local and regional governmental organisations.

Since its establishment in 1982, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages worked to strengthen contacts and develop mutual co-operation between lesser-used language communities.  The main goal was to promote linguistic diversity and to support these languages.  It acted to facilitate links and communications with the European institutions, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and UN and UNESCO. It spoke on behalf of Europe’s 50 million speakers of regional or minority languages.

EBLUL's operational grant was discontinued by the EU in 2007 despite recommendations from the European Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2008/408495/IPOL-CULT_ET(2008)408495_EN.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Multilingualism2part1.doc |format=PDF |website=Europarl.europa.eu |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the 2003 Ebner Report, and the EU's own evaluation conducted by Ernst and Young&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140123122928/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/404_en.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; that the EU should continue to support the organisation. The cut in funding remains controversial because the 2003 Ebner Report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A5-2003-0271+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en |title=Report with recommendations to the Commission on European regional and lesser-used languages - the languages of minorities in the EU - in the context of enlargement and cultural diversity- Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - A5-0271/2003 |website=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a European Parliament legislative report, which has to be implemented by the EU, recommended that EBLUL continue to receive EU funding.

However, with the cut in its core funding EBLUL was finally closed by a decision of its board of directors on 27 January 2010.  The main reason given was that "the funding mechanism of such an organisational model [was] not suitable in current circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426071208/http://eblul.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=260&amp;Itemid=1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

EBLUL has since been replaced by the '''European Language Equality Network''' ('''ELEN''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elen.ngo |title=ELEN &amp;#124; European Language Equality Network |website=Elen.ngo |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European NGO for lesser-used languages, it gathers most of the former EBLUL members plus many more civil society organisations from across Europe. To date, ELEN represents 44 languages with 60 member organisations in 20 European states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/6_resources/PDF_FCNM_15th_Anniv_DHicks.pdf|title=Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|website=Coe.int|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fjölnir''' (also '''Fjolnir''' or '''Fjoelnir''') is a [[programming language]] developed by [[professor]] Snorri Agnarsson of [[computer science]] at [[Háskóli Íslands]] (University of Iceland) that was mostly used in the 1980s. The [[source file]]s usually have the [[filename extension|extension]] &lt;code&gt;fjo&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sma&lt;/code&gt;.

== Features ==

Fjölnir is based on the concept of representing programs as trees, and packages by substitutions on trees using [[Algebraic operation|algebraic operators]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800225.806833&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Hello World]] example below, &lt;code&gt;"GRUNNUR"&lt;/code&gt; is a package, the block of code between braces is a package, and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is an operator that substitutes names in one package with elements from another. In this case, &lt;code&gt;skrifastreng&lt;/code&gt; (which writes a string to the [[standard output]]) is imported from &lt;code&gt;"GRUNNUR"&lt;/code&gt;.

== Code examples ==

&lt;pre&gt;
;; Hello world in Fjölnir

"hello" &lt; main
{
    main -&gt;
    stef(;)
    stofn
        skrifastreng(;"Hello, world!"),
    stofnlok
}
*
"GRUNNUR"
;

'''Flannel panel''' is a humorous term for a [[magazine]] masthead panel that lists publisher and staff details.

The origin of the term is unknown, but according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', one definition of "flannel" is: "Nonsense, ‘hot air’; flattery, unnecessary ostentation." Thus, the origin of the term likely comes from the perception that journalists are full of hot air and nonsense.

Short-lived UK computing magazine ''[[Amiga Power]]'' points out: "It [flannel panel] is, of course, merely the list of credits at the beginning of a magazine, but, like all jargon, given a stupid elevating name so people who work in a particular industry can feel superior to people who don't."

The '''garrucha''' is a small pistol, similar to a [[derringer]], common in southern Brazil and Argentina in the early 20th Century.  It is usually double-barreled,&lt;ref name="Anthropology1951"&gt;{{cite book|author=Smithsonian Institution. Institute of Social Anthropology|title=Cruz das Almas, a Brazilian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKNXAAAAMAAJ|year=1951|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; though with the barrels side-by-side rather than vertical as is common in American derringers, and the bores can be rifled or smooth.

In Brazil, the most popular chamberings were for the .320 and .380 centrefire cartridges, similar to the [[.32 S&amp;W]] and [[.38 S&amp;W]] in appearance, but conical.  They were also chambered for the [[.22 Short]], [[.22 Long]], [[.22 Long Rifle]], and the .32, 8mm, and [[9mm Flobert]] cartridges, among others.

These types of pistols were popular from 1930-1960 due to their low cost and small size, and were associated with the [[gaucho]]s (cowboys) of the South American [[pampa]]s.

In Brazil, Garruchas were produced by Castelo, [[Rossi (manufacturer)|Rossi]], and Lerap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://armasonline.org/armas-on-line/antigas-fabricas-de-armas-no-brasil/|title=Antigas Fábricas de Armas no Brasil|publisher=Armas on Line|access-date=2013-11-23|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetic editing''' ([[French language|French]] ''critique génétique''; [[German language|German]] ''genetische Kritik'') is an approach to scholarly editing in which an [[Exemplar (textual criticism)|exemplar]] is seen as derived from a dossier of other [[manuscript]]s and events. The derivation can be through physical [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]; writing or drawing in a variety of media; quotation, [[annotation]] or correction; acts of physical defacement; etc.  Genetic editing aims to reconstruct the sequence of actions on the manuscript and exactly which parts of the manuscript were acted upon. Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/gencrit/index.html|title=Textual Scholarship: Genetic Criticism|date=|work=textualscholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cts.dmu.ac.uk/index.php?q=objectives.html] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30227768|title=The "Wake's Progress": Toward a Genetic Edition|first=Dirk|last=Van Hulle|date=17 January 2018|publisher=|journal=Text|volume=13|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, [[textual scholarship]]. Completed works of genetic editing are known as genetic editions.

Whereas traditional scholarly editing can be seen as constructing a new document drawing together and comparing many source documents to cast light on a work, genetic editing closely examines a single [[Extant literature|extant]] manuscript and traces back each aspect to cast light on the work.

Genetic editing is named by analogy with genetics manuscripts (individuals) are derived from other manuscripts (or previous states of the same manuscript) and with the derivation tree being a partial [[Tree (data structure)|ordered tree]].

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]'s [[XML]] format has support for encoding of genetic editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PH-changes|title=TEI Guidelines 11.7 Identifying Changes and Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harmony Gold''' is a [[real estate developer]], [[Film distribution|motion picture]] and [[Broadcast syndication|television]] distributor, and film, television, and animation [[production company]], video game developer and publisher, based in Los Angeles. It was founded in 1983 by [[Egypt]]ian-born [[Frank Agrama]] and is managed by his daughter, Jehan F. Agrama.

The company began by selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to the [[Mediaset]] media conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The company worked closely with Intersound, a Los Angeles-based [[Recording studio|post-production recording studio]], managed by Frank Agrama's son, Ahmed Agrama. They were responsible for partially dubbing ''[[Dragon Ball]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to its distribution and production interests, Harmony Gold manages several [[real estate]] properties in the Southern California area. They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.

==History==

===Beginnings in late 1970s===
Harmony Gold's story began in the 1976, when [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1983, Agrama set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1980s: notable projects===

====''Shaka Zulu'' (1983–1986)====
In late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) to distribute the controversial ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' miniseries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |work=Remembered |date=30 May 2013 |title=Remembering Shaka Zulu |accessdate=2015-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233031/http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the economic sanctions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/entertainment/ca-14929_1_shaka-zulu 'Shaka Zulu': Negative Metaphor For South African Blacks], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 21, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The planned 10-episode [[miniseries]] was based on the story of the king of the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]], [[Shaka]] (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British [[Merchant|traders]] with whom he interacted. In the same year, Agrama founded Harmony Gold.

Throughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a "calculated gamble." ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.

''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Robotech'' (1985)====
In the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', but was instead forced to combine three different [[anime]] series together, which became ''[[Robotech]]'':

#''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''
#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''
#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''&lt;ref&gt;(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third "season" after ''Macross'' &amp; ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit a movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.

===Late 1980s to early 2000s===
In 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.

In 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].

From 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', a spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.

===2000s and beyond===
Harmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.

In August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''[[The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines]]''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.

==Legal problems==

Harmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.

===Mediaset conviction===
On November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.&lt;ref name="bbcfraud"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.

===Mediatrade acquittal===

In October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.

Prosecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&amp;cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="afr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l’appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped. Berlusconi and Mediaset Chairman Fedele Confalonieri were convicted and were sentenced to 13 months of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mediaset-ceo-tax-evasion-sentence-876702|author=Ariston Anderson|work=Hollywood Reporter| date=2016|title=Mediaset CEO Pier-Silvio Berlusconi Gets 14-Month Sentence in Tax Evasion Case}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues regarding ''Macross'' copyright==
Harmony Gold, via its license of ''[[Robotech]]'', is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, ''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''. They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.

Most notably, many early designs used in ''[[Battletech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of Macross, with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of Battletech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.

Harmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set "G.I. Joe vs Transformers The Epic Conclusion" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese [[Macross]] TV series (1982–84).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|title=HARMONY GOLD USA, INC vs HASBRO|work=www.courthousenews.com|accessdate=April 29, 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085251/http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-17/harmony-gold-usa-v-hasbro-case-dismissed | title = Harmony Gold USA v. Hasbro Case Dismissed|work=www.animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of Harmony Gold's license to Macross was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property. According to the US Copyright Office, Harmony Gold is the Co-Copyright owner until 2021.

In November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber Mospeada'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to Macross and its trademark for the Macross series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these will be ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022 but the pending expiration of the licensing agreement could affect the trademark ownership before 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names: MasterVision==
Harmony Gold was known in the [[United Kingdom]] as MasterVision in the VHS pre-certs sector. They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.

'''Hejazi Arabic''' or '''Hijazi Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|حجازي}} ''{{transl|ar|ḥijāzī}}''), also known as '''West Arabian Arabic''', is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken in the [[Hejaz]] region in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Strictly speaking, there are two main groups of dialects spoken in the [[Hejaz]] region,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Alzaidi|2014|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; one by the urban population, originally spoken in the major cities of [[Jeddah]], [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and another by the [[Bedouin]] or rural populations. However, the term most often applies to the urban variety which is discussed in this article.

In antiquity, the Hejaz was home to the [[Old Higazi|Old Hejazi]] dialect of Arabic. Old Hejazi is distinct from modern Hejazi Arabic, and represents an older linguistic layer wiped out by centuries of migration, but which happens to share the imperative prefix vowel /a-/ with the modern dialect.

== Classification ==
Hejazi Arabic belongs to the western [[Peninsular Arabic]] branch of the [[Arabic language]], which itself is a [[Semitic language]]. It includes features of both urban and bedouin dialects giving its history between the ancient urban cities of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] and the bedouin tribes that lived on the outskirts of these cities.

=== Features ===
Also referred to as the sedentary Hejazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term "Hejazi Arabic", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. With respect to the axis of [[bedouin]] versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both. Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties in some aspects and has therefore shed some Classical forms and features that are still present in bedouin dialects, these include gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker ''-n'' (see [[Varieties of Arabic]]). But in contrast to bedouin dialects, the constant use of full vowels and the absence of [[vowel reduction]] plus the distinction between the emphatic letters {{angbr|[[ض]]}} and {{angbr|[[ظ]]}} is generally retained.

==== Innovative features ====

# The present progressive tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|بـ}} {{IPA|/bi/}} or {{lang|acw|قاعد}} {{IPA|/gaːʕid/}} as in {{lang|acw|بيدرس}} {{IPA|/bijidrus/}} or {{lang|acw|قاعد يدرس}} {{IPA|/gaːʕid jidrus/}} ("he is studying").
# The future tense is marked by the prefix {{lang|acw|حـ}} {{IPA|/ħa/}} as in {{lang|acw|حيدرس}} {{IPA|/ħajidrus/}} ("he is going to study").
# the internal passive form, which in Hejazi, is replaced by the pattern ({{lang|acw|أنفعل}} {{IPA|/anfaʕal/}}, {{lang|acw|ينفعل}} {{IPA|/jinfaʕil/}}).
# The final ''-n'' in present tense plural verb forms is no longer employed (e.g. {{lang|acw|يركبوا}} {{IPA|/jirkabu/}} instead of {{lang|acw|يركبون}} {{IPA|/jarkəbuːn/}}).
# The dominant case ending before the 3rd person masculine singular pronoun is ''-u'', rather than the ''-a'' that is prevalent in bedouin dialects. For example, {{lang|acw|بيته}} {{IPA|/beːtu/}} ("his house"), {{lang|acw|عنده}} {{IPA|/ʕindu/}} ("he has"), {{lang|acw|أعرفه}} {{IPA|/aʕrifu/}} ("I know him").
[[File:Semitic-map-english.gif|thumb|323x323px|right|Approximate distribution of Arabic language around the 1st century in [[Hejaz]] and [[Najd]]]]

==== Conservative features ==== 
# Hejazi Arabic does not employ [[double negative|double negation]], nor does it append the negation particles ''-sh'' to negate verbs: Hejazi {{lang|acw|ما اعرف}} {{IPA|/maː aʕrif/}} ("I don't know"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|معرفش}} {{IPA|/maʕrafʃ/}} and [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] {{lang|ar|بعرفش}} {{IPA|/baʕrafiʃ/}}.
#The present indicative tense is not marked by any prefixes as in {{lang|acw|يِدْرُس}} {{IPA|/jidrus/}} ("he studies"), as opposed to [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] {{lang|ar|بيدرس}}.
# The prohibitive mood of Classical Arabic is preserved in the imperative: {{lang|acw|لا تروح}} {{IPA|/laː tiruːħ/}} ("don't go").
# The possessive suffixes are generally preserved in their Classical forms. For example, {{lang|acw|بيتكم}} {{IPA|/beːtakum/}} "your (pl) house".
# The plural first person pronoun is {{lang|ar|نحنا}} {{IPA|/niħna/}} or {{lang|ar|إحنا}} {{IPA|/iħna/}}, as opposed to the bedouin {{lang|ar|حنّا}} {{IPA|/ħənna/}} or {{lang|ar|إنّا}} {{IPA|/ənna/}}.
# When used to indicate location, the preposition {{lang|acw|في}} {{IPA|/fi/}} is preferred to {{lang|acw|بـ}} {{IPA|/b/}}. In bedouin dialects, the preference differs by region.
# Less restriction on the distribution of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}.
# The glottal stop can be added to final syllables ending in a vowel as a way of emphasising.
# Compared to neighboring dialects, urban Hejazi retains most of the short vowels of [[Classical Arabic]] with no [[vowel reduction]], for example:
:: {{lang|ar|سمكة}} {{IPA|/samaka/}} ("fish"), as opposed to bedouin {{IPA|[sməka]}}.
:: {{lang|ar|نُطْق}} {{IPA|/nutˤg/}} ("pronunciation"), as opposed to bedouin {{IPA|[nətˤg]}}.
:: {{lang|ar|ضربَته}} {{IPA|/dˤarabatu/}} ("she hit him"), as opposed to bedouin {{IPA|[ðˤrabətah]}}.
:: {{lang|ar|وَلَدُه}} {{IPA|/waladu/}} ("his son"), as opposed to bedouin {{IPA|[wlədah]}}.
:: {{lang|ar|عندَكُم}} {{IPA|/ʕindakum/}} ("in your possession" pl.), as opposed to bedouin {{IPA|[ʕəndəkum]}}, Egyptian {{IPA|[ʕanduku]}}, and Levantine {{IPA|[ʕandkon]}}.

== History ==
The Arabic of today is derived principally from the old dialects of Central and North Arabia which were divided by the classical Arab grammarians into three groups: [[Hejaz]], [[Najd]], and the language of the tribes in adjoining areas. Though the modern Hejazi dialects has developed markedly since the development of Classical Arabic, and Modern Standard Arabic is quite distinct from the modern dialect of Hejaz. Standard Arabic now differs considerably from modern Hejazi Arabic in terms of its phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Phonology and Morphology of Arabic|last=Watson|first=Janet|publisher=Oxford university press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; such diglossia in Arabic began to emerge at the latest in the sixth century CE when oral poets recited their poetry in a proto-Classical Arabic based on archaic dialects which differed greatly from their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar|last=Lipinski|first=|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, it is not well known in which stage of Arabic the shift from the [[Semitic languages#Phonology|Proto-Semitic]] pair {{IPA|/q, g/}} to Hejazi {{IPA|/g, d͡ʒ/}}  {{angbr|[[ج]] ,[[ق]]}} occurred, although it has been attested as early as the eighth century CE, and it can be explained by a [[chain shift]] {{IPA|/q/}}* → {{IPA|/g/}} → {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cours de phonétique arabe|last=Cantineau|first=Jean|publisher=Libraire C. Klincksieck|year=1960|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=67|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; that occurred in one of two ways:

# Drag Chain: Proto-Semitic [[Gimel|gīm]] {{IPA|/g/}} [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] to Hejazi {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} jīm first, opening up a space at the position of {{IPA|[g]}}, which qāf {{IPA|/q/}} (or {{IPA|/kˤ/}}) then moved to fill the empty space resulting in Hejazi {{IPA|/g/}} gāf, restoring structural symmetrical relationships present in the pre-Arabic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Aaron|date=2015|title=The Linguistic Geography of Dorsal Consonants in Syria|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~aaronfr/L568-final-Freeman.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Geography of Dorsal Consonants in Syria|publication-place=University of Pennsylvania|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öhrnberg|first=Kaj|date=2013|title=Travelling Through Time|url=|journal=Studia Orientalia 114|volume=|pages=524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Push Chain: Proto-Semitic [[Qoph|qāf]] presumably {{IPA|/q/}} (or {{IPA|/kʼ/}}) changed to Hejazi {{IPA|/g/}} gāf first, which resulted in pushing the original gīm {{IPA|/g/}} forward in articulation to become Hejazi {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} jīm, but since most modern qāf dialects as well as standard Arabic also have jīm, hence the push-chain of qāf to gāf first can be discredited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=Wolfhart|date=|title=Ibn Khaldūn as a Historical Linguist with an Excursus on the Question of Ancient gāf|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8F_PW9P6dqlcWc1OUpBcFpLZTA/view|journal=Harvard University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are good grounds for believing that old Arabic qāf had both voiced {{IPAblink|g}} and voiceless {{IPAblink|q}} allophones; and after that gīm {{IPA|/g/}} was fronted to {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} jīm, possibly as a result of pressure from the allophones.&lt;ref&gt;Blanc 1969: 11, Travelling Through Time, Essays in honour of Kaj Öhrnberg&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;* The original value of [[Semitic languages#Phonology|Proto-Semitic qāf]] was probably an [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] {{IPAblink|kʼ}} not {{IPAblink|q}}.&lt;/small&gt;
== Phonology ==
{{Main article|Hejazi Arabic phonology}}In general, Hejazi native phonemic inventory consists of 26 to 28 [[consonant]] [[Phoneme|phonemes]] depending on the speaker's background and formality, while it has an eight-vowel system, consisting of three short and five long [[Vowel|vowels]] {{IPA|/a, u, i, aː, uː, oː, iː, eː/}}, in addition to two diphthongs {{IPA|/aw, aj/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdoh|2010|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Omar|1975|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consonant length]] and [[Vowel length]] are both distinctive in Hejazi.

The main phonological feature that differentiates urban Hejazi from the neighboring urban and rural dialects of the [[Arabian peninsula]], is the constant use of full vowels and the absence of [[vowel reduction]], for example {{lang|ar|قلت لك}} 'I told you' (to a female), is pronounced {{IPA|[gʊltalːɪk]}} or {{IPA|[gʊltalɪk]}} in Hejazi with full vowels but pronounced with the reduced vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} as {{IPA|[gəltələk]}} or {{IPA|[gəltələt͡s]}} in [[Najdi Arabic|Najdi]]. In general it also retains the distinction between the letters {{angbr|[[Ḍād|ض]]}} and {{angbr|[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]}}, but alternates between the pronunciations of the letters {{angbr|[[Ṯāʾ|ث]]}} ,{{angbr|[[Ḏāl|ذ]]}}, and {{angbr|[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]}}. (See {{slink||Writing system}}, below.)

A conservative phonological feature that Hejazi holds is the lack of [[Palatalization (sound change)#Semitic languages|palatalization]] for the letters {{lang|acw|ك}} {{IPA|/k/}}, {{lang|acw|ق}} {{IPA|/g/}} and {{lang|acw|ج}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}, unlike in other [[Peninsular Arabic|peninsular dialects]] where they can be [[Palatalization (sound change)#Varieties of Arabic|palatalized]] and merged with other phonemes in certain positions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Arabic Linguistics|last=Owens|first=Owens|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; (to [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|t͡ʃ]]], [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiceless alveolar affricate|t͡s]]], [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|ʃ]]], or [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless%20alveolar%20sibilant|s]]] in case of ك, [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiced palato-alveolar affricate|d͡ʒ]]] or [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Voiced alveolar affricate|d͡z]]] in case of ق and {{IPAblink|j}} in case of ج), it is also worth mentioning that this trait of non-palatalization is becoming common across Saudi Arabia especially in urban centers, another feature is that the ل {{IPA|/l/}} is only [[Velarization|velarized]] to /[[Alveolar lateral approximant#Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|ɫ]]/ in the word الله /aɫːaːh/ 'god' (except when it follows an /i/: بسمِ الله {{IPA|/bism'''i'''lːaːh/}} or لله {{IPA|/l'''i'''lːaːh/}}) and words derived from it, unlike other peninsular dialects where it might be velarized [[Allophone|allophonically]], as in {{lang|acw|عقل}} pronounced {{IPA|[ʕaɡe̞l]}} in Hejazi but {{IPA|[ʕaɡəɫ]}} in other peninsular Arabic dialects.

Phonetic notes:
* due to the influence of [[Modern Standard Arabic]], {{IPAblink|q}} has been introduced as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} {{angbr|[[ق]]}} in few words and phrases as in {{lang|acw|القاهرة}} ('Cairo') which is [[Narrow versus broad transcription|phonemically]] {{IPA|/alˈ'''g'''aːhira/}} but can be pronounced as {{IPA|[alˈ'''q'''aːhɪra]}} or less likely {{IPA|[alˈ'''g'''aːhɪra]}} depending on the speaker, although older speakers prefer {{IPAblink|g}} in all positions.
* the marginal phoneme /[[Alveolar lateral approximant#Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|ɫ]]/ only occurs in the word الله /aɫːaːh/ ('god') and words derived from it, it contrasts with /l/ in والله /waɫːa/ ('i swear') vs. ولَّا /walːa/ ('or').
*the [[affricate]] {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} {{angbr|[[ج]]}} and the trill {{IPA|/r/}} {{angbr|[[ر]]}} are realised as a {{IPAblink|ʒ}} and a tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}} respectively by a number of speakers or in a number of words.
*the reintroduced phoneme {{IPA|/θ/}} {{angbr|[[Ṯāʾ|ث]]}} is partially used as an alternative phoneme, while most speakers merge it with {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/s/}} depending on the word.
*the reintroduced phoneme {{IPA|/ð/}} {{angbr|[[Ḏāl|ذ]]}} is partially used as an alternative phoneme, while most speakers merge it with {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/z/}} depending on the word.
* the classicized {{IPAblink|ðˤ}} is an optional allophone for ⟨[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]⟩, but it is always used when pronouncing the letter's name which is [ˈðˤaːʔ]. In general, urban Hejazi speakers pronounce it as /zˤ/ or merge it with /dˤ/ depending on the word.
*{{IPA|/p/}} ⟨[[Pe (Persian letter)|پ]]⟩ and {{IPA|/v/}} ⟨[[Ve (Arabic letter)|ڤ]]⟩ which exist only in foreign words, are used by a number of speakers and can be substituted by {{IPA|/b/}} ⟨[[ب]]⟩ and {{IPA|/f/}} ⟨[[ف]]⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.
*{{IPA|/tʃ/}} occurs only in foreign words and it is not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory but as a [[Consonant cluster|sequence]] of {{IPA|/t/}} ⟨[[ت]]⟩ and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} ⟨[[ش]]⟩, as in تشيلي {{IPA|/ˈtʃiːli/}} or {{IPA|/tʃiːleː/}} ('Chile').

Phonetic notes:
*{{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} are always pronounced either as a front {{IPAblink|a}} or a central {{IPAblink|ä}} depending on the speaker, except in some words such as {{lang|acw|ألمانيا}} {{IPA|[almɑːnja]}} ('Germany'), {{lang|acw|يابان}} {{IPA|[jaːbɑːn]}} ('Japan') and {{lang|acw|بابا}} {{IPA|[bɑːbɑ]}} ('dad') where they are pronounced with the back vowel {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.
*{{IPA|/oː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} are pronounced as true [[mid vowel]]s {{IPAblink|o̞ː}} and {{IPAblink|e̞ː}} respectively.
* short {{IPA|/u/}} is pronounced allophonically as {{IPAblink|ʊ}} or {{IPAblink|o̞}} in word initial or medial syllables and strictly as {{IPAblink|u}} at the end of words or before {{IPAblink|w}} or when isolate.
* short {{IPA|/i/}} is pronounced allophonically as {{IPAblink|ɪ}} or {{IPAblink|e̞}} in word initial or medial syllables and strictly as {{IPAblink|i}} at the end of words or before {{IPAblink|j}} or when isolate.

==== Monophthongization ====
Most of the occurrences of the two diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} in the [[Classical Arabic]] period underwent [[monophthongization]] in Hejazi, and are realized as the long vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} respectively, but they are still preserved as diphthongs in a number of words which created a contrast with the long vowels {{IPA|/uː/}}, {{IPA|/oː/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}}.

Not all instances of mid vowels are a result of monophthongization, some are from grammatical processes {{lang|ar|قالوا}} {{IPA|/gaːl'''u'''/}} 'they said'  →  {{lang|ar|قالوا لها}} {{IPA|/gaːl'''oː'''laha/}} 'they said to her' (opposed to Classical Arabic  {{lang|ar|قالوا لها}} {{IPA|/qaːl'''uː''' lahaː/}}), and some occur in modern [[Portmanteau|Portmanteau words]] e.g. {{lang|ar|ليش}} {{IPA|/leːʃ/}} 'why?' (from Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|لأي}} {{IPA|/liʔaj/}} 'for what' and {{lang|ar|شيء}} {{IPA|/ʃajʔ/}} 'thing').

== Vocabulary ==
Hejazi vocabulary derives primarily from Arabic Semitic roots. The urban Hejazi vocabulary differs in some respect from that of other dialects in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, there are fewer specialized terms related to desert life, and more terms related to seafaring and fishing. Loanwords are mainly of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Romance languages|Latin]] ([[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) and [[English language|English]] origins, and due to the diverse origins of the inhabitants of Hejazi cities, some loanwords are only used by some families. A number of old loanwords are fading or became obsolete due to the influence of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and their association with lower social class and education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Alahmadi|2015|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. {{lang|ar|كنديشن}} {{IPA|/kunˈdeːʃan/}} "[[Air conditioning|air conditioner]]" (from English ''Condition'') was replaced by Standard Arabic {{lang|ar|مكيّف}} {{IPA|/mukajːif/}}. Most of the loanwords are nouns (with a change of meaning sometimes) as in: {{lang|ar|جزمة}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒazma/}} "[[shoe]]" from Turkish {{wikt-lang|tr|çizme}} {{IPA|/t͡ʃizme/}} originally meaning "[[boot]]" or {{lang|ar|كُبري}} {{IPA|/kubri/}} "[[overpass]]" from {{wikt-lang|tr|köprü}} {{IPA|/køpry/}} originally meaning "[[bridge]]".

Some general Hejazi expressions include {{lang|ar|بالتوفيق}} {{IPA|/bitːawfiːg/}} "good luck", {{lang|ar|إيوه}} {{IPA|/ʔiːwa/}} "yes", {{lang|ar|لأ}} {{IPA|/laʔ/}} "no", {{lang|ar|لسة}} {{IPA|/lisːa/}} "not yet", {{lang|ar|قد}} {{IPA|/ɡid/}} or {{lang|ar|قيد}} {{IPA|/ɡiːd/}} "already", {{lang|ar|دحين}} {{IPA|/daħiːn/}} or {{IPA|/daħeːn/}} "now", {{lang|ar|أبغى}} {{IPA|/ʔabɣa/}} "I want", {{lang|ar|لو سمحت}} {{IPA|/law samaħt/}} "please/excuse me" to a male and {{lang|ar|لو سمحتي}} {{IPA|/law samaħti/}} "please/excuse me" to a female.

=== Portmanteau ===
A common feature in Hejazi vocabulary is [[Portmanteau|portmanteau words]] (also called a ''[[Blend word|blend]]'' in linguistics); in which parts of multiple [[word]]s or their [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] (sounds) are combined into a new word, it is especially innovative in making [[Interrogative words]], examples include:
* {{lang|ar|إيوه}} ({{IPA|/ʔiːwa/}}, "yes") : from {{lang|ar|إي}} ({{IPA|/ʔiː/}}, "yes") and {{lang|ar|و}} ({{IPA|/wa/}}, "and") and {{lang|ar|الله}} ({{IPA|/aɫːaːh/}}, "god").
* {{lang|ar|معليش}} ({{IPA|/maʕleːʃ/}}, is it ok?/sorry) : from {{lang|ar|ما}} ({{IPA|/maː/}}, nothing) and {{lang|ar|عليه}} ({{IPA|/ʕalajh/}}, on him) and {{lang|ar|شيء}} ({{IPA|/ʃajʔ/}}, thing).
* {{lang|ar|إيش}} ({{IPA|/ʔeːʃ/}}, "what?") : from {{lang|ar|أي}} ({{IPA|/aj/}}, "which") and {{lang|ar|شيء}} ({{IPA|/ʃajʔ/}}, "thing").
* {{lang|ar|ليش}} ({{IPA|/leːʃ/}}, "why?") : from {{lang|ar|لأي}} ({{IPA|/liʔaj/}}, for what) and {{lang|ar|شيء}} ({{IPA|/ʃajʔ/}}, "thing").
* {{lang|ar|فين}} ({{IPA|/feːn/}}, where?) : from {{lang|ar|في}} ({{IPA|/fiː/}}, in) and {{lang|ar|أين}} ({{IPA|/ʔajn/}}, where).
* {{lang|ar|إلين}} ({{IPA|/ʔileːn/}}, "until") : from {{lang|ar|إلى}} ({{IPA|/ʔilaː/}}, "to") and {{lang|ar|أن}} ({{IPA|/an/}}, "that").
* {{lang|ar|دحين}} ({{IPA|/daħiːn/}} or {{IPA|/daħeːn/}}, "now") or {{lang|ar|ذحين}} ({{IPA|/ðaħiːn/}} or {{IPA|/ðaħeːn/}}, "now") : from {{lang|ar|ذا}} ({{IPA|/ðaː/}}, "this") and {{lang|ar|الحين}} ({{IPA|/alħiːn/}}, part of time).
* {{lang|ar|بعدين}} ({{IPA|/baʕdeːn/}}, later) : from {{lang|ar|بعد}} (baʕd, after) and {{lang|ar|أَيْن}} (ʔayn, part of time).
* {{lang|ar|علشان}} or {{lang|ar|عشان}} ({{IPA|/ʕalaʃaːn/}} or {{IPA|/ʕaʃaːn/}}, "because") : from {{lang|ar|على}} ({{IPA|/ʕalaː/}}, "on") and {{lang|ar|شأن}} ({{IPA|/ʃaʔn/}}, "matter").
* {{lang|ar|كمان}} ({{IPA|/kamaːn/}}, "also") : from {{lang|ar|كما}} ({{IPA|/kamaː/}}, "like") and {{lang|ar|أن}} ({{IPA|/ʔan/}}, "that").
* {{lang|ar|يلّا}} ({{IPA|/jaɫːa/}}, come on) : from {{lang|ar|يا}} ({{IPA|/jaː/}}, "o!") and {{lang|ar|الله}} ({{IPA|/aɫːaːh/}}, "god").

=== Numerals ===
The Cardinal number system in Hejazi is much more simplified than the Classical Arabic&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kheshaifaty|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system similar to the German numbers system is used for other numbers between 20 and above : 21 is {{lang|acw|واحد و عشرين}} {{IPA|/waːħid u ʕiʃriːn/}} which literally mean ('one and twenty') and 485 is {{lang|acw|أربعمية و خمسة و ثمانين}} {{IPA|/urbuʕmijːa u xamsa u tamaːniːn/}} which literally mean ('four hundred and five and eighty').

Unlike Classical Arabic, the only number that is gender specific in Hejazi is "one" which has two forms {{lang|acw|واحد}} ''m.'' and {{lang|acw|وحدة}} ''f.'' as in {{lang|acw|كتاب واحد}} {{IPA|/kitaːb waːħid/}} ('one book') or {{lang|acw|سيارة وحدة}} {{IPA|/sajːaːra waħda/}} ('one car'), with {{lang|acw|كتاب}} being a masculine noun and {{lang|acw|سيّارة}} a feminine noun.

* for 2 as in 'two cars' 'two years' 'two houses' etc. the dual form is used instead of the number with the suffix ēn {{IPA|/eːn/}} or tēn {{IPA|/teːn/}} (if the noun ends with a feminine {{IPA|/a/}}) as in {{lang|acw|كتابين}} {{IPA|/kitaːb'''eːn'''/}} ('two books') or {{lang|acw|سيّارتين}} {{IPA|/sajːara'''teːn'''/}} ('two cars'), for emphasis they can be said as {{lang|acw|كتابين اثنين}} or {{lang|acw|سيّارتين اثنين}}.
* for numbers 3 to 10 the noun following the number is in plural form as in {{lang|acw|اربعة كتب}} {{IPA|/arbaʕa kutub/}} ('4 books') or {{lang|acw|عشرة سيّارات}} {{IPA|/ʕaʃara sajːaːraːt/}} ('10 cars').
* for numbers 11 and above the noun following the number is in singular form as in :-
** from 11 to 19 an {{lang|acw|ـر}} [ar] is added to the end of the numbers as in {{lang|acw|اربعطعشر كتاب}} {{IPA|/arbaʕtˤaʕʃ'''ar''' kitaːb/}} ('14 books') or {{lang|acw|احدعشر سيّارة}} {{IPA|/iħdaʕʃ'''ar''' sajːaːra/}} ('11 cars').
** for 100s a [t] is added to the end of the numbers before the counted nouns as in {{lang|acw|ثلثميّة سيّارة}} {{IPA|/tultumijːa'''t''' sajːaːra/}} ('300 cars').
** other numbers are simply added to the singular form of the noun {{lang|acw|واحد و عشرين كتاب}} {{IPA|/waːħid u ʕiʃriːn kitaːb/}} ('21 books').

== Grammar ==
=== Subject pronouns ===
In Hejazi Arabic, [[personal pronoun]]s have eight forms. In singular, the 2nd and 3rd persons differentiate gender, while the 1st person and plural do not.

=== Verbs ===
Hejazi Arabic verbs, as with the verbs in other [[Semitic languages]], and the entire vocabulary in those languages, are based on a set of three, four also five consonants (but mainly three consonants) called a [[Semitic root|root]] (''triliteral'' or ''quadriliteral'' according to the number of consonants). The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k-t-b}}'' 'to write', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʼ-k-l}}'' 'to eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as :
* Two tenses ('''past''', '''present'''; present progressive is indicated by the prefix (b-), future is indicated by the prefix (ħ-))
* Two voices (active, passive)
* Two genders (masculine, feminine)
* Three persons (first, second, third)
* Two numbers (singular, plural)
* Two moods (indicative, imperative).
Hejazi Has a single indicative present verb mood instead of the three Classical Arabic present verb moods (indicative رفع, subjunctive نصب, jussive {{lang|acw|جزم}}), it also includes present progressive tense which was not part of the Classical Arabic grammar, and has a two grammatical number in verbs (Singular and Plural) instead of the Classical (Singular, Dual and Plural).

==== Regular verbs ====
The most common verbs in Hejazi have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' and '''i''') to present ('''a''' or '''u''' or '''i'''). Combinations of each exist:

{| class="wikitable centered" style="text-align:center;"
! colspan="2" | Vowel patterns

|-

| ʕir'''i'''f {{lang|acw|عرف}} ''he knew'' – yiʕr'''i'''f {{lang|acw|يعرف}} ''he knows''
|}

According to Arab grammarians, verbs are divided into '''three''' categories; Past ماضي, Present {{lang|acw|مضارع}} and Imperative {{lang|acw|أمر}}. An example from the root ''{{transl|ar|ALA|k-t-b}}'' the verb ''katab'''t'''/'''&lt;big&gt;ʼ&lt;/big&gt;a'''ktub'' 'i wrote/i write' (which is a regular sound verb):

Active participles act as adjectives, and so they must agree with their subject. An active participle can be used in several ways:
# to describe a state of being (understanding; knowing).
# to describe what someone is doing right now (going, leaving) as in some verbs like {{lang|acw|رحت}} ("i went") the active participle {{lang|acw|رايح}} ("i'm going") is used instead of present continuous form to give the same meaning of an ongoing action.
# to indicate that someone/something is in a state of having done something (having put something somewhere, having lived somewhere for a period of time).

=== Object pronouns ===
[[Enclitic]] forms of object pronouns are suffixes that are affixed to various parts of speech, with varying meanings:
* To the [[construct state]] of nouns, where they have the meaning of possessive demonstratives, e.g. "my, your, his".
* To verbs, where they have the meaning of direct object pronouns, e.g. "me, you, him".
* To verbs, where they have the meaning of indirect object pronouns, e.g. "(to/for) me,(to/for) you, (to/for) him".
* To prepositions.
Unlike [[Egyptian Arabic]], in Hejazi no more than one pronoun can be suffixed to a word.

Modifications:-
* When a noun ends in a feminine {{IPA|/a/}} vowel as in {{lang|acw|مدرسة}} {{IPA|/madrasa/}} ('school') : a {{IPA|/t/}} is added before the suffixes as in → {{lang|acw|مدرستي}} {{IPA|/madrasa'''t'''i/}} ('my school'), {{lang|acw|مدرسته}} {{IPA|/madrasa'''t'''u/}} ('his school'), {{lang|acw|مدرستها}} {{IPA|/madrasa'''t'''ha/}} ('her school') and so on.
* After a word ends in a vowel (other than the {{IPA|/-a/}} of the feminine nouns), the vowel is lengthened, and the pronouns in (Parentheses) are used instead of their original counterparts :-
** the possessive pronouns as in {{lang|acw|كرسي}} {{IPA|/kursi/}} ('chair') → {{lang|acw|كرسيه}} {{IPA|/kurs'''iː'''/}} ('his chair'), {{lang|acw|كرسينا}} {{IPA|/kurs'''iː'''na/}} ('our chair'), {{lang|acw|كرسيكي}} {{IPA|/kurs'''iːki'''/}} ('your chair' f.)
** the direct object pronouns {{lang|acw|لاحقنا}} {{IPA|/laːħagna/}} ('we followed') → {{lang|acw|لاحقناه}} {{IPA|/laːħagn'''aː'''/}} ('we followed him'), {{lang|acw|لاحقناكي}} {{IPA|/laːħagn'''aː'''ki/}} ('we followed you' feminine).
** the indirect object pronouns {{lang|acw|رحنا}} {{IPA|/ruħna/}} ('we went') → {{lang|acw|رحنا له}} {{IPA|/ruħn'''aː'''lu/}} ('we went to him').
* After a word that ends in two consonants, or which has a long vowel in the last syllable, {{IPA|/-a-/}} is inserted before the 5 suffixes which begin with a consonant {{IPA|/-ni/}}, {{IPA|/-na/}}, {{IPA|/-ha/}}, {{IPA|/-hom/}}, {{IPA|/-kom/}}.
** the possessive pronouns {{lang|acw|كتاب}} {{IPA|/kitaːb/}} ('book') → {{lang|acw|كتابها}} {{IPA|/kitaːb'''a'''ha/}} ('her book'), {{lang|acw|كتابهم}} {{IPA|/kitaːb'''a'''hum/}} ('their book'), {{lang|acw|كتابكم}} {{IPA|/kitaːb'''a'''kum/}} ('your book' plural), {{lang|acw|كتابنا}} {{IPA|/kitaːb'''a'''na/}} ('our book').
** the direct object pronouns {{lang|acw|عرفت}} {{IPA|/ʕirift/}} ('you knew') → {{lang|acw|عرفتني}} {{IPA|/ʕirift'''a'''ni/}} ('you knew me'), {{lang|acw|عرفتنا}} {{IPA|/ʕirift'''a'''na/}} ('you knew us'), {{lang|acw|عرفتها}} {{IPA|/ʕirift'''a'''ha/}} ('you knew her'), {{lang|acw|عرفتهم}} {{IPA|/ʕirift'''a'''hum/}} ('you knew them').
* '''only''' with indirect object pronouns when a verb ends in two consonants as in katabt {{lang|acw|كتبت}} {{IPA|/katabt/}} ('i wrote') : an {{IPA|/-al-/}} is added before the Indirect object pronoun suffixes → katabtallu {{lang|acw|كتبت له}} {{IPA|/katabt'''al'''ːu/}} ('i wrote to him'), katabtallahum {{lang|acw|كتبت لهم}} {{IPA|/katabt'''al'''ːahum/}} ('i wrote to them').
* '''only''' with indirect object pronouns when a verb has a long vowel in the last syllable as in {{lang|acw|أروح}} {{IPA|/aruːħ/}} ('I go') : the vowel is shortened before the suffixes → {{lang|acw|أرُح لها}} {{IPA|/aruħlaha/}} ('I go to her') with the verbs resembling the Jussive mood conjugation in written Classical Arabic.
* {{note|11|1}} the colon between the (Parentheses) indicate that only the vowel is lengthened, since the word-final {{lang|acw|ـه}} [h] is silent in this position.
* {{note|12|2}} if a noun ends with a vowel (other than the {{IPA|/-a/}} of the feminine nouns) that is {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/a/}} then the suffix (-ya) is used as in {{lang|acw|أبو}} {{IPA|/abu/}} ('father') becomes {{lang|acw|َابوي}} {{IPA|/abuːja/}} ('my father') but if it ends with an {{IPA|/i/}} then the suffix (-yya) is added as in {{lang|acw|َّكرسي}} {{IPA|/kursijːa/}} ('my chair').
* it is uncommon for Hejazi nouns to end in a vowel other than the {{IPA|/-a/}} of the feminine nouns.

== Writing system ==
[[File:Qur'anic Manuscript - 2 - Hijazi script.jpg|thumb|right|An Early Qur'anic manuscript written in [[Hijazi script]] (8th century AD)|290x290px]]
Hejazi is written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]; like other [[varieties of Arabic]], Hejazi does not have a standard form of writing and mostly follows Classical Arabic rules of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Arabic: Structures, Functions, and Varieties|last = Holes|first = Clive|publisher = Georgetown University Press, Washington D.C.|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Washington D.C.|pages = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general people alternate between writing the words according to their etymology or the phoneme used while pronouncing them, which mainly has an effect on the three letters {{angbr|[[Ṯāʾ|ث]]}} {{angbr|[[Ḏāl|ذ]]}} and {{angbr|[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]}}, for example writing {{lang|acw|تخين}} instead of {{lang|acw|ثخين}} or {{lang|acw|ديل}} instead of {{lang|acw|ذيل}} although this alternation in writing is not considered acceptable by all Hejazi speakers.

Another alternation which is more likely to appear happens when writing words that end in a short vowel {{IPA|/a, u, i/}}, the writer would choose whether to add a vowel letter {{angbr|و}} {{angbr|ا}} or {{angbr|ي}} at the end of the word as in {{lang|acw|انتي}} {{IPA|/inti/}} ('you' singular feminine) to differentiate it from {{lang|acw|انت}} {{IPA|/inta/}} ('you' singular masculine), or use the Classical form {{lang|acw|انت}} which can be pronounced {{IPA|/inta/}} or {{IPA|/inti/}}, this happens since most word-final short vowels from the Classical Arabic period have been omitted and most word-final unstressed long vowel letters have been shortened in Hejazi. In Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written, and when needed to be written they are written in a form of [[Arabic diacritics|diacritics]]; &lt;big&gt;{{lang|acw|ـَ}}&lt;/big&gt; above the letter for {{IPA|/a/}}, &lt;big&gt;{{lang|acw|ـُ}}&lt;/big&gt; above the letter for {{IPA|/u/}}, &lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|ـِ}}&lt;/big&gt; under the letter for {{IPA|/i/}}.

Notes:

* The classical {{IPAblink|q}} is an [[allophone]] for {{IPA|/g/}} {{angbr|[[Qoph|ق]]}} only in few words and phrases e.g. {{lang|acw|قاموس}} "dictionary" {{IPA|/gaːmuːs/}} pronounced {{IPA|[qaːmuːs]}}.
*{{IPA|/zˤ/}} is spelled {{angbr|[[Ḍād|ض]]}} only in a number of words from the two [[Semitic root|trilateral roots]] {{angbr|ض ب ط}} and {{angbr|ض ر ط}}, as in {{lang|acw|ضبط}} ("it worked") pronounced {{IPA|/zˤabatˤ/}} and not {{IPA|/dˤabatˤ/}}. 
* {{angbr|[[ة]]}} is only used at the end of words and mainly to mark [[Grammatical gender|femi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Grammatical gender|nine gender]] for [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[adjective|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]s with few exceptions (e.g. {{lang|ar|أسامة}}; a male noun). phonemically It is silent, except when in [[construct state]] it is a /t/, which leads to the word-final /-at/. e.g. {{lang|ar|رسالة}} {{IPA|/risaːl'''a'''/}} 'message' → {{lang|ar|رسالة أحمد}} {{IPA|/risaːl'''at''' ʔaħmad/}} 'Ahmad's message'.

== Rural dialects ==
The varieties of Arabic spoken in the smaller towns and by the bedouin tribes in the Hejaz region are relatively under-studied. However, the speech of some tribes shows much closer affinity to other bedouin dialects, particularly those of neighboring [[Najd]], than to those of the urban Hejazi cities. The dialects of northern Hejazi tribes [[Dialect continuum|merge]] into those of [[Jordan]] and [[Sinai]], while the dialects in the south [[Dialect continuum|merge]] with those of [['Asir]] and [[Najd]]. Also, not all speakers of these bedouin dialects are figuratively [[nomadic]] bedouins; some are simply sedentary sections that live in rural areas, and thus speak dialects similar to those of their bedouin neighbors.

=== Al-`Ula ===
The dialect of [[Al-`Ula]] governorate in the northern part of the [[Al Madinah Region|Madinah region]]. Although understudied, it is considered to be unique among the Hejazi dialects, it is known for its pronunciation of Classical Arabic {{angbr|[[Kaph|ك]]}} {{IPA|/k/}} as a {{angbr|[[Shin (letter)|ش]]}} {{IPA|/[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|ʃ]]/}} (e.g. {{lang|ar|تكذب}} {{IPA|/takðib/}} becomes {{lang|ar|تشذب}} {{IPA|/taʃðib/}}), the dialect also shows a tendency to pronounce long {{IPA|/aː/}} as {{IPAblink|e|eː}} (e.g. Classical {{lang|ar|ماء}} {{IPA|/maːʔ/}} becomes {{lang|ar|ميء}} [meːʔ]), in some instances the Classical {{IPA|/q/}} becomes a {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}} as in {{lang|ar|قايلة}} {{IPA|/qaːjla/}} becomes {{lang|ar|جايلة}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒaːjla/}}, also the second person singular feminine pronoun {{IPA|/ik/}} tends to be pronounced as /i[[Voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|ʃ]]/ (e.g. {{lang|ar|رجلك}} {{IPA|/rid͡ʒlik/}} ('your foot') becomes {{lang|ar|رجلش}} {{IPA|/rid͡ʒliʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2008/20080629/wo5.htm|title=Spoken Al-'Ula dialect between privacy and fears of extinction. (in Arabic)|last=Aljuhani|first=Sultan|date=2008|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Badr ===
The dialect of [[Badr, Saudi Arabia|Badr]] governorate in the western part of the [[Al Madinah Region|Madinah region]] is mainly noted for its lengthening of word-final syllables and its alternative pronunciation of some phonemes as in {{lang|ar|سؤال}} {{IPA|/suʔaːl/}} which is pronounced as {{lang|ar|سعال}} {{IPA|/suʕaːl/}}, it also shares some features with the general urban dialect in which modern standard Arabic {{lang|ar|ثلاجة}} {{IPA|/θalːaːd͡ʒa/}} is pronounced {{lang|ar|تلاجة}} {{IPA|/talːaːd͡ʒa/}}, another unique feature of the dialect is its similarity to the Arabic dialects of [[Bahrain]].

'''Jalil Huseyngulu oglu Mammadguluzadeh''', also spelled as '''Jalil Mohammad Qolizadeh'''{{sfn|Javadi|Burrill|1988|pages=251–55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Devos|editor1-first=Bianca|editor2-last=Werner|editor2-first=Christoph|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135125530|pages=302, 326}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-az| Cəlil Məmmədquluzadə}}; 22 February 1869 – 4 January 1932), was an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] satirist and writer. He was the founder [[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|''Molla Nasraddin'']], a satirical magazine that would greatly influence the genre in the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]].

Mammadguluzadeh is considered to be one of the first feminists in Azerbaijan and Middle East and had a big role in founding the first women's magazine in Azerbaijan.

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}

===Early life===
Mammadguluzadeh was born in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] exclave of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nakhchivan.preslib.az/en_b2.html|title=Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|website=Nakhchivan.preslib.az|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammadguluzadeh considered himself to be [[Iran]]ian, and was proud of the fact that his ancestors hailed from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=AZERBAIJAN x. Azeri Turkish Literature|last1=Javadi|first1=H.|last2=Burrill|first2=K.|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-x|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. III, Fasc. 3|pages=251–55|year=1988|quote=Jalil Moḥammad-qolizāded (Mämmädguluzade) was proud of the fact that his forefathers were from Iran, and he considered himself an Iranian (Sardariniā, p. 109)|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, he graduated from the [[Gori Pedagogical Seminary]] and for the next ten years was involved in teaching at rural schools in [[Jalilkand|Bash-Norashen]], [[Masis (city)|Ulukhanli]], [[Nehram]] and other towns and villages of the [[Erivan Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azerigallery.com/literatura/dzhalil-mamedkulizade.html|title=Джалил Мамедкулизаде &amp;#124; Литература &amp;#124; Галереи|website=Azerigallery.com|accessdate=5 January 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammadguluzadeh was a strong activist of the language unification movement.{{Clarify|reason=more information about what this movement was|date=June 2018}} He condemned many of his contemporaries for what he considered a corruption of the Azeri language by replacing its genuine vocabulary with newly introduced Russian, Persian and Ottoman Turkish loanwords, often alien and confusing to many readers. Later he became deeply involved in the process of [[Romanization]] of the Azeri alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.az/down/meqale/adalet/2015/may/439967.htm|title=Cəlil Məmmədquluzadə və ana dili|website=Anl.az|accessdate=5 January 2018|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
In 1898, he moved to [[Yerevan|Erivan]]; in 1903, he moved to [[Tiflis]] where he became a columnist for the local ''Sharqi-Rus'' newspaper published in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] language. In 1906, he founded a satirical magazine entitled ''[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]''. Frequent military conflicts and overall political instability in the [[Caucasus]] forced him to move to [[Tabriz]], [[Iran|Persia]], where he continued his career as a chief-editor and columnist for ''Molla Nasraddin''. He eventually settled in Baku in 1921.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Mammadguluzadeh is considered to be one of first feminists in Azerbaijan and Middle East and had a big role in founding the first women's magazine in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azadliq.org/a/27596027.html|title=Azərbaycanda ilk feministlər kişilər olub|date=8 March 2016|website=Azadliq.org|language=az|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

====''Molla Nasraddin''====
{{main|Molla Nasraddin (magazine)}}
In 1905, Mammadguluzadeh and his companions purchased a printing-house in [[Tiflis]], and in 1906 he became the editor of the new ''[[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]]'' illustrated satirical magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/81_folder/81_articles/81_mollanasraddin.html Language and Alphabet Transitions, #8.1. Summer 2000], Azer.com; accessed 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine accurately portrayed social and economic realities of the early-20th century society and backward norms and practices common in the [[Caucasus]]. In 1921 (after ''Molla Nasraddin'' was banned in Russia in 1917), Mammadguluzadeh published eight more issues of the magazine in [[Tabriz|Tabriz, Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shexsiyyetler.nakhchivan.az/shexenglish/c_memmedquluzade.html Famous Personalities of Nakhchivan: Jalil Mammadguluzadeh], Shexsiyyetler.nakhchivan.az; accessed 5 October 2016.{{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Sovietization]], the printing-house was moved to [[Baku]], where ''Molla Nasraddin'' was published until 1931. Mammadguluzadeh's satirical style influenced the development of this genre in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azernews.az/culture/51970.html|title=Int'l cartoon contest kicks off in Azerbaijan|website=Azernews.az|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers of the first satirical magazines in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were influenced by Jalil Mammadguluzadeh and [[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|''Molla Nasraddin'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azadliq.org/a/28230447.html|title=Mirzə Cəlil və onun "Molla Nəsrəddin"i haqda bilinməyənlər|website=Azadliq.org|date=19 May 1907|accessdate=5 January 2018|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life and death===
In 1907, the twice-widowed Mammadguluzadeh married Azerbaijani philanthropist and feminist-activist [[Hamida Javanshir]]. He died in [[Baku]] in 1932, aged 65.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Literature==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Mammadguluzadeh wrote in various genres, including [[short stories]], [[novels]], [[essays]], and [[dramatics]]. His first significant short story, "The Disappearance of the Donkey" (part of his ''Stories from the village of Danabash'' series), written in 1894 and published in 1934, touched upon social inequality. In his later works (''The Postbox'', ''The Iranian Constitution'', ''Gurban Ali bey'', ''The Lamb'', etc.), as well as in his famous comedies ''The Corpses'' and ''The Madmen Gathering'' he ridiculed corruption, snobbery, ignorance, religious fanaticism, etc.

==Religious views==
Mammadguluzadeh's religious views have been disputed. Some sources {{clarify|date=October 2016}} claim he was an [[atheist]] while others {{which|date=October 2016}} claim he supported [[Islamic democracy|Muslim democracy]] while being critical of extremism and ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calilbook.musigi-dunya.az/adebi_mc1.html Mammadguluzadeh profile], Calilbook.musigi-dunya.az; accessed 5 October 2016.{{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his harsh criticism of religion he was sometimes threatened with death by extremists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulis.az/xeber_Arxadak%C4%B1_Az%C9%99rbaycan__4815.html Arxadaki Azerbaycan], Kulis.az; accessed 25 October 2016.{{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enyeniedebiyat.com/2009/06/06/a287alar_m601mm601dovmentalitetimizin_disfunksionall305287305.html Dysfunctionality of Our Mentality - Agalar Mammadov], Enyeniedebiyat.com, 6 June 2009; accessed 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A drama theatre in Nakhchivan, a street in Baku, the city of [[Jalilabad]] (formerly Astrakhan-Bazaar) and the town of [[Jalilkand]] (former Bash-Norashen) were all named for him.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Krasnyi Luch''' ({{Lang-ru|Красный Луч}}) or '''Khrustalny''' ({{Lang-uk|Хрустальний}}) is a [[city]] in the [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) of south-eastern [[Ukraine]], currently controlled by the [[Lugansk People's Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204211939/http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 February 2016|title=Численность населения по состоянию на 1  октября  2015 года по  Луганской Народной Республ ике|publisher=[[Luhansk People's Republic]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]]. Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2017|81,389}}.

==History==
The town was founded as '''Krindachyovka''' at the beginning of the 20th century, and renamed as Krasnyi Luch (lit. "red beam") in 1920. The city became one of the most important [[coal mining]] centres of the [[Donets Basin]].
The city was under German occupation from 1942 to 1944. The Jews were thrown in and killed with other categories of victims, such as the Communists, in the well of the Bogdan coal mine. Total number of victims was about 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahadmap.org/#village/krasnyi-luch-luhansk-ukraine.143|title=YAHAD - IN UNUM|author=|date=|website=yahadmap.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|decommunization laws]] the city was renamed on 12 May 2016 by the [[Ukrainian parliament]] to Khrustalny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32267075 Goodbye, Lenin: Ukraine moves to ban communist symbols], [[BBC News]] (14 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/342825.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On the right is a picture of the Wall of Honor. Such walls were installed in every [[oblast]] seat throughout the [[Soviet Union]]. With the dissolution of the Soviet state those landmarks were mostly removed, but in some instances were retained as the relics of the past.

Light heavyweight fighter [[Nikita Krylov]] originates from Krasnyi Luch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.sovsport.ru/gazeta/article-item/834461|title=I am Russian but competitor for Ukraine|work=m.sovsport.ru/|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1943, the well-known [[WWII]] fighter pilot [[Lydia Litvyak]] took off from a base at Krasnyy Luch, to the last mission from which she never came back.

'''Leonard''' "'''Len'''" '''Lawlor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɔː|l|ər}}; born November 2, 1954)&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress authority record, [[LCCN]] [http://lccn.loc.gov/n92035822 n 92035822] (accessed April 27, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; is Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Pennsylvania State University]]. He specializes in nineteenth- and twentieth-century [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Faculty Page"&gt;[http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/faculty/profiles/lawlor.shtml Penn State University Faculty Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414220350/http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/faculty/profiles/Lawlor.shtml |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Lawlor received his doctorate from [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|SUNY Stony Brook]] in 1988 and taught at the [[University of Memphis]] from 1989–2008, where he held the position of Faudree-Hardin University Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2008 before joining the faculty at Penn State, as Sparks Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Faculty Page 2"&gt;[https://umdrive.memphis.edu/lrlawlor/www/index.htm University of Memphis Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his writings on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and on the figures [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Jean Hippolyte]]. Lawlor's most recent work concerns transcendental violence and possible responses to it. His recent ''From Violence to Speaking Out'' takes up the question of responses to violence. Although ''From Violence to Speaking Out'' contains precise expositions of important ideas in Derrida, Deleuze, and Foucault, it is an original work of philosophy, extending ideas found in his 2007 ''This is not Sufficient''. Somewhat disguised by the expositions, ''From Violence to Speaking Out'' is primarily a work in ethics.

[[File:Nude pet slave girl.jpg|thumb|A submissive woman is paraded nude at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. She is wearing a [[leash]], one end of which is held by her master.|alt=]]

In [[BDSM]], '''Master/slave''', '''M/s''' or '''sexual slavery''' is a relationship in which one individual serves another in an authority-exchange structured relationship. Unlike [[Dominance and submission|Dominant]]/[[Submission|submissive]] structures found in BDSM in which love is often the core value, [[servant|service]] and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] are often the core values in Master/slave structures.{{sfn|Rubel|2014}} The participants may be of any [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The relationship uses the term "slave" because of the association of the term with [[ownership]] rights of a master to their slave's body, as [[property]] or chattel. While male "masters" will usually be referred to as "Master", whether or not female Masters are referred to as "Master" or "Mistress" may depend upon whether they identify as following the [[leather subculture]] or BDSM path, or simply preference.{{sfn|Rubel|2014}}{{rp|27–30}}


Sexual slavery in a BDSM context is both a [[sexual fantasy]] and [[sexual roleplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Addington| first = Deborah| title = Fantasy Made Flesh: The Essential Guide to Erotic Roleplay| edition = 1st| year = 1993| publisher = Greenery Press| isbn = 978-1-890159-47-4| postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slave master or mistress might be any person or group, though the majority of such relationships are usually either one dominant, or a committed dominant couple, owning one or more slaves. A sex slave and the owner, and others involved in the relationship, can be of any gender, sexual identity, or orientation.&lt;ref name=Snitow1983 &gt;{{citation | last=Snitow | first=Ann Barr | year=1983 | title=Powers of desire : the politics of sexuality | last2=Stansell | first2=Christine | last3=Thompson | first3=Sharon | publisher=Monthly Review Press | series=New feminist library | isbn=978-0-85345-610-0 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9759530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Master/slave (or [[Ownership|Owner]]/[[property]]) relationship is entered into on a [[Consent|consensual]] basis, without the legal force of historical or modern non-consensual [[slavery]], that is forbidden by the laws of most countries.

==Terminology==
[[File:The Gor Project 1 by mjranum stock.jpg|thumb|left|Model dressed as the fictional slave-girl [[Kajira]] from [[John Norman]]'s [[Gor]] novels]]
The term "sex slave" is used rather than just "slave" because sex is not a necessary component of consensual slavery. In BDSM, a slave is a specific type of submissive. Not all submissives are slaves, though all slaves would normally be considered submissive in the relationship.
However some calling themselves 'slave' may only be submissive within a sexual context/activity whilst others are also submissive within other or all aspects of the relationship, 'sex-slave' or 'slave' respectively.

==Slave==
Outside the [[BDSM]] community, the relationship of Master/slave is sometimes regarded as a form of [[Consent|consensual]] sexual slavery. In BDSM, a [[Slavery|slave]] is a specific type of [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]]. The Master/slave relationship refers to the relationship between the individuals involved, and does not necessarily require any specific acts, sexual or otherwise, though sexual activity is usually an aspect of the relationship. The sexual aspect could be [[conventional sex|conventional]], and not necessarily BDSM. A slave could also be a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] or [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]], but this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Baldwin (2002). ''SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude&amp;nbsp;– Principles, Skills and Tools.'' Daedelus Publishing Co. pp. 57–62. {{ISBN|1-881943-14-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some participants regard the relationship as [[sexual roleplay]], while others enter into the relationship on the basis of a highly committed, long-term, [[submissive]] [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].

==Symbols and rituals==

Various forms of symbolism are sometimes used to affirm the owner/slave relationship. These include wearing the owner's [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]], being registered in a slave register, adopting (sometimes legally changing to) a name chosen by the owner, or engaging in a public declaration or ritualized ceremony of some type.

Some people draw up a [[Contract (BDSM)|slave contract]] that defines the relationship in explicit detail.  These contracts may also deal with domestic arrangements (such as cleanliness, home duties) and [[interpersonal relationship]] matters (such as issues of deference, language, etc.), besides the sexual arrangements. Typically, they would provide that the Master has the exclusive authority in all matters relating to the body and behavior of the slave, including underwear and other clothing, social relations outside of the arrangement, etc. Although such contracts are not enforceable in the ways legal contracts are, they can be useful for defining in written form the limits of the arrangement between the signatories, and for documenting the consensuality of the relationships they define between them.&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/your-rights-as-a-pup/  |title=A Pup Bill of Rights |work=Sirius Pup|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some traditional rituals, after signing a slave contract, the commitment to the relationship is celebrated by a collaring ceremony, which can be simple or elaborate, often witnessed by invited friends. The slave then wears a [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]] to publicly declare the slave's subjugation and the Master's ownership. Such a collar may be a piece of [[neckwear]], or may be a bracelet or other piece of jewelery that symbolizes slave status. Such a collar is generally not removed except for practical reasons such as medical or security requirements, unless or until the relationship is dissolved; however, a slave is sometimes permitted to wear a more subdued (or less obtrusive) one outside of the home&amp;nbsp;— for example during work or in social situations with people who may otherwise feel uncomfortable.

==Slave training==

'''Slave training''' is a [[BDSM]] activity usually involving a consensual [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] between two people taking on the roles of a [[Master (BDSM)|Master]] or [[Dominatrix|Mistress]] and a slave. The objective is to change the slave's behavior in a manner that is pleasing to the Master or Mistress, for example to train the slave to follow a set of rules or commands that the Master or Mistress has provided.

Some Masters adopt a holistic approach to the maintenance and long-term development of their slave by using such models as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]].

Depending on the relationship, one or more lesson plans may also involve some forms of aversion training.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} This could include use of spanking, physical restraints, or clamping to encourage compliance, and to provide the slave with a specific reason to comply. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} If the trainee is also a masochist, the aversion to physical pain may be lacking, in which case psychological or emotional discomfort may be employed to create the unpleasant result that punishment requires.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Nature of the relationship==
[[File:Nude pet girl.jpg|thumb|upright|As seen here, master and slave can be of the same gender. Photo shows a dominant female parading a nude pet female (who is held by a dog [[leash]] and is crawling) at [[Folsom Street Fair]].]]

Sexual slavery is a consensual [[Power exchange (BDSM)|exchange of power]] by the submissive to the dominant, though the scope of the surrender of discretion may be limited and may be withdrawn at any time.

The types of activities that the sex slave may be expected to perform are usually defined in advance and sometimes spelled out in a [[Contract (BDSM)|slave contract]], a document without real value that outlines the desires, limits, and expectations of the parties. The sex slave is often expected to perform sexually, though typically many relationship-oriented dynamics are also clearly negotiated, including clothing, diet, speech restrictions, household affairs and schedules, though the details may be left to the master or mistress. Typically outlined are clear expectations of whether the couple will be [[Monogamy|monogamous]] or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and if there would be permission or expectation of sexual interaction with other people. Otherwise, a sex slave may be expected to perform many of the same functions that are expected of a slave/submissive, including wearing very revealing clothes, being shared, wearing a [[Collar (BDSM)|slave collar]] or leash, [[Sadomasochism |S&amp;M activities]], or [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].&lt;ref name=slave2002 &gt;{{citation | last=slave | first=Grateful | year=2002 | title=SlaveCraft : roadmaps for consensual erotic servitude : principles, skills, and tools | last2=Baldwin | first2=Guy | last3=Bean | first3=Joseph W | publisher=Daedalus Pub. Co | isbn=978-1-881943-14-3 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50758803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Master &amp; slave "relationship" is normally a long-term relationship, comparable in duration to normal relationships whereas a Dominant - submissive "relationship" could be of a similar duration or shorter from a few minutes, as in a scene.

In [[Hebrew]], [[verb]]s, which take the form of [[derived stems]], are conjugated to reflect their [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], as well as to [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their [[subject (linguistics)|subjects]] in [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical person|person]]. Each verb has an inherent [[grammatical voice|voice]], though a verb in one voice typically has counterparts in other voices. This article deals mostly with Modern Hebrew, but to some extent, the information shown here applies to Biblical Hebrew as well.

==Classification of roots==
Verbs in Hebrew, like nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are formed and declined by altering a (usually) three letter root. However, the root can be identified as having a different pattern than normal in certain cases.

A [[Semitic root|root]] that contains at least one of the "weak" letters {{hebrew|א}} [[aleph|alef]], {{hebrew|ה}} [[he (letter)|hey]], {{hebrew|ו}} [[Waw (letter)|vav]], {{hebrew|ח}} [[heth|het]], {{hebrew|י}} [[Yodh|yod]], {{hebrew|נ}} [[nun (letter)|nun]], and {{hebrew|ע}} '[[ayin]] or two of the same consonant ([[Gemination|geminates]]) is called a ''weak'' root. Each pairing of a weak letter with a position results in a slightly different [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] pattern. [[Resh]] ר is often considered a weak letter, though it occasionally functions as a strong letter, depending on speaker and era of the language. Roots without weak letters are called ''strong'' roots, among other names.

A root that contains {{hebrew|ח}} [[heth|het]], {{hebrew|ה}} [[he (letter)|hey]] (except in third position without [[mappiq]]), or {{hebrew|ע}} '[[ayin]] or {{hebrew|א}} [[aleph|alef]] (in first position only) is a ''guttural root''. The pattern changes from this group are largely due to all of these letters being unable to take [[Shva|schwa]] nah. Alef outside of first position is in its own group due to the vowel changes that accompany it being drastically different than other guttural roots. A root that contains {{hebrew|ה}} [[he (letter)|hey]] word-finally without mappiq is also similarly divergent from guttural roots, due to being a marker of vowel-final words rather than any historical consonant.

A root that contains a {{hebrew|ו}} [[vav (letter)|vav]] or a {{hebrew|י}} [[yodh|yod]] as the first or second letter is called a ''hollow root'', as the simple (pa'al and nif'al) conjugation function as two-letter roots, while the other conjugations keep the letters somewhat due to the middle root being geminated. A root beginning with yod usually marks a waw-initial root (due to Old Hebrew {{IPA|/w/}} becoming {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of words), but occasionally functions as if it a regular yod root.

A root containing {{hebrew|נ}} [[nun (letter)|nun]] is irregular due to the fact it will form [[Gemination|geminated]] consonants rather than clusters of it. Roots containing two of the same consonant as the second and third part of the root function similarly.

Roots of four or more letters treat the middle letters as a permanent cluster and don't have forms in the simple conjugations pa'al and nif'al, but are regular otherwise.

There are also entirely irregular verbs like הָיָה ("to be"), and הָלַךְ ("to walk"), which are unusual beyond their bearing of weak letters.

==Binyanim or conjugations==
Hebrew verbs are conjugated according to specific patterns, [[derived stems]], called בִּנְיָנִים ({{IPA|/binjaˈnim/}} – ''binyanim'', "constructions") where vowels patterns and affixes are slotted into the (usually) three-letter שרשים ({{IPA|/ʃoraˈʃim/}} – ''shorashim'', "roots") from which the majority of Hebrew words are built.

There are seven basic conjugations and a very rare eighth ''hitpu'al'', as well as some irregular verbs technically pa'al, nif'al or pi'el being used irregularly without necessarily a weak root (due to being descendants of obsolete conjugation or confluence between multiple conjugations). The traditional demonstration root is {{hebrew|פ.ע.ל}}, which has the basic meaning of "action" or "doing":

This '''simplified''' chart's [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]-like shape is sometimes invoked in teaching the binyanim to help students remember the main ideas about the binyanim: (1) which binyanim are [[active voice]] (left side) vs. [[passive voice]] (right side), and (2) which binyanim are simple (outer-most menorah branches), [[intensive]] (second-outer-most), [[causative]] (third-outer-most), and [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] (center). Note that some binyanim have more than one meaning.

Examples:
*In Hebrew (and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), many words that have a meaning related to [[writing]] contain the root K-T-B. (In Hebrew, due to a process called [[begadkefat]], when the letter B does not come at the beginning of a word, it may sound like a V. The same thing happens with K and Ḥ.) Thus:
** "he wrote" (simple active voice) is כָּתַב {{IPA|/kaˈtav/}}, while "it was written" (simple passive voice) is נִכְתַּב {{IPA|/nixˈtav/}}
** "he dictated" (causative active v.) is הִכְתִּיב {{IPA|/hixˈtiv/}}, while "it was dictated" (causative passive v.) is הֻכְתַּב {{IPA|/huxˈtav/}}
** כִּתֵּב {{IPA|/kiˈtːev/}} and כֻּתַּב {{IPA|/kuˈtːav/}} have a few meanings, none of which is commonly used, while "he corresponded" (intensive-reflexive) is הִתְכַּתֵּב {{IPA|/hitkaˈtːev/}}
** "he rewrote" is שִׁכְתֵּב {{IPA|/ʃixˈtev/}}, while "it was rewritten" is שֻׁכְתַּב {{IPA|/ʃuxˈtav/}} (though these two rare binyanim are used only with a few roots and thus are omitted from most of the discussion within this article).
* In Hebrew, many words that have a meaning related to [[cloth]]ing contain the root לב״ש L-B-SH (in Arabic, لبس L-B-S). When this root is put through the seven common binyanim, it changes its meaning similarly to the way the root כת״ב K-T-B does, but with a small difference. Here, the intensive reflexive form, הִתְלַבֵּשׁ {{IPA|/hitlaˈbːesh/}}, does not connote reciprocity as with "he corresponded", so the meaning is "he dressed himself", not "he dressed the person who dressed him".
* The root גד״ל G-D-L is common to words related to growth. Thus:
** "he grew up" (simple act, either active or passive) is גָּדַל {{IPA|/ɡaˈdal/}}; the {{IPA|/nifˈʕal/}} binyan is not used with this root
** "he enlarged" is הִגְדִּיל {{IPA|/hiɡˈdil/}}, while "it was enlarged" is הֻגְדַּל {{IPA|huɡˈdal}}
** "he grew apples" (intensive, active) is גִּדֵּל תַּפּוּחִים {{IPA|/ɡiˈdːel tapːuˈħim/}}, while "the apples were grown" (intensive, passive) is גֻּדְּלוּ הַתַּפּוּחִים {{IPA|/ɡudːəˈlu hatːapːuˈħim/}}, and the intensive-reflexive form of this root (הִתְגַּדֵּל {{IPA|/hitɡaˈdːel/}}) is used almost exclusively in [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] prayers.

As mentioned, some binyanim have more than one meaning. For example, הִפְעִיל {{IPA|/hifˈʕil/}}'s second most common meaning is "become". Verbs like "became fat" (הִשְׁמִין {{IPA|/hiʃˈmin/}}) and "turned pale" (הֶחְוִיר {{IPA|/heħˈvir/}}) are in this binyan. This meaning of הִפְעִיל {{IPA|/hifˈʕil/}} is similar to that of the Arabic ninth derived stem, افعلّ {{IPA|/ifʕalla/}}, while הִפְעִיל {{IPA|/hifˈʕil/}}'s main meaning is shared with its Arabic historical equivalent, the fourth derived stem, أفعل {{IPA|/afʕala/}}.

==Present Tense (Present Participle)==
A verb in the present tense ({{hebrew|הוֹוֶה}} {{IPA|/hoˈve/}}) agrees with its subject in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), so each verb has four present-tense forms:

The present tense does not inflect by first, second, or third person because its use as a present tense is a relatively recent trend, as this form was originally used only as the [[participle]]. The modern present tense verb is ''still'' used as the present participle; see below.

The ancient language did not have strictly defined past, present, or future tenses, but merely perfective and imperfective aspects, with past, present, or future connotation depending on context.  Later the perfective and imperfective aspects were explicitly refashioned as the past and future tenses respectively, with the participle standing in as the present tense.  (This also happened to the [[Aramaic language]] around the same time, but did not happen in Arabic, where the present and future tenses still share the same morphology, the one equivalent to the Hebrew future tense. The future tense is distinguished from the present tense by the use of prefixes.)

==Past Tense (Past/Perfect)==
A verb in the past tense ({{hebrew|עָבָר}} {{IPA|ʕaˈvar}}) agrees with its subject in person (first, second, or third) and number, and in the second-person singular and plural and third-person singular, gender.

Note that the past/perfect and the present/participle inflections of the third-person singular nif'al were historically pronounced with different vowels in the final syllable&amp;mdash;the past/perfect with a {{IPA|paˈtaħ}} (&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|ַ}}&amp;nbsp; = {{IPA|/ɐː/}}), and the present/participle with a {{IPA|kaˈmats ɡaˈdol}} (&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|ָ}}&amp;nbsp; = {{IPA|/ɔː/}}).  In Modern Hebrew, both of these vowels have merged to {{IPA|/a/}}, and the two verb forms now are pronounced the same.  For example, the past tense {{hebrew|נִשְׁמַר}} {{IPA|niʃˈmar}} means "he was guarded" (or in old-fashioned perfective "he is/was guarded"), whereas the present tense {{hebrew|נִשְׁמָר}} {{IPA|niʃˈmar}} means "he is being guarded".

==Future Tense (Unpast/ Imperfect)==
A verb in the future tense ({{hebrew|עָתִיד}} {{IPA|/ʕaˈtid/}}) agrees with its subject in person and number, and in the second- and third-person singular, gender. The second-person singular masculine and third-person singular feminine forms are identical for all verbs in the future tense. Historically, there have been separate feminine forms for the second- and third-person plural (shown in parentheses on the table). These are still occasionally used today (most often in formal settings), and could be seen as the 'correct' forms. However, in everyday speech, most Israelis use the historically male form for both genders.

As in the past tense, personal pronouns are not strictly necessary in the future tense, as the verb forms are sufficient to identify the subject, but they are frequently used.

|+ Example conjugations in the imperative.
|}
Except for the strictly passive binyaním ({{IPA|puˈʕal}} and {{IPA|hufˈʕal}}), each binyan has distinct imperative forms in the second person. This imperative form is only used for affirmative commands. The pa'al, nif'al, pi'el and hif'il form their imperatives by dropping the initial ת [[tav (letter)|taw]] of the future-tense form (e.g., {{hebrew|תִּפְתַּח}} {{IPA|/tifˈtaħ/}} (singular, masc.) → {{hebrew|פְּתַח}} {{IPA|/ˈpətaħ/}} "open!", {{hebrew|תִּשְׁמְרִי}} {{IPA|/tiʃməˈri/}} (singular, fem.) → {{hebrew|שִׁמְרִי}} {{IPA|/ʃimˈri/}} "guard!"); the fifth, hitpa'el, forms its imperative by replacing this initial {{hebrew|ת}} with {{hebrew|ה}} ({{IPA|/titbaˈtːel/}} → {{IPA|/hitbaˈtːel/}} "do nothing!"). (Note that the dropping of the initial ת often results in a change in vocalization, as can be seen in the instance of {{IPA|/tiʃməˈri/}} vs. {{IPA|/ʃ'''i'''mˈri/}}).

Negative commands use the particle {{hebrew|אַל}} {{IPA|/ʔal/}} followed by the future-tense form. For example, {{hebrew|אַל תִּדְאַג}} {{IPA|/ʔal tidʔaɡ/}} means "don't worry" (masculine, singular).

In informal speech, the future tense is commonly used for affirmative commands when making requests. Thus for example, {{hebrew|תִּפְתַּח}} {{IPA|/tifˈtaħ/}} can mean either "you will open" or "would you open" (masculine, singular). (Similarly in English one might say "would you open" or "could you open" in lieu of simply "open".) In Hebrew, as in English, the more formal way to avoid the implication of commanding is to use the word "please" ({{hebrew|בְּבַקָּשָׁה}} {{IPA|/bə-vakːaʃa/}}) with the imperative.

The infinitive can be used as a "general imperative" when addressing nobody in particular (e.g., on signs, or when giving general instructions to children or large groups), so that for example, {{hebrew|נָא לֹא לִפְתֹּחַ}} {{IPA|/ˈna ˈlo lifˈtoaħ/}} means "please do not open". This might be more literally rendered as "it is requested that [this] not be opened", avoiding the question of address by using a passive voice.

==Participles==
Present participles are identical to present tense forms (the modern present tense actually having been derived from the ancient present participle): {{hebrew|נֵרוֹת בּוֹעֲרִים}} {{IPA|/neˈrot boʕaˈrim/}} (burning candles), {{hebrew|יַלְדָּה מַקְסִימָה}} {{IPA|/jalˈda maksiˈma/}} (charming girl).

Only the pa'al binyan has a true past participle: from {{hebrew|כתב}} k-t-b we have {{hebrew|כָּתוּב}} {{IPA|/kaˈtuv/}}, (writ, written). For verbs that have a pa'al form and a nif'al form serving as its passive, this provides a means to distinguish between a completed and a continuing action. The pa'al past participle indicates completion:

*{{hebrew|הַסְּפָרִים כְּתוּבִים}} {{IPA|/hasː(ə)faˈrim k(ə)tuˈvim/}} (the books are written)

while the present tense of nif'al indicates that the action continues:

*{{hebrew|הַסְּפָרִים נִכְתָּבִים}} {{IPA|/hasː(ə)faˈrim nixtaˈvim/}} (the books are being written)

The passive participle is commonly used as an adjective, as in {{hebrew|הַפְּקֻדָּה הַכְּתוּבָה}} {{IPA|/hapː(ə)kuˈd:a hakː(ə)tuˈva/}} (the written order).

The present tense of the pu'al and huf'al are used as passive participles for the pi'el and hif'il respectively. For example, from hif'il {{hebrew|הֵאִיר}} {{IPA|/heˈʔir/}} (lit) we get {{hebrew|חֶדֶר מוּאָר}} {{IPA|/ˈħeder muˈʔar/}} (lit room).

==Infinitives (Prospectives)==
Infinitives ({{IPA|/ʃəˈmot hapːoˈʕal/}}) in Hebrew are primarily formed by adding the letter lamed (ל) to the front of the base form ({{IPA|/t͡suˈrat hamːaˈkor/}}). The vowels change systematically according to the binyan.

*{{hebrew|כָּתַב}} {{IPA|/kaˈtav/}} (wrote, {{IPA|paʕal}}) → {{hebrew|לִכְתֹּב}} {{IPA|/lixˈtov/}} (to write)
*{{hebrew|מְדַבֵּר}} {{IPA|/mədaˈb:er/}} (speak, {{IPA|piʕel}}) → {{hebrew|לְדַבֵּר}} {{IPA|/lədaˈbːer/}} (to speak)
*{{hebrew|הִתְחִיל}} {{IPA|/hitˈħil/}} (started, {{IPA|hifʕil}}) → {{hebrew|לְהַתְחִיל}} {{IPA|/ləhatˈħil/}} (to start)
*{{hebrew|הִתְפַּלֵּל}} {{IPA|/hitpaˈlːel/}} (prayed, {{IPA|hitpaʕel}}) → {{hebrew|לְהִתְפַּלֵּל}} {{IPA|/ləhitpaˈlːel/}} (to pray)
*{{hebrew|נִפְגַשׁ}} {{IPA|/nifˈɡaʃ/}} (met with, {{IPA|nifʕal}}) → {{hebrew|לְהִפָּגֵשׁ}} {{IPA|/ləhipːaˈɡeʃ/}} (to meet with)

Note that {{IPA|puʕal}} and {{IPA|hufʕal}} verbs do not have infinitives.

==Gerunds==
Gerunds ({{IPA|ʃəˈmot pəʕuˈla}}) are nouns expressing an action. Gerunds are created in Hebrew by putting the root of a verb into a {{IPA|miʃˈkal}}, a noun pattern (''see'' [[Modern Hebrew grammar#Noun derivation]]). Five of the binyanim have gerunds: {{IPA|paʕal}}, {{IPA|piʕel}}, {{IPA|hifʕil}}, {{IPA|hitpaʕel}}, and {{IPA|nifʕal}}. For example:

*{{hebrew|שָׁמַר}} {{IPA|/ʃaˈmar/}} (''guarded'' — {{IPA|paˈʕal}}) → {{hebrew|שְׁמִירָה}} {{IPA|/ʃ(ə)miˈra/}} (''guarding, a watch'')
**{{hebrew|שָׁב}} {{IPA|/ˈʃav/}} (''returned'' — hollow {{IPA|paʕal}}) → {{hebrew|שִׁיבָה}} {{IPA|/ʃiˈva/}} (''returning'', ''a return'')
**{{hebrew|שָׁתָה}} {{IPA|/ʃaˈta/}} (''drank'' — final hey {{IPA|paʕal}}) → {{hebrew|שְׁתִיָּה}} {{IPA|/ʃ(ə)tiˈjːa/}} (''drinking'', ''a drink'')
*{{hebrew|נִכְנַס}} {{IPA|/nixˈnas/}} (''enter'' — {{IPA|nifʕal}}) → {{hebrew|הִכָּנְסוּת}} {{IPA|/hikːanˈsut/}} (''entering, an entrance'')
*{{hebrew|בִּקֵּר}} {{IPA|/biˈkːer/}} (''visited'' — {{IPA|piʕel}}) → {{hebrew|בִּקּוּר}} {{IPA|/biˈkːur/}} (''visiting'', ''a visit'')
*{{hebrew|הִפְתִּיעַ}} {{IPA|/hifˈtiaʕ/}} (''surprised'' — {{IPA|hifʕil}}) → {{hebrew|הַפְתָעָה}} {{IPA|/haftaˈʕa/}} (''surprising'', ''a surprise'')
*{{hebrew|הִתְחַמֵּם}} {{IPA|/hitħaˈmːem/}} (''warmed'' — {{IPA|hitpaʕel}}) → {{hebrew|הִתְחַמְּמוּת}} {{IPA|/hitħamːəˈmut/}} (''warming'')

Note that unlike in English (where gerunds and present participles share the same form but different etymology), Hebrew gerunds cannot be used as adjectives.

==Conditional==
Modern Hebrew has an analytic [[conditional mood|conditional]]~[[Habitual aspect|past-habitual mood]] expressed with the auxiliary {{IPA|/haˈja/}}:

{|style="text-align:center;white-space:nowrap"
|style="border:1px solid silver"|

'''Mysore Suryanarayana Bhatta Puttanna''' (ಎಂ.ಎಸ್. ಪುಟ್ಟಣ್ಣ) was one of the authors of [[Kannada literature]] noted for introducing [[Kannada]] in prose form to a wider audience. Kannada had largely fallen out of use in classical form and usage as an official language which was attributed to the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] when Urdu was used. Thus in the late 19th century, Kannada was mainly used in matters of commerce and personal communication. He was involved in its cultural resurrection during the late 19th and early 20th century.

His literary works include first translations of major works in English to Kannada such as [[The History of Sandford and Merton]] by [[Thomas Day]], [[Hamlet]] and [[King Lear]].

==Early life==
M.S. Puttanna (Mysore Suryanarayana Bhatta Puttanna) was born on 21 November 1854 in Mysore, Kingdom of Mysore, as a member of the [[Hoysala]] Karnataka [[Brahmin]] caste to Suryanarayana and Lakshamma in the parental home of his mother. His given birth name was Lakshmi Narasimha Sastry, but he became known as Puttanna (translates to 'younger big brother') by those around him.

==Education==
M.S. Puttanna was educated at home in Mysore by a private Panth teacher. Later he joined the Raja School, which was subsequently renamed [[Maharaja's College, Mysore]] after its chief patron, [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]] the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. There he passed the F.A. (First Arts) examination which is the equivalent of present-day pre-university.

After working as a teacher he was admitted to [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], Madras. He graduated from college in 1885 with a Bachelors in Arts degree majoring in [[Ethics]] and [[Logic]].

==Career==
M.S. Puttanna began his career in [[Kolar]] High School in 1878 teaching literature. He was granted a transfer to his alma mater, Raja School Mysore, where he resumed teaching. While teaching at the Raja School he enrolled in classes towards his BA in Ethics and Logic.

After graduating from college in 1885, he left his teaching post and took a job as a court translator in the Chief Court of the Kingdom of Mysore, known today as the High Court of Mysore, translating legal documents from English to Kannada and vice versa. He held this job until 1897.

In 1897 he was appointed to be the [[Amildar]](administrator of a group of villages) in the [[Taluk]] of [[Chitradurga]], Kingdom of Mysore. He later served in the capacity of Amildar in the Mysore Taluks of [[Nelamangala]], [[Chamrajnagar]], Bagepalli, Mulabagal and Hosadurga.

While serving as Amildar and advocate, M.S. Puttanna began his literary career around the end of the 19th century. M.S. Puttanna authored 29 works of Kannada literature. His works are associated with the two prominent phases of Kannada literature. One was 'Arunodaya' (pre-renaissance) and the other, 'Navodaya' (renaissance) which overlapped in his lifetime. In addition to his commitment to full-time authorship, he served as editor and contributing author to a monthly literary journal called 'Hitha Bodhini' which loosely translates to 'Teaching the Good' or 'Wise Counsel’.

In Kannada literature he is known to be one of the pioneers of the use of colloquial or common language, effectively broadening the appeal of the language to a wider readership. He was the first Kannada author to record in a [[biography]], the life of a local Kannadiga personage, Kunigal Rama Sastry. He was also the first to translate the works of Thomas Day and William Shakespeare from English to Kannada. He translated '[[The Adventures of Hatim Tai]]' by [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]] (originally written in 1824). Together with his friend H.V. Nanjundaiah, M.S. Puttanna worked for the founding of the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Institute) in [[Chamrajpet]], Bangalore and served as its first secretary.

Based on his prior experience as Amildar, he worked as a secretary for the ‘Ratepayers Association’ (equivalent of today's Tax Revenue Board) preparing reports and chairing meetings held in Kannada. He also supported [[equality before the law|equal rights]] for all in the Kingdom of Mysore and demonstrated this by personally honoring a select group of soldiers from all [[castes]] at his home in [[Basavanagudi]], Bangalore  (where a street is named for him) on their return from action in Europe after the [[Great War]].

==Death==
M.S. Puttanna died at age 76 in Bangalore, Kingdom of Mysore in 1930.

Nyaheun speakers were formerly distributed in the Senamnoy and Sepian valleys, but due to logging and hydroelectric power projects, they were forcibly relocated to Ban Tayeukseua (Tagneugsua; about 10&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Houeikong), and a new village 8&amp;nbsp;km north of Houeikong (near Ban Thongvay) (Sidwell 2003:21).

==Alternate names==
Nyaheun is known by many alternate names including Nhaheun, Nhahem, Nya Hoen, Nia-Heun, Nyah Heuny, Gya Hon, Nahoen, Hoen, Honh, Hun, Hin, Iahoun, Nya Hön, Nyah Heuny, Nha Heun, Yaheun, and Nyahon.

A '''receiving house''' (sometimes called a '''roadhouse''') is a [[theatre]] which does not produce its own repertoire but instead receives [[Concert tour|tour]]ing theatre companies, usually for a brief period such as three nights or a full week. The incoming company may receive a share of the [[box office]] takings or a minimum [[guarantee]]d payment.

[[West End theatre]]s in [[London]] and most [[Broadway theatre]]s in New York are also receiving houses, as the venue solely provides facilities to the incoming show even though the production may stay for many years.

Theatres which produce their own shows are known as [[producing house]]s, and some regional theatres will do both.

==Biography==

Risdeard was a member of the Ó Conchubhair medical family of [[Leinster]], who were themselves a branch of the Ó Connchubhair Failghe dynasty, rulers of the [[Kingdom of Uí Failghe]].

In one surviving [[manuscript]] - now [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] MS 439 (3 C 19) - he gives his genealogy, text title, patron, place and date of writing:

''Finis. I am Richard, son of Muircheartach, son of Tadhg, son of Muircheartach, son of Cathal, son of Murchadh, son of Muircheartach na Cairrge O Conchubhair, who by permission of God wrote this Prognostica of Bernardus, in the school of my kinsman and master, Donnchadh Og O Conchubhair, namely, the chief Master of Medicine of Mac Giollapadraig. And Achadh Mic Airt ^^ is my place of writing. And out of the book of Fearghus Mac Bheathadh ^^ it was transcribed. To-day is April the first, 1590. Jesus. Maria.''[http://digital.nls.uk/early-gaelic-book-collections/pageturner.cfm?id=76714317&amp;mode=transcription]

A 20th-century editor, [[Paul Walsh (priest)]], remarked:

''I have seen but two notices of him outside his own MS., namely, H.2.7, page 345, top margin, where he scribbled a few lines of verse, and added the note : Ag sin duity a Risderd I Betecain od shesi A. Risterd mac Muircertaig ; and in a note in page 349 of the same MS., which I have failed to decipher satisfactorily.''

'''Shiwe''' (''Chiwa, {{IPA|ʃiwə}}, Shiwa, Oshieba, Ossyeba''), also known as "Fang Makina", is a [[Bantu language]] of central Gabon, near the related language [[Yambe language|Yambe]].  It is most closely related to [[Kwasio language|Kwasio]]. The Gabonese people who refer themselves as Shiwe or Bishiwe live in the city of Booué in the Ogooué-Ivindo province. There are no accurate statistics available for the Shiwe population in Booué. However, there are about 18 Shiwe tribes still living in Booué today. These tribes include   Bi-mbouma, Bira-ngouembi, Bi-néli, Sha-ntouong, Sha-nguié, Bi-nshwô, Bi-shanga, Bi-kwo, Bi-tsinguie’rg, Sha-shouo, Bi-nvœ’rg, Bi-koundeu, Biong-nkouendi, Bi-ntoubi, Biékoulembi, Bi-nzimili, Bi-nyambi, Sha-tsoung. These tribes live in 5 villages including Beleumeu, Menchoung, Metououng, Beaux Arts, and Tsombiali. It is important to underline that there are entire Shiwe tribes and villages near Makokou and Ndjole. But these originally Shiwe tribes are now increasingly using more the Fang language than Shiwe.

A '''skyway''', '''skybridge''', or '''skywalk''' is a type of [[pedway]] consisting of an [[Covered bridge|enclosed]] or covered [[footbridge]] between two or more buildings in an [[Urban area|urban]] area. This protects pedestrians from the weather. In North America skyways are usually owned by businesses, and are therefore not [[public space]]s (compare with [[sidewalk]]). However, in Asia, such as Bangkok's and Hong Kong's skywalks, they are built and owned separately by the city government, connecting between privately run rail stations or other transport with their own footbridges, and run many kilometers. Skyways usually connect on the first few floors above the ground-level floor, though they are sometimes much higher, as in [[Petronas Towers]].  The space in the buildings connected by skyways is often devoted to retail business, so areas around the skyway may operate as a [[shopping mall]]. Non-commercial areas with closely associated buildings, such as [[university]] campuses, can often have skyways and/or [[tunnel]]s connecting buildings.

The world's largest discontinuous skyway network – Calgary, Canada's "[[+15|+15 Walkway]]" system – has a total length of {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The [[Minneapolis Skyway System]] is the world's largest continuous system and spans {{convert|11|mi|km}} connecting 80 blocks in downtown Minneapolis.

On a smaller scale, [[Airport terminal|terminals]] of large [[airport]]s are often connected by skywalk systems, as at [[Manchester Airport]], [[United Kingdom]]; in many airports, retractable [[jet bridge]]s provide a direct connection between airplanes and terminals.

Some cities have the equivalent of a skyway underground, and there are also mixed subway/skyway systems; see [[underground city]].

== Early examples ==
* [[Florence]], [[Italy]], [[Vasari Corridor]], connects [[Palazzo Vecchio]] to [[Uffizi]] and then to [[Palazzo Pitti]], 16th century
* [[Venice]], [[Italy]], [[Bridge of Sighs]], connects [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] and prison, 16th century
* [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]: skywalk connecting courts building to adjacent uses, 18th century
* [[Faaborg]], [[Funen]], Denmark: skywalk in centrum, 18th century

== Environmental factors ==
Besides pedestrian safety and convenience, the chief reasons assigned by urban planners for skywalk development are decrease of [[traffic congestion]], reduction in [[roadway air dispersion modeling|vehicular air pollution]] and separation of people from [[roadway noise|vehicular noise]]. A number of cities (for example, Spokane, Washington) have given intricate analysis to skywalk systems employing [[computer simulation|computer model]]s to optimize skywalk layout.&lt;ref&gt;''Carbon monoxide dispersion analysis in downtown Spokane'', [[ESL Incorporated|ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative impacts ==
There is debate about the negative impact on urban areas of skyways. Robertson (1988) noted the negative impacts to street activities, and reductions to the property value at ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=K. A.|date=1988-07-01|title=PEDESTRIAN SKYWALK SYSTEMS: DOWNTOWN'S GREAT HOPE OR PATHWAYS TO RUIN?|url=https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=282855|journal=Transportation Quarterly|volume=42|issue=3|issn=0278-9434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woo (2012) found that skywalk systems could be negatively associated with promoting consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.inpolis.com/2012/07/02/guest-article-skywalks-in-hong-kong-and-their-consequences-on-urban-communities/|title=Guest Article: Skywalks in Hong Kong and their Consequences on Urban Communities|last=Ares|date=2012-07-02|website=Places.|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cui (2015) called for more research into the impact of skyways in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Jianqiang|last2=Allan|first2=Andrew|last3=Lin|first3=Dong|date=2015-06-03|title=Assessing grade separation pedestrian systems: Planning, design and operation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/udi.2015.8|journal=URBAN DESIGN International|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=241–252|doi=10.1057/udi.2015.8|issn=1357-5317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cities with notable systems ==

===North America===
There are significant skyway networks in many cities in the [[Midwest|US Midwest]], such as [[Minneapolis]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Des Moines]], [[Cedar Rapids]], [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], and [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=Michael R.|last2=Bean|first2=Richard|date=1999-01-01|title=Market Failure, Government Failure, and the Private Supply of Public Goods: The Case of Climate-Controlled Walkway Networks|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/kappubcho/v_3A99_3Ay_3A1999_3Ai_3A3-4_3Ap_3A403-37.htm|journal=Public Choice|volume=99|issue=3–4|pages=403–37|issn=0048-5829|doi=10.1023/a:1018301628084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most networks in North America are privately owned. A notable exception in are the [[Saint Paul, MN|Saint Paul]] skyways, which are publicly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2016/04/how-small-request-kicked-big-debate-over-skyways-and-public-safety-st-paul|title=How a small request kicked off a big debate over skyways and public safety in St. Paul|newspaper=MinnPost|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] there are more than 5.4&amp;nbsp;km of covered wide dedicated elevated skywalks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/news/420125/up-above-the-milling-crowd&lt;/ref&gt; with lighting. These were developed due to lack of proper sidewalks as well as street hawkers and local merchants taking advantage of any sidewalk space as makeshift [[commercial real estate]]. Common reasons skywalks were built include to avoid street pollution, dust, wetness from food vendors and/or rain, potholes, long queues, crowds, and uneven pavement, supporting [[urbanism]] but probably most importantly, [[tourism]] receipts.  Most skywalks connect to a [[BTS Skytrain|BTS]] station and utilize space underneath the rail line and BTS pillar supports. These skywalks have connector ramps which connect stations to malls seamlessly and are paid for by the malls themselves, otherwise the city and BTS fund walkway development.  A [http://christao.net/2011/02/24/50km-of-skywalks-to-be-built-in-bangkok/ 50km long extension project] was shelved in 2011 due to funding issues,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thailand-construction.com/bmas-skywalk-project-over-priced/?doing_wp_cron=1435427814.1741809844970703125000&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless the system is growing organically.
[[File:HK Central Elevated Walkway 中區行人天橋 Queen's Road 2 old market building noon.JPG|thumb|Commuters cross [[Queen's Road East|Queen's Road]] on the Hong Kong Central Elevanted Walkway]]
In [[Hong Kong]], there are numerous foot bridge networks across the city. Particularly large networks exists around elevated or at grade [[MTR]] stations and connections between malls and housing estates in [[new town]] centers. The largest network spans [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and parts of [[Sheung Wan]] districts in the CBD and consists of the [[Central Elevated Walkway|Central Elevated]] and [[Central–Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system|Central–Mid-Levels]] Walkway systems which link up over 40 major office buildings. The [[Central–Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system|Central–Mid-Levels walkway system]] is the longest outdoor covered [[escalator]] system in the world according to [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Central–Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system#cite note-stairway-9|[9]]][[Central–Mid-Levels escalator and walkway system#cite note-10|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Other large systems exist in [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Mong Kok]].

The [[Mumbai Skywalk Project]] is a planned discontinuous network of over 50&amp;nbsp;km of skywalks in [[Mumbai|Mumbai Metropolitan Region]], [[India]]. The skyways will connect [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]] stations to important junctions, each 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;km in length. The first of these is a 1.3&amp;nbsp;km (0.8&amp;nbsp;mi) long skywalk connecting the suburban regions of [[Bandra]] and [[Kurla]].&lt;ref name="mmrda-skywalk"&gt;[http://www.mmrdamumbai.org/skywalk.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913090148/http://www.mmrdamumbai.org/skywalk.htm |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-skywalks"&gt;Bellman, Eric.

Additionally, short skyways are used to connect buildings in other locations. This includes a skywalk, 170 m above the ground and 58 m long between the two [[Petronas Twin Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], between the two towers on 41st and 42nd floors, world's highest 2-story bridge. [[Image:Skybridge petronas twin towers kl.jpg|thumb|right|A [[skybridge]] connects the two towers of [[Petronas Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]].]]

===Europe===
[[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] has a skyway between the two [[Belgacom Towers]].

[[London]] has skywalks on the [[Barbican Estate]] and [[London Wall]]. The [[City of London Pedway Scheme]] was devised as part of the post World War II reconstruction plans for London, it was put into effect mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s and eventually abandoned by the 1980s.

'''Southern Uzbek''', also known as ''Afghan Uzbek'', is the southern variant of the [[Uzbek language]] and an official language of Afghanistan where it is based and has up to 4.2 million speakers. It uses the [[Perso-Arabic]] writing system in contrast to the language variant of [[Uzbekistan]]. 

It shares the same [[macrolanguage]] with the northern variant spoken in Uzbekistan and its spoken form is intelligible to the northern variant to a certain degree. However it has differences in grammar and much more loan words from [[Dari language (Afghanistan)|Afghan Persian]], which many of the Southern Uzbek speakers are proficient in. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/uzs|title=Uzbek, Southern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voice tube.jpg|thumb|A speaking tube in use on a United States Navy [[Landing Craft Utility]] (2005)]]
A '''speaking tube''' or '''voicepipe''' is a device based on two [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s connected by an [[air]] pipe through which [[Speech communication|speech]] can be transmitted over an extended distance. While its most common use was in intra-[[ship]] communications, the principle was also used in affluent{{vague|date=November 2013}} homes and offices of the 19th century, as well as expensive {{vague|date=November 2013}} [[automobiles]], military [[aircraft]], and even [[locomotive]]s. For most purposes, the device was outmoded by the [[telephone]] and its widespread adoption. 
==Design==
[[File:1910 aircraft intercom - Two tubes for duplex send and receive.jpg|thumb|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', 21 August 1910.  French air-force ready to deter hostile advances along the eastern frontier, and equipped with intercom - two speaking tubes for full duplex send and receive.]]
Early voicepipes consisted of two cones, of [[wood]] or [[metal]], one end shaped to fit the speaker's mouth, connected to the other which was flared to amplify the sound (specifically to match the [[Impedance matching#Acoustics|impedance of the tube]] to that of the open room). Later designs of the voicepipe inserted a removable cork-mounted whistle, which could be sounded by blowing into the tube from the other end. On naval vessels, this created a distinctive sound associated with urgent intra-ship communication on old warships. The sound of the whistle would summon the listener, who would remove the whistle and answer the call.

Voice pipes could be used over distances as long as {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}}.&lt;ref name="museumretro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/voicepipe/voicepipe.htm | title=Voicepipes and Speaking-Tubes | publisher=The Museum of Retro-Technology | date=15 March 2010 | accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very long speaking tubes might use an electrical signalling device to indicate a call, as the large volume of air in the pipe would make it difficult to blow with enough pressure to sound a whistle at the far end.&lt;ref name="museumretro" /&gt; Despite this, a pipe with a larger internal diameter was desirable for longer runs as the signal loss is inversely proportional to the pipe's cross-sectional area.&lt;ref name="museumretro" /&gt;

Voicepipes have no [[switch]]ing mechanism and so, to provide multiple destinations, separate voicepipes with dedicated transit pipes have to be provided between all pairs of desired endpoints.

The technology continues to be used into the electronic age due to its reliability and low cost. Voice pipes are unaffected by a complete electrical power loss or by an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. Warships built as late as the 1950s continued to incorporate voicepipes alongside more advanced technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Maritime use==

Voice pipes, the maritime term, served to transmit reports from lookout positions aloft to the deck and from the bridge to the steering position and [[engine room]]. These were somewhat larger in diameter than the domestic version and were often covered in sound absorbent material to increase their efficiency.

Copper voice pipes were being fitted to British two and three-deck warships as early as 1803. A notable use was on board [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. ''Victory's'' [[ship's wheel]] was shot away early in the battle. A voice tube was then used to carry steering orders from the [[quarterdeck]] down three decks, to where a gang of sailors operated the ship's [[tiller]] directly using ropes and pulleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=HMS Victory | publisher=Haynes | author=Goodwin, Peter | year=2012 | pages=69 | isbn=9780857330857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of voice pipes is that they may breach the integrity of watertight spaces. This led to the introduction of shut-off valves on both ends of voicepipes to prevent water from a flooded compartment from entering other compartments via its voicepipes.

Permanently fitted, rigid voice pipes are still in use and are generally covered with heavy lids to avoid ingress of water. The speaker has to place his mouth in the "horn" or bell-shaped end of the pipe and the receiver has to 'bend an ear' to hear what is being said.

Voice pipes have generally been replaced by [[sound powered telephone]]s. The speaking tubes on naval ships are used when they are in "clam" mode{{clarify|date=January 2018}} instead of telephones for electronic stealth.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Domestic use==
[[File:Office speaking tubes 1903.jpg|thumb|right|An office in 1903, showing speaking tubes hanging on the end of a desk]]
[[File:Parlophone pneumatique.jpg|thumb|190px|&lt;center&gt;Domestic speaking tube on the sidewalk end. Brussels,(2014) Caption is ''Please listen to the voice-carrier''.]]

In domestic applications, voicepipes were smaller and referred to as "speaking tubes". The ends of the tube were often flexible for convenience of use. The speaking tube supplemented the array of remotely controlled [[hand bell]]s that were operated in the upstairs rooms and rang in the servant's quarters in even modest houses in the 19th century.  The phrase "get on the horn" and "give him a blow" as well as the use of "blower" as a synonym for "telephone" are generally accepted as having their origin in this feature of speaking tubes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Speaking tubes were employed in some offices, with whistles at either end and were therefore also known as '''whistling tubes'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/a/r/Silas-j-Ward/BOOK-0001/0003-0010.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several speaking tubes could be hung from the edge of a desk to communicate with different locations.

Speaking tubes were also used in fine automobiles such as the 1927 Rolls Royce Phantom, allowing communication between the separate passenger and driver's compartments when desired.

==Gosport tube==
A 'Gosport Tube' was a voice tube used by flight instructors in the early days of military aviation to give instructions and directions to their students. It was invented by flying instructor [[Robert Raymond Smith-Barry]] at the School of Special Flying he opened at [[Gosport]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Orange, "Barry, Robert Raymond Smith- (1886–1949)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/72242 accessed 12 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Acoustic tube [[earphones|headphones]] (also called pneumatic earphones or air earphones) are used especially in [[two-way radio]]. These are useful because a clear tube can be used to hide the earphones. They are also sometimes used for the microphone on telephonists headsets and to provide music to patients undergoing an MRI scan, as it would be dangerous to use metal wiring in the scanner's magnetic field.

In Europe, they were installed on the wards of hospitals for a time where the patient's 'radio' was built into the nurse call and lighting control unit. This unit contains an electromagnetic conventional speaker but from there to the patients ears was by tube - presumably so that the part contacting the patient could be easily cleaned. These systems are still in use.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Pneumatic [[intercom]]s can be applied to motorcycle helmets for pilot-passenger communication. Similar systems are common on [[ultralight aviation]] too. They are sometimes preferred over [[bluetooth]] or other radio technologies due to their simplicity and absence of batteries.

Up to the 2000s acoustic tubes were in use in some civil aircraft for movies, audio and other audio broadcasting in-flight entertainments.

The principle of the speaking tube can be found on certain [[playground]] equipment, which employs tubing connecting sound horns or other speaking boxes to allow voices to travel to separate points, for the amusement of the children.

In [[psychology]], '''sublimation''' is a [[Defense mechanism#Level 4: Mature|mature type]] of [[defense mechanism]], in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that sublimation was a sign of [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and [[civilization]], allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being "an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an "important" part in civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, '[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]' (1930) in The Standard Edition Of ''The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud&amp;nbsp;– The Future of an Illusion, Civilization and its Discontents, and Other Works'', trans. by James Strachey (Hogarth Press; London, 1961), vol. XXI, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Wade and Travis present a similar view, stating that sublimation is when [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] "serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions".&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Carol and Carol Travis, ''Psychology'', Sixth Edition (Prentice Hall, 2000) 478. {{ISBN|0-321-04931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
&lt;ref&gt;Walter Arnold Kaufmann, Nietzsche: philosopher, psychologist, Antichrist, Chapter 7, section II, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening section of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' entitled 'Of first and last things', Nietzsche wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Human, All Too Human, by Friedrich Nietzsche.|work=gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Psychoanalytic theory ==
In Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.

Sublimation ({{lang-de|Sublimierung}}) is the process of transforming [[libido]] into "socially useful" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as [[Psychological repression|repression]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[intellectualisation]], and [[Psychological projection|projection]]. In ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (Karnac Books, 2011), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud got the idea of '''sublimation''' while reading ''[[Die Harzreise|The Harz Journey]]'' by [[Heinrich Heine]]. The story is about [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be observed in an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, J.(2009). "Of Snips... and Puppy Dog Tails": Freud's Sublimation of Judentum. American Imago66(2), 169-184. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved April 6, 2012, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal psychoanalysis ===
[[Harry Stack Sullivan]], the pioneer of [[interpersonal psychoanalysis]], defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social approval for the pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.

== Sexual sublimation ==
'''Sexual sublimation''', also known as '''sexual transmutation''', is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or "sexual energy" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the [[transference]] of sexual energy, or [[libido]], into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief. It is based on the idea that "sexual energy" can be used to create a spiritual nature which in turn can create more sensual works, instead of one's sexuality being unleashed "raw".&lt;ref name="Sivananda1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Brahmacharya (Celibacy)|url=http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/brahmacharya.htm|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samael Aun Weor|authorlink=Samael Aun Weor|title=The Transmutation of Sexual Energy|url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=43|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|authorlink=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|title=Cognizantability: Section 2, The Basic Laws of Transmutation|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/mws/mws_cgz_sect-02.html|accessdate=2006-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical example in [[Western religions]] is [[clerical celibacy]].

As espoused in the [[Tanya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Likkutei Amarim Tanya I|last=|first=R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi|publisher=Kehot|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=ch. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic]] Jewish mysticism views sublimation of the animal soul as an essential task in life, wherein the goal is to transform animalistic and earthy cravings for physical pleasure into holy desires to connect with God.

Different schools of thought describe general sexual urges as carriers of spiritual essence, and have the varied names of vital energy, vital winds ([[prana]]), spiritual energy, [[ojas]], [[shakti]], [[tummo]], or [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]]. It is also believed that undergoing sexual sublimation can facilitate a mystical awakening in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|authorlink=Swami Sivananda Saraswati|title=Techniques of Sex Sublimation|url=http://atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184624/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_techniques_sex_sublimation.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swami Krishnananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp|title=Brahmacharya&amp;nbsp;– An Outlook of Consciousness|accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043338/http://atmajyoti.org/sw_brahmacharya_outlook_consciousness.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swami Chidananda|authorlink=Swami Chidananda Saraswati|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|title=The Role of Celibacy in the Spiritual Life|accessdate=2006-07-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226120409/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_role_of_celibacy_in_spiritual_life.asp|archivedate=2004-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== According to Jung ==

[[C. G. Jung]] believed sublimation to be mystical in nature, thus differing fundamentally from Freud's view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends). The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the [[super-ego]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, Letters, ed. By G. Adler and A. Jaffé (Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1974), vol. 1, 171,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, Dreams: (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung), Princeton University Press (2012), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== According to Lacan ==

=== ''Das Ding'' ===

Lacan's exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars.&lt;ref&gt;The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept ''Das Ding'' (later in his career Lacan termed this ''[[objet petit a]]''); ''Das Ding'' is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences all of which serve to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships which one relies on to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are always insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual.

Lacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact 'it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at the most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 52"/&gt; Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to ''Das Ding'' in relation to its end.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lacanian sublimation ===

Lacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of ''Das Ding''. His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 119"/&gt; in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.

Lacan also considers sublimation to be process of creation ''ex nihilo''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnesänger''&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 112"/&gt; who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centred around a hole (the vagina&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Provençal verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).

Lacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; They are primitive and even primordial artefacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; and often depict empty spaces through perspective.

In myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 163"/&gt; (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).

Lacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behaviour can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.&lt;ref name="Jacques Lacan p. 130"/&gt; As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.

==Empirical research==
A study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.&lt;ref name="kim13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639–666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing "possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms".&lt;ref name="kim13"/&gt;{{rp|639}}

== In fiction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].
*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].
*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F. Heatherton]], a more sinister example is given in which a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] becomes a [[surgeon]] or a [[dentist]]. A direct example of this is in the musical and movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' characterized in the descriptively sadistic character of Orin Scrivello who follows his mother's advice to become a dentist, quoting her "You'll find a way/to make your natural tendencies pay ... Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane."
*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.
* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.
* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode "[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.
* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: "...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strength of the Nipponese."

({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|ən|,_|-|i|ən}}; {{lang-la|Tatianus}}; {{lang-grc|Τατιανός}}; {{lang-syc|ܛܛܝܢܘܣ}}; c. 120 – c. 180 AD) was a Syrian [[Christianity|Christian]] writer and [[Christian theologian|theologian]] of the 2nd century.

Tatian's most influential work is the [[Diatessaron]], a [[Biblical paraphrase]], or "harmony", of the four gospels that became the standard text of the four gospels in the Syriac-speaking churches until the 5th-century, after which it gave way to the four separate gospels in the [[Peshitta]] version.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, articles ''Diatessaron'' and ''Peshitta''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Concerning the date and place of his birth, little is known beyond what Tatian tells about himself in his ''Oratio ad Graecos'', chap. xlii (''[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]]'', ii. 81–82): that he was born in "the land of the Assyrians"; (referring to Syria)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=79wj2hj4wKUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq The Modern Assyrians of the Middle East] Greeks often substituted "Syrian" with "Assyrian" to evoke a romanticized pre-Hellenic history of Syria.&lt;/ref&gt; Tatian was not born in geographical Assyria (Mesopotamia), he was born to the west of the Euphrates (Syria) scholarly consensus is that he died c. 185 AD, perhaps in [[Adiabene]].

He traveled to [[Rome]], where he first encountered Christianity. During his prolonged stay in Rome, according to his own representation, his abhorrence of the pagan cults sparked deep reflections on religious problems. Through the [[Old Testament]], he wrote, he grew convinced of the unreasonableness of paganism. He adopted the Christian religion and became the pupil of [[Justin Martyr]]. During this period [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosophers]] competed with Greek sophists. Like Justin, Tatian opened a Christian school in Rome.

Knowledge of Tatian's life following the death of Justin in 165 AD is to some extent obscure. [[Irenaeus]] remarks (''Haer.'', I., xxvlii. 1, ''Ante-Nicene Fathers,'' i. 353) that after the death of Justin, he was expelled from the church for his [[Encratites|Encratitic]] ([[asceticism|ascetic]]) views. ([[Eusebius]] claims he founded the Encratitic sect), as well as for being a follower of the [[gnostic]] leader [[Valentinius]]. It is clear that Tatian left Rome, perhaps to reside for a while in either Greece or [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], where he may have taught [[Clement of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, John (1974). ''Clement of Alexandria''. New York: Ardent Media, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] relates that Tatian established a school in Mesopotamia, the influence of which extended to [[Antioch]] in Syria, and was felt in Cilicia and especially in Pisidia.

The early development of the Syrian church furnishes a commentary on the attitude of Tatian in practical life. Thus for [[Aphrahat]] baptism conditions the taking of a [[vow]] in which the catechumen promises celibacy. This shows how firmly the views of Tatian were established in Syria, and it supports the supposition that Tatian was the missionary of the countries around the [[Euphrates]].

== Writings ==
His ''Oratio ad Graecos'' (Address to the Greeks) condemns paganism as worthless, and praises the reasonableness and high antiquity of Christianity. As early as [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], Tatian was praised for his discussions of the antiquity of [[Moses]] and of Jewish legislation, and it was because of this chronological section that his ''Oratio'' was not generally condemned.

His other major work was the ''[[Diatessaron]]'', a "harmony" or synthesis of the four [[New Testament]] [[Gospel]]s into a combined narrative of the life of [[Jesus]]. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] referred to it as the ''Evangelion da Mehallete'' ("The Gospel of the Mixed"), and it was practically the only gospel text used in Syria during the 3rd and 4th centuries.

In the 5th century the Diatessaron was replaced in those Syrian churches that used it by the four original Gospels. [[Rabbula]], Bishop of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], ordered the priests and deacons to see that every church should have a copy of the separate Gospels (''Evangelion da Mepharreshe''), and [[Theodoret]], Bishop of Cyrus, removed more than two hundred copies of the ''Diatessaron'' from the churches in his diocese.

A number of [[recension]]s of the ''Diatessaron'' are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephrem's ''Commentary'' on Tatian's work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem's original [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text from the late 5th/early 6th century, which has been edited by [[Louis Leloir]] (Paris, 1966). Other translations include translations made into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Georgian language|Old Georgian]]. A fragment of a narrative about the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] found in the ruins of [[Dura-Europos]] in 1933 was once thought to have been from the ''Diatessaron'', but more recent scholarly judgement does not connect it directly to Tatian's work.

The earliest member of the Western family of recensions is the Latin [[Codex Fuldensis]], written at the request of bishop [[Victor of Capua]] in 545 AD. Although the text is clearly dependent on the [[Vulgate]], the order of the passages is distinctly how Tatian arranged them. Tatian's influence can be detected much earlier in such Latin manuscripts as the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin translation]] of the Bible, in [[Novatian]]'s surviving writings, and in the Roman Antiphony. After the Codex Fuldensis, it would appear that members of the Western family led an underground existence, popping into view over the centuries in an [[Old High German]] translation (c. 830), a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (c. 1280), a Venetian manuscript of the 13th century, and a [[Middle English]] manuscript from 1400 that was once owned by [[Samuel Pepys]].

In a lost writing entitled ''On Perfection according to the Doctrine of the Savior,'' Tatian designates matrimony as a symbol of the tying of the flesh to the perishable world and ascribed the "invention" of matrimony to the devil. He distinguishes between the old and the new man; the old man is the law, the new man the Gospel. Other lost writings of Tatian include a work written before the ''Oratio ad Graecos'' that contrasts the nature of man with the nature of the animals, and a ''Problematon biblion'', which aimed to present a compilation of obscure Scripture sayings.

== Theology ==
The starting-point of Tatian's theology is a strict monotheism which becomes the source of the moral life. Originally, the human soul possessed faith in one God, but lost it with the fall.
In consequence, under the rule of demons, man sank into the abominable error of polytheism. By monotheistic faith, the soul is delivered from the material world and from demonic rule and is united with God. God is spirit (''pneuma''), but not the physical or [[Pneuma (Stoic)|stoical ''pneuma;'']] he was alone before the creation, but he had within himself potentially the whole creation.  Some scholars consider Tatian's creation theology as the beginning of teaching "ex nihilo" (creation from "nothing").&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Hatch, The Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the Christian Church, 195–196.  '' The basis of the theory [ex nihilo] was Platonic, though some of the terms were borrowed from both Aristotle and the Stoics. It became itself the basis for the theory which ultimately prevailed in the Church. The transition appears in Tatian [ca. 170 A.D.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The means of creation was the ''dynamis logike'' ("power expressed in words"). At first there
proceeded from God the [[Logos]] who, generated in the beginning, was to produce the world by creating matter from which the whole creation sprang. Creation is penetrated by the ''pneuma hylikon'', "world spirit," which is common to angels, stars, men, animals, and plants. This world spirit is lower than the divine ''pneuma,'' and becomes in man the ''psyche'' or "soul," so that on the material side and in his soul man does not differ essentially from the
animals; though at the same time he is called to a peculiar union with the divine spirit, which raises him above the animals. This spirit is the image of God in man, and to it man's immortality is due.

The first-born of the spirits fell and caused others to fall, and thus the demons originated. The fall of the spirits was brought about through their desire to separate man from God, in order that he might serve not God but them. Man, however, was implicated in this fall, lost his blessed abode and his soul was deserted by the divine spirit, and sank into the material sphere, in which only a faint reminiscence of God remained alive.

As by freedom man fell, so by freedom he may turn again to God. The Spirit unites with the souls of those who walk uprightly; through the prophets he reminds men of their lost likeness to God. Although Tatian does not mention the name of Jesus, his doctrine of redemption culminates in his [[Christology]].

Wannarexia is a [[cultural phenomenon]] and has no [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria,&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt; although some wannarexics may be instead diagnosed with [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS).&lt;ref name=amny&gt;{{cite news|title = Bad fad: Wannarexia|work = [[Associated Press]]|publisher = [[AM New York]]|date = 2007-08-06|pages = 24|author = Bauman, Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wannarexia is more commonly, but not always, found in teenage girls who want to be trendy,&lt;ref name=amny /&gt; and is likely caused by a combination of [[culture|cultural]] and [[Mass media|media]] influences.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;

Dr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their [[weight loss]], while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--wannabe-eating-di0804aug04,0,532415.story?page=2 |title='Wannarexic' girls aspire to be anorexic, eating disordered |accessdate=2007-08-06 | work=Newsday|date=2007-08-04|author=Bauman, Valerie|quote=Most commonly found among teenage girls, wannarexia is a label describing those who claim to have anorexia, or wish they did.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-04-wannarexic_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Wannarexic' girls yearn for eating disorders | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;
