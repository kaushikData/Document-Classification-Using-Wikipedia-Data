      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">'''Alphege, or the Green Monkey''' (in French : ''Alphinge ou le singe vert'') is a French literary [[fairy tale]], included in a work entitled ''Nouveaux Contes de fées'' (1718). In his compilation ''Le Cabinet des Fées'' (tome 31), Charles-Joseph de Mayer stated that the author was unknown, but it was finally attributed to the [[Chevalier de Mailly]] (1657&amp;ndash;1724).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76071/f8.item Editor's mention in the ''Nouveau Cabinet des Fées''. Gallica (BNF)].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Lang]] collected it in ''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Yellow Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/030.htm "Alphege, or the Green Monkey"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A king's wife dies in childbirth, leaving a boy heir. The godmother, the "Good Queen", names the boy ''Alphege'' and keeps an eye on him from afar. Alphege is brought up by a lady courtier and her husband, who also have daughter, Zayda.  The king eventually remarries and has another son; the new queen becomes jealous that Alphege, and not her own son, will become king and seeks help from her friend the "Fairy of the Mountain". The Good Queen sends Alphege a talisman, a red ruby, which will protect him only within his father's realm. The wicked queen fruitlessly plots to get get Alphege out of the country, until chance intervenes and he is sent to visit the king's sister. On the way, the entourage stops by a brook, where Alphege drinks the water and immediately rushes off and disappears. Searchers are told by a mysterious black monkey that he will not return until after they have failed for some time to recognise him. The entourage returns; the king dies in his grief and the wicked queen's son becomes king.

Years later, the king is out hunting and spies a green monkey looking at him strangely; he entices it to eat and takes it back to the palace. Soon later, the monkey escapes to the house of Zayda and her mother (the father having died). The mother becomes convinced it is Alphege, and then the Good Queen appears to her in a dream. She and Zayda follow the Good Queen's instructions and restore Alphege. Meanwhile, the wicked queen implores the king to kill an "impostor" raised up by plotters of a revolt. Instead, he makes inquiries and goes to confront the women at their home. He is astounded to meet Alphege, and immediately renounces his crown. At the palace, Alphege displays the ruby talisman, which splits with a loud noise, and the wicked queen dies. Alphege marries Zayda and shares the throne with his stepbrother.

==Commentary==
This tale makes use of fairies and shapeshifting in a manner similar to many [[Précieuses|précieuse]] writers, such as [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].

'''Burqush''' or '''Burkush''' ({{lang-ar|برقش}}) is an archaeological site situated {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Beattie|author2=Timothy Pepper|title=The Rough Guide to Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iCfkTe8v2EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-718-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuprechtsbergerErtel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwin Maria Ruprechtsberger|author2=Christine Ertel|title=Vom Mount Hermon zum Djebel Burqush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KkKMAEACAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Stadtmuseum Linz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby [[Wadi al-Qarn – Burqush Important Bird Area|Wadi al-Qarn]] is an important breeding site for wild [[bird]]s in the [[Middle East]] and has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref name="EvansEast1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. I. Evans |title=Important bird areas in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZrwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=BirdLife International|isbn=978-0-946888-28-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site sits at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|1580|m|ft}} and overlooks the [[Damascus]] plain and surrounding hill country where herds of [[goat]]s and [[camel]]s wander the area. Due to the sensitive nature of the territory close to the borders with [[Lebanon]] and the [[Golan]], visitors may need a military escort to access the site, which is a ten-minute walk along a steep track away from the main road.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

Julien Aliquot suggested that the site may have been called '''Barkousa''' in ancient times. This was contrary to the location of '''Barkusha''' that had previously been suggested by [[Albrecht Alt]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, it was renamed '''Justinianopolis''' ({{lang-el|Ἰουστινιανούπολις}}, "city of Justinian") after the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnadk/Lovell_2011.pdf Klein, Konstantin., Review of Aliquot, J., Inscriptions Grecques et Latines de la Syrie - Tome 11: Mount Hermon (Liban et Syrie) Beirut: Presses de l'IFPO (Bibliothèque archéologique et historique 183) Reviews, Levant, Vol 43, No 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potts2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Byzantine basilica and Roman temple==
There are the ruins of two [[Roman temple]]s in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer20082"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=Aliquot, Julien., Sanctuaries and villages on Mount Hermon in the Roman period in The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dar1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimʻon Dar|title=Settlements and cult sites on Mount Hermon, Israel: Ituraean culture in the Hellenistic and Roman periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuwtAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1993|publisher=Tempus Reparatum|isbn=978-0-86054-756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of a 6th-century CE [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]] lie on the top of a hill which has been artificially flattened to form a two level plateau. The area around features numerous rock cut rooms and crypts. The podium on which the basilica is constructed is suggested to be that of a previous [[Roman temple]] suggested to date to the 1st century CE. The Roman temple itself is thought to have been built on the remains of a previous temple that had been in use for secular purposes for at least four hundred years earlier and possibly for many generations prior. The basilica is constructed of massive blocks of stone and the site is littered with other confusing blocks, some of which possibly resemble buildings or unusual [[geological]] outcrops.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

The temple complex at Burqush was mentioned by the [[Germany|German]] archaeological mission to [[Baalbek]] in 1903 and has received little study since then. A [[topographic]] and architectural survey of the site was conducted in 1999 by Gunnar Brands for the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. A dissertation covering the results of the survey is in progress by Frederike von Bargen.&lt;ref name="brands"&gt;[http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/digs/burqush/burqush.htm Burqush (Syria) - Archaeological Survey 1999, Funded by the German Research Foundation, Director: Prof. Dr. Gunnar Brands, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg Institut für Altertumswissenschaften, Seminar für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Bargen, Friederike., Die Kirchenanlage von Burqush im Hermongebirge und ihre Ausstattung, Institut für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunst (in progress)&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey noted complex substructures, and intended to document the surrounding settlements, [[tomb]]s, [[quarries]] and a [[propylon]] temple ruins. The survey was hampered by the remoteness and altitude of the site, tank shelling, and finding a settlement in the area that was twice as large as expected with numerous rock cut tombs nearby. The basement of the basilica was constructed from bedrock and showed a high technical quality of construction. Traces of bronze [[candle]] holders were found along with remnants of a [[marble]] cover that was white with gray veining. Twelve [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] were recorded in 1903, of which only eight remained in place, with three more displaced nearby, one reused for [[medieval]] farming. The twelfth capital had been covered in rubble and totally obscured. The east wall of the basilica features a [[portico]]. Foundations of what were thought to be a [[peristyle]] for the basilica were found to its north west, some of the area to the north was cleared and leveled by the military.&lt;ref name="brands"/&gt;  The remains of the settlement are dispersed on the east slope of the hill are also large buildings on the west slope.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">'''Certosina''' is a decorative art technique used widely in the [[Italian Renaissance]] period. Similar to [[marquetry]], it uses small pieces of wood, bone, metal, or mother-of-pearl to create inlaid geometric patterns on wood. The term comes from [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa Church in Pavia]], where the technique was used in ornamenting an altarpiece.

'''''Chadam''''' is an animated web series by artist [[Alex Pardee]] based on characters he created for a number of [[The Used]]'s album artwork and distributed by [[The WB]] and [[Alex Pardee|Eye Suck Ink]]. ''Chadam'' is produced by [[Jason "Jace" Hall]] of HDFILMS Inc. The short series premiered June 15, 2010 on TheWB.com. [[The WB]] and its children's network, [[Kids WB!]] is closed, but the website is still open. ''Chadam'' appeared on the cover of ''[[Lies for the Liars]]''. The episodes are nearly 4 to 5 minutes long. [[iTunes]] has the episodes in a collection called ''Chadam, the Complete Series''. [[iTunes]] episodes are nearly the 13 minute mark because two short episodes are built into one, for example, "Cut from Cardboard" and "Ripley, Believe It or Not" are put together as "The Awakening".

Hall pushed the boundaries of traditional filmmaking by using a computer game engine, [[Unreal Engine 3]], in order to meet the challenge of animating Pardee's surreal work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hsu | first = Jeremy | title = Gaming Software Offers Cheap Alternative to Hollywood Animation Tools | work = InnovationNewsDaily | date = 2011-04-13 | url = http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/games-take-aim-big-budget-hollywood-animation-1893/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6563">'''Contemporary romance''' is a subgenre of [[romance novel]]s, generally [[Setting (narrative)|set]] contemporaneously with the time of its writing.&lt;ref name="rwasub"&gt;
{{cite web | title = Romance Novels--Subgenres | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]    | url =https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=579  | accessdate = 2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of the romance novel subgenres, contemporary romance novels are set in the time when they were written, and usually reflect the mores of their time.  Heroines in the contemporary romances written prior to 1970 usually quit working when they married or had children, while those novels written after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career.&lt;ref name=ramsdell43&gt;Ramsdell (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.&lt;ref name=ramsdell44/&gt;

Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books, and the majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print.&lt;ref name=ramsdell44&gt;Ramsdell (1999), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;   Those that survive the test of time, such as the works of [[Jane Austen]] are often reclassified as historical romances.&lt;ref name=ramsdell43/&gt;  In a 2014 survey of romance readers, contemporary romance made up 41% of print and 44% of ebook sales compared to other romance subgenres.&lt;ref name="rwastat"&gt;{{cite web | title = Romance Reader Statistics  | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | year = 2014  | url =https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582  | accessdate = 2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by [[Kelly Ripa]] to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.&lt;ref name="2003massmarket"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Year in Books 2003: Mass Market |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] via internet archive |date=November 17, 2003 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA336202.html?q=paranormal+romance+genre |accessdate=2015-06-24 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130500/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA336202.html?q=paranormal+romance+genre |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==
Contemporary romance novels may, in turn, be categorized into several subgenres, sometimes mixing with other main subgenres of romance novels.

Subgenres include:
* General contemporary romance
* Contemporary Romantic Suspense
* Baby Love
* Medical romance
* Cowboy contemporary romance
* Glamour &amp; Jet Set
* Humorous contemporary romance
* International Lovers
* Love in the Workplace
* Vacation Love
* Lesbian romance
* Amnesia, that is [[memory loss]], often including some former relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wereallydig.com/romancenovels/c/contemporarynovels.html#Amnesia|title=Contemporary Romance Books at We Really Dig Romance Novels|first=We Really|last=Dig|website=www.wereallydig.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baby love===
This subgenre includes [[pregnancy]], babies or children. One obstacle for making plots in this sense is to adapt to an ongoing increase in women who independently foster their children without any partner.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

Highly notable examples include ''[[Nobody's Baby But Mine]]'' by [[Susan Elizabeth Phillips]].

===Medical romance===
Medical romance novels may generally be regarded as a subcategory of contemporary romance, as well as of [[medical fiction]], but has its own type of setting and characters, although it yet can be as multifarious as any other subgenre. The setting usually involves a medical workplace, often the [[emergency department]], but also [[Air ambulance|airborne medicine]], [[family medicine]] and [[obstetrics and gynaecology]].&lt;!--Dead link; couldn't find it on internet archive&lt;ref name=healthday&gt;[http://www.hon.ch/News/HSN/609415.html Hospital Romance May Largely Be Fiction.] By Amanda Gardner, HealthDay Reporter&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Regarding characters, the central male protagonists (heroes) are almost always [[medical doctor]]s, mostly [[emergency physician]]s, [[primary care physician]]s or [[surgeon]]s, and sometimes [[obstetrician]]s/[[neonatologist]]s or [[pediatrician]]s. The female protagonists (heroines) are mostly medical doctors but also often nurses, working in primary care, obstetrics/neonatology, training or [[Residency (medicine)|residency programs]], surgery, [[anesthesiology]] or emergency medicine. The doctors are almost always ingenious, the male ones usually being tallish, husky and chiseled, while nurses are strong but caring.

Patients bring a lot of potential for subplots. They mostly get completely recovered, regardless of the severity of their injury or disease. Almost no plot, however, includes a doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship, since it is a code for professional health care workers to avoid intimate relationships with patients, as a part of a professional [[doctor-patient relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3552134/seductive-patient The Seductive Patient] American Family Physician,  Sept 1, 2000  by Cheryl Winchell&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot often includes [[pregnancy]]&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708052723/http://medicalromance.blogspot.com/2008/07/unexplained-popularity-of-pregnant.html The Unexplained Popularity Of Pregnant Protagonists - via internet archive] by Lynne Marshall&lt;/ref&gt; and children.

===Lesbian romance===
This subgenre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFRYZz06dloC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=lesbian+romance+genre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r-bf1amtVN&amp;sig=WQcEbY7f5UjtjQwWuYc56YPhrfM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QdWRU4GLIcny8AGNp4DYAQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=lesbian+romance+genre&amp;f=false|title=Lesbian Romance Novels: A History and Critical Analysis|first=Phyllis M.|last=Betz|date=24 June 2009|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786454389}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an important part of literature and has been prevalent since the mid 1700s. The lesbian romance genre is often a subgenre of broader genres such as BDSM romance, paranormal romance, coming-of-age romance, fantasy romance, and inspirational romance.

[[File:edith-craig.jpg|thumb|right|Edith Craig]]
'''Edith Ailsa Geraldine Craig''' (9 December 1869 – 27 March 1947) was a prolific theatre director, producer, costume designer and early pioneer of the [[women's suffrage]] movement in England.  She was the daughter of actress [[Ellen Terry]] and the progressive English architect-designer [[Edward William Godwin]], and the sister of [[theatre practitioner]] [[Edward Gordon Craig]].

As a lesbian, an active campaigner for women's suffrage, and a woman working as a theatre director and producer, Edith Craig has been recovered by feminist scholars as well as theatre historians.&lt;ref&gt;Dymkowski (1992); Cockin (1998), among others; and Gandolfi (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Craig lived in a [[ménage à trois]] with the dramatist [[Christabel Marshall]] and the artist [[Clare Atwood|Clare 'Tony' Atwood]] from 1916 until her death.&lt;ref name=strange&gt;Holroyd (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Rubin, Martin. [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/23/entertainment/et-book23 "''A Strange Eventful History: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, and Their Remarkable Families'' by Michael Holroyd"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 23 March 2009, accessed 18 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Am4bzJUW5cQC&amp;pg=PA90 Jill Rudd &amp; Val Gough (editors) ''Charlotte Perkins Gilmore: Optimist Reformer'' University of Iowa Press, p. 90 (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Law&gt;Law, Cheryl.

==Early years==
Edith 'Edy' Craig, like her younger brother Edward, was illegitimate, as her mother, Ellen Terry, was still married to her first husband [[George Frederic Watts]] when she eloped with [[Edward William Godwin|Godwin]] in 1868. Edith Craig was born the following year at Gusterwoods Common in [[Hertfordshire]], and was given the surname 'Craig' to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36460 "Terry, Dame Ellen Alice (1847–1928)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 4 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pa.essortment.com/actressellente_rdpq.htm Profile of Terry by Amanda Hodges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517111736/http://pa.essortment.com/actressellente_rdpq.htm |date=17 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in Fallows Green, [[Harpenden]] in Hertfordshire, designed by Godwin, until 1874. The couple separated in 1875. In 1877 Terry married her second husband, Charles Wardell, an actor with the stage name Charles Kelly with whom she had worked. He became a father figure for the children leading to Craig taking the name Wardell. However, in 1907 Terry married her third husband, [[James Carew]], whom Edith Craig did not like.

Craig was educated at Mrs Cole's school, a co-educational institution in [[Earls Court]] in London, and at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. Craig made her first appearance on the stage in 1878 during the run of ''Olivia'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. She trained as a pianist under Alexis Hollander in [[Berlin]], Germany, from 1887 to 1890. She also occasionally studied under [[Elizabeth Malleson]] of Dixton Manor Hall, [[Winchcombe]], Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Katharine Cockin, "Craig, Edith Ailsa Geraldine (1869–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39083, accessed 10 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre career==
[[File:terry-craig.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ellen Terry]] and Edith Craig onstage at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] c.1895]]
Craig joined the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] company as a costume designer and actress, touring America in 1895 and 1907 under the stage name Ailsa Craig. Edith was noted for her expertise in historically accurate costumes and began to gain recognition for them. Like her younger brother, Craig appeared with [[Henry Irving]] in a number of plays, including ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'' (1895). In 1895 her performances in [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]]'s ''Bygones'' and [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Lyons Mail'' respectively were praised by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Eleonora Duse]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] was a family friend of Craig's, he wrote several roles specifically for her. In Bernard Shaw's play ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'', it is believed that the role of Prossy was created for Craig, who originally played the role.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Craig also acted in plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]], toured with [[Mrs Brown-Potter]] and the Independent Theatre. In 1899, Irving employed her to make the costumes for his production of ''Robespierre'', which led to her going into business as a dressmaker as Edith Craig &amp; Co in Covent Garden until 1903. After Ellen Terry left the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and went into management, Craig accompanied her on her tours in the English provinces and America as her stage-director, and from then play-production became her chief occupation.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Craig founded the Pioneer Players (1911–1925), a theatre society based in London.&lt;ref name=Cockin1&gt;Cockin (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}} The Pioneer Players were known for producing formerly banned plays, plays on social humanism, women's suffrage and feminism and, from 1915, foreign plays in English. The plays in translation allowed the group to reach beyond the Actresses Franchise League and to be accepted into mainstream English theatre. Craig's mother, Ellen Terry, was president of the society. Craig served as the managing director / stage director, and her partner, Chris St. John, served as the secretary. An advisory committee included [[George Bernard Shaw]] and the President [[Gabrielle Enthoven]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 8th edition 1936, ed. John Parker&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Players has been described by some critics as a women's theatre company, increasing women's opportunities in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=craied The Orlando Project of Women Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Craig produced approximately 150 plays.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

After the Pioneer Players finally closed, Craig produced plays for the Little Theatre movement at [[York]], [[Leeds]], [[Letchworth]] and [[Hampstead]]. In 1919, she was an important figure in the British Drama League (BDL), which had been formed to promote amateur theatre throughout the United Kingdom, and to encourage a lasting peace after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Cockin2&gt;Cockin, Katharine. [http://www.english.heacademy.ac.uk/explore/publications/magazine/wordplay2/cockin.htm "Dame Ellen Terry and Edith Craig: Suitable Subjects for Teaching"], ''Wordplay'', English Subject Centre Magazine, Issue 2, October 2009, accessed 18 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Later Craig directed plays at the Everyman Theatre Hampstead and Leeds Art Theatre.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Cockin (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}} In 1929, the year after Ellen Terry's death, Craig converted the Elizabethan barn adjacent to Terry's house at [[Smallhythe Place]] into a theatre which she named The Barn Theatre. Here she produced [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] every year to commemorate the anniversary of her mother's death. Craig also appeared in a number of [[silent film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2287499/ Craig on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Fires of Fate (1923 film)|Fires of Fate]]'' (1923).

Craig was involved in many [[women's suffrage|suffrage]] groups, and sold newspapers on behalf of that cause in the street. After she met a woman selling newspapers for the Women's Freedom she became a member and worked at branch level for that group. She did not fully understand the meaning of suffragism, but formed strong opinions about it quickly. She stated that's "[she] grew up quite firmly certain that no self-respecting woman could be other than a suffragist". Craig used her theatrical experience on behalf of the [[Actresses' Franchise League]] and was also involved in various suffrage productions. She directed ''A Pageant of Great Women'', a play she devised with the writer and actor [[Cicely Hamilton]], which was performed across the United Kingdom before large audiences. ''A Pageant'' followed the concept of a [[morality play]] in which the main character, Woman, is confronted by the antagonist, Prejudice, who believes that men and women are not equal. Justice presides over the debate between Prejudice and Woman, as groups of great women process on stage as evidence of women's achievements in art, government, education, spiritual matters and battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cockin (2005), pp. 527–42&lt;/ref&gt; Craig directed each production of this play, bringing the three professional actors to perform Woman, Justice and Prejudice and the historically accurate costumes with her to each venue. Craig frequently played the role of [[Rosa Bonheur]], a lesbian artist.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
[[File:craig-atwood-marshall.jpg|thumb|right|Edith Craig, [[Clare Atwood]] and [[Christabel Marshall]] at [[Smallhythe Place]]]]
The composer [[Martin Shaw (composer)|Martin Shaw]] proposed to Craig in 1903, and she accepted. However, the marriage was prevented by [[Ellen Terry]], out of jealousy for her daughter's affection, and by [[Christabel Marshall]], who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher St. John, with whom she lived from 1899 until they were joined in 1916 by the artist [[Clare Atwood|Clare 'Tony' Atwood]], living in a [[ménage à trois]] until Craig's death in 1947.&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=Law/&gt; Her lesbian lifestyle was looked down upon by her family. Her brother Edward said Edith's sexuality was a result of her "hatred of men, initiated by the hatred of her father". Craig became involved in several books about her mother and [[George Bernard Shaw]] which created a rift in the relationship with her brother, who asked Craig not to write about their mother, and specifically not to share the details of the family's innermost problems. [[Edward Gordon Craig]]'s book ''Ellen Terry and her Secret Self'' (1931) explicitly objected to ''Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw: a Correspondence'' (1931) edited by Christopher St. John. In 1932 Craig co-edited with St. John ''Ellen Terry's Memoirs'' in which she replied to her brother's representation of their mother. Also in 1932 Craig adopted Ruby Chelta Craig.&lt;ref&gt;Cockin (1998), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Craig was reconciled with her brother some time before her death.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

On the death of her mother Craig committed her life to preserving her mother's legacy. She opened the family home, [[Smallhythe Place]] in Kent, England to the public. From 1939 she was supported in running the house by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. On her death she left Smallhythe Place to the National Trust as a memorial to her mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellenterryarchive.hull.ac.uk/ Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Craig died of [[coronary thrombosis]] and chronic [[myocarditis]] on 27 March 1947 at Priest's House, [[Smallhythe Place]] while planning a Shakespeare festival in honour of her mother. Her body was cremated. Marshall and Atwood are buried alongside each other at St John the Baptist's Church, [[Small Hythe]]. Craig's ashes were supposed to be buried there as well, but at the time of Marshall and Atwood's deaths, the ashes got lost and a memorial was placed in the cemetery instead.&lt;ref&gt;Rachlin, Ann. ''Edy was a Lady''. Troubador Publishing (2011), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Craig suffered from acute arthritis especially in her hands.  In her younger days, this painful condition prevented her from becoming a professional musician. She attended the Royal Academy of Music and held a certificate in piano from Trinity College. In her later years, after the death of her mother, Craig dictated her memoirs to her friend Vera Holme, known as Jacko. Jacko wrote them down in a quarto notebook that was "lost in an attic" for decades and then sold to [[Ann Rachlin]] in 1978. They included Craig's reminiscences of her childhood and life with her mother, Edward Gordon Craig and Henry Irving. Rachlin published them in her book ''Edy was a Lady'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Rachlin (2011), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]] is said to have used Edith Craig as a model for the character of Miss LaTrobe in her novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name=Cockin2/&gt;

'''''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', also titled '''''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''''', is an [[autobiographical]] book by [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] about his experiences during the [[Cuban Revolution]] (1956–1958) to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]].

First published in 1963, it was the compilation of a series of articles by Guevara that had originally appeared in ''Verde Olivo'', a weekly publication of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR).

The 2008 biopic [[Che (2008 film)|''Che'']] starring [[Benicio del Toro]] is based partly on this book.

==Translations==
The book was translated into English in 1968 as ''Reminiscences of the Revolutionary War'', retranslated in 1986 as ''Episodes of the Cuban Revolutionary War'', and again in 2005 as ''Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War''.

==Review==

'''''Eskimo Artist: Kenojuak''''' is a 1964 Canadian [[short film|short]] [[documentary film]] about [[Inuit]] artist [[Kenojuak Ashevak]], directed by [[John Feeney (filmmaker)|John Feeney]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short]].&lt;ref name="Oscars1965"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1965 |title=The 37th Academy Awards (1965) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=August 24, 2011|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the use of the term "Eskimo" in the title, Feeney wrote in 1993 that he had suggested using the now-accepted term "Inuit" in the film, but had been told that it would be confusing for non-Inuit audiences of the day.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''''' is a 2001 [[guide book]] written by British author [[J. K. Rowling]] (under the [[pen name]] of the fictitious author [[Newt Scamander]]) about the [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]] in the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]]. The original version, illustrated by the author herself, purports to be [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s copy of the textbook of the same name mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (or ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the US), the first novel of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It includes several notes inside it supposedly handwritten by Harry, [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], detailing their own experiences with some of the beasts described, and including in-jokes relating to the original series.

In a 2001 interview with publisher [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]], Rowling stated that she chose the subject of [[magical beasts (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]] because it was a fun topic for which she had already developed a lot of information in earlier books. Rowling's name did not appear on the cover of the first edition, the work being credited under the pen name "Newt Scamander", who, in the books, wrote this textbook as seen on Harry's supply list for his first year.

The book benefits the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Over 80% of the cover price of each book sold goes directly to poor children in various places around the world. According to Comic Relief, sales from this book and its companion ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' have raised over £17&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicrelief.com/news/2009-07/harry-potter-book-profits-go-comic-relief |title=News |publisher=[[Comic Relief]] |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314132659/http://www.comicrelief.com/news/2009-07/harry-potter-book-profits-go-comic-relief |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2013, [[Warner Bros.]] and Rowling announced they would be producing a [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film inspired by the book]], being the first in a series of five such films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/786672299374157824?lang=en-gb | title="Five films exactly". JK Rowling Twitter feed | date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling herself was the screenwriter. She came up with a plan for a movie after Warner Bros. suggested the idea. The story features Newt Scamander as a main character and is set in [[New York City]], 70 years before Harry's story started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/warner-bros-j-k-rowling-team-for-new-harry-potter-inspired-film-series/ |title= Warner Bros, J.K.

On 14 March 2017 a new edition of the book, with cover illustrations by Johnny Duddle and interior illustrations by Tomislav Tomic, was published with six new creatures and a foreword by Newt Scamander. It is assumed to be a new copy as it does not feature any handwritten notes. Proceeds from this edition are donated to [[Lumos (charity)|Lumos]] as well as Comic Relief.

On 7 November 2017 a new edition was published with illustrations by Olivia Lomenech Gill, featuring the aforementioned 2017 text. On 1 February 2018 a Kindle in Motion edition, featuring these illustrations with movement, was released for compatible devices.

==Synopsis==
===Original version===
''Fantastic Beasts'' purports to be a reproduction of a textbook owned by [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and written by [[Cryptozoology|magizoologist]] Newt Scamander, a character in the fictional ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. In the series, magizoology is the study of [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter|magical creatures]].

[[Albus Dumbledore]], headmaster of [[Hogwarts]], provides the foreword and explains the purpose of the special edition of this book (the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] charity). At the end, he tells the reader, "...The amusing creatures described hereafter are fictional and cannot hurt you." He repeats the Hogwarts motto: "Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus", [[Latin]] for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".

''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' contains the history of magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the world. Scamander says that he collected most of the information found in the book through observations made over years of travel across five continents. He notes that the first edition was commissioned in 1918 by Augustus Worme of [[Places in Harry Potter#Obscurus Books|Obscurus Books]]. However, it was not published until 1927. It is now in its fifty-second edition.

In the [[Harry Potter universe]], the book is a required textbook for first-year [[Hogwarts]] students, having been an approved textbook since its first publication. In his foreword to the book, [[Albus Dumbledore]] notes that it serves as an excellent reference for wizarding households in addition to its use at [[Hogwarts]].

The book features doodles and comments added by [[Ron Weasley]]. The comments would appear to have been written around the time of the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]].'' These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the "[[Acromantula]]" entry has a comment confirming that [[Hogwarts]] is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Ron saying "you're not kidding" when talking about the Hungarian Horntail being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry's encounter with one in the fourth book).

The cover design of the first edition of the book features apparent claw marks from an unidentified animal.

===2017 text===
This edition features six new creatures: the [[Hidebehind|hidebehind]], the [[hodag]], the [[horned serpent]], the [[Snallygaster|snallygaster]], the thunderbird and the wampus cat, in addition to the original 75, and the illustrations are replaced. Newt Scamander in the foreword stated the reason the six new creatures were not previously included is because MACUSA president Seraphina Picquery requested the more important American creatures not be mentioned to deter wizarding sightseers at a time when the US wizarding community were subject to greater persecution than their European counterparts, and after Scamander had contributed to a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy in New York.


===Fictional biography===
{{in-universe|section|date=January 2015}}
Newton Artemis Fido "Newt" Scamander is the fictional author of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', born in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/newt-scamander&lt;/ref&gt; According to the "About the Author" section of the book, Scamander became a magizoologist because of his own interest in fabulous beasts and the encouragement of his mother, an enthusiastic [[Hippogriff]] breeder. In [[Hogwarts]], he was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]] house.

After being expelled from [[Hogwarts]], Scamander joined the [[Ministry of Magic]] in the [[Ministry of Magic#Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. His career included a brief stint in the Office of [[House-elf]] Relocation, a transfer to the [[Ministry of Magic#Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Beast Division]], the creation of the Werewolf Register in 1947, the 1965 passage of the Ban on Experimental Breeding, and many research trips for the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau. His contributions to [[Magizoology]] earned him an Order of Merlin, Second Class in 1979.

When retired, he lived in [[Dorset]] with his wife [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)#Cast|Porpentina]] and their pet Kneazles: Hoppy, Milly and Mauler. He had a grandson named Rolf, who married [[Luna Lovegood]] (a character who appeared in the last three ''Harry Potter'' novels) some time after the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.

In the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', Newt Scamander's name appeared on the Marauder's Map. 

In the film adaptation of ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', it is mentioned that Scamander was expelled from Hogwarts following an unspecified incident involving one of his creatures, but Albus Dumbledore argued in his defence.

===Role in the ''Harry Potter'' series===
Scamander himself does not appear in the seven Harry Potter books. He is mentioned in passing in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' as the author of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. He is the central character of the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film adaptation of ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'']], in which he is portrayed by [[Eddie Redmayne]].

Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the book with an "A" and wrote "With its richly detailed history lessons and witty debate parsing the differences between ''being'' and ''beast'', plus a compendium of 85 magical creatures that's chockablock with Rowling's trademark wordplay (''Glumbumble'' is a standout), ''Beasts'' adds a vital new dimension to the Potter mythology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280392,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly| accessdate=29 January 2011|title=Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them; Quidditch Through the Ages|author=Jensen, Jeff|date=23 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federation of European Carnival Cities''' (FECC) was founded in 1980 and has been registered in the Court of Luxembourg. Member cities, organization and individual members are engaged in producing popular celebrations or [[carnivals]] which represent an authentic [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] or [[parade]] of a people's cultural identity. The General membership meets twice each year generally at the end of May and in October. [[File:FECC-logo.png|right]]

== History ==
On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of [[Amsterdam]] (The Nederlands), Carnival Princes from all over the world met each other in the Amsterdam RAI congress centre in November 1975. The Amsterdam Carnival Association, governed by Mr.[[Henk van der Kroon]] was called "Amstelpieren &amp; Brokkerijders."  The big event brought an unprecedented number of Carnival Associations from different countries together. The guests of honour included Her Royal Highness [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]] as well as diplomats and dignitaries from afar including [[Brazil]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]]. This unique event is widely recognized as the starting point for the lasting contacts and exchanges between associations and cities that has become the FECC.

In 1980, international carnival associations met in Patras (Greece), again under the initiative of the Amsterdam Carnival Association Ämstelpieren &amp; Bfrokkerijders. It is generally accepted that the FECC (Foundation of European Carnival) came into existence during this meeting. At the 5th reunion in Kos-Patmos (Greece), which took place in 1985, a membership was introduced and it was decided to drawn up rules and bylaws. The first countries that became a member of the Foundation were Belgium, Netherlands, [[Luxembourg]], [[England]] and [[Malta]]. Articles of association were formulated and the creation of FECC was registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Directly following the 1987 7th reunion in Malta, the Belgian members founded their own section FECC-Belgium with its own governing board. In 1988 FECC-Germany founded their own section as did FECC-Netherlands and FECC –Luxembourg. The first elected International President was Mr. Henk van der Kroon.

Throughout the year the International President and other Board Members travel to member cities and interested Carnivals to learn, educate and often officiate at the ceremonies surrounding what is often the most important annual event for the community and even country. The FECC is a global organization holding its first annual convention outside the Mediterranean in the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1987. Many Carnivals, particularly those in Eastern Europe, have grown up under the mentorship of FECC engagement. Since its founding, the FECC has been the only unswerving organization consistently speaking for the interests and concerns of Carnival organizations. Representatives from Carnival organizations in over 50 countries are members and annual conventions generally have several Mayors seeking ways to bring more international recognition and culturally oriented tourists to their festivals.

==Annual Carnival City Congress==
Once a year, all FECC members: cities, associations and individual members are invited to an international assembly. This convention is organized by a member-city and takes place every year in a different country.
The convention lasts 1 week end takes place between end mid-May and mid- June. These conventions enjoy a lot of interest: every year, participants from more than 20 countries are present.
During these annual conventions, the members get an international forum which enables them to promote their carnival and their town on the occasion of seminars and workshops.

Direct personal contacts with the numerous participants can also increase the international publicity of a member's carnival and/of town.
The organizers of the convention moreover, use these gatherings to show the participants a few tourist attractions and places of interest of their town and the surrounding area. 

The 11 October 1980 marks the founding of the FECC and it is observed by the FECC membership with a '''Dies Natalis''' celebration. This weekend gathering is hosted by a member city.

[[File:Glasgow Empire Theatre Sauchiehall Street about 1930.jpg|thumb|Empire Theatre , Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow before the Art Deco changes of 1931]]
'''Glasgow Empire Theatre''', known as the Glasgow Palace Empire until the early 1900s, was a major theatre in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], which opened in 1897 on the site of the Gaiety Theatre at 31-35 [[Sauchiehall Street]].
It was one of the leading theatres in the UK chain of theatres owned and developed by [[Moss Empires]] under the chairmanship of Sir [[Edward Moss]], who served his apprenticeship in Greenock &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/GreenockTheatres.htm#lorne&lt;/ref&gt;
and elsewhere.

==Beginning and reopening==
The Empire Theatre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Empire.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by the renowned theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]] for the [[Moss Empires]] theatre chain. [[Vesta Tilley]] topped the opening bill. Its predecessor the Gaiety Theatre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/GaietyTheatre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; had opened in 1874 under Charles Bernard, staging pantomime, opera, musicals and plays but changed to variety, which Moss Empires developed further.

Expanding westwards towards Renfield Street and after a major Art Deco redesign by Sunderland-based architects [[W &amp; TR Milburn]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202007&lt;/ref&gt; the Empire re-opened in 1931 with a seating capacity of 2,100. The main attraction on the re-opening was [[Jack Payne (bandleader)|Jack Payne]] and the [[BBC]] [[British dance band|Dance Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/glasgow-empire/theglasgowempirestory.htm|title=The Glasgow Empire story|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202774|title=DSA Architect Biography Report|publisher=Dictionary of Scottish Architects|accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre attractions==
The Empire presented variety, revues, musicals and dance, including Pavlova, winter circus, pantomimes and ice spectaculars especially those produced by Tom Arnold.
Over the years many stars appeared including [[Lilly Langtry]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], Sir [[Harry Lauder]], [[G. H. Elliott]], [[Tommy Lorne]], [[Evelyn Laye]], [[Will Fyffe]], [[Harry Gordon (entertainer)|Harry Gordon]], [[Robert Wilson (tenor)|Robert Wilson]], the Logan family and [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]]. Dance bands included [[Jack Hylton]] and [[Joe Loss]].
Top quality American artistes were greatly welcomed, including [[the Andrews Sisters]] and [[Billy Eckstine]]. [[Fats Waller]] made his European debut in the Empire in 1938. [[Tony Bennett]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Mel Tormé]] and [[Liberace]] were joined by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Jack Benny]] and a great favourite [[Danny Kaye]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA00248|title=The Glasgow Empire Palace Theatre|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other performers from Britain who became regulars included [[Nat Gonella]], [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]], [[Harry Secombe]], [[Max Bygraves]], [[Ken Dodd]] (who brought the house down), [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Adam Faith]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Springfields]] and [[Frankie Vaughan]] before he headlined at the [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]].
Welsh singer Dame [[Shirley Bassey]] made her debut at the theatre in 1959 and was initially given a hard time before asking the audience to give her a chance, whereupon the singer finished her set and was warmly applauded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/music-news/2009/11/01/dame-shirley-bassey-still-going-strong-after-notorious-scots-debut-78057-21789772/ |publisher=Daily Record |title=Dame Shirley Bassey going strongly after tough Scots debut |accessdate=29 March 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire was notorious within showbiz circles as ''"The English comic's grave"'', if their act was slow or thin. Among those judged this way were [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Bernie Winters]] and [[Morecambe and Wise]]. [[Des O'Connor]] pretended to faint when the Glasgow audience started jeering his act and was duly dragged off stage. [[Roy Castle]] survived because of his versatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ua1zluoDxjwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=glasgow+empire+theatre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1uAJTrTvGNSy8QOr37GTAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=glasgow%20empire%20theatre&amp;f=false|title=Footprint Glasgow Handbook:The Travel Guide|author=Alan Murphy, Rebecca Ford|year=2001|page=131|publisher=Footprint Handbook Ltd|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian Ken Dodd famously disparaged attempts to psychoanalyse humour with the rebuttal, "The trouble with [[Sigmund Freud]] is that he never played second house at the Glasgow Empire after both halves of the [[Old Firm]] had just lost!"

The record for the longest running shows is held by The Andy Stewart Show, twice-nightly with a change of programme each six weeks, for 26 weeks in 1961 and again in 1962, with 400,000 tickets sold each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Empire.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final curtain==
The final curtain came down on the theatre on 31 March 1963 with a cast that included the Red Army Choir, [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]], [[Robert Wilson (tenor)|Robert Wilson]], [[Iain Cuthbertson]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Rikki Fulton]] and [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glasgow-empire.webs.com/thefinalcurtain.htm|title=Glasgow Empire Theatre|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now occupied by Empire House, an office and retail development, at the corner of West Nile Street and 31-35 Sauchiehall Street.

[[File:Hours of Idleness 1807 Lord Byron.jpg|thumb|1807 title page.]]'''''Hours of Idleness''''' was the first volume of poetry published by [[Lord Byron]], in 1807, when he was 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englishhistory.net/byron/chronology.html |title=Lord Byron: A Chronology of His Life and Work |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=EnglishHistory.net |publisher= |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of mostly short [[poem]]s, many in imitation of classic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poets.
==Background==

The volume was published in June-July 1807 as a small octavo, printed and published by S. and J. Ridge of Newark in the UK and sold by the  London booksellers: Crosby and Co.; Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme; F. and C. Rivington; and J, Mawman. The full title was ''Hours of Idleness; a Series of Poems Original and Translated. By George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor.'' It consisted of 187 pages with thirty-nine poems. Of these, nineteen came from the original ''Fugitive Piece'' volume, while eight had first appeared in ''Poems on Various Occasions''. Twelve were published for the first time. The "Fragment of a Translation from the 9th Book of Virgil's AEneid" was included as "The Episode of Nisus and Euryalus, A Paraphrase from the AEneid, Lib. 9," made up of 406 lines.

After a scathing review in ''The Edinburgh Review'' in 1808, Byron responded by publishing, anonymously, his satiric poem ''[[English Bards and Scotch Reviewers]]'' in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hours-of-Idleness ''Hours of Idleness'' by The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Retrieved 30 August, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] wrote of the volume: "The poesy of this young lord belongs to the class which neither gods nor men are said to permit." He attacked the poems as “effusions ... spread over a dead flat" like "so much stagnant water" and accused Byron of being disingenuous, “pleading his minority” while seeming at the same time to say, “See how a minor can write!” 

In a letter to [[John Cam Hobhouse]], Byron wrote of his reaction: "As an author, I am cut to atoms by the E[dinburgh] Review, it is just out, and has completely demolished my little fabric of fame."

'''''Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar''''' (''The Saga of Haakon Haakonarson'') or '''''Hákonar saga gamla Hákonarsonar''''' is an [[Old Norse]] [[kings' sagas|Kings' Saga]], telling the story of the life and reign of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]] of [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= https://snl.no/H%C3%A1konar_saga_gamla
|title= Hákonar saga gamla
|publisher=Store norske leksikon  
|author=  Knut Ødegård
|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and style==

The circumstances of the saga's composition are exceptionally well understood, as they are recorded in some detail in ''[[Sturlunga saga]]'' (particularly ''Sturlu þáttr''): the saga was written in the 1260s (apparently 1264-65) by the Icelandic historian and chieftain [[Sturla Þórðarson]] (nephew of the noted historian [[Snorri Sturluson]]). Sturla Þórðarson was at the court of Haakon's son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus Lagabøte]] when Magnus learned of his father's death in [[Kirkwall]] in [[Orkney]]. Magnus is said to have immediately commissioned Sturla to write his father's saga. This was awkward for Sturla: 'King Hákon had instigated the death of Sturla's uncle, Snorri Sturluson, in 1241.
Sturla rightly regarded Hákon as his most dangerous enemy, for he had steadfastly resisted the king's subjugation of Iceland to Norway, which was accomplished in 1262-1264. [[Skúli Bárðarson]] (d. 1240), Hákon's most dangerous rival for royal power, was the maternal grandfather of Magnús, who supervised the composition of his father's biography, much as [[Sverre of Norway|King Sverrir]] is said to have "sat over" [[Karl Jónsson]] as the Icelandic abbot wrote Sverrir's biography'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schach, 'Hákonar saga gamla Hákonarsonar', in Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 259-60 (p. 259).&lt;/ref&gt;

The saga is the main source to Norwegian history for the period from 1217 (Haakon's accession) to his death in 1263. Additionally the saga also describes events in [[Iceland]] and other locations where Haakon's realm had a presence.

'Because Sturla relied heavily on eyewitness accounts and written documentation as sources for the prose account of ''Hák[onar saga]'', the poetic citations in the saga are mainly ornamental in nature. The inclusion of the stanzas reflects the convention in the earlier kings’ sagas of using skaldic stanzas to verify the events described in the prose texts.' Nevertheless, the saga contains lots of verse, much by Sturla himself, along with some poetry by his brother [[Óláfr hvítaskáld Þórðarson]] and his uncle [[Snorri Sturluson]], [[Gizurr Þorvaldsson]]’s ''Hákonardrápa'', and numbers of ''lausarvísur'' (mostly attributed but in three cases anonymous).&lt;ref&gt;''Poetry from the Kings' Sagas 2'', ed. by Kari Ellen Gade, Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, 2 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2009), accessed from http://www.abdn.ac.uk/skaldic/db.php?id=565&amp;if=db&amp;table=doc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts and transmission==

The saga survives in three main redactions, preserved primarily in the manuscripts [[Eirspennill]], [[Codex Frisianus]], and [[Flateyjarbók]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schach, 'Hákonar saga gamla Hákonarsonar', in Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 259-60 (p. 260).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is not yet a satisfactory stemma of the saga, as the relationships between its manuscripts are complex.&lt;ref&gt;''Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, etter Sth. 8 fol., AM 325 VIII 4to og AM 304 4to'', ed. by Marina Mundt, Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt: Norrøne tekster, 2 (Oslo: Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt i kommisjon hos Forlagsentralen, 1977), pp. xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Alaux''', called "''le Romain''" ("the Roman"), (1785 &amp;ndash; 2 March 1864) was a French [[History painting|history]] [[painting|painter]] and Director of the [[French Academy in Rome]] from 1846-52.&lt;ref name="Chau"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/chautauquanorga18circgoog A director of the French Academy in Rome] (The Chautauquan: Organ of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, 1891) pp. 352-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Alaux was born in [[Bordeaux]], the son of a painter and the second of four brothers who all became painters. He received his first lessons in art from his father, but went on to a formal training with [[Pierre Lacour]] and later with [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]. In 1807 he was admitted to the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. From 1808 he entered works for the [[Prix de Rome]], but his energies were diverted when his elder brother, Jean-Francois Alaux (1783–1858), asked him to help with a large "neorama" (a type of [[Panorama]]) he was working on. Alaux eventually won the major Prix de Rome in 1815 with a work entitled "[[Briseis]] weeping over the body of [[Patroclus]]", a scene inspired by the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]]. He subsequently became a ''pensionnaire'' at the ''French Academy'' in [[Rome]] from 1816 to 1820 and went on to become its director.&lt;ref name="Chau" /&gt;

Among his fellow artists at the Academy were such luminaries as [[Michel Martin Drolling|Drolling]], [[François-Édouard Picot|Picot]], and [[Léon Cogniet|Gogniet]], and sculptors such as [[David d'Angers|Angers]], [[James Pradier|Pradier]], and [[Étienne-Jules Ramey|Ramey]]; he became a friend of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].  His first painting at the Academy was "Cadmus killing the dragon at the fountains of Dirce", which was later purchased by the [[Louis Philippe I|Duke of Orleans]] but was destroyed in the fire which engulfed the [[Palais-Royal]] in the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. Alaux also painted at the Academy "Diamedes carrying off the palladium" and "Episodes in the combats between the centaurs and the Lapithes". In 1821, he returned to France, where his reputation steadily grew with works such as "The Baptism of Clovis" (1825), "States General of 1838", "The Assembly of the notables at Rouen in 1596", and "States General 1614".&lt;ref name="Chau" /&gt; Under the [[July Monarchy]], he worked at the "Galerie des batailles" of the [[Château de Versailles]], for which he painted "The [[Battle of Villaviciosa]]" (1836); "The Capture of [[Valenciennes]]" (1837); and "The [[Battle of Denain]]" (1839).

Alaux was appointed as director of the French Academy in [[Rome]] in 1846 and was caught up in the [[Siege of Rome (1849)|siege of Rome]] of 1849, involving defending Italian forces under [[Garibaldi]] and the invading French army; he and his students were forced to temporarily flee the city for France. His directorship ended quietly with his retirement in 1852.&lt;ref name="Chau" /&gt;

Alaux died in Paris on 2 March 1864.&lt;ref name="Chau" /&gt;

'''Leilah Assunção''', or '''Leilah Assumpção''' (born Maria de Lourdes Torres de Assunção), is a Brazilian dramatist, actress and writer. She was born June 18, 1943 in [[Botucatu]], São Paulo, Brazil. She graduated from the [[University of São Paulo]] in 1964 with a degree in English and also completed extra courses in theater and literary criticism in Brazil and England. Although she is known as a playwright, she began her career working as an actress and a model, performing in ''Vereda de Salvacao'' by Jorge de Enrade in 1963 and ''The Three-penny opera'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] in 1964. From there, she transitioned into writing stories for magazines and soap operas, eventually leading into her work as a playwright.&lt;ref name=andre&gt;{{cite book|last1 = André|first1 = María|last2 = Bueno|first2 = Eva|title = Latin American Women Writers: An Encyclopedia|date = 2014|publisher = Literary Criticism|pages = 1–640|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AyzGBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate = 21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assunção has been classed as among the two major women playwrights of [[Brazil]], the other being [[Maria Adelaide Amaral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w0Lc79wP-40C&amp;pg=PA32 Tentative transgressions: homosexuality, AIDS, and the theater in Brazil by Severino João Medeiros Albuquerque, pg 32]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first play, ''Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito'' (Speak Quietly or I’ll Scream), won the [[Molière Award]] from the theatre critics of [[São Paulo]] when it was staged in 1969. She aimed to shock the audience by her choice of topic: depicting a middle-aged woman meeting an intruder. She was one of the leaders of New Theatre in the 1960s and several of her early plays were banned by censors.&lt;ref name=andre/&gt;

''Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito'' along with her two preceding plays, ''Jorginho, o machão'' and ''Roda cor de Roda'' focus majorly on the stereotypes of the middle class and emphasize that conformity to these stereotypes is required. She openly depicts the majority of her characters as stuck in their current lifestyles, unable to break away from the status quo. One commodity of her first three works is that one or more of the characters eventually break free, but not in the traditional way one would think. They break free in regards to their imaginations/fantasies. For a short time period, they are able to fantasize and imagine themselves living in a world outside of the social norms. Overall, she wrights these plays to target the repressions society’s moral standards place on people and the dissatisfaction of life that is likely to come with these repressions.&lt;ref name=milleret&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Milleret|first1 = Margo|title = Entrapment and Flights of Fantasy in Three Plays by Leilah Assunção|journal = Luso-Brazilian Review|date = 1984|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 49–56|jstor = 3513076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito'' (1969) focuses on a middle-aged woman with a very boring, standard lifestyle. One night, an intruder breaks into her house with a gun and proceeds to insult her and destroy her apartment. He forces the woman to come with him on a fantasy adventure in which the woman breaks away from her dull life and creates an ideal one. She enjoys the experience up until she remembers she has responsibilities to attend to at a local department store. This results in her screaming for help, unable to ignore the obligations of her daily life.&lt;ref name=milleret/&gt;

''Jorginho, o machão'' (1973) describes the dilemma of a young man who is pressured by his family to marry and join the family business. He rebels by fleeing to study at the University of São Paulo and then by continuing to fantasize there about what he wants his life to be like. This behavior does not help the conflict with his parents, resulting in attempted suicide.&lt;ref name=milleret/&gt;

''Roda cor de Roda'' (1973) entails the story of a housewife rebelling against her husband after she has found out he has been cheating. The results in the fantasies of role reversals, where all three of them take turns being the breadwinner, the prostitute, and the homemaker. These role changes result in many opportunities and freedoms for the characters, but also the realizations of the limitations of each role.&lt;ref name=milleret/&gt;

==History==

===The Whitestone period===

[[Henry Whitestone]] (1819–1893) was born at Clondegad House in [[County Clare, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard G.|title=Victorian Resorts and Hotels|year=1982|publisher=Victorian Society in America|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated to the United States amidst famine and depression&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Samuel W.|title=The Architectural History of Louisville|year=2009|publisher=The Filson Historical Society|location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9781889937137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with his wife Henrietta in January 1852 from Innis, Ireland after he was recommended to [[Isaiah Rogers]] (1800–1869), for his work on the County Clare Courthouse. Rogers was an architect based in Cincinnati who came to be known as "the father of the American hotel". Whitestone's first project with Rogers was the [[Capital Hotel]] in Frankfort, Kentucky and a partnership formed in November 1853 when Rogers was contracted to rebuild the recently burned Louisville Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleber|first=John|title=The Kentucky Encyclopedia|year=1992|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813117720|pages=948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitestone moved from Frankfort to Louisville and received 2/5 of all profits from the services he performed with Rogers.&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt;

The first office of Isaiah Rogers and Henry Whitestone was located at Bullit and Main Streets, near where the [[Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere]] is located today.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Louisville"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleber|first=John|title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville|year=2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813121000|pages=42, 636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they transformed Louisville into a "five-story city" and introduced the Italianate architectural style to the region. Whitestone separated from Rogers in 1857 and soon became the preeminent architecture firm in Louisville through the 1880s. Notably, Charles J. Clarke worked for Henry Whitestone during the Civil War and later formed a partnership with Arthur Loomis, to form the historically significant Louisville architecture firm ''[[Clarke and Loomis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleber|first=John|title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville|year=2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813121000|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitestone retired in approximately 1881 and died in 1893. An 1893 publishing of ''The American Architect and Building News'' wrote of Whitestone,

:''"...forty years ago, in the prime of life, he was in the active practice of his profession, erecting buildings in that perennial style of Italian Renaissance, of which he was a master, and from which he was never lured by passing fashion."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ticknor &amp; Co.|title=Vol XLI-No. 919, page 92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvgzAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22henry%20whitestone%22&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henry%20whitestone%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 20, 2014|newspaper=The American Architect and Building News|date=August 5, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried at [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in Louisville Kentucky alongside his wife and two daughters (Section C, lot 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cave Hill Cemetery|url=http://www.cavehillcemetery.com/famouspeople.php|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marker located on Main St., across from the old Louisville Hotel, bears his name.


===The D.X. Murphy era===
Dennis Xavier ("D.X.") Murphy (11/3/1853-8/27/1933), was born in Louisville after his parents immigrated from Ireland, began working as a draftsman at age 16 for Henry Whitestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberwarth|first=Clarence|title=A History of the Profession of Architecture in Kentucky|year=1987|publisher=State Board of Examiners and Registration of Architects|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1874 he was the head draftsman and eventually took over the practice in 1880 just before Whitestone's retirement. It was at this point that the firm was renamed ''D.X. Murphy''. His brothers James C. Murphy (1865-1935), later joined the practice in 1890 at which time the firm became ''D.X. Murphy and Brother''. Their younger brother Peter C. Murphy subsequently joined&lt;ref name=" Encyclopedia of Louisville" /&gt; and together they designed many of Louisville's Catholic Churches, among other many notable buildings, for significantly reduced fees on the order of 1% of construction costs. The Murphy's sister, Sr. Mary Anselm, was a nun with the [[Sisters of Charity of Nazareth]] in Bardstown, Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kentucky Historic Resources Inventory|title=St. Boniface Church Complex|url={{NRHP url|id=82001562}}|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which likely led to many of the commissionings.

The firm's most famous work was that of the Twin Spires at Churchill Downs in 1895, designed by 24-year-old Joseph D. Baldez and constructed in time for the 21st Kentucky Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bock|first=Hal|title=Steepled in Racing History : A Century for Churchill Downs' Landmark Twin Spires|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-07/sports/sp-63362_1_churchill-downs|accessdate=October 20, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of works by D.X. Murphy or the firm are listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works include:

Dennis Murphy died in 1933 and is buried at St. Louis Cemetery in Louisville.

In 1935 ''D.X. Murphy and Brother'' was sold by James Murphy's wife to ''D.X. Murphy and Brother Incorporated'' for a sum of $1,147, at which time Peter Murphy became president. By 1943, Peter Murphy was named chairman of the board and William G. O'Toole became president. Thomas D. Luckett II (1909 – 1996) became majority stakeholder in the firm upon O'Toole's passing in 1956 while Jean D. Farley (b. 1927) was named Vice President.

''D.X. Murphy and Bro., Inc'' became ''Luckett &amp; Farley, Inc'' on May 25, 1962, with T.D. Luckett and J.D. Farley sharing ownership.

D.X. Murphy occupied the old Louisville Trust Building (208 S. 5th St) until 1962 when the office was relocated to the Washington Building (4th and Market), which has since been demolished.

===Luckett &amp; Farley===

By the time the firm was renamed ''Luckett &amp; Farley Inc.'' in 1962 to reflect the change of ownership, civil and structural engineering services were also provided; Mechanical and electrical engineering services were added in 1970 in order to deliver better-coordinated construction documents to clients. By 1973 the firm name was changed to ''Luckett &amp; Farley Architects, Engineers, and Construction Managers, Inc.'' and by the end of 1982, Jean Farley sold the company to Dennis Dewitt, Ronald Kendall, and Douglas Wilkerson.

In 2000 an [[employee stock ownership plan]] (ESOP) was formed and by 2002, leadership was transferred to Ed Jerdonek, Belinda Gates, Gail Miller, and Rob Diamond. A [[design-build]] subsidiary, ''LFDB'', was created in 1999 but has since separated with the company as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eigelbach|first=Kevin|title=Luckett &amp; Farley sells interest in its design/build subsidiary|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/print-edition/2011/02/11/luckett-farley-sells-interest-in-its.html|accessdate=October 20, 2014|newspaper=Business First Louisville|date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belinda Gates retired from Luckett &amp; Farley in 2010. On January 1, 2012, Jerdonek, Miller, and Diamond sold their interest in the company to the employee-owners, making Luckett &amp; Farley 100% employee-owned. 
Luckett &amp; Farley occupied the Washington Building from 1963 to 1968 when it moved to 215 W. Breckinridge and again in 1997 to their current location in the Prince Wells Building at 737 S. Third St.

Luckett &amp; Farley utilizes [[BIM]] technology to produce their drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mariam|title=Building-information modeling improves efficiency, reduces need for changes|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/print-edition/2011/07/08/building-information-modeling-improves.html|accessdate=October 20, 2014|newspaper=Business First - Louisville|date=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mooncalf''' (or '''moon-calf''', '''calvaluna''') is a [[monstrous birth]], the [[miscarriage|abortive]] [[fetus]] of a [[Cattle|cow]] or other [[livestock|farm animal]]. The term was occasionally applied to an abortive [[human]] fetus.

The term derives from the once widespread [[superstition]], present in many [[Europe]]an [[folk medicine|folk]] traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the [[Moon]] on fetal development.

==Modern usage==
The term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], for instance, used the term to describe [[Caliban]], the deformed servant of [[Prospero]], in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]''.

In [[H. G. Wells]]' 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'', large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as "mooncalves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The First Men in the Moon]] |last=Wells |first=H. G. |authorlink=H. G. Wells |year=1901 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Mooncalf Pastures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, [[W. C. Fields]] in ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a "mooncalf" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price.

Mooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the [[Harry Potter]] series. It is described in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] |last=Rowling |first=J. K. |authorlink=J. K. Rowling |year=2001 |chapter=An A–Z of Fantastic Beasts }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film of the same name]], Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves.

Wilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of [[occult]]ist [[Dion Fortune]]’s 1938 novel, ''[[The Sea Priestess]]'', refers several times to a mentally handicapped character who falls into the sea and disappears as a "mooncalf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Sea Priestess]] |last=Fortune|first=Dion|authorlink=Dion Fortune|origyear=1938|year=1978 |at=Chapter X, p. 86, ''et infra''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Narrative [[criticism]]''' focuses on the stories a speaker or a writer tells to understand how they help us make meaning out of our daily human experiences. [[Narrative]] theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fisher | first = Walter | title = Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action | place = Columbia | publisher = U of South Carolina P | year = 1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), [[genre]] (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, [[Theme (literature) | theme]], [[irony]], foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.

Characteristics of a narrative were defined as early as [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' under plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Aristotle | title = Poetics | chapter = VI–VII}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a [[tragedy]].” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, [[climax (narrative)]], and final resolution. As described by White  (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= White |first= H |work= On Narrative |title= The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Culture |editor-first = WJT |editor-last= Mitchell |place= Chicago |publisher= U of Chicago Press |year= 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} and Martin  (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Martin | first = W | title = Recent Theories of Narrative | place = Ithaca, NY | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} plot involves a structure of action.  However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Michael Calvin | last1 = McGee | first2 = John S | last2 = Nelson | first3 = Michael | last3 = Sizemore |  year = 1990 | title = Narrative Reason in Public Argument}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}

Narratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Jasinski | title = Sourcebook on Rhetoric | place = California | publisher = Sage | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}  All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact. Sample questions from Sonja K Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sonja K | last = Foss | title = Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice | place = Illinois | publisher = Waveland | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|312-313}} offer a guide for analysis:
* Setting – How does the setting relate to the plot and characters? How is the particular setting created? Is the setting textually prominent – highly developed and detailed – or negligible?
* Characters ([[Persona]]) – Are some of the characters non-human or inanimate phenomena, described as thinking and speaking beings? In what actions do the characters engage? Are the characters round (possess a variety of traits, some of them conflicting or contradictory) or flat (one or a few dominant traits making the character predictable)?
* [[Narrator]] – Is the narrative presented directly to the audience, or is it mediated by a narrator? What makes the narrator intrusive or not? What kind of person is the narrator (examine his or her ethos)?
* Events – What are the major and minor events? How are the events presented? Are the events active (expressing action) or stative (expressing a state or condition)?
* Temporal relations – Do events occur in a brief period of time or over many years? What is the relationship between the natural order of the events as they occurred and the order of their presentation in the telling of a narrative? Is the story in past or present tense?
*[[Causal]] relations – What cause-and-effect relationships are established in the narrative? Are events caused largely by human action, accident, or forces of nature? In how much detail are the causes and effects described?
*[[Audience]] – Is the audience a participant in the events recounted? What can be inferred about the audience’s attitudes, knowledge, or situation from the narrative? What seems to be the narrator’s evaluation of the audience’s knowledge, personality, and abilities?
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]] – What is the major theme (general idea illustrated by the narrative) of the narrative? How is the theme articulated? How obvious and clear is the theme?
*Limitations: Traditional narrative criticism focuses primarily on the narrative and does not take the socioeconomic and political background into consideration; however, it is not opposed to New-Historicism theory. In addition, it does not take the narrator's motivations into consideration as it focuses on the narrative to generate the analysis. Also, as the critic looks at the overall unity of the narrative, the theory is not conducive to deconstruction techniques (19-20).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale A. Yee|Yee, Gale]].

The '''''Nativity of the Virgin''''' is a  painting by the  German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], dating to c. 1520, which is currently housed in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

==Description==
The work uses a scenic composition typical of the [[Danube school]] of the time. The subject, the birth of Mary, is shown in a secondary location of the lower part of the painting. It includes St. Anne's bed, the midwives with the daughter and St. Joachim riding a stair with something in his hand.  

The predominant part of the work is the church background, where angels fly to form a large circle: in the middle is a young angel with a [[thurible]] for the incense.
 
The edifice, symbolizing the analogy between Mary and the Catholic church (a subject later abolished by the [[Protestant Reformation]]), is organized in a complicated and original fashion: the [[ambulatory (architecture)|ambulatory]] and the  column galleries are [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], the ogival windows are [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], the vaults and the shell-shaped niches are  in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]]. This attention to architectural elements was typical of Altdorfer's work in the period he spent at the court of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Nature printing''' is a printing process, developed in the 18th century, that uses the plants, animals, rocks and other natural subjects to produce an image.  The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process.

[[Image:Nature print (Bradbury).jpg|thumb|Plate from ''The Nature-printed British Seaweeds'', (1859-60).]]

Another person attributed with the invention of the process, [[:de:Naturselbstdruck|''Naturselbstdruck'']], is [[Alois Auer]]; the first publication, of instructions for the process, was by this Austrian printer in ''The Discovery of the Natural Printing Process: an Invention ...''  Vienna, 1853. This was written in four languages by the author.  He shows the use of plants, a fossil fish, and lace impressed by roller onto a lead plate, this is hand coloured and transferred to the final print.  
[[Image:Nature print, Alois Auer.jpg|thumb|240px]]
Many others botanical and natural history illustrations had attempted to use techniques that were a 'shorthand', or for a type of accuracy, in the representation of subjects. Another printer, the Englishman [[Henry Bradbury]], immediately used Auer's 'nature printing' process to publish work of his own. These included two major botanical works; 
*''[[The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland]]'', [[Thomas Moore (botanist)|Moore, Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland; Edited by [[John Lindley]]. Nature-printed by Henry Bradbury. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;(1857) and the rendition of these species was readily adapted to the process; the two dimensional print would reveal form and detail for the identification of species.
*''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds'', W.G. Johnstone &amp; A. Croall. 1859-60.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, William Grosart &amp; Alexander Croall. ''The Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds: A History, accompanied by figures and dissections, of the algæ of the British Isles''. Four volumes. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans, 1859-60. Text available on Google books [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yaTjgEACAAJ&amp;dq=nature+printed+british+sea+weeds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy9_TitsrKAhUH4D4KHTfFCl8Q6AEILzAD here].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sherman Denton]] in his book ''As Nature Shows Them: Moths and Butterflies ...'' used the wings of the species he was describing by pressing them into the page itself. For this work he used over 50,000 insects.&lt;ref name=Dentonc1900&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denton|first1=Sherman Foote|title=As nature shows them : moths and butterflies of the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains : with over 400 photographic illustrations in the text and many transfers of species from life|page = vi|date=1900|publisher=J.B. Millet|location=Boston, U.S.A|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/45790#page/11/mode/1up|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auer method==
Auer's method can only be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, embroidery and lace, and a few animals. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes.  For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in copper by the [[electrotyping|electrotype]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Nature Printing|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newington-Cropsey Foundation''' ('''NCF''') is a nonprofit private organization based in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]]. The foundation's aim is to maintain and preserve the works of [[Jasper Cropsey]] and the art movement he was a part of, the [[Hudson River School]]. The foundation also promotes [[Representation (arts)|representational]] painting and sculpture.

The organization was founded in 1977 by Barbara and John Newington to collect and promote works of Barbara's great-grandfather Jasper Cropsey, as well as other non-abstract art.&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

The NCF offers free tours of its properties: [[Ever Rest]], the last home and studio of [[Jasper Cropsey]], and the Gallery of Art Building, a museum dedicated to the works of Cropsey. The properties are adjacent to each other in the village of Hastings-on-Hudson.

==Organization==
The foundation's stated aim is to preserve the moral, artistic and religious values of [[Jasper Cropsey]] and the [[Hudson River School]],&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; as well as to "recapture a little sense of stability, security and beauty that was so much a part of the 19th century".&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The foundation also promotes [[Representation (arts)|representational]] painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The foundation does not seek publicity, intending to stay less noticed by the general public.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; Other than including listings in local guidebooks, the NCF has no marketing.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt;

The nonprofit organization is privately owned.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The current chairman is Barbara Newington, the executive director is Adelia C. Rasines, and the foundation's director is Anthony Speiser; all three also act as trustees.&lt;ref name="Homepage"/&gt; The organization provides grants to representational artists and classes to sculptors of classical works; it also publishes ''American Arts Quarterly'', a journal for non-abstract art.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

The NCF maintains a large collection of Cropsey's paintings: about 100 oil and 30 watercolor paintings.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt; It is seen as the leading authority on Cropsey paintings.&lt;ref name="NYT4"/&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===
After Jasper Cropsey's death in 1900, his wife Maria Cropsey still lived in Ever Rest, until her death in 1906. Jasper Cropsey's granddaughter Isabel subsequently inherited the property and began buying back some of Cropsey's paintings. Isabel and her husband William Steinschneider lived there, raising their daughter Barbara in the house. William was a six-term mayor of Hastings.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melvin3"/&gt; Isabel died in 1958 and William in 1970, making William the last to live in the house; Barbara inherited it. Their daughter, married as Barbara Newington, aggressively pursued Cropsey's paintings alongside her husband John until about the 1980s, while Cropsey paintings were still inexpensive.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; Barbara and John Newington created the Newington-Cropsey Foundation and its properties in 1977 with concern over the state of modern art and "the way culture was going".&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

Newington, today the foundation's chairman, is a philanthropist living in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and is the great-granddaughter of Cropsey.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

Around 1977, the foundation traded land with the village of Hastings, giving the village land and $400,000 for a garage for its department of public works.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melvin3"/&gt; In turn, the NCF acquired a {{convert|6|acre|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt; parcel of land and the village's existing public works garage, on a site that was formerly the town dump for decades, and was called Frog Hollow around Cropsey's time.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; The NCF's initial plans were to renovate the garage, landscape the property, restore the pond, and construct steps to connect the property to Ever Rest, in total "to make [the property] look like a Cropsey painting".&lt;ref name="Melvin3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=Hastings Weighs Museum Proposal|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/01/nyregion/hastings-weighs-museum-proposal.html|date=July 1, 1984|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the NCF was among several museums and private collectors that lent items to "An Unprejudiced Eye", an exhibit of Cropsey's works. The exhibit was at the [[Hudson River Museum]] and was created by the village of Hastings, marking its association with Cropsey and its 100th anniversary. NCF art historian Kenneth Maddox organized and curated the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Raynor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raynor|first=Vivien|title=An Eye on a Hastings Artist of Old|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/30/archives/westchester-weekly-an-eye-on-a-hastings-artist-of-old.html|date=December 30, 1979|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1988, the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] cleaned up oil from Sugar Pond, a small pond on the property. The department approved the project and its environmental assessment report.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s, the NCF contracted the construction of an intricately landscaped 19th-century arts complex with three buildings, a pond, and a garden, designed by Peter Gisolfi Associates of Hastings.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The first building, the New Studio, opened in 1990 with an exhibition of paintings by Hudson River School artist [[Worthington Whittredge]]. The site was also slated to include a gatekeeper's cottage, a library and administration center, an outdoor amphitheater, as well as a {{convert|10000|sqft|adj=on}} museum, which was to be completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="Melvin2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=Cropsey Art Complex To Open First Building|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/nyregion/cropsey-art-complex-to-open-first-building.html|date=December 2, 1990|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial planning phase for the complex, the village's historical society intervened, expressing curiosity over possible remains in the ravine. The society urged the village's planning board to put a hold on construction so the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] could make preliminary tests in the ravine. The historical society president described the site as "our village's cradle of civilization – where our early industry started"; another member of the society expressed that the site was "the least-disturbed 19th-century industrial site in Westchester County". The executive director of the Westchester County Historical Society (a former president of the Hastings Historical Society) supported an archaeological study, and described that the site was previously the confluence of two streams where three early mills operated, including a bone mill and brass and iron-turning factory. Since then, the site was home to the Hastings Pavement and Brick factory, the Cottlet Hotel, and a Hastings Department of Public Works building. The public works building's foundation still remained, and the NCF had planned to build on top of it. The NCF was opposed to archaeological studies as it would require dynamiting the foundation and would disturb the fragile site, including a 125-year-old retaining wall. Greg Wyatt, director of the project, was concerned delays would lead to costs excessive of their $2.7 million budget. The construction was approved pending the archaeological study, paid for by the NCF and directed by a state-approved archaeologist with a specialty in early industry.&lt;ref name="Brenner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=Elsa|title=Art and Archeology Clash Over Ravine Near Cropsey Studio|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/nyregion/art-and-archeology-clash-over-ravine-near-cropsey-studio.html|date=September 10, 1989|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Newington was considered a friend of the Hastings Historical Society, and had given the organization its first substantial home. The NCF gave them a $42,000 grant and a 5-year $1 lease to a cottage next to Ever Rest, which the historical society used until its relocation to its current home, the [[Henry Draper Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Melvin1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Tessa|title=In Hastings, A Treasury of History|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/nyregion/in-hastings-a-treasury-of-history.html|date=February 7, 1988|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallery of Art opened on October 16, 1994.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt;

===Garden of Great Ideas===
[[File:Central Library of Vanderbilt University.JPG|thumb|''Tree of Learning'' by [[Greg Wyatt]], in front of [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Heard Library|Central Library]]]]
Beginning in May 1997, the foundation partnered with [[Vanderbilt University]] to create a sculpture garden on the university campus, to be known as the "Garden of Great Ideas".&lt;ref name="Van2"/&gt; Then-US Republican Senator [[Fred Thompson]] brought the idea of the sculpture garden to the university's chancellor [[Joe B. Wyatt]], who visited the NCF and decided to partner with the organization.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt; 

Students of the NCF's Academy of Art, including six young artists, would create the bronze sculptures. The NCF's goal was the placement of many sculptures on numerous college campuses as a link between scholarship and artistry. By 1997, the NCF had already donated ''Bill of Rights Eagle'', a sculpture by  NCF Academy of Art Director [[Greg Wyatt]] to the college. The NCF planned to donate 15 to 20 additional bronze sculptures by the students for permanent exhibiton,&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt; added over the following three to five years. The final piece would also be by Wyatt, a sculpture named ''Tree of Knowledge'' placed in front of the [[Jean and Alexander Heard Library]].&lt;ref name="Van2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shick|first=Ellie|title='Garden of Great Ideas' brings original sculptures to campus|newspaper=Vanderbilt Register|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=7560.html|date=May 5, 1997|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Jamie Lawson|title=Newington-Cropsey artists visit campus, present proposals for bronze works|newspaper=Vanderbilt Register|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=9297.html|date=October 27, 1997|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art program had numerous criticisms. The university's art community and faculty were largely not consulted on the decision. One professor at the school expressed dismay that the "program is nowhere near the avant-garde of our own age", and that the sculptures were placed in so many areas of the campus that it could impede other gifts or exhibitions on campus. An art professor found the sculptures to not achieve the school's goals of quality and diversity, noting one material, one presentation, and generic ideas symbolized by the works. As well, 
no Vanderbilt students were among the student artists.&lt;ref name="Pulle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulle|first=Matt|title=Not-So-Fine Art|newspaper=[[Nashville Scene]]|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13005115/notsofine-art|date=November 16, 2000|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tree of Learning'' provoked the most opposition from professors, seen as a "boring and unchallenging" reproduction of a barren or burnt dead tree. Judson Newbern, associate vice chancellor of the college, admitted the tree looks dead, and requested Wyatt weld leaves and buds onto his work. Newbern did defend the program overall, and noted that the student artists are diverse in ethnicity and gender.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt;

A committee of professors was not created to approve this project as the vice chancellor did not want the project to be a missed opportunity if obstacles came up. It was noted that the NCF appeared right-leaning, with stated goals to "advance and promote the values inherent in the 19th century...including the belief that God created nature". The NCF also promotes "strong national pride in America". Professor Cecilia Tichi was against the works for their values, in believing that campuses are a place to stretch people's minds.&lt;ref name="Pulle"/&gt;

===Further history===
Sculptor Joseph Petrovics, who sculpted the [[National Iwo Jima Memorial]] and the [[FDNY memorial wall]], was a Studio Instructor at the Newington-Cropsey Foundation Academy of Art beginning in 1993.&lt;ref name="Aristos"/&gt;

From 1994 until about 2005, the NCF hosted the Hudson Valley Art Association's Annual Exhibition; Newington and the foundation had been long-time supporters of the association, which was established by a small group of artists who first met at Ever Rest in 1928.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HVAA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudman|first=Joan|title=The History of the Hudson Valley Art Association|publisher=Hudson Valley Art Association|url=https://www.hudsonart.org/history|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NCF spent $500,000 to create a Christian [[docudrama]] ''Lost Letters of Faith'', a story about King [[Abgar of Edessa]]. The foundation filmed the production at [[Regent University]]. Terry Lindvall, a film and religious studies scholar and a former president of Regent University, assembled filmmakers for the drama.&lt;ref name="Vegh"/&gt; Another of their film projects, called ''Cradle of Genius'', focused on [[divine inspiration]] and the composers [[Brahms]], [[Puccini]], and [[Richard Strauss]]. It was based on Arthur Abell's ''Talks with Great Composers''.&lt;ref name="Cradle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle of Genius: Newington Cropsey Foundation Production|url=http://www.newingtoncropsey.com/ncffilm/cradle/cradle.htm|date=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312014736/http://www.newingtoncropsey.com/ncffilm/cradle/cradle.htm|archive-date=March 12, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 to 2017, Greg Wyatt installed a series of busts at the [[Boscobel (mansion)|Boscobel House and Gardens]] in [[Garrison, New York]]. Adjacent to the house, the property contains a permanent sculpture garden with ten bronze busts of significant Hudson River School artists. The sculptures are by Wyatt and were donated by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. Boscobel was chosen to house the works because of its location in the [[Hudson Highlands]], which was a popular subject of the school's painters, and because the area roughly lies in the geographic center of Hudson River School artist homes and the landscapes that they painted. The busts include a biography of each artist, on the back of each sculpture, and the works also combine elements of the Hudson River School artists' paintings into them.&lt;ref name="BHG-NCF"&gt;{{cite news|last=Deffenbaugh|first=Ryan|title=Boscobel Sculptures Capture Hudson River School|newspaper=Wag Magazine|url=http://www.wagmag.com/boscobel-sculptures-capture-hudson-river-school/|date=September 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden opened with three works in late 2015, and an additional seven were added by November 2017 when the site was dedicated.&lt;ref name="2016AR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boscobel House and Gardens: 2016 Annual Report|publisher=Boscobel House and Gardens|page=4|url=https://www.boscobel.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Boscobel-2016-Annual-Report.pdf|date=2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever Rest and the Gallery of Art are part of the Hudson River School Art Trail, a project of the [[Thomas Cole National Historic Site]].&lt;ref name="ArtTrail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTArtTrail"/&gt;

==Ever Rest==
[[File:NCF Ever Rest.jpg|thumb|Cropsey's home [[Ever Rest]]]]
[[Ever Rest]], the cottage and last home of Jasper Cropsey, is a {{convert|4.5|acre|adj=on}} site managed by the foundation. The site is at 49 Washington Avenue in Hastings.&lt;ref name="Faber"&gt;{{cite news|last=Faber|first=Harold|title=The Legacy of the Hudson River School|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/10/arts/the-legacy-of-the-hudson-river-school.html|date=June 10, 1988|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home is open for free tours by appointment as a [[historic house museum]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The bright yellow [[board-and-batten]]&lt;ref name="Faber"/&gt; [[Carpenter Gothic]]&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; cottage is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]],&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; and was Cropsey's home from 1885 until his death in 1900.&lt;ref name="Haller"/&gt; The home houses about 40 to 50 of Cropsey's works, including many watercolors.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt;

==Gallery of Art==
The Gallery of Art building is located in a ravine {{convert|60|ft}}&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt; beneath Ever Rest, overlooking the nearby Hudson River and [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|the Palisades]] and behind a commuter parking lot of the [[Hastings-on-Hudson station|Hastings-on-Hudson]] Metro-North station.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt; There lies a small campus of buildings, including an archive of Cropsey's papers.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; The site's administration building houses the office of ''American Arts Quarterly'', a publication for Hudson River Realistic painting, with a circulation of about 3,000. The upper floor has a library with about 4,000 books on 19th century painting, along with a computer library and databanks.&lt;ref name="Brenner"/&gt;

The museum is dedicated to the paintings and sculptures of Cropsey and other artists of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; It holds roughly 75 paintings of Cropsey's, many with scenes from England and Rome, where Cropsey visited, and allegorical works from the 1850s.&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt; It is open for free tours by appointment.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

Polites of PolitesCook Architects.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Along with the surrounding landscape, it was constructed at a cost of about $4 million.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The building was designed to resemble a relic from a paste era, recapturing beauty and stability of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The building uses many principles of classical architecture, including sunlight directed onto the rotunda's floor.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

''New York Times'' art critic [[Roberta Smith]] found the building to be "garishly inappropriate and amateurish", with "badly scaled architecture". She noted that the building's main gallery has Cropsey paintings hung well above eye level, poorly lit, and with unlabeled and overcleaned paintings. She found Cropsey's works better-suited and more easy to see at Ever Rest.&lt;ref name="NYT5"/&gt;

===Exterior===
The building's exterior has wrought iron doors and a canopy, along with arches and turrets.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The parkland surrounding and in front of the gallery includes a [[duck pond]] with [[duck house]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

===Interior===
The rotunda was modeled after the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]];&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; its terrazzo floor was modeled after the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]] in Rome. The rotunda also has friezes of scenes of [[History of the Hudson River|Hudson River history]]. Surrounding the rotunda walls is an inscribed quotation from Cropsey:&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;
{{bquote|Ambition may be praiseworthy when its aim is that of excellence and the fountain from which it draws nourishment that of almighty wisdom.|Jasper Francis Cropsey&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;}}

The main gallery is an octagonal Victorian room with maroon-flocked wallpaper above dark oak wainscoting and a timber ceiling, with a large oak staircase to the second floor.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The room features Cropsey paintings from its floor to ceiling; the light is kept low, allowing the paintings to glow.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; It was designed after Hudson River houses including Ever Rest and [[Lyndhurst (mansion)|Lyndhurst]]. [[David Linley]] designed furniture in the building.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The building also has commissioned sculptures and religious statues, including a replica of [[Abgar V#The Letter of King Abgar to Jesus|an inscribed]] [[lintel]], with a message from King [[Abgar of Edessa]] to Jesus Christ. The building holds a research library of Hudson River School art and painters, which the organization aims to make the most complete resource for artists of the school within Westchester County.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt; The space also has a gallery for temporary exhibitions by contemporary representational artists.&lt;ref name="Barolini"/&gt;

[[File:Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo - Google Art Project.jpg|260px|thumbnail|right|The Physician Yutog Yontan Gonpo]]
'''The Portrait of Yutog Yontan Gonpo''' is a 17th-century [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[thangka]] of the [[lama]] and the [[physician]] [[Yutog Yontan Gonpo]] (traditionally 708 - 833&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itmonline.org/arts/tibherbs.htm Institute for Traditional Medicine: Tibetan Herbal Medicine] by Subhuti Dharmananda&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Tibet]], now in the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York. This style of Tibetan thangka painting is called 'tsal thang' with [[gold]] on a [[vermilion]] ground.

The figure of Yutog Yontan Gonpo is often portrayed surrounded by the five buddhas above, the eight Medicine Goddesses at the sides, his special [[yidam]] Black [[Hayagriva]] accompanied by four goddesses below. The protector [[Mahakala]] Shanglon Dorje Dradul typically placed at the bottom center is accompanied by eight fearsome wrathful protector deities with one face and two or four hands, each riding a [[vahana]]. Four of the retinue figures ride atop wild animal or zombie mounts and each of those has nine heads.

The portrait depicts a clean shaven Gonpo as he stretches the right arm forward across the knee in the [[mudra]] of generosity while holding the stem of a pink lotus flower blossoming over the shoulder supporting the [[wisdom book (attribute)|wisdom book]] and [[sword (attribute)|sword]]. The left placed at the heart holds the stem of another lotus, blossoming over the left shoulder, supporting a [[gold]] [[vajra]] and medicinal nectar vase topped with precious [[cintamani|jewels]]. With a headdress of red flower blossoms, he wears a long flowing garment typical of a layman, trimmed with blue and tied with a red sash. He is surrounded by a blue-orange [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] and dark green [[aureola]]. In front, an ornate table supports a large bowl of [[myrobalan]] fruit and precious jewels.

At the top center is the buddha [[Akshobhya]] with one face and two hands holding to the heart with the right a vajra sceptre and with the left a skullcup in the lap. Seated in vajra posture he embraces the consort. At the left is the [[Ratnasambhava]] holding a jewel to the heart and embracing the consort. Below is buddha [[Vairochana]] holding a wheel to the heart. At the right is buddha Amitabha holding a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower. Below the buddha [[Amoghasiddhi]] is holding a visva-vajra to the heart surrounded by radiant light.

At the middle right and left are four standing goddesses holding a [[flute]], [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[lute]] and a [[mirror]]. Beautiful in appearance with flowing garments they stand on lotus seats surrounded by light.

At the bottom center is the Medicine Buddha in the form of a wrathful tutelary deity, Black Hayagriva, with one face, and three eyes with a head crowned with a single green [[horse]] head. The right hand holds aloft a curved knife ''([[kartika (knife)|kartika]])'' and in the left a skullcup ''([[kapala]])'' to the heart. On the rear of [[Hayagriva]] two large black wings are unfurled. At the right and left stand four goddesses each with one face and two hands holding aloft in the right a curved knife and a skullcup to the heart with the left, carrying a katvanga staff in the bend of the elbow. Adorned with a tiara of five skulls and various bone ornaments, they each stand on the left leg in a dancing posture surrounded again by radiant light.

A '''production team''' is the group of technical staff who produce a play, [[television show]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], or film.  Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating of a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertize is required, or how long they are involved in the project.  For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the [[running crew]], but also the [[theatrical producer]], [[designer]]s and [[theatre direction]].

A [[production company]] in [[filmmaking]] is composed of a [[film crew]] and a [[television crew]] in [[video production]].

In music, the term ''production team'' typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of "[[record producer]]" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include [[Matmos]] and [[D-Influence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The '''Public Monuments and Sculpture Association''', or PMSA, was established in 1991 to bring together individuals and organisations with an interest in British public sculptures and monuments, their production, preservation and history.

The primary aim of the PMSA is to heighten public awareness of [[UK|Britain]]'s monumental heritage— past, present, and future—through activities, publications and dialogue. It campaigns for the listing, preservation, protection and restoration of public monuments and sculpture, covering a period from the Stuart monarchy to the present day. As well as campaigning for historic monuments and public sculpture, the PMSA has been active in promoting the commissioning of new public monuments and sculpture.

The PMSA's founding members were Jo Darke, with the writer, lecturer and broadcaster Paul Atterbury, Ian Leith of the [[English Heritage Archive|National Monuments Record]], and Catherine Moriarty, then Co-ordinator of the [[UK National Inventory of War Memorials|National Inventory of War Memorials]], which was founded in 1989 to create a database of war memorials throughout the UK.

From the beginning, the PMSA was actively encouraged by the writer and sculpture scholar [[Benedict Read]], and by Andrew and Janet Naylor, metal sculpture conservators. Subscriptions were opened in May 1991 and membership has now stabilised at around 250. Since 1991, the PMSA has initiated the National Recording Project and collaborated with the publishers [[Liverpool University Press]] on the acclaimed series ''Public Sculpture of Britain'', and has established the much respected bi-annual Sculpture Journal. It has set up events, conferences and publications in collaboration with English Heritage, the UK Institute of Conservators, [[University College Dublin]] and many other similar institutions. The PMSA operates an advisory service and distributes newsletters and newssheets to its members.

The latest projects include collaboration with other organisations and individuals to oversee production of the Custodians Handbook, published in 2005 and occasionally updated. It was designed to give guidance to families and individuals who inherit sculptors' works, studios, archives and memorabilia; and the campaign Save our Sculpture (SoS) was set to encourage concerned members of the public to keep watch over their neighbourhood sculptures, and to report damage or negligence to the PMSA. Another project is creating a digital database of public sculptures and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/05032014-digital-database-uk-sculpture-planned|title=Digital database planned for UK sculpture| first=Geraldine| last=Kendall| date=5 March 2014| journal=[[Museums Journal]]| accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association is a charitable company which is run by a board comprising its Director and the Trustees, known as the General Committee. Ad hoc sub-committees are established to organise events, projects or campaigns.

The President of the PMSA is the Duke of Gloucester and the chairman is John Lewis, OBE. It is based at 70 [[Cowcross Street]], London.&lt;ref name=PMSA&gt;{{cite web| title=Contact us| url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/about/contact-us/| website=PMSA| accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RAFM Company, Inc.''' of [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]] is a producer of [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]], reference materials, and board games. RAFM has produced games, reference materials, and their own lines of miniature figures in 15&amp;nbsp;mm, 20&amp;nbsp;mm, 25&amp;nbsp;mm, and 28&amp;nbsp;mm scales since 1977. Their games concern soldiers, adventurers, and monsters inspired by history and fiction, and their products are sold at gaming conventions, in hobby shops, and by mail order for use in role playing games, wargaming, dioramas, competitive painting, and collecting. The company is best known for its ''Baker Company'' (WW2 Rules &amp; Miniatures 20mm), ''Charlie Company'' (Vietnam Rules &amp; Miniatures 20mm), ''Death in the Dark'' (28mm Fantasy Board Game), RAFM historical miniatures, ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' miniatures, fantasy miniatures (featuring the new ''Iron Lords'' line of 28mm figures), ''[[Space: 1889]]'' figures, historical source materials, and pewter dice.

==History==
RAFM was founded in 1977 by a group of [[wargaming]] enthusiasts in [[Paris, Ontario]] to publish a set of miniature battles rules called ''The Universal Soldier: Wargame Rules for Ancient, Medieval and Pike and Shot'' (1977) by Patrick Jenkins, John Laing, Colin McClelland, and Paul Sharpe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Initially, RAFM focused on publications for the historical gaming, particularly the wars of the 18th and 19th centuries. Like their contemporaries at [[Ral Partha Enterprises]] and [[Grenadier Models Inc.]], the company found that their efforts were best directed at the rapidly expanding market in fantasy games. Bob Murch began sculpting for RAFM in the early 1980s and remained their primary sculptor until he began [[Pulp Figures]] in 2002. The company started as a partnership among the principal owners until John Laing moved to England in 1987 and left the partnership. Jack Van Schaik has been the president and part-owner of the company since the beginning. In 1999 RAFM Company Inc. became a subsidiary of Van Schaik's Silver Fox Productions and the RAFM headquarters was moved to [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]].  In addition to their own lines, RAFM was the long-time caster and Canadian distributor for [[Ral Partha Enterprises]], [[Citadel Miniatures]], and currently distribute figures of [[Reaper Miniatures]] of [[Denton, Texas]].

==Miniatures and publications==

RAFM's miniatures are typically unmarked and in order to be identified must be matched to pictures and descriptions in product catalogs. Catalogs were produced in 1986 Canada,&lt;ref name =RafmCan86&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1986 Catalogue.'' (Canadian, gold cover)&lt;/ref&gt; 1986 U.S.,&lt;ref name =RafmUS86&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1986 Catalogue.'' (U.S., green cover)&lt;/ref&gt; 1987 Canada,&lt;ref name =RafmCan87&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1987 Catalogue (Canada).''&lt;/ref&gt; 1989-90 U.S.,&lt;ref name =RafmUS89&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1989-90 Catalogue (U.S.).''&lt;/ref&gt; 1994&lt;ref name =Rafm94&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1994 Catalogue.''&lt;/ref&gt; 1996 Update #1,&lt;ref name =Rafm96.1&gt;''Rafm Company, Inc. 1996 Update #1.''&lt;/ref&gt; 2005,&lt;ref name =Rafm05&gt;''Rafm Miniatures 2005 Silver Fox Productions, Inc.''&lt;/ref&gt; 2006,&lt;ref name =Rafm06&gt;''RAFM Miniatures Catalogue 2006.''&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009.&lt;ref name =Rafm09&gt;''USX Modern Day Heroes.''&lt;/ref&gt;

RAFM was also the Canadian caster and distributor of [[Ral Partha Enterprises]] and [[Citadel Miniatures]] carrying most of their lines. RAFM tended to preserve older manufacturer's codes. For example, when Ral Partha switched to all numeric product codes in early 1980, RAFM continued production with the originals. In the 1990s RAFM distributed [[Frei Korps 15]]'s ''Yellow Ribbon'' line of 15mm figures for the American Wild West (YR01-YR18), another series for the American Civil War (7000-7011).&lt;ref name =Rafm94/&gt; A one time sculptor for RAFM, Bob Ridolfi's sculpts and others are licensed by [[Reaper Miniatures]] for distribution in Canada. Rafm also produced miniatures for GHQ and [[Martian Metals]] in the 1980s. Contracts were also signed with Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear, Global Games and Palladium's Rifts.

Unless otherwise noted, RAFM's miniatures were designed by the prolific Bob Murch and produced in 25mm scale. Other sculptors included Murch's apprentice Stephen Koo, Carol Moyer, James Johnson, and Bill Schwarz who specializes in the engines and vehicles of war throughout history. In recent years the boss' sons James and Brock Van Schaik have become accomplished sculptors.

The colour red and the star are symbols of communism; grains are often used to represent agriculture, farmers, or the common people, the cogwheel or other industrial tools represent the industrial proletariat.]]

'''[[Socialist]] [[heraldry]]''', also called '''[[communist]] heraldry''', consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by [[communist state]]s and filled with [[communist symbolism]]. Although commonly called ''[[coat of arms|coats of arms]]'', most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all.&lt;ref name="von Volborth"&gt;{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth|date= 1981|title= Heraldry – Customs, Rules and Styles|location= Ware, Hertfordshire|publisher= Omega Books Ltd.|page= 11|isbn= 0-907853-47-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of [[European heraldry]] in order to distance themselves from the [[monarchy|monarchies]] that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.

The [[Soviet Union]] was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after [[World War II]], when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist (or communist) states have adopted the style, for various reasons—usually because [[Wars of national liberation|communists had helped them to gain independence]]—but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the [[emblem of Italy]].&lt;ref name="von Volborth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="von Volborth 1972"&gt;{{cite book |last= von Volborth|first= Carl-Alexander|author-link1= Carl-Alexander von Volborth| date= 1972 | title= Alverdens heraldik i farver | language=Danish | others=Editor and translator from English to Danish: [[Sven Tito Achen]] | location= Copenhagen | publisher=Politikens Forlag |page= 158|isbn= 87 567 1685 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989–1991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.

==Origin and history==
[[File:State Emblem of the Soviet Union.svg|thumb|right|200px|Soviet leaders sought to distinguish their insignia from the emblems used by the Russian Emperor and aristocracy. They replaced and omitted the traditional heraldic devices, substituting an emblem that did not conform to traditional European practices.]]

The [[Soviet Union]], created after the 1917 revolution, required insignia to represent itself in line with other sovereign states, such as emblems, flags and seals, but the Soviet leaders did not wish to continue the old heraldic practices which they saw as associated with the societal system the revolution sought to replace. In response to the needs and wishes, the national emblem adopted would lack the traditional heraldic elements of a shield, helm, crest and mantling, and instead be presented more plainly. This style was followed then by other socialist and communist states, which wished to also focus attention on the nation's workers and diverge from feudalism and all of its associations.&lt;ref name="von Volborth 1972"/&gt;

In some communist countries, the socialist heraldry was never adopted fully. The [[coat of arms of Poland]] was only changed slightly under the communist era, retaining the traditional heraldic form. In Hungary, the [[coat of arms of Hungary#Changes during the 20th Century|"Rákosi badge"]], an emblem in the form of socialist heraldry, was adopted following the Second World War, but after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 uprising]], a [[coat of arms of Hungary#Changes during the 20th Century|new emblem]] was created combining communist symbolism with a heraldic shield in the colours of the Hungarian flag. Czechoslovakia became a Communist country in 1948 but retained its original coat of arms until 1961, when they were replaced with a [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia#After 1960|non-traditional shield]] depicting the heraldic Bohemian lion without a crown and with a red star above head. Some of the states of Yugoslavia also used heraldic shields coupled with socialist imagery in their emblems, as did two republics within the USSR: the [[Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and the [[Emblem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

==Characteristics==
{{unsourced section|date=July 2014}}
Socialist heraldry typically makes use of the following symbols:
* [[Hammer and sickle]], representing respectively the workers and peasantry. More rarely, a hammer may be used on its own, to represent the working class(es) as a whole.
* The five-pointed [[Red star]], representing the five fingers of the worker's hand and the five continents on the earth. Often displayed with a yellow border, or a yellow five-pointed star, often on a red background 
* [[Wreath of wheat ears|Wreaths of]] [[grain]] or other [[List of domesticated plants|domesticated plants]] encircling the emblem, representing agriculture and plenty
* Interwoven [[ribbon]]s in national and/or red colors, sometimes used for a motto
* Single or multiple [[gear]]s, often crossed, representing industry
* [[The Sun in culture|The rising sun]], representing revolution
* [[Earth]]
* [[Landscape]]s
* Books, representing the intelligentsia.
* Modern industrial accessories such as [[cogwheel]]s and [[electricity pylon]]s

==Present==
With the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc in Europe, most of these countries' socialist heraldry has been replaced with old pre-communist symbols or by wholly new coats of arms.

Socialist heraldry is still seen in the emblems of several countries, such as the [[emblem of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Emblem of North Korea|North Korea]] has a national emblem in pure socialist style, as does [[emblem of Vietnam|Vietnam]].

During the infancy years of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] (the successor to the Soviet Union), the country used the modified version of the [[Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|emblem of the RSFSR]] with the inscription was changed from ''RSFSR (РСФСР)'' to the ''Russian Federation (Российская Федерация/Rossiyskaya Federaciya)'' until the new coat of arms was adopted in 1993. The [[national emblem of Belarus]] was adopted in 1995 following a controversial [[Belarusian referendum, 1995|referendum]]. It is reminiscent of that of the [[Coat of arms of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] and replaced the coat of arms of 1991-1995 which followed the traditional heraldic style. [[Emblem of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] and [[Emblem of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] retained components of their [[Coat of arms of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|respective]] [[Coat of arms of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|republics]] for similar reasons.

The [[coat of arms of the Republic of Macedonia|national emblem of Macedonia]] is reminiscent of that of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] (once a constituent socialist republic of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).

In Africa, the emblems of [[insignia of Angola|Angola]] and [[coat of arms of Mozambique|Mozambique]], as well as [[Emblem of Algeria|Algeria]], use socialist heraldry.

The [[Serbia|Republic of Serbia]] used the [[coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;Law on the use of the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia ({{lang-sr|Zakon o upotrebi grba Socijalisticke Republike Srbije}} ("SG SRS", br. 6/1985.)&lt;/ref&gt; until the recommended [[Coat of arms of Serbia|symbols]] by the National Assembly on August 17, 2004. The recommended usage was made Law on May 11, 2009 thus officially replacing the socialist heraldic Coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Zakon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Zakon o izgledu i upotrebi grba, zastave i himne Republike Srbije |trans-title=Law on the Appearance and Use of the Coat of arms, the Flag and the Anthem of the Republic of Serbia |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia – No. 36/2009 |publisher=Narodna skupština Republike Srbije – JP "Službeni glasnik" |publication-date=2009-05-11 |date=2009-05-19 |url=http://www.parlament.sr.gov.yu/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=549&amp;t=Z |accessdate=2009-12-15 |language=Serbian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802105145/http://www.parlament.sr.gov.yu/content/lat/akta/akta_detalji.asp?Id=549&amp;t=Z |archivedate=2009-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also exclude emblems which were a mix of traditional heraldry and socialist symbolism, like the present arms of [[coat of arms of São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé e Príncipe]] and of [[coat of arms of East Timor|East Timor]], the 1960-1990 [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia#Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1960-1990)|Emblem of Czechoslovakia]], or the 1974-2008 [[state seal of Burma]], or traditional heraldic coats of arms of socialist countries, like those of [[coat of arms of Guyana|Guyana]], [[coat of arms of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[coat of arms of Cuba|Cuba]].

===Current emblems===
&lt;!--Do not remove emblems of non-Communist/non-Socialist States, or add traditionally heraldic emblems of Communist/Socialist States. As, stated in the Talk Page, This is after all an article about emblem styles, not about type of government. The Emblems of Czechoslovakia and Cuba are unambiguously traditional, non-socialist heraldry. Please DO NOT put them in in spite of the socialist ideology of the countries they represent.--&gt;

Retrieved 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Bury's publications focus on [[artists' books]], which he has defined as "books or book-like objects over the final appearance of which an artist has had a high degree of control; where the book is intended as a work of art in itself."&lt;ref&gt;Bury, Stephen (1995) ''Artist's Books: The Book As a Work of Art, 1963–1995'' (Scolar Press), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''Artist's Books: The Book As a Work of Art, 1963–1995'' of 1995 (to be re-issued in May 2015), which combines a series of incisive essays on historical aspects of the medium with an extensive bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;Markovich, Kristine (1996). "''Artist's Books: The Book As a Work of Art, 1963-1995'' by Stephen Bury (Review)." ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' 15, no. 1 (Spring 1996): 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he published ''Artists' Multiples'' and ''Multiplication'', and in 2007, ''Breaking the Rules: The Printed Face of the European Avant-Garde, 1990–1937'' appeared. He has had an artists' book column in [[Art Monthly]] since 1997. He also regularly contributes to [http://www.cassone-art.com/ Cassone].

==Curating==

Bury curated the exhibition "Breaking the Rules" at the British Library in 2007-2008.&lt;ref&gt; British Library (2007). [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/homepage.html/ "Breaking the Rules: The Printed Face of the European Avant Garde 1900-1937"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212709/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/homepage.html |date=2016-03-04 }}.

'''''The Hiding Place''''' is a 1971 book on the life of [[Corrie ten Boom]], written by ten Boom together with [[John and Elizabeth Sherrill]].

The idea of a book on ten Boom's life began as John and Elizabeth Sherrill were doing research for the book ''[[God's Smuggler]]'', about ten Boom's fellow Dutchman, [[Andrew van der Bijl]].  Corrie ten Boom was already in her mid-seventies when the Sherrills first heard about her. She was one of Brother Andrew's favorite traveling companions and many of his recollections were about her. In the preface to the book, the Sherrills recount:

:''...his [Brother Andrew's] fascinating stories about her in Vietnam, where she had earned that most honorable title "Double-old Grandmother" - and in a dozen other Communist countries - came to mind so often that we finally had to hold up her hands to stop his flow of reminiscence. "We could never fit her into the book," we said. "She sounds like a book in herself." It's the sort of thing you say. Not meaning anything.''

It was later made into a [[The Hiding Place (film)|film of the same name]], along with a comic book adaptation.

The title refers to both the physical hiding place where the ten Boom family hid [[Jew]]s from the [[Nazi]]s, and also to the Scriptural message found in Psalm 119:114 which states, "Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word...

The book begins with the ten Boom family celebrating the 100th anniversary of the family [[watch]] and watch repair business, now run by the family's elderly father, [[Casper ten Boom]]. The business took up the ground floor of the family home (known as the Béjé). Casper lived with his unmarried daughters Corrie (the narrator and a watchmaker herself) and [[Betsie ten Boom|Betsie]], who took care of the house. It seemed as if everyone in the Dutch town of [[Haarlem]] had shown up to the party, including Corrie's sister Nollie, her brother Willem, and her nephews Peter and Kik. Willem, a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], brought a Jewish man, who had just escaped from Germany, as a guest. The man's beard had been burned off by some thugs, a grim reminder of what was happening just to the east of the Netherlands.

In the next few chapters, Corrie talks about her childhood, her infirm but glad-hearted mother, and the three aunts who once lived in the Béjé. She talks about the only man she ever loved, a young man named Karel, who ultimately married a woman from a rich family.

Eventually, both Nollie and Willem married. After the deaths of Corrie's mother and aunts, Corrie, Betsie, and their father settled down into a pleasant, domestic life. Then, in 1940, the [[Nazi]]s invaded the Netherlands.

The family had strong morals based on Christian beliefs, and they felt obligated to help their [[Jewish]] friends in every way possible. The Béjé soon became the center for a major anti-Nazi operation. Corrie, who had grown to think of herself as a middle-aged spinster, found herself involved in [[black market]] operations, using stolen [[ration card]]s, and eventually hiding Jews in her own home.

Corrie suffered a moral crisis over the lying, theft, [[forgery]], and [[bribery]] that was necessary to keep the Jews her family was hiding alive. Moreover, it was unlikely that her family would get away with helping Jews for long, as they had nowhere to hide them. The [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] arranged for a secret room to be built in the Béjé, so the Jews would have a place to hide in the event of an inevitable raid.

It was a constant struggle for Corrie to keep the Jews safe; she sacrificed her own safety and part of her own personal room to give constant safety to the Jews. Rolf, a police officer friend, trained her to be able to think clearly anytime in case the Nazis invaded her home and started to question her.

When a man asked Corrie to help his wife, who had been arrested, Corrie agreed, but with misgivings. As it turned out, the man was a spy, and the watch shop was raided. The entire ten Boom family was arrested, along with the shop employees, though the Jews managed to hide themselves in the secret room.

Casper was in his mid-eighties by this time, and a Nazi official offered to let him go, provided he made no more trouble. Casper did not agree to this, and was shipped to prison. It was later learned he had died ten days later.

Meanwhile, Corrie was sent to [[Scheveningen]], a Dutch prison which was used by the Nazis for political prisoners, nicknamed 'Oranjehotel'--a hotel for people loyal to the [[House of Orange]].  She later learned that her sister was being held in another cell, and that, aside from her father, all other family members and friends had been released. A coded letter from Nollie revealed that the hidden Jews were safe. While at Scheveningen, Corrie befriended a depressed Nazi officer, who arranged a brief meeting with her family, under the pretense of reading Casper's will. Corrie was horrified to see how ill Willem was, as he had contracted [[jaundice]] in prison. He would eventually die from his illness in 1946. Corrie also learned that her nephew, Kik, had been captured while working with the Dutch underground. He had been killed, though the family did not learn of this until 1953.

After four months at Scheveningen, Corrie and Betsie were transferred to [[Vught#World War II|Vught]], a concentration camp for political prisoners in Netherlands. Corrie was assigned to a factory that made radios for aircraft. The work was not hard, and the prisoner-foreman, Mr. Moorman, was kind. Betsie, whose health was starting to fail, was sent to work sewing prison uniforms.

When a counter-offensive against the Nazis seemed imminent, the prisoners were shipped by train to Germany, where they were imprisoned at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], a notorious women's concentration camp. The conditions there were hellish; both Corrie and Betsie were forced to perform back-breaking manual labor. It was there that Betsie's health failed. Throughout the ordeal, Corrie was amazed at her sister's faith. In every camp, the sisters used a hidden [[Bible]] to teach their fellow prisoners about Jesus. In Ravensbrück, where there was only hatred and misery, Corrie found it hard to look to Heaven. Betsie, however, showed a universal love for everyone—not only for the prisoners, but also for the Nazis. Instead of feeling anger, she pitied the Germans, sorrowful that they were so blinded by hatred. She yearned to show them the love of Christ, but died before the war was over. Corrie was later released because of a clerical error, but she was forced to stay in a hospital barracks while recovering from [[edema]]. Corrie arrived back in the Netherlands by January 1945.

'''''The Lorax''''' is a [[children's literature|children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1971.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012/&gt; It chronicles the plight of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book.

The book is commonly recognized as a [[fable]] concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of [[anthropomorphism|personification]] to give life to industry as the Once-ler and the environment as the Lorax.

''The Lorax'' was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and [[environmental issue|environmental]] issues without it being dull. "''The Lorax''," he once explained, "came out of me being angry. In ''The Lorax'' I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Lebduska. "Rethinking Human Need: Seuss's ''The Lorax''." Children's Literature Association Quarterly 19.4 (1994): 170-176. Project MUSE. Web. October 20, 2014. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away.

The Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, chops one down and uses its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who "speaks for the trees" as they have no tongues, emerges from the stump of the Truffula and voices his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchases the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler is encouraged and starts a business making and selling Thneeds.

The Once-ler's small shop soon grows into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all come to work for him and new vehicles and equipment are brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appears again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, are short of food and must be sent away to find more. The Lorax later returns to complain that the factory has polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swanee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler is unrepentant and defiantly tells the Lorax that he will keep on "biggering" his business, but at that moment one of his machines fells the very last Truffula tree.

Without raw materials, the factory shuts down and the Once-ler's relatives leave. The Lorax says nothing but with one sad backward glance lifts himself into the air "by the seat of his pants" and disappears behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small monument engraved with a single word: "UNLESS".  The Once-ler ponders the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile.

In the present, his buildings falling apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not." He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.

==Reception==
Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Lorax'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse No. 8 Production''. Blog. [[School Library Journal]] (blog.schoollibraryjournal.com) |date= July 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective critique written in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, [[Emma Marris]] described the Lorax character as a "parody of a [[misanthropic]] ecologist". She called the book "gloomy" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7359/full/476148a.html In retrospect: The Lorax]. Marris, E. 2011. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. 476: 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958654,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "California: Chopping Down Dr. Seuss"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

Terri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored ''The Truax'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145354/http://www.myteacherpages.com/webpages/NDow/files/TRUAX1.pdf "Truax"]. Terri Birkett. National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA) Environmental Committee. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; offering a logging-friendly perspective to an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tree known as the ''Guardbark''.  This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA).  Just as in ''The Lorax'', the book consists of a disagreement between two people.  The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the [[environmentalist]] movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out.  But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a "casual attitude toward endangered species" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020509134328/http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 9, 2002|title=The People-Centered Development Forum - Living Economies Forum|publisher=|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aadl.org/node/9624|title=What's A Truax?

The line "I hear things are just as bad up in [[Lake Erie]]" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6rnHjVaTKMMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA276&amp;lpg=RA1-PA276&amp;dq=lorax+lake+erie+line+removed&amp;source=web&amp;ots=In0YHjRebf&amp;sig=WkYwbVQXEzCTQP78cekSaexw1kQ&amp;hl=en "Dr. Seuss &amp; Mr. Geisel : a biography"]. Judith &amp; Neil Morgan. Random House. 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-679-41686-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The line remains in the home video releases of the television special and in the audiobook read by [[Rik Mayall]].

==Adaptations==

===1972 television special===
{{Main article|The Lorax (1972 film)}}
The book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], directed by [[Hawley Pratt]] and starring the voices of [[Eddie Albert]] and [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]]. It was first aired by [[CBS]] on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of [[Lake Erie]] was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'', with [[Kathy Najimy]]'s reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story.

===2012 feature film===
{{Main article|The Lorax (film)}}
On March 2, 2012, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Illumination Entertainment]] released a [[3D film|3-D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Zac Efron]] as Ted (the boy in the book), and [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: [[Rob Riggle]] as villain Aloysius O'Hare, [[Betty White]] as Ted's Grammy Norma, [[Jenny Slate]] as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and [[Taylor Swift]] as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70&amp;nbsp;million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|lorax|The Lorax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio books===
Two audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by [[Ted Danson]] in the United States (Listening Library, {{ISBN|978-0-8072-1873-0}}) and one narrated by [[Rik Mayall]] in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, {{ISBN|978-0-00-715705-1}}).

===Musical===
A musical adaptation of ''The Lorax'' was originally included in script for the Broadway musical ''[[Seussical]]'', but was cut before the show opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth|title=Ahrens &amp; Flaherty Double Bill of Musicals Pairs Lorax and Emperor's New Clothes|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/ahrens-flaherty-double-bill-of-musicals-pairs-lorax-and-emperors-new-clothe-141201|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=December 26, 2014|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the [[Old Vic]] theatre in London. With former [[Noah and the Whale]] frontman, [[Charlie Fink]], who wrote the music for the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702104801/http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trademark may be located on a [[Packaging and labeling|package]], a [[label]], a [[voucher]], or on the product itself. For the sake of [[corporate identity]], trademarks are often displayed on company buildings.

The first legislative act concerning trademarks was passed in 1266 under the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], requiring all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857. The [[Trade Marks Act 1938]] of the United Kingdom changed the system, permitting registration based on "intent-to-use”, creating an examination based process, and creating an application publication system. The 1938 Act, which served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere, contained other novel concepts such as "associated trademarks", a consent to use system, a defensive mark system, and non claiming right system.

The owner of a trademark may pursue [[lawsuit|legal action]] against [[trademark infringement]]. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect an unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder, in general, less legal protection than registered trademarks.

==Designation==
A trademark may be designated by the following symbols:
*'''[[trademark symbol|™]]''' (the "[[trademark symbol]]", which is the letters "TM"  in superscript, for an [[unregistered trademark]], a mark used to promote or brand goods)
*'''[[service mark symbol|℠]]''' (which is the letters "SM" in superscript, for an unregistered [[service mark]], a mark used to promote or brand services)
*'''[[®]]''' (the letter "R" surrounded by a circle, for a registered trademark)
==Styles==
A trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, [[logo]], [[symbol]], [[design]], image, or a combination of these elements.&lt;ref name="Restatement 1995"&gt;Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 9 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a range of [[non-conventional trademark]]s comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories, such as those based on colour, smell, or sound (like [[jingle]]s). Trademarks which are considered offensive are often rejected according to a nation's trademark law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1997/06/25/bus_nike.html |title= In addition to recalling 38,000 pairs of the offensive shoes, Nike has diverted another 30,000 pairs from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey to "less-sensitive" markets |accessdate=1997-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''trademark'' is also used informally to refer to any distinguishing attribute by which an individual is readily identified, such as the well-known characteristics of celebrities. When a trademark is used in relation to services rather than products, it may sometimes be called a [[service mark]], particularly in the [[United States trademark law|United States]].&lt;ref name="Restatement 1995"/&gt;

==Fundamental concepts==
The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, ''indicates source'' or serves as a ''badge of origin''. In other words, trademarks serve to identify a particular business as the source of goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as ''trademark use''. Certain [[exclusive right]]s attach to a registered mark.

Trademark rights generally arise out of the use of, or to maintain exclusive rights over, that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections.

Different goods and services have been classified by the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services]] into 45 [[Trademark Classes]] (1 to 34 cover goods, and 35 to 45 cover services). The idea behind this system is to specify and limit the extension of the intellectual property right by determining which goods or services are covered by the mark, and to unify classification systems around the world.

==History==
In trademark treatises it is usually reported that [[blacksmiths]] who made [[sword]]s in the [[Roman Empire]] are thought of as being the first users of trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Richardson |title=Brand Names Before the Industrial Revolution |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13930 |date=April 2008 |doi=10.3386/w13930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable trademarks that have been used for a long time include [[Löwenbräu]], which claims use of its lion mark since 1383.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Packard |first=Ashley |authorlink= |title=Digital Media Law |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |location= |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcYJGlKJ4g4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781444318203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trademark legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of England]] under the reign of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1266, which required all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold.&lt;ref name="tmprotect"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmprotect.idknet.com/eng/history.html|title=History of Trademarks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857 with the "Manufacture and Goods Mark Act". In Britain, the [[Merchandise Marks Act 1862]] made it a criminal offence to imitate another's trade mark 'with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud'. In 1875, the [[Trade Marks Registration Act 1875|Trade Marks Registration Act]] was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as 'a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket'.&lt;ref name="bently 2008"&gt;Bently, Lionel, "The Making of Modern Trade Marks Law: The Construction of the Legal Concept of Trade Mark (1860-80)" in Lionel Bently, Jane C. Ginsburg &amp; Jennifer Davis (eds), ''Trade Marks and Brands: An Interdisciplinary Critique'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] first attempted to establish a federal trademark regime in 1870. This statute purported to be an exercise of Congress' [[Copyright Clause]] powers. However, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the ''[[Trade-Mark Cases]]'' later on in the decade. In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its [[Commerce Clause]] powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iip.or.jp/translation/ono/ch2.pdf|title=The History and Development of Trademark Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lanham Act]] of 1946 updated the law and has served, with several amendments, as the primary federal law on trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Dyer Jr., [http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/mlr/vol77/iss1/10 Monetary Damages under the Lanham Act: Eighth Circuit Holds Actual Confusion is Not a Prerequisite], 77 Mo. L. Rev. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trade Marks Act 1938]] in the [[United Kingdom]] set up the first registration system based on the “intent-to-use” principle. The Act also established an application publishing procedure and expanded the rights of the trademark holder to include the barring of trademark use even in cases where confusion remained unlikely. This Act served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9041109382|title=Introduction to Intellectual Property: Theory and Practice|author=World Intellectual Property Organization|year=1997|publisher=Kluwer Law International|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
The two symbols associated with trademarks, ™ (the [[trademark symbol]]) and ® (the [[registered trademark symbol]]), represent the status of a mark and accordingly its level of protection. While ™ can be used with any common law usage of a mark, ® may only be used by the owner of a mark following registration with the relevant national authority, such as the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO or PTO). The proper manner to display either symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style.

==Terminology==
[[File:Burberry pattern.svg|thumb|right|Approximate drawing of [[Burberry]] check pattern. The pattern is a registered trademark of Burberry Ltd.]]

Terms such as "mark", "[[brand]]" and "[[logo]]" are sometimes used interchangeably with "trademark". "Trademark", however, also includes any device, brand, label, name, signature, word, letter, numerical, shape of goods, packaging, colour or combination of colours, smell, sound, movement or any combination thereof which is capable of distinguishing goods and services of one business from those of others. It must be capable of graphical representation and must be applied to goods or services for which it is registered.

Specialized types of trademark include [[certification mark]]s, [[collective trademark]]s and [[defensive trademark]]s. A trademark which is popularly used to describe a product or service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a [[genericized trademark]]. If such a mark becomes [[synonym]]ous with that product or service to the extent that the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.

A "[[trademark look]]" is an informal term for a characteristic look for a performer or character of some sort. It is usually not legally trademark protected and the term is not used in the trademark law.

==Registration==
The law considers a trademark to be a form of [[property]]. [[Wikt:proprietary|Proprietary]] [[rights]] in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the [[marketplace]], or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office (or "trademarks registry") of a particular [[jurisdiction]]. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, the extent to which they will be able to enforce their rights through [[trademark infringement]] proceedings will therefore be limited. In cases of dispute, this disparity of rights is often referred to as "first to file" as opposed to "first to use." Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection, the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace&amp;nbsp;— where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services.

In the United States, the registration process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner files an application to register the trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examination Procedure.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 700"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/0700.htm TMEP Sec. 700] Trademark Manual.&lt;/ref&gt; This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing applied-for or registered mark.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1200"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1200.htm TMEP Sec. 1200], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark. If the examining attorney approves the application, it will be "published for opposition." During this 30-day period third parties who may be affected by the registration of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark. If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue.&lt;ref name="TBMP Sec. 300 et seq."&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/appeal/tbmp_ed2_rev1.pdf TBMP Sec. 300 et seq.], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor the mark will be registered in due course.

Outside of the United States the registration process is substantially similar to that found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding. In short, once an application is reviewed by an examiner and found to be entitled to registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition for a period of typically 6 months from the date of registration.

A registered trademark confers a [[bundle of rights|bundle]] of [[exclusive right]]s upon the registered owner, including the right to exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or "colourfully" similar to the "registered" products or services, and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as "Sony" where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in.

Once trademark rights are established in a particular jurisdiction, these rights are generally only enforceable in that jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as '''territoriality'''. However, there is a range of international trademark laws and systems which facilitate the protection of trademarks in more than one jurisdiction.

==Search==
In the United States the USPTO maintains a database of registered trademarks. The database is open to the public. A licensed attorney may be required to interpret the search results. As trademarks are governed by federal law, state law, and common law, a thorough search as to the availability of a mark is very important. In the United States obtaining a trademark search and relying upon the results of an opinion issued by an attorney may insulate a trademark user from being required to pay treble damages and attorney's fees in a trademark infringement case as it demonstrates that the trademark user performed [[due diligence]] and was using the mark in good faith. The USPTO internally captures more information about trademarks than what they publicly disclose on their official search website, such as the complete contents of every logo trademark filing.

Trademarks may also be searched on third-party databases such as [[LexisNexis]], [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]], and [[CompuMark]].

Within the European Union, searches have to be conducted taking into account both EU Trademarks as well as national trademarks.

Classification systems exist to help in searching for marks. One example is the "International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks", better known as the Vienna Classification.

==Ability to register== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Australian trade mark law]] --&gt;
In most systems, a trademark can be registered if it is able to [[Trademark distinctiveness|distinguish the goods or services]] of a party, will not confuse consumers about the relationship between one party and another, and will not otherwise deceive consumers with respect to the qualities.

===Distinctive character===
{{Main article|Trademark distinctiveness}}
A trademark may be eligible for registration, or registerable, if it performs the essential trademark function, and has distinctive character. Registerability can be understood as a continuum, with "inherently distinctive" marks at one end, "generic" and "descriptive" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and "suggestive" and "arbitrary" marks lying between these two points. "Descriptive" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning – [[consumers]] have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator – to be protectable. "Generic" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks. (See the KitKat v Cadbury case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/kit-kat-unprotected-european-court-rejects-trademark-case|title=KitKat goes unprotected as European court rejects trademark case|first=Sean|last=Farrell|date=16 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Maintaining rights==

Trademarks rights must be maintained through actual lawful use of the trademark. These rights will cease if a mark is not actively used for a period of time, normally 5 years in most jurisdictions. In the case of a trademark registration, failure to actively use the mark in the lawful course of trade, or to enforce the registration in the event of infringement, may also expose the registration itself to become liable for an application for the removal from the register after a certain period of time on the grounds of "non-use".

It is not necessary for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement if it can be shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.

All jurisdictions with a mature trademark registration system provide a mechanism for removal in the event of such ''non use'', which is usually a period of either three or five years. The intention to use a trademark can be proven by a wide range of acts as shown in the "Wooly Bull" and ''[[Aston v Harlee]]'' cases.

In the U.S., failure to use a trademark for this period of time will result in ''abandonment'' of the mark, whereby any party may use the mark. An abandoned mark is not irrevocably in the [[public domain]], but may instead be re-registered by any party&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which has re-established exclusive and active use, and must be associated or linked with the original mark owner. A mark is registered in conjunction with a description of a specific type of goods, and if the party uses the mark but in conjunction with a different type of goods, the mark may still be considered abandoned, as was the case in [[Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.]]. If a court rules that a trademark has become  "[[Generic trademark|generic]]" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.

Unlike other forms of intellectual property (e.g., patents and copyrights) a registered trademark can, theoretically, last forever.  So long as a trademark's use is continuous a trademark holder may keep the mark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by filing Section 8 Affidavit(s) of Continuous Use as well as Section 9 Applications for renewal, as required.

Specifically, once registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the owner of a trademark is required to file a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use to maintain the registration between the 5th and 6th year anniversaries of the registration of the mark or during the 6-month grace period following the 6th anniversary of the registration.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1604.04"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1600.htm#_T160404 TMEP Sec. 1604.04], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a trademark owner may concurrently opt to file a Section 15, Declaration of Incontestability. A mark declared incontestable is immune from future challenge, except in instances where the mark becomes generic, the mark is abandoned, or if the registration was acquired fraudulently. Note, if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6-month grace period additional fees to file the Affidavit with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will apply.&lt;ref name="TMEP USPTO Fee Schedule"&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/qs/ope/fee2009september15.htm#tm USPTO Fee Schedule], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to requirement above, U.S. trademark registrations are also required to be renewed on or about every 10-year anniversary of the registration of the trademark.  The procedure for 10-year renewals is somewhat different from that for the 5th-6th year renewal.  In brief, registrants are required to file both a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use as well as a Section 9 Application for Renewal every ten years to maintain their registration.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1606 et seq."&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1600.htm#_T1606 TMEP Sec. 1606 et seq.], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcing rights==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The extent to which a trademark owner may prevent unauthorized use of trademarks which are the same as or similar to its trademark depends on various factors such as whether its trademark is registered, the similarity of the trademarks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved, and whether the owner's trademark is ''well known'' or, under U.S. law relating to [[trademark dilution]], ''famous''.

If a trademark has not been registered, some jurisdictions (especially [[Common Law]] countries) offer protection for the [[business]] [[reputation]] or [[goodwill (business)|goodwill]] which attaches to unregistered trademarks through the [[tort]] of [[passing off (legal term)|passing off]]. Passing off may provide a remedy in a scenario where a business has been trading under an unregistered trademark for many years, and a rival business starts using the same or a similar mark.

If a trademark has been registered, then it is much easier for the trademark owner to demonstrate its trademark rights and to enforce these rights through an infringement action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thepolarislawfirm.com/trademark/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Trademark Law {{!}} The Polaris Law Firm|work=The Polaris Law Firm|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unauthorized use of a registered trademark need not be intentional in order for infringement to occur, although damages in an infringement [[lawsuit]] will generally be greater if there was an intention to deceive.

For trademarks which are considered to be well known, infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to products or services which are not the same as or similar to the products or services in relation to which the owner's mark is registered.
A growing area of law relating to the enforcement of trademark rights is [[secondary liability]], which allows for the imputation of liability to one who has not acted directly to infringe a trademark but whose legal responsibility may arise under the doctrines of either contributory or vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95  ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=13 September 2012 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits and defenses to claims of infringement===
Trademark is subject to various defenses, such as abandonment, [[Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine|limitations on geographic scope]], and fair use. In the United States, the [[fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]] defence protects many of the interests in free expression related to those protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

[[File:LinuxWasch3.jpg|thumb|A product bearing "Linux" name, but not infringing [[Linux Mark Institute|the trademark owned by Linus Torvalds]], because it falls into a different category]]
Fair use may be asserted on two grounds, either that the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products, or that the alleged infringer is using the mark to identify the mark owner.  One of the most visible proofs that trademarks provide a limited right in the U.S. comes from the comparative advertising that is seen throughout U.S. media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2008/11/16/comparative-advertising-mac-vs-pc/ Comparative Advertising: Mac vs. PC] - "In the United States where we hold the First Amendment above reproach by any laws, there are many legitimate and legal uses of a trademark, and the right to engage in comparative advertising is among one of those legitimate uses."&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the first type is that although [[Maytag]] owns the trademark "Whisper Quiet" for its dishwashers, makers of other products may describe their goods as being "whisper quiet" so long as these products do not fall under the same category of goods the trademark is protected under.

An example of the second type is that [[Audi]] can run advertisements saying that a trade publication has rated an Audi model higher than a [[BMW]] model, since they are only using "BMW" to identify the competitor. In a related sense, an auto mechanic can truthfully advertise that he services [[Volkswagen]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'', 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; and a former ''[[Playboy]]'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]] can identify herself as such on her website.&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles'', 279 F.3d 796 (9th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrongful or groundless threats of infringement===
Various jurisdictions have laws which are designed to prevent trademark owners from making wrongful threats of trademark infringement action against other parties.  These laws are intended to prevent large or powerful companies from intimidating or harassing smaller companies.

Where one party makes a threat to sue another for trademark infringement, but does not have a genuine basis or intention to carry out that threat, or does not carry out the threat at all within a certain period, the threat may itself become a basis for legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940026_en_2#pt1-pb4-l1g21 Section 21, Trade Marks Act 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this situation, the party receiving such a threat may seek from the Court a [[declaratory judgment]]; also known as a declaratory ruling.

==Other aspects==

===Public policy===
Trademark law is designed to fulfill the [[public policy]] objective of [[consumer protection]], by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of a product or service. By identifying the commercial source of products and services, trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics.

Trademarks may also serve as an incentive for manufacturers, providers or suppliers to consistently provide quality products or services to maintain their business reputation. Furthermore, if a trademark owner does not maintain [[quality control]] and adequate supervision in relation to the manufacture and provision of products or services supplied by a licensee, such "naked licensing" will eventually adversely affect the owner's rights in the trademark. For US law ''see, ex.'' ''Eva's Bridal Ltd. v. Halanick Enterprises, Inc.'' 639 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2011). This proposition has, however, been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of ''Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB et al.'' [2001] UKHL 21; wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a bare license (equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license) has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead.

By the same token, trademark holders must be cautious in the sale of their mark for similar reasons as apply to licensing.  When assigning an interest in a trademark, if the associated product or service is not transferred with it, then this may be an "assignment-in-gross" and could lead to a loss of rights in the trademark. It is still possible to make significant changes to the underlying goods or services during a sale without jeopardizing the trademark, but companies will often contract with the sellers to help transition the mark and goods or services to the new owners to ensure continuity of the trademark.

===Comparison with patents, designs and copyright===
{{See also|Functionality doctrine|Threshold of originality}}
While trademark law seeks to protect indications of the commercial source of products or services, [[patent]] law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions, and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article. Trademarks, patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an industrial or commercial context.

By comparison, [[copyright]] law generally seeks to protect original literary, artistic and other creative works. Continued active use and re-registration can make a trademark perpetual, whereas copyright usually lasts for the duration of the author's lifespan plus 70 years for works by individuals, and some limited time after creation for works by bodies corporate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Directive harmonizing the term of copyright protection]]&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to confusion in cases where a work passes into the [[public domain]] but the character in question remains a registered trademark.

Although intellectual property laws such as these are theoretically distinct, more than one type may afford protection to the same article. For example, the particular design of a bottle may qualify for copyright protection as a non-utilitarian [sculpture], or for trademark protection based on its shape, or the '[[trade dress]]' appearance of the bottle as a whole may be protectable. Titles and character names from books or movies may also be protectable as trademarks while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright protection as a whole. Trademark protection does not apply to utilitarian features of a product such as the plastic interlocking studs on Lego bricks.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite CanLII|litigants=Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc.|link=Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc.|year=2005|court=scc|num=65|format=scc|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing these distinctions is necessary, but often challenging for the courts and lawyers, especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the [[public domain]], depending on the jurisdiction. Unlike patents and copyrights, which in theory are granted for one-off fixed terms, trademarks remain valid as long as the owner actively uses and defends them and maintains their registrations with the competent authorities. This often involves payment of a periodic renewal fee.

As a trademark must be used to maintain rights in relation to that mark, a trademark can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or [[estoppel]] when suit is finally brought.

Like patents and copyrights, trademarks can be bought, sold, and transferred from one company or another. Unlike patents and copyrights, trademarks may not remain intact through this process. Where trademarks have been acquired for the purpose of marketing generic (non-distinctive) products, courts have refused to enforce them.

In 1923, the author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] registered his fictitious character [[Tarzan]] as a trademark; even after the copyright to the Tarzan story expired, his [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.|company]] used ownership of the trademarks relating to the character (which unlike copyrights, do not have a limited length) to control the production of media using its imagery and [[Brand licensing|license]] the character for use in other works (such as adaptations). This practice is a precursor to the modern concept of a [[media franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-09/local/me-32680_1_jungle-heat|title=Law of the Jungle: Burroughs Descendants' Suit Says Adult Movie, Game Violate Trademark|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=December 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Trademark dilution}}
A trademark is ''diluted'' when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source.  In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word [[Pepsi]] spoken, or on a billboard).
Under trademark law, dilution occurs either when unauthorized use of a mark "blurs" the "distinctive nature of the mark" or "tarnishes it." Likelihood of confusion is not required. 15 U.S.C §§ 1127, 1125(c).

===Sale, transfer and licensing===
In various jurisdictions a trademark may be sold with or without the underlying [[goodwill (business)|goodwill]] which subsists in the business associated with the mark. However, this is not the case in the United States, where the courts have held that this would "be a fraud upon the public". In the U.S., trademark registration can therefore only be sold and assigned if accompanied by the sale of an underlying asset. Examples of assets whose sale would ordinarily support the assignment of a mark include the sale of the machinery used to produce the goods that bear the mark, or the sale of the corporation (or subsidiary) that produces the trademarked goods.

===Licensing===
Licensing means the trademark owner (the licensor) grants a permit to a third party (the licensee) in order to commercially use the trademark legally. It is a contract between the two, containing the scope of content and policy. The essential provisions to a trademark license identify the trademark owner and the licensee, in addition to the policy and the goods or services agreed to be licensed.

Most jurisdictions provide for the use of trademarks to be licensed to third parties. The licensor must monitor the quality of the goods being produced by the licensee to avoid the risk of trademark being deemed abandoned by the courts. A trademark license should therefore include appropriate provisions dealing with quality control, whereby the licensee provides warranties as to quality and the licensor has rights to inspection and monitoring.

===Domain names===
The advent of the [[domain name system]] has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks, particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue. As with dilution protection, enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market, because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service.

This conflict is easily resolved when the domain name owner actually uses the domain to compete with the trademark owner. [[Cybersquatting]], however, does not involve competition. Instead, an unlicensed user registers a domain name identical to a trademark, and offers to sell the domain to the trademark owner. [[Typosquatting|Typosquatters]]—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits.  "[[Gripe site]]s", on the other hand, tend to be protected as free speech, and are therefore more difficult to attack as trademark infringement.

This clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high-profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue (and not always successfully) within the framework of existing trademark law.  As the website itself was not the product being purchased, there was no actual consumer confusion, and so [[initial interest confusion]] was a concept applied instead. Initial interest confusion refers to customer confusion that creates an initial interest in a competitor's "product" (in the online context, another party's website).  Even though initial interest confusion is dispelled by the time any actual sales occur, it allows a trademark infringer to capitalize on the goodwill associated with the original mark.

Several cases have wrestled with the concept of initial interest confusion. In [[Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.]] the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the [[HTML]] metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In ''[[Playboy v. Netscape]]'', the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.

In [[Lamparello v. Falwell]], however, the court clarified that a finding of initial interest confusion is contingent on financial profit from said confusion, such that, if a domain name confusingly similar to a registered trademark is used for a non-trademark related website, the site owner will not be found to have infringed where they do not seek to capitalize on the mark's goodwill for their own commercial enterprises.

In addition, courts have upheld the rights of trademark owners with regard to commercial use of domain names, even in cases where goods sold there legitimately bear the mark. In the landmark decision Creative Gifts, Inc. v. UFO, 235 F.3d 540 (10th Cir. 2000) (New Mexico), defendants had registered the domain name "Levitron.com" to sell goods bearing the trademark "Levitron" under an at-will license from the trademark owner. The 10th Circuit affirmed the rights of the trademark owner with regard to said domain name, despite arguments of [[promissory estoppel]].

Most courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting, and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., "trafficking" in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement.  Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters.

In the US, the legal situation was clarified by the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]], an amendment to the Lanham Act, which explicitly prohibited cybersquatting. It defines cybersquatting as "(occurring) when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well-known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder".&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Medical Institute, Inc v Bosley Medical Group, 403 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2005)(quoting DaimlerChrysler v The Net Inc. 388 F.3d 201, 204 (6th Cir. 2004))&lt;/ref&gt; The provision states that "[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark ... if, without regard to the goods or services of the person, that person (i) had a bad faith intent to profit from the mark ...; and registers, traffics in, or uses domain name [that is confusingly similar to another's mark or dilutes another's mark]".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}(d)(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

This international legal change has also led to the creation of [[ICANN]] [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) and other dispute policies for specific countries (such as [[Nominet UK]]'s [[Dispute Resolution Service|DRS]]) which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name (without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages).  This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous.

Registrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves (e.g., "XYZ.COM") as trademarks for perceived advantages, such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked, and to avail themselves of such remedies as ''confusion'' or [[passing off (legal term)|passing off]] against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names.

As with other trademarks, the domain name will not be subject to trademark registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant's goods or services to the public, rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant's web site appears. [[Amazon.com]] is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public's identification of the company and its products.

Terms which are not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning, may become registerable when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it. An example of such a domain name ineligible for trademark or service mark protection as a generic term, but which currently has a registered U.S. service mark, is "HEARSAY.COM".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among trademark practitioners there remains a great deal of debate around trademark protection under [[ICANN]]'s proposed generic top-level domain name space expansion. [[World Trademark Review]] has been reporting on the at times fiery discussion between trademark owners and domainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/daily/Detail.aspx?g=0332a6d5-8494-4466-a8f1-6e1de82bdafd|title=The STIckler: inside the latest trademark protection gTLD discussion - Blog - World Trademark Review|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
Although there are systems which facilitate the filing, registration or enforcement of trademark rights in more than one jurisdiction on a regional or global basis, it is currently not possible to file and obtain a single trademark registration which will automatically apply around the world. Like any national law, trademark laws apply only in their applicable country or jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as "territoriality".

===Territorial application===
The inherent limitations of the territorial application of trademark laws have been mitigated by various [[intellectual property]] [[treaty|treaties]], foremost amongst which is the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]. TRIPS establishes legal compatibility between member jurisdictions by requiring the [[harmonisation of law|harmonization]] of applicable laws. For example, Article 15(1) of TRIPS provides a definition for "sign" which is used as or forms part of the definition of "trademark" in the trademark legislation of many jurisdictions around the world.

===Madrid system===
{{Main article|Madrid system}}

The major international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is commonly known as the "Madrid system". Madrid provides a centrally administered system for securing trademark registrations in member jurisdictions by extending the protection of an "international registration" obtained through the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]. This international registration is in turn based upon an application or registration obtained by a trade mark applicant in its home jurisdiction.

The primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process. Furthermore, the "coverage" of the international registration may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time.

===Trademark Law Treaty===
The Trademark Law Treaty establishes a system pursuant to which member jurisdictions agree to standardize procedural aspects of the trademark registration process. It is not necessarily respective of rules within individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the [http://alpilaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Full_text_Trademark_Law_Treaty.pdf Trademark Law Treaty.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Trademark system===
{{Main article|European Union trade mark}}

The EU Trade Mark (EUTM) system (formerly the Community Trademark system) is the trademark system which applies in the [[European Union]], whereby registration of a trademark with the [[European Union Intellectual Property Office]] (EUIPO, formerly Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)), leads to a registration which is effective throughout the EU as a whole. The EUTM system is therefore said to be unitary in character, in that an EUTM registration applies indivisibly across all [[European Union member states]]. However, the CTM system did not replace the national trademark registration systems; the CTM system and the national systems continue to operate in parallel to each other (see also [[Trade mark law of the European Union|European Union trade mark law]]).

Persons residing outside the EU must have professional representative to the procedures before EUIPO, while representation is recommended for EU residents.

One of the tasks of an EUTM owner is the monitoring of the later applications whether any of those is similar to his/her earlier trademark. Monitoring is not easy and usually requires professional expertise. To conduct a monitoring there is the so-called Trademark Watching service where it can be checked if someone tries to get registered marks that are similar to the existing marks.

Oppositions should be filed on the standard opposition form in any official language of the European Union, however, the substantive part of the opposition (e.g. the argumentations) can be submitted only in the language of the opposed application, that is one of the working languages of the EUIPO, e.g. English, Spanish, German.

===Well-known status===
Well-known trade mark status is commonly granted to famous international trade marks in less-developed legal jurisdictions.

Pursuant to Article 6 ''bis'' of the [[Paris Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention: [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/trtdocs_wo020.html#P151_21198 Article 6 bis, Paris Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; countries are empowered to grant this status to marks that the relevant authority considers are 'well known'. In addition to the standard grounds for trade mark infringement (same/similar mark applied same/similar goods or services, and a likelihood of confusion), if the mark is deemed well known it is an infringement to apply the same or a similar mark to dissimilar goods/services where there is confusion, including where it takes unfair advantage of the well-known mark or causing detriment to it.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong Trade Marks Ordinance section dealing with infringement: [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/b8ad171ad6e831894825697d0028e34e?OpenDocument Cap 559, s.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known trademark does not have to be registered in the jurisdiction to bring a trade mark infringement action (equivalent to bringing a [[passing off]] claim without having to show goodwill and having a lesser burden of proof).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Protection of well-known marks===

Many countries protect unregistered well-known marks in accordance with their international obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Consequently, not only big companies but also SMEs may have a good chance of establishing enough goodwill with customers so that their marks may be recognized as well-known marks and acquire protection without registration. It is, nevertheless, advisable to seek registration, taking into account that many countries provide for an extended protection of registered well-known marks against dilution (Art. 16.3 TRIPS),&lt;ref name="Paris Convention 1967"&gt;[Article 6bis of the Paris Convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services which are not similar to those in respect of which a trademark is registered, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the registered trademark and provided that the interests of the owner of the registered trademark are likely to be damaged by such use]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the reputation of the mark being weakened by the unauthorized use of that mark by others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/marks/well_known_marks.htm WIPO]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of trademark laws merely implement obligations under Article 16.3&lt;ref name="Paris Convention 1967"/&gt; of the TRIPS Agreement and protect well-known registered trademarks only under the following conditions: 1- that the goods and services for which the other mark is used or is seeking protection are not identical with or similar to the goods for which the well-known mark acquired its reputation 2- that the use of the other mark would indicate a connection between these goods and the owner of the well-known mark, and 3 – that their interests are likely to be damaged by such use.

The '''Verbal Arts Centre''' is based in [[Derry]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], and is a centre for the development of the verbal arts and [[literacy]] (i.e. the ability to read, write, communicate (talking &amp; listening) and comprehend). It was established in 1992 as an educational charity. In 2000 it moved to the refurbished First Derry School, a listed building on the city’s walls, in Bishop Street.&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Verbal Arts Centre | work=Verbal Arts Centre website| url=http://www.verbalartscentre.co.uk/index.htm | accessdate= 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It focuses on promotion of all aspects of the written and spoken word and is also involved in research and the publication and provision of information, including material for schools. It has also developed literacy building programmes for schools, works on literary heritage, storytelling and works also with youth and community groups throughout the north-west. The Centre coordinates the annual 2D Festival which is the largest [[comic book festival]] on the island of Ireland.[http://www.2dfestival.com 2d]

The centre publishes bi-monthly [http://www.verbalon.com/magazine/ Verbal Magazine] which has a circulation of over 235,000 and is the largest free literary magazine in Ireland. Launched in January 2007, Verbal is devoted to books, authors, reading and the arts in general. The publication is free of charge and is an important showcase for writers, publishers, poets, critics and everyone involved in the Arts.

As part of its work in developing the oral heritage of the area the centre developed with support from [https://web.archive.org/web/20111211220147/http://www.hlf.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx Heritage Lottery Fund][http://verbal.fm Verbal.fm]

It also promotes verbal arts events.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Verbal Arts Centre | work=Culture Northern Ireland| url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=501 | accessdate= 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre has rooms for hire for meetings and events. A readers circle and children's book club are also in operation.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt; It has integrated a number of arts and crafts pieces in the building including works by [[Louis le Brocquy]] and [[John Behan (sculptor)|John Behan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Verbal Arts Centre | work=Discover Northern Ireland| url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/The-Verbal-Arts-Centre-Londonderry-Derry-P3225 | accessdate= 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We are sudamerican rockers''''' is a spanish-language song by [[chile]]an [[rock band]] [[Los Prisioneros]], from the album [[La cultura de la basura|La Cultura de la Basura]]. It came out into airplay as a single the year of 1987. In 1993 [[MTV Latin America]] begun its airplay with ''We are sudamerican rockers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll Los Prisioneros], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''sudamerican'' is a mock [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for South Americans, which is the very similar ''sudamericanos''.

The lyrics of the song start with ''"Son hermosos ruidos que salen de las tiendas, atraviesan a la gente y les mueven los pies..."'' and then includes a call to Elvis in a mix of Spanish, English and French: ''"Elvis! sacúdete en tu cripta, We are south american rockers, Nous sommes rockers sudamericaines. No nos acompleja revolver los estilos."''

As a basic element of human expression, [[dance]] is found within many of the world's [[religion]]s, and is frequently associated with [[worship]]. However, use of the term '''worship dance''' appears to be restricted to [[Christianity]] and [[Messianic Judaism]].

==Christianity==
[[Dance]] has had a chequered history within [[Christianity]]. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders within most branches of the [[Christian Church]], for such reasons as the association of dance with [[paganism]], fears relating to sexuality, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body.

However, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century there was a significant growth in the use of dance within [[Christian worship]]. This received a boost within the framework of the [[charismatic movement]] of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to [[contemporary worship]] in many churches.

==Hinduism==

From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance). We read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsara]]s who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshipped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

'''Pendet''' is a traditional dance from [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theater as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance.&lt;ref name="BaliNOW"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nowbali.co.id/pendet-a-beautiful-welcoming-dance/|title=Pendet: A Beautiful Welcoming Dance - NOW!

''Wali'' (sacred dances) are usually performed only during certain ritual ceremonies. [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindus]] believed that the sacred dances has strong religious significance and spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific religious ceremony by specific dancers. ''Bebalihan'' are usually performed in social events. In addition to entertain, ''Bebalihan'' also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration of harvests, or gathering crowds. ''Bebalihan'' has more variations than ''Wali''. Pendet is considered as a form of ''Bebalihan'', often performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences. Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering ritual, which offered ''banten'' or ''canang'' (floral offerings) from shrine to shrine within [[Balinese temple]] or residential compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of ''piodalan'' ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the gods who descend from ''khayangan'' (realm of gods).

==Judaism==
A distinctive style of worship dance has developed within [[Messianic Judaism]]. Known as ''messianic dance'' or ''davidic dance'' (named after [[King David]], who famously danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]]), it takes a similar form to [[Israeli Folk Dancing]]. And there also is a dance known as Lippo dancing that was originated in the late 1800's by a handsome , clever man known as Chevaughn Rowe III, who later became a wealthy astronomer and mathematician.
