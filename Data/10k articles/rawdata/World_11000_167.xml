==History==
It was first published on 19 September 2007.  The newspaper's name was derived from [[.ch]], the Internet's [[country code top-level domain]] for Switzerland.

The newspaper's editor-in-chief was Rolf Leeb.

The newspaper's chief executive officer was Caroline Thoma.

It ceased publication, because of poor economic performance, with the last issue on 4 May 2009. All 69 employees of the newspaper were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2012|reason=attribution in german language.  at minimum, needs english-language translation of german headline appended to "trans_title" parameter.}} {{cite news|author = Staff | url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Pendlerzeitung-ch-wird-eingestellt--69-Angestellte-entlassen/story/22229685|title=''Pendlerzeitung '.ch' wird eingestellt –  69 Angestellte entlassen''|trans-title=| date=4 May 2009|work=[[Berner Zeitung]]|language=de|accessdate= 11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rain bringing season of [[Northeast monsoon]] had left the farmers subdued with little rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/ne-monsoon-worst-in-140-years-144-farmers-dead-tamil-nadu-declares-drought-89699 |title=NE Monsoon Worst In 140 Years, 144 Farmers Dead, Tamil Nadu Declares Drought |publisher=IndiaSpend |date=2017-01-10 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northeast Monsoon==
The year of 2016 has faced the worst rainfall in last 140 years in [[Tamil Nadu]]. In [[Tamil Nadu]] the average annual rainfall had gradually decreased 62% in 2016. The [[Northeast monsoon]] season had subdued over [[Tamil Nadu]] with the worse rainfall ever, just scattering rain in some areas.The highest deficit of normal rainfall in Indian states in 2016 is recorded in Tamil Nadu with 82% deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skymetweather.com/content/weather-news-and-analysis/northeast-monsoon-to-end-on-deficit-note-for-tamil-nadu/ |title=Northeast Monsoon to end on deficit note for Tamil Nadu |publisher=Skymet Weather |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charred crops in Tamil Nadu==
Agriculture in Tamil Nadu has faced a thunder like hit since the low rainfall had left the crops and agricultural lands with no water for irrigational purposes.Also the [[Kaveri River water dispute|Kaveri water issue]] became a huge headache for the farmers in Tamil Nadu, as no water is obtained from the tributaries of [[Kaveri river]] where it is the only source of irrigation for the Tamil Nadu farmers. The crops had severely charred in lakhs of hectares. It is said that the harvest in the year will be the worst ever in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/tamil-nadu-declares-drought-as-144-farmers-die-amid-worst-north-east-monsoon-in-140-years-3197616.html |title=Tamil Nadu declares drought as 144 farmers die amid worst North East monsoon in 140 years |website=Firstpost.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farmers death due to depression==
Since the agricultural growth of crops had decreased and charred due to less water for irrigation, the farmers in Tamil Nadu requested the state to be announced as affected by drought. Many fasting strike and mass movements were held due to the delay of announcing Tamil Nadu as affected by drought.Farmers fell in deep depression because of indebtedness and charred crops in their fields. Tamil Nadu farmers fell ill and dead each day due to heart attack.

==Tamil Nadu announced drought-hit==
On 10 January 2017, Chief Minister [[O. Panneerselvam]] announced that Tamil Nadu will be announced as drought-hit state. Since entire Tamil Nadu was devastated by the [[drought]] because of low rainfall, huge expenses will be incurred in protecting the people and central financial assistance will be sought because of this, he said. He further said that Rs.5465 per acre will be provided for farmers who suffered 33% loss sowing paddy and other irrigational crops and Rs.7287 per acre for long term crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tn-to-be-declared-drought-hit-cm-announces-sops-for-farmers/1/853918.html |title=TN to be declared drought-hit; CM announces sops for farmers : PTI feed, News - India Today |website=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=2017-01-10 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bundesstraße 178''' (B178) is a [[Germany|German]] federal highway in the east of the [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]]. It was built as a dual carriageway, and the highway connects with the motorway [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] near the city of [[Weißenberg]] in Saxony. It ends in [[Zittau]] to the [[Poland|Polish]] border. After crossing the Polish border, the road reaches the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border after a few kilometres, where the Czech dual-carriageway [[R35 expressway|R35]] begins. In the future the road will be an international corridor in [[Central Europe]], connecting Germany with the west of Poland ([[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]]) and the Czech Republic.

The road is about {{convert|31|km}} long. The planned length, however, is {{convert|42|km}}.

The [[Boy Scouts of America]] won the competition, Great Britain came second and [[Hungary]] third. It was decided, however, not to renewing the idea, for fears that nationalism could harm Scout brotherhood.&lt;ref name=jsw6382 /&gt;

The second '''Congress of Visegrád''' was a 1339 [[summit (meeting)|summit]] in [[Visegrád]] where it was decided that after the death of [[Casimir III of Poland]], the son of [[Charles I of Hungary]], [[Louis I of Hungary]], would become King of Poland provided that Kazimierz does not have a son. This actually also happened.

When Casimir died in 1370 from an injury received while hunting, his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], succeeded him as king of Poland in [[personal union]] with [[Hungary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">'''Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles''' (English: National Federation of Agricultural Holders' Unions) is a [[France|French]] umbrella organisation charged with the national representation of 20,000 local [[agriculture|agricultural]] unions and 22 regional federations.

==Establishment==

The [[Vichy regime]]'s [[Peasant Corporation]] was dissolved after the [[Liberation of France]] in September 1944, but the unity of agricultural organizations that it had established persisted.{{sfn|Paxton|1997|p=149}}
The new socialist Minister of Agriculture, [[François Tanguy-Prigent]], replaced it with a national union of working farmers rather than landowners, the General Confederation of Agriculture (GCA).
In March 1946 the CGA became the Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles (FNSEA).{{sfn|Gildea|2013|p=361}}
Many of the former Peasant Corporation leaders became leaders of the FNSEA.{{sfn|Paxton|1997|p=149}}

'''Globalization of wine''' is the expansion of [[wine]] [[varietal]]s and [[brand]]s across nations and to other continents, especially in modern times as a result of the advent of air travel and access to wine information via  the [[internet]].

==History==
{{main article|History of wine}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Wine has been traded internationally since ancient times. In the wake of the [[amphora]]s came professional winemakers, winemaking techniques, and cuttings of grapevines. Many grapes that are considered 'traditional' in Western Europe were in fact brought by ancient trade routes from the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region. The [[Phoenicians (wine)|Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks (wine)|Greeks]], the [[Romans (wine)|Romans]], the [[Armenian wine|Armenians]] all brought grapes to new homes.

There was a second wave of migration to the New World, under the European empires of the 16th–19th centuries – by the early 18th century South Africa was exporting [[Constantia (wine)|Constantia]] to Europe, made with muscat grapes that originated in [[Egypt]]. Subsequent immigrants have brought their native wines and grapes wherever they have gone – the Italian influence on Argentine and Californian winemaking is particularly noteworthy. Wines from [[Portugal]] and [[Madeira]] were fortified to survive journeys across the world, and left their mark on wines in the colonies that aped their style and were named after them.

The [[phylloxera]] epidemic of the late 19th century also had a big influence, destroying traditional field blends of indigenous grapes in vineyards, which were often replaced by monocultures of fashionable grapes such as the [[Bordeaux]] varieties – grafted, of course, onto rootstocks from North America. Vignerons faced a stark choice, either  adopt the new techniques, or choose another profession.  Phylloxera was the stimulus for the development of a new infrastructure of government breeding programmes and exchange of plant material and techniques.

After the [[Second World War]], a number of countries developed bland wines for the export market, with an emphasis on uniformity and branding, such as [[Mateus (wine brand)|Mateus Rose]] and [[Blue Nun]]. These were welcomed by a mass market – and the multiple retailers who served them – and those same factors have helped similar brands to gain more power, although changes in fashion mean that the names have changed.  The modern equivalents come from industrial [[irrigated vineyards]] in the New World, in regions such as Murray Darling in southern Australia and Worcester in South Africa.  Such moves reflect changes in the general scale of food production in industrialised countries.

Another aspect of this is the rise of varietal labelling, which has made the big companies less tolerant of blends of obscure grapes, instead preferring to market 'big name' varietals such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]],  [[Merlot]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Syrah]] (Shiraz), [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc]] and [[Riesling]].

Another growing trend has been the practice of the blending of bulk wine from other countries with local wine.  In some cases, a wine marketed as a local product may be sourced entirely from elsewhere.  Regulations on this practice vary widely, depending on the jurisdiction.

The [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] in 1976 and subsequent [[wine competitions]] helped winemakers throughout the New World realize that they could make wines equal to the very best produced anywhere in the world as well educating some markets about the potential of wine outside Europe. This process was much easier in some countries like England, with little indigenous production and a centuries-old tradition of importing wine from around the world, than it was in other countries. Further competitions brought to international attention other great wines from around the world, some of which like [[Penfolds Grange]] had already been made for decades.

A major influence has been the wine critic [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] among consumers in the United States. His approval can make a massive difference to sales of a wine in the United States, and some winemakers in some parts of the world have been accused of chasing this market by changing their wines to suit his personal taste. This effect is the main subject of the documentary film ''[[Mondovino]]''.  His points system is influential, particularly among retailers as a substitute for staff training.

==Return to ''terroir''==
On the other hand, as New World winemaking has matured, winemakers have taken more notice of ''[[terroir]]'', and matching grapes and winemaking styles to particular locations. Thus New World styles are starting to develop, such as [[Clare Valley]] Riesling, [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] Sauvignon Blanc, and 'indigenous' varieties such as [[Pinotage]] are being proudly marketed as single-varietal wines rather than blended.

In Europe, there is renewed interest in heritage wines, particularly by the new democracies in Eastern Europe where wine can be a statement of national identity.  A particularly good example is seen in [[Eger]] in Hungary, where the local [[Egri Bikavér|Bull's Blood]] wine has seen a steady infusion of foreign grapes such as [[Blaufränkisch]] in the 18th century, the Bordeaux varieties after ''[[phylloxera]]'' struck, and [[Zweigelt]] under communism. This is now being reversed with substantial new planting of the traditional [[Kadarka]] variety.

'''Greece–Macedonia relations''' refer to the [[bilateral relations]] between the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Greece has a Liaison Office in [[Skopje]] and an Office of Consular, Economic and Commercial Affairs in [[Bitola]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athensinfoguide.com/gengreeceabroad-ej.htm Greek Embassies and Consulates] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Republic of Macedonia maintains a Liaison Office in [[Athens]] and an Office for Consular, Economic and Commercial Affairs in [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missions.gov.mk/athens/liaison-office/about-the-liaison-office/?lang=en-GB About the Liaison Office] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the Republic of Macedonia broke away from former Yugoslavia, Greece has refused to recognize its name.&lt;ref name="YPEKS fYROM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ |title=FYROM Name Issue |publisher=www.mfa.gr |accessdate=27 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015051902/http://www1.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ |archivedate=15 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisional reference '''''the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia''''' ('''FYROM''')&lt;ref name="Interim Accord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/120001_144071/6/3/00004456.pdf |title=GREECE and THE  FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF  MACEDONIA - Interim Accord  (with  related  letters  and  translations  of the Interim Accord in the languages of the Contracting Parties).

Nevertheless, all United Nations member-states have agreed to accept any final agreement resulting from negotiations between the two countries. The ongoing dispute has not prevented the two countries from enjoying close trade links and investment levels (especially from Greece), but it has generated a great deal of political and academic debate on both sides.

On 13 September 1995 the two countries signed the Interim Accord,&lt;ref name="Interim Accord" /&gt; whereby Greece recognized the Republic of Macedonia under its provisional reference.&lt;ref name="Interim Accord" /&gt; As of August 2011 negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute are ongoing. Under Greek pressure, the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] agreed that in order for the Republic of Macedonia to receive an invitation to join these institutions the name dispute must be resolved first.&lt;ref name="NATO summit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summitbucharest.ro/en/doc_202.html |title=Bucharest Summit Declaration Issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Bucharest on 3 April 2008 |date=3 April 2008 |publisher=www.summitbucharest.ro |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU Accession"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:080:0032:01:EN:HTML |title=2008/212/EC: Council Decision of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and repealing Decision 2006/57/EC |date=18 February 2008 |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU Accession 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2010/package/conclusions_fyrom_en.pdf |title=Conclusions on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia |publisher=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a case at the [[International Court of Justice]] against Greece for violation of the Interim Accord.&lt;ref name="ICJ 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf |title=The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia institutes proceedings against Greece for a violation of Article 11 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 |date=17 November 2008 |publisher=www.icj-cij.org |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]], Greece sent peacekeeping forces together with other [[NATO]] and [[European Union]] members. In addition, Greece donated 10 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]] [[ELVO Leonidas-2|Leonidas-2]] to the Republic of Macedonia.

On 4 October 2012, the Greek foreign minister [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]] sent a memorandum of understanding to the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, [[Nikola Poposki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/10/macedonia-and-greece?spc=scode&amp;spv=xm&amp;ah=9d7f7ab945510a56fa6d37c30b6f1709 | title=Macedonia and Greece | publisher=The Economist | date=2012-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gr/en/current-affairs/news-announcements/foreign-ministry-announcement-regarding-letter-from-foreign-minister-avramopoulos-to-fyrom-foreign-minister-poposki.html | title=Letter from Avramopoulos to FYROM foreign minister Poposki | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Athens| date=2012-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Court of Eritrea''' is the [[final court of appeal]] in [[Eritrea]] and the highest court in the Eritrean judicial hierarchy. It has both original and [[appellate]] jurisdiction.

A panel of three [[judge]]s hears all original cases.  However, when the High Court is serving final appeals, a panel of five judges hears the trial.

In 2005, The High Court took an average of 2 months to decide if it would hear an appeal, and at year's end had a backlog of approximately 200 cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2006-08-01|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61568.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (2005)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Huilumies"''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "A Flute Man") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]]. The song was composed by [[Aarno Raninen]], who also had composed 1977 entry "[[Lapponia (song)|Lapponia]]". In turn, lyricist [[Vexi Salmi|Veikko 'Vexi' Salmi]] had also written the lyrics to 1979 entry "[[Katson sineen taivaan]]".

The song was performed tenth on the night (following [[Switzerland]]'s [[Paola (singer)|Paola]] with "[[Cinéma (song)|Cinéma]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Sverre Kjelsberg]] &amp; [[Mattis Hætta]] with "[[Sámiid Ædnan]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 6 points, placing 19th (last) in a field of 19.

The song is sung from the perspective of the tititular "flute man", who sings that while he may not be able to express his feelings in words, he is able to do so with his flute.

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981 Contest]] by [[Riki Sorsa]] with "[[Reggae OK]]".

The resistance began after Metropolitan [[Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow|Sergius (Stragorodsky)]] issued formal declaration to all members of the Church, called for loyalty toward the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government: “… ''We need to prove it by not words but deeds that not only those indifferent to the Orthodoxy, not only its betrayers can be loyal citizens of the Soviet Union but also its most fervent adherents for whom it is as dear as the truth and life with all its dogmas and traditions, all its canonical and service ways. We want to be Orthodox and simultaneously view the Soviet Union as our civil fatherland, whose joys and achievements are our joys and achievements and failures are our failures''”

'''Kel Ahaggar''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: ⴾⵍ ⵂⴴⵔ) (trans: "People of Ahaggar") is a [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] confederation inhabiting the [[Hoggar Mountains]] (Ahaggar mountains) in [[Algeria]]. The confederation is believed to have been founded by the Tuareg matriarch [[Tin Hinan]], whose monumental [[Tin Hinan Tomb|tomb]] is located at [[Abalessa]]. The official establishment is dated to around 1750. It has been largely defunct since 1977, when it was terminated by the [[Algeria|Algerian government]].

The language of the confederation is ''Tahaggart'', a dialect of [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]].

== Tribes ==
The Kel Ahaggar confederation is made up of a number of tribes, including:
*[[Aït Loaien]]
*[[Dag Rali]] (also spelled Dag Ghâli)
*[[Iregenaten]]
*[[Kel Rela]], the ruling tribe.
*[[Kel Silet]]
*[[Taituq]]
*[[Tégéhé Millet]]

The '''Lithuanian State Symphony Orchestra''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos valstybinis simfoninis orkestras}} or '''LVSO''') is one of [[Lithuania]]'s two national orchestras, founded in 1988. The other, the [[Lithuanian National Symphony Orchestra]] (LNSO, Lietuvos nacionalinis simfoninis orkestras) was founded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bousfield ''Baltic States'' Rough Guides 2004 p97 "Classical music, opera and ballet; Vilnius can boast two symphony orchestras, of which the [[Lithuanian National Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Lietuvos nacionalinis simfoninis orkestras) is marginally the more prestigious, receiving the lion's share of visiting soloists and also embarking on major international tours in its own right. The Lithuanian State Symphony Orchestra (Lietuvos valstybinis simfoninis orkestras) is a newer outfit that doesn't have quite the same pedigree, but it is also of the highest quality, as is the other jewel in Vilnius's musical crown, the [[Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] (Nacionalinis operos ir baleto teatras)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra began as a group of young musicians led by [[Gintaras Rinkevičius]] in 1988, which gave its first concert on January 30, 1989.&lt;ref name=15min/&gt; One of the most famous conductor in Lithuania, the National Award winner Gintaras Rinkevičius (b. 1960) is a Lithuanian State Symphony Orchestra‘s founder, artistic director and chief conductor. Current conductors include Ričardas Šumila and Martynas Staškus. The orchestra staged over a dozen operas, starting with [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' directed by [[Oskaras Koršunovas]] in 1995. Six other operas were directed by [[Dalia Ibelhauptaitė]].&lt;ref name=15min&gt;[http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/kultura/muzika/lietuvos-valstybinis-simfoninis-orkestras-koncertu-atsves-22-aji-gimtadieni-284-134634 Lietuvos valstybinis simfoninis orkestras koncertu atšvęs 22-ąjį gimtadienį (nuotraukos)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis I, Count of Loon (Looz)''' (after 1107 &amp;ndash; 11 August 1171) was the [[County of Loon|Count of Loon]], which he inherited from his father.  He ruled from approximately 1139 until his death.

== Life ==
He was the son of [[Arnold II, Count of Looz]], and his wife whose name may have been Adeleide or Agnes.&lt;ref&gt;Vaes p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[vogt]] (advocate) of [[Averbode Abbey]]. In 1154, he donated Laethof Manor in [[Heusden-Zolder]] to the abbey.

He constructed a castle in Brustem (now part of [[Sint-Truiden]]).  In 1155, he inherited the [[County of Rieneck]] from his brother Gerhard.

Louis married Agnes of Metz ({{circa|1114}} &amp;ndash; {{circa|1175/1180}}),{{sfn|Baerten|1965|p=1242}} the daughter of Folmar V, [[County of Metz|Count of Metz]], and Matilda of Dagsburg, the heiress of [[Longwy]].  Agnes commissioned [[Hendrik van Veldeke]] to write his "Life of [[Saint Servatius]]".  Louis I served as [[burgrave]] of Metz from 1159 to 1162.  Via his wife, he also had a claim on the Duchy of Luxembourg, however, he could not realize this claim.

In 1171, Louis attempted to conquer the County of [[Duras Castle|Duras]].  However, Gilles, Count of Duras, called in the help of the citizens of Sint-Truiden and together they defeated Louis' army.  Louis died during this battle, on 11 August 1171.  He was buried in the chapel of the infirmary in [[Borgloon]].  His grave can still be found there.

== Issue ==
Louis and Agnes had the following children:
* [[Agnes of Loon|Agnes]], married [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria]]
* Arnold, died young
* [[Gérard II, Count of Looz|Gerard, Count of Loon]]
* Hugo, married and had issue
* Bonne, married Walter Berthout, Lord of [[Mechelen]] and [[Grimbergen]]
* Imagina married [[Godfrey III, Count of Louvain]]
* Lauretta (d. before 1193), married [[Gilles, Count of Montaigu|Gilles]], [[Counts of Duras|Count of Duras]] (divorced 1174), grandson of [[Otto II, Count of Duras]], and later married to [[Theobald I of Bar]].
Louis was succeeded as Count of Loon by his son Gerard II.

'''Luigi Alidosi''' (also '''Ludovico''', died 1430) was the lord of [[Imola]] (as Papal vicar) from 1391 until 1424, the last ruler of the city from his family. He was the son of [[Bertrando Alidosi]].

During the [[Wars in Lombardy]], his city was attacked by [[Filippo Maria Visconti]]'s army, and he was taken captive to Milan. When he was freed after the end of the conflict, Imola had been acquired by the Papal States: he therefore became a [[Cistercian]] monk, and died in Rome in 1430.

'''Placido Rizzotto''' (Corleone, January 2, 1914 – March 10, 1948) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Italian Resistance|partisan]]&lt;ref&gt;http://lombardia.anpi.it/voghera/rizzotto/rizzotto.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, [[socialist]] peasant and [[trade union]] leader from [[Corleone]], who was assassinated by [[Sicilian Mafia]] boss [[Luciano Leggio]]. Pieces of Rizzotto's mutilated body were discovered two years later at the bottom of a cliff with his limbs chained up, and a bullet hole in his head. When he was killed, Rizzotto was doing activist work with farm laborers, trying to help them take over unfarmed land on large estates in the area.&lt;ref name = "whiteout-137"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Cockburn  | first = Alexander  | authorlink = Alexander Cockburn  |author2=[[Jeffrey St. Clair]]   | title = Whiteout, the CIA, drugs and the press  | pages= 137| publisher = [[Verso]]  | year=  1998  | location = [[NYC|New York]]  | isbn = 1-85984-258-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="midnight-104"&gt;{{cite book|title=Midnight in Sicily|author=Peter Robb|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-42684-2|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaQ7atNLeawC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A passion for Sicilians: the world around Danilo Dolci|author=Jerry Mangione|publisher=Transaction|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88738-606-0|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AlM3vxXp8gC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mafia and politics, Volume 1966, Part 1|author=Michele Pantaleone|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1966|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uA8ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Placido+Rizzotto%22+%28Union+OR+unionist+OR+socialist%29&amp;dq=%22Placido+Rizzotto%22+%28Union+OR+unionist+OR+socialist%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tiZ4TMmAOIXGsAPNkuStBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2012, nearly 65 years after his death, his remains were reburied in [[Sicily]] with state honors. The Italian government recognized in this way his achievement in standing up against the Italian Mafia.

The party was founded by Choua in December 1991 and was among the first batch of political parties to be legalized in March 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Parties of the World'' (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Chadian parliamentary election, 2002|parliamentary election]] held on 21 April 2002, the party, allied to the ruling [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]], won 12 out of 155 seats.

However, since the [[2005 Chad constitutional referendum]], which would allow President [[Idriss Déby]] to eliminate presidential terms, the RDP has been part of the opposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4114">The '''Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan''' ({{zh|'''台灣地位未定論'''}}), also called the '''Theory of the Undetermined Sovereignty of Taiwan''' ({{zh|'''台灣主權未定論'''}}), is one of the theories which describe the [[island of Taiwan]]'s present legal status.

The theory originated from United States President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s statement on 27 June 1950, regarding the [[Korean War]], which had broken out two days earlier. In his statement, Truman said that it would be a direct threat to the [[United States]]' security in the western [[Pacific]] area if the communist forces occupied Taiwan, so he ordered the [[7th Fleet]] to enter the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent any attack on the island. Truman stated: "The determination of the future status of [[Formosa]] must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with [[Japan]], or consideration by the [[United Nations]]."&lt;ref name="Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Harry S. Truman]] | title = Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=800 | website = [[Harry S. Truman Library and Museum]] | date = 27 June 1950 | accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the statement, the Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan came into existence.

Although Japan concluded the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1951, in the treaty it merely "renounced" all right, title and claim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | date= 8 September 1951 | title = Treaty of San Francisco | quote = Chapter II. Territory – Article 2 – (b) Japan renounces all right, title and claim to Formosa and the Pescadores.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Taiwan and the [[Pescadores]] without explicitly stating the sovereignty status of the two territories. Therefore, the Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan is still supported by some politicians and jurists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Shirley A. Kan; Wayne M. Morrison | title = U.S.-Taiwan Relationship: Overview of Policy Issues | url = http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41952.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[Congressional Research Service]] | location = [[Washington, D.C.]] | date = 11 December 2014 | page = 4 | quote = The United States has its own "one China" policy (vs. the PRC's "one China" principle) and position on Taiwan's status.

Supporters of the theory include, but are not limited to, supporters of the [[Taiwan independence movement]]. They believe that Taiwan's status should be determined by [[Taiwanese people]] through [[self-determination]].

'''Ulytau''' ({{lang-kz|Ұлытау}}), literally meaning "the great mountain", is a popular Turkic neopagan instrumental [[folk metal]] trio from [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="KMC"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Music of Ulytau |url=http://www.kazakhstanmediacentre.com/history/arts/ulytau.cfm |publisher=Kazakhstanmediacentre.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330212937/http://www.kazakhstanmediacentre.com/history/arts/ulytau.cfm |archivedate=March 30, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their music combines the sound of the violin and electric guitar with the [[dombra]], a traditional two stringed instrument from their country.

The band is named after the district of Ulytau in Central Kazakhstan, the mythical birthplace of the nation.

==Biography==
Ulytau was conceived as a project by producer Kydyrali Bolmanov in 2001 to merge Western and Eastern music with arrangements of classical music from such composers as [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Niccolò Paganini]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Creation |url=http://www.ulytau.kz/en/pages/2.jsp |publisher=Ulytau.kz |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401042539/http://www.ulytau.kz/en/pages/2.jsp |archivedate=April 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since toured Germany, England, Scotland, Poland, USA, Turkey, China, Japan and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulytau |publisher=Darksage.ru (In Russian) |url=http://darksage.ru/page/ULYTAU |accessdate=May 6, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}} (Google translation: ''Despite the youth, musicians have already visited with tours in Germany, England, Scotland, Poland, USA, Turkey, China, Japan and, of course, Russia.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The band was awarded the "Golden Disc" in 2001 for their song "Aday" that was based on a composition from Kurmangazy of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home-of-rock-news.blog.de/2009/06/19/ulytau-wanderer-welten-6345638/ ULYTAU – Wanderer zwischen Welten] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153331/http://home-of-rock-news.blog.de/2009/06/19/ulytau-wanderer-welten-6345638/ |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also featured on the [[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] compilation to the music of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Greenberg, Adam |title=''The Rough Guide to the Music of Central Asia'' review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r727247|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
