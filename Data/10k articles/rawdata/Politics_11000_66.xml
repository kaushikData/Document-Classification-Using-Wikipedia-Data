      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">'''ABC Codes''' are five-digit [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) compliant alpha codes (e.g., AAAAA) used by licensed and non-licensed [[healthcare]] practitioners on standard healthcare claim forms (e.g., [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]] 1500 Form) to describe services, remedies and/or supply items provided and/or used during patient visits. ABC codes contain both a short description and an expanded definition of the service, remedy and/or supply item. ABC codes were created and designed by ABC Coding Solutions [http://www.ABCcodes.com].

ABC codes fill gaps in healthcare coding and the [[National Health Information Network]] (NHIN) that older medical code sets do not cover by describing care provided by all healthcare practitioners. ABC codes can also be used in conjunction with two-digit, alpha-numeric practitioner identifiers (e.g., 1A) to identify the practitioner type (e.g., chiropractor) providing the service. Additionally, ABC codes are supported by state legislative references regarding scope of practice and training requirements on a code, state and practitioner-specific basis.

ABC codes are a proposed solution and approach to accurately document care provided during each patient encounter as mandated by HIPAA.

[[File:Seal of the National Transitional Council (Libya).svg|thumb|Seal of the National Transitional Council]]
The '''aftermath of the Libyan Civil War''' has been characterized by marked change in the social and political order of [[Libya]] after the overthrow and [[Killing of Muammar Gaddafi|killing]] of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]]. The country has been subject to ongoing proliferation of weapons, Islamic insurgencies, sectarian violence, and lawlessness, with spillovers affecting neighboring countries including [[Mali]].

After the interim [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) declared that the country had been liberated in October 2011, it began a process to form a new government, prepare for elections and prosecute former Gaddafi officials. In the absence of an organized military, armed militias of former rebels continued to assert their role as "guardians of the revolution" around the country, and there were reports of vigilante justice and sporadic clashes between rival militias. International organizations voiced concerns over the proliferation of weapons in the region, and the risk that they might fall into the hands of militant [[Islamist]]s.

[[Libyan General National Congress election, 2012|Elections]] were held in July 2012 to a [[General National Congress]] (GNC), which took power a month later, charged with organising a [[constituent assembly]] for authoring Libya's new constitution. The NTC was formally dissolved, and in November 2012 [[Ali Zeidan]] was sworn in as Prime Minister. In March 2014, Zeidan was ousted by the GNC, amid [[2014 Libyan conflict|escalating conflict in the country]]. On 4 August 2014, the GNC was replaced by a newly elected [[Council of Deputies]] (CoD), but on 25 August 2014, some members of the former GNC reconvened unilaterally and said they had elected [[Omar al-Hasi]] as Prime Minister, effectively leaving the country with two rival governments: the one proclaimed by the CoD in [[Tobruk]] and the one proclaimed by the [[General National Congress (2014)|claimant GNC]] in [[Tripoli]].

== Uprising and civil war ==
{{main article|2011 Libyan civil war}}
The popular uprising against the government of Gaddafi began in January 2011 as non-violent protests, simultaneously with other protests in the [[Arab Spring]]. Within weeks, violence broke out in clashes between police and protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libyans Protest over Delayed Subsidized Housing Units|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/297407|date=16 January 2011|work=Egypt Independent|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya Protest over Housing Enters Its Third Day|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4032/World/Region/Libya-protest-over-housing-enters-its-third-day.aspx|last=Abdel-Baky|first=Mohamed|date=16 January 2011|work=[[Al-Ahram]]|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) was formed in an effort to consolidate efforts for change in the rule of Libya.&lt;ref name=NTCform&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/28/us-libya-protests-idUSTRE71G0A620110228| title=World raises pressure on Libya, battles for key towns|agency=Reuters |last=Golovnina|first=Maria| date=28 February 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi forces lost control of several cities in eastern Libya,&lt;ref name=NTCform/&gt; and a number of officials resigned or defected from his government.&lt;ref name="BBCNews-pressure"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12550719 |title=Pressure Mounts on Isolated Gaddafi|publisher=BBC News|date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Gaddafi forces launched a counteroffensive, and regained many of the cities that had been lost to opposition forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=19 March 2011|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/03/201131934914112208.html|title=Gaddafi Forces Encroaching on Benghazi|publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-March, tanks of Gaddafi forces rolled into the main remaining bastion of the opposition forces, [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=19 March 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12793919|title=Libya: Gaddafi Forces Attacking Rebel-Held Benghazi|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, aircraft of the [[French Air Force]] entered Libyan airspace under the mandate of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], to prevent any attacks on the city.&lt;ref name=aljazcommand&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-19 |title=Libya Live Blog – March&amp;nbsp;19 |accessdate=19 March 2011 |date=19 March 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xJ4lwmv0?url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/live/africa/libya-live-blog-march-19 |archivedate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A multinational coalition launched a large scale air-based [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] to disable the Gaddafi government's military capabilities and enforce the UN Security Council resolution.&lt;ref name=aljazcommand/&gt; By the end of March, command of the coalition operations had been assumed by [[NATO]] under [[Operation Unified Protector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/deal-puts-nato-at-head-of-libyan-operation/story-e6frg6so-1226027088954 |title=Deal Puts NATO at Head of Libyan Operation |work=The Australian|last=Norington|first=Brad |date=23 March 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following months were characterized by a stalemate on the ground, as opposition fighters were unable to retake cities in western Libya. The stalemate was broken in August as opposition forces advanced on the cities surrounding [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/libyan-rebels-converging-on-tripoli/2011/08/21/gIQAbF3RUJ_story.html|title=Gaddafi's rule crumbling as rebels enter heart of Tripoli | work=The Washington Post|location=Tripoli|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Liz|last2=Sly|accessdate=25 January 2012 | date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of August, opposition fighters had captured Tripoli, with little resistance from Gaddafi forces. The opposition then launched a series of campaigns against the last pockets of resistance by Gaddafi loyalists, and in October, Gaddafi and several other leading figures in his government were captured and killed in Gaddafi's hometown of [[Sirte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79J09O20111020|title=Libya forces capture Sirte|agency=Reuters|work=Reuters Africa|date= 20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15389550|title=Muammar Gaddafi killed in Libya|publisher=BBC|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events after Gaddafi's death ==
[[File:El keib.jpg|thumb|Libyan interim Prime Minister [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]]]]
On 23 October 2011, the [[National Transitional Council]] officially declared that Libya had been liberated.&lt;ref name="declib"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/23/libya-declaration-liberation-idUKL5E7LN0P620111023|title=UPDATE 4-Libya declares nation liberated after Gaddafi death|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|first1=Yasmine|last1=Saleh|first2=Brian|last2=Rohan|location=Benghazi|agency=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libya's ''de facto'' Prime Minister, [[Mahmoud Jibril]] announced that consultations were under way to form an [[interim government]] within one month, followed by elections for a constitutional assembly within eight months and parliamentary and presidential elections to be held within a year after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Libya-to-Declare-Liberation-from-42-Year-Gadhafi-Rule-132403478.html|title=Libya Declares Liberation From 42-Year Gadhafi Rule|publisher=Voice of America|first=Al|last=Pessin|location=Tripoli|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jibril then stepped down to make place for elections and was succeeded as interim Prime Minister by [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]] after a brief period in which Jibril's deputy, [[Ali Tarhouni]], had assumed his duties. El-Keib was elected by members of the National Transitional Council, gaining 26 out of 51 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-31/libya-s-ntc-elects-ex-alabama-professor-el-keib-as-interim-prime-minister.html|work=Bloomberg L.P.|title=Libya’s NTC Elects Ex-Alabama Professor El-Keib as Interim Prime Minister|date=1 November 2011|accessdate=2 November 2011|first1=Zaid|last1=Sabah|first2=Caroline|last2=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2011, the United Nations mandate authorizing international military action in Libya was lifted, and [[NATO]]'s [[Operation Unified Protector]] formally ended, in spite of requests by the NTC for military assistance to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security fears as UN ends Libya military mandate|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|work=The Independent|first=Kim|last=Sengupta|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/security-fears-as-un-ends-libya-military-mandate-2376888.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nato chief Rasmussen 'proud' as Libya mission ends|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of a government ===
{{main article|National Transitional Council}}
On 22 November 2011, the NTC named its interim government. [[Osama al-Juwaili]], a commander of the military council in [[Zintan]] whose forces were responsible for the capture of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, was named [[defense minister]]. [[Fawzi Abdelali]], a militia leader from [[Misrata]], was named [[interior minister]]. [[Ashour Bin Hayal]], a diplomat originally from [[Derna, Libya|Derna]], was named [[foreign minister]]. [[Hassan Ziglam]], an oil industry executive, was named [[finance minister]]. [[Ali Hameda Ashour]] was named [[justice minister]]. [[Abdulrahman Ben Yezza]], a former executive with the Italian oil and gas company [[Eni]], was made oil minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/22/us-libya-idUSTRE7AL0JM20111122 | title=Libya's NTC unveils new government line-up | date=22 November 2011 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=11 December 2011 | last=Murphy | first=Francois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/11/23/profiles-of-libyas-new-cabinet-ministers/ | title=Profiles of Libya’s New Cabinet Ministers| publisher=Voice of America | date=23 November 2011 | accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2012, [[Yousef al-Manqoush]], a retired general from [[Misrata]], was named head of the [[Libyan National Army]] by the NTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL6E8C32DU20120103| title=UPDATE 1-Libya names new head of armed forces | agency=Reuters Africa | date=3 January 2012 | accessdate=5 January 2012|location=Tripoli|first=Mahmoud|last=Habboush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2012, it was reported that majority of the NTC members approved a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib citing incompetence as the main reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/04/26/libya-cabinet-fired.html|title=Libya Cabinet Fired By National Transitional Council|work=[[CBC News]]|date=26 April 2012|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=27 April 2012|location=Tripoli|first=Rami|last=Al-Shaheibi}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the president of the NTC denied the news stating that the government would stay until the elections in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/29/us-libya-government-idUSBRE83S0CJ20120429|title=Libya leader says government to stay put until elections
|date=29 April 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=2 May 2012|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2012, [[Ali Zeidan]] was elected Prime Minister by a vote of 93 to 85, with two weeks to submit his proposed new government for approval by Congress. Zeidan's cabinet, formed by ministers from the NFA, the JCP, and independents, was approved by Congress on 31 October 2012 and sworn in on 14 November.

In March 2014, Zeidan was ousted by the GNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26533594 | title=Libya PM Zeidan dismissed as oil tanker 'breaks blockade' | work=BBC News | date=11 March 2014 | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/world/africa/libyas-prime-minister-ousted-in-chaos-over-tanker.html | title=Libya’s Prime Minister Ousted in Chaos Over Tanker | work=[[New York Times]] | date=11 March 2014 | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August 2014, the GNC was replaced by a new [[Council of Deputies]]. On 25 August 2014, some members of the former GNC [[General National Congress (2014)|reconvened unilaterally]] in Tripoli and said they had elected [[Omar al-Hasi]] as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/libya-outgoing-parliament-elects-pm-2014825134648296586.html | title=Libya's outgoing parliament elects PM | work=[[Al Jazeera]] | date=25 August 2014 | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.voanews.com/content/libya-in-turmoil-with-second-premier-elected/2427613.html | title=Libyan Turmoil: 2 Assemblies, 2 Premiers | work=[[Voice of America]] | date=25 August 2014 | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First public elections ===
On 1 January 2012, the NTC released a 15-page draft law that would regulate the election of a national assembly charged with writing a new constitution and forming a second caretaker government. The proposed law laid out more than 20 classes of people who would be prohibited from standing as candidates in the elections, including Libyans who had ties to Muammar Gaddafi, former officials accused of torturing Libyans or embezzling public funds, active members of the Revolutionary Guard, opposition members who made peace with Gaddafi and academics who wrote about Gaddafi's [[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]].&lt;ref name="nolinkelections"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE8010H920120102| title=Libyans linked to Gaddafi can't run in election - draft | agency=Reuters Africa | date=2 January 2012 | accessdate=5 January 2012|location=Tripoli|first=Mahmoud |last=Habboush}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft bill also stipulated that 10% of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly would be reserved for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/01/21/libyans-storm-transitional-govt-hq-in-benghazi/ | title=Libyans Storm Transitional Govt. HQ in Benghazi | publisher=Voice of America | date=21 January 2012| accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finalization of the election law would be followed by the appointment of an election commission to divide the country into constituencies and oversee the poll, to be held in June.&lt;ref name="nolinkelections"/&gt;

The Forum of National Parties, an association of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election law because it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy. According to [[Wasila al-Ashiq]], head of one of the parties represented in the organization, candidates would have to run as independents under the proposed law because Libya has no law regulating political parties. That would mean that those candidates capable of drawing on tribal power and affiliation would win the seats, she said, while minorities such as the [[Berber people|Berbers]] would be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL6E8CF09420120115|title=Libyan parties reject draft election law|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=17 January 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Reuters Africa|first1=Taha|last1=Zargoun|first2=Oliver|last2=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2012, the NTC announced it had adopted a revised version of the electoral bill as law. The proposed 10 percent quota for female members of the constituent assembly was dropped; instead, the law required political parties to have equal numbers of men and women in their candidate lists. Furthermore, the law called for two-thirds of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly - the so-called General National Congress - to go to candidates of political parties, while the remaining seats would be held by independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gN5_8HWi3dScd2EJPyumFIQH8ttw?docId=CNG.4ffac2cc40606474bc6242c7407d8a26.e1|title=Libya's NTC adopts election law, drops women quota|date=28 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News|first1=Imed |last1=Lamloum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new law governing the formation of political organisations was passed on by the NTC on 24 April. Political parties based on regional, tribal or religious affiliation were prohibited. Furthermore, parties cannot be an extension of a political party abroad or receive foreign funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCTuRbVtfd1O3_vRYxrkF9amsFcg?docId=CNG.a667c2f5c2ae88920e6404e109ae6992.c71|title=Religion-based parties banned under new Libya law|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=25 April 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/25/us-libya-election-idUSBRE83O0Y620120425|title=Libya bans religious, tribal or ethnic parties|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|location=Tripoli|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2012, Libyans voted in their first parliamentary elections since the end of the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. The election, in which more than 100 political parties had registered, formed an interim 200-member national assembly. The purpose of this assembly was to replace the unelected NTC, name a Prime Minister, and form a committee to draft a constitution. The vote was postponed several times to resolve logistical and technical problems, and to give more time to register to vote, and to vetting candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Epatko|first=Larisa|title=In Libya, Expectations High as Parliamentary Vote Approaches|publisher=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2012, the High National Election Commission announced provisional results. Jibril's [[National Forces Alliance]] (NFA) received 48.1%, taking 39 out of the 80 party-list seats. This was followed by the [[Justice and Construction Party (Libya)|Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP), which received 10.3% and 17 seats and third was the National Front Party with 4.1% and three seats. The [[Politics of Libya|Union for the Homeland]] and the [[National Centrist Party]] also took two seats, as did the [[Politics of Libya|Wadi Al-Hayah Party for Democracy and Development]].

[[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], his father's ''heir apparent'', was captured near the town of [[Ubari]] in the [[Idehan Ubari]] by [[Zintan]]i militiamen on 19 November 2011. His capture was confirmed by the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), which had issued an arrest warrant for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and his father during the war. The military council in Zintan said it would hold the Gaddafi son in Zintan until [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]], the incoming Prime Minister of Libya, formed a government it considered capable of taking custody of the high-ranking prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/20111119111936535209.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Saif al-Islam Gaddafi arrested in Libya|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief prosecutor of the ICC, [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], said that he was "not competing" with Libyan authorities to prosecute Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and that he was happy for the case to be tried in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-libya-icc-saif-idUSTRE7AM13H20111123 | title=ICC prosecutor happy for Libya to try Gaddafi son | date=23 November 2011 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=11 December 2011 | last=Murphy | first=Francois|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC said in a separate statement that it had the "exclusive competence" to decide on the continuation of the case before the court, and that if Libyan authorities wish to conduct the prosecutions against Gaddafi in their own country, they must submit a challenge to the admissibility of the case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/48F6B130-EC14-4A51-BC79-1CCF8633E270.htm |title=Course of action before the ICC following the arrest of the suspect Saif Al Islam Gaddafi in Libya |publisher=International Criminal Court |accessdate=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125183824/http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/48F6B130-EC14-4A51-BC79-1CCF8633E270.htm |archivedate=25 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the civil war, brigades of armed volunteers sprang up around the country, reporting to local military councils, which became ''de facto'' local governments. Civilian leaders said that, after the declaration of liberation, the militias shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as "guardians of the revolution". Some of the largest, and most well-equipped brigades were associated with [[Islamist]] groups then forming political parties.&lt;ref name="nytoutlast"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/world/africa/in-libya-the-fighting-may-outlast-the-revolution.html|title=In Libya, Fighting May Outlast the Revolution|date=1 November 2011|work=The New York Times|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|accessdate=16 November 2011|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libyan officials acknowledged that prisoners held by revolutionary forces had been abused, but insisted that the mistreatment had been committed by militias not yet under the control of the new government and that the authorities were trying to eliminate it.

Officials of the NTC said it was not clear how many weapons were still in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15531816|title=UN Security Council concern over Libya arms stockpile|date=1 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[United Nations Support Mission in Libya]] said that Gaddafi's government had accumulated a large stockpile of [[MANPAD]]s, and that although thousands were destroyed during the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]], there were "increasing concerns over the looting and likely proliferation of these portable defence systems, as well as munitions and mines, highlighting the potential risk to local and regional stability."&lt;ref name="UNleak"/&gt;

In November, a convoy loaded with heavy weaponry was intercepted when trying to cross from Libya into neighboring Niger, according to Nigerien security officials. The officials said the convoy was composed of loyalists of Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/libyan-weapons-smugglers-killed-in-border-clash/2011/11/09/gIQAjnAx5M_story.html|title=Libyan weapons smugglers killed in border clash|work=The Washington Post|date=9 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|first=Alice|last=Fordham|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]], believed to be one of the leaders of [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], acknowledged that his Al-Qaeda franchise had acquired weaponry from Gaddafi's arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-terror-group-benefit-libya-weapons/story?id=14923795|title=Al Qaeda Terror Group: We 'Benefit From' Libyan Weapons|date=10 November 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|publisher=ABC News|first1=Lee|last1=Ferran|first2=Rym|last2=Momtaz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of Islamists and foreign powers ===
In August, [[Abdelhakim Belhadj]] was appointed commander of the Tripoli Military Council, a grouping of several brigades of rebels involved in taking the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Libya, Former Enemy Is Recast in Role of Ally|first=Rod|last=Nordland|location=Tripoli|date=1 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/world/africa/02islamist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belhadj was the [[emir]] of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]]. In 2004, he was taken into custody by the [[CIA]] and [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|rendered]] to the Libyan government at the time, who held him in the [[Abu Salim prison]] for seven years, where he claims to have been subjected to torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK says inquiry could probe Libya torture reports|agency=Reuters Africa|date=5 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7K51FT20110905|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rival commanders in the uprising complained that Belhadj has close ties to the [[Qatar]]i monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's rival military commanders fight war of words |first=Nic |last=Robertson |publisher=CNN |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-13/africa/world_africa_libya-rival-commanders_1_qatar-libyan-capital-commanders |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130724024621/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-13/africa/world_africa_libya-rival-commanders_1_qatar-libyan-capital-commanders |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali al-Sallabi]], an Islamist cleric, who lived in [[Doha]] for four years, was a key conduit for weapons, vehicles and funds from Qatar to the Libyan rebels during the civil war. Rebel commanders outside of Sallabi's circle openly complained that they lacked weapons and medical supplies, leading NTC's head of government, [[Mahmoud Jibril]], to send an envoy to Doha to lobby for weapons and supplies to be sent through him. But of the 18 plane loads from Qatar, only five were sent through this NTC-approved channel. This led NTC and Western officials to raise concerns that the Qatari seemed to be aiding primarily Islamist leaders at the expense of the NTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya’s former PM accuses Qatar of seeking too big a role|agency=Reuters|location=Dubai|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012|work=Lebanon Daily Star|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Nov-11/153684-libyas-former-pm-accuses-qatar-of-seeking-too-big-a-role.ashx#axzz1kUdyRACN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sallabi, who is well known as an Islamic scholar and orator in Libya, announced the formation of a party based on Islamic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/world/africa/in-libya-islamists-growing-sway-raises-questions.html|title=Islamists’ Growing Sway Raises Questions for Libya|work=The New York Times|first1=Rod|last1=Nordland|first2=David D.|last2=Kirkpatrick|location=Tripoli|date=14 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Libyan+exile+unveils+party+plan+liberal+Islamic+state/5683190/story.html |title=Libyan exile unveils new party's plan for 'liberal' Islamic state |first=Richard |last=Spencer |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |work=The Vancouver Sun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110032159/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Libyan%2Bexile%2Bunveils%2Bparty%2Bplan%2Bliberal%2BIslamic%2Bstate/5683190/story.html |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice and Development Party (Libya)|Freedom and Justice Party]] was also founded on such principles.

Following the end of Gaddafi's rule, there were reports of attacks against sites of [[Sufi Muslim]]s. In late 2011, a Sufi school in Tripoli was stormed by armed men who "burned its library, destroyed office equipment and dug up graves of sages buried there," and "turned the school into a [[Salafi]] mosque."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/us-libya-sufis-idUSTRE8101LA20120201 | work=Reuters | title=Freed from Gaddafi, Libyan Sufis face violent Islamists | date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, several Sufi sites were heavily damaged or destroyed, including the tomb of [[Abd As-Salam Al-Asmar]] in [[Zliten]] and the mausoleum of [[Abdullah Al-Sha'ab]] in [[Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208402.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[United Nations Independent Expert]]s condemned the destruction of Sufi religious and historic sites in various parts of the country, and [[Human Rights Watch]] said the Libyan government had "failed both to protect sites sacred to Libyan Muslims who follow Sufi practices and to arrest those who have destroyed the tombs."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42838#.Ue0urN-8039&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/31/libya-stop-attacks-sufi-sites&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, [[Ministry of Interior (Libya)|Libyan interior minister]] [[Fawzi Abdel A'al]] resigned in protest at criticism from the [[General National Congress]] over his handling of the violence in the country, though the resignation was subsequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19386322 | work=BBC News | title=Libya interior minister quits after Sufi shrine attacks | date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jIR4TI6x2fXGqH9ikami4qwDihnA?docId=CNG.e223f828e62750350df9154f0a83ad11.d11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/08/2012828151119960654.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]] said it had seized complete control of [[Benghazi]] and that the city had now become "an Islamic emirate".&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/31/Libya-s-Ansar-al-Sharia-declares-Islamic-state-in-Benghazi.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42729&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7#.VDbP2R_Rfrf&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2014, the group had also declared an "Islamic emirate" in the eastern city of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and pledged allegiance to [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] (ISIS).&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/africa/2014/10/06/Video-Libya-s-Islamist-militants-parade-with-ISIS-flags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neighbouring states ===
[[File:Tuareg area.png|thumb|left|A map of the Tuareg region.]]
In the months following the Libyan uprising, the [[Sahel]] region saw thousands of combatants originating from [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], mostly ethnic [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] who supported either Gaddafi or the NTC, returning from Libya to their respective countries with a wide range of weapons. Mali's [[defence minister]], Natie Plea, said that the risk of organizations such as [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM) seizing the arsenal for terrorist purposes was "a real source of concern" for countries in the desert sub-region. The head of the [[United Nations Office for West Africa]] stated that the UN also was concerned about the impact of the Libyan crisis on countries in the Sahel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iAVMWcukaAKi6UJdkM3iXu2Wg9HQ?docId=CNG.156c7bd071cf4eb15b665238e235daca.3d1 |title=Sahel army chiefs weigh regional security risks after Libya |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011|publisher=Google News|location=Bamako}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jhH8BqwJ8NnSUnlViXVxLlqY-GFg?docId=CNG.f2c02c700bcf33947db7403f3c93a92b.51 |title=Kidnappings add to Mali woes after Libyan crisis: UN |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=28 November 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011|publisher=Google News|location=Dakar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's secret service warned that AQIM had planned a "wave of abductions" of Westerners in the wake of the instability in North Africa following the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15573516,00.html |title=Growing threat of al Qaeda in North Africa prompts EU action |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011|first=Nick|last=Amies}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November 2011, two French nationals were kidnapped in northern Mali.

On 28 November 2011, Tunisian customs officers stopped three cars at the [[Ras Ajdir]] border crossing, two of which carried [[contraband]]. Relatives of the smuggler retaliated by burning tires in front of the [[Ben Gardane]] town hall, spreading concern in the city and requiring national and regional officials to intervene. On 30 November 2011, a group of Libyans on the Tunisian side of the border crossing assisted several vehicles loaded with contraband cross into Libya. A Tunisian policeman failed an attempt to stop the vehicles and was attacked and threatened with a firearm, an eyewitness reported. Border police went on strike in protest of the lack of security and the [[Tunisian Armed Forces]] decided to close the border crossing indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/04/us-libya-tunisia-border-idUSTRE7B30CC20111204 |title=Libya says will secure Tunisia border after clashes |agency=Reuters|date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2012|location=Tripoli and Tunis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Tunisia)|Tunisian foreign ministry]] voiced "deep concern" over the infringements of the country's territorial integrity and urged Libya to increase security at the border post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-12/02/c_131283034.htm|title=Tunisia urges Libya to increase security at main border post|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tunis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Tripoli Military Council expressed deep regret over the disorder at the Ras Ajdir border crossing and strongly condemned "any attack that violates the sanctity of Tunisian soil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/04/abdelhakim-belhaj-apologizes-for-disorder-caused-at-ras-ajdir-border-crossing-with-tunisia/ |title=Abdelhakim Belhaj Apologizes for Disorder Caused at Ras Ajdir Border Crossing With Tunisia |work=Tunisia Live |date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |first=Houda |last=Mzioudet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309213244/http://www.tunisia-live.net/2011/12/04/abdelhakim-belhaj-apologizes-for-disorder-caused-at-ras-ajdir-border-crossing-with-tunisia/ |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==

=== Public protests ===
By December 2011, the NTC were facing protests in [[Benghazi]] over the pace of reforms and lack of transparency in the new Libyan government. Protesters were criticizing the NTC and its chairman [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]] and demanding that former Gaddafi supporters would be excluded from governing posts in the new Libyan state. Jalil called for patience and promised that personal details and official information of all government officials would be published publicly on the Internet in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dw.de/dw/article/0,,15600388,00.html | title=Frustration threatens to unleash second Libyan revolution | publisher=Deutsche Welle | date=16 December 2011 | accessdate=5 January 2012|first=Monika|last=Dittrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2012, the vice president of the NTC, [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]], was surrounded and jostled by a mob of protesters at the [[University of Benghazi]] where he was attending a memorial ceremony for those killed during the civil war. He escaped unharmed. Witnesses said the crowd accused him of opportunism due to his belated defection from Gaddafi's government. The NTC responded to the incident by saying "every attack or aggression against the National Transitional Council represents an attack on the sovereignty of the Libyan people and its glorious revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE80J02T20120120|agency=Reuters Africa|date=20 January 2012|accessdate=21 January 2012|title=Students rough up Libya's NTC vice president|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January 2012, Ghoga resigned from the NTC, saying he did not want the "atmosphere of hatred" to affect the council and its performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/libya-benghazi-protests-idUSL5E8CM07X20120122|title=UPDATE 3-Deputy head of Libya's NTC quits after protests|agency=Reuters|date=22 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012|first=Oliver|last=Holmes|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2012, hundreds of protesters, including many young men wounded from the civil war, stormed the NTC's headquarters in Benghazi, protesting the speed of reforms and lack of transparency from the interim government. When the head of the NTC, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, appeared to address the crowd, the protesters began throwing empty plastic bottles at him, prompting security forces to fire tear gas. Before storming the headquarters, protesters threw stones and metal bars at the building, breaking its windows. Jalil is believed to have been pulled to safety after he went back into the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQ_rpc6hqvKeygkMvVVhdLcMx5tA?docId=e8c1ed4fc4e8416caf683269c601d159 | title=Libyans storm transitional government headquarters | agency=Associated Press|publisher=Google News|location=Benghazi | date=21 January 2012 | accessdate=21 January 2012|first=Rami|last=Al-Shaheibi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al Tommy|first=Mohammad|title=Protesters storm Libyan government HQ in Benghazi|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/us-libya-ntc-benghazi-idUSTRE80K0OC20120122|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=21 January 2012|agency=Reuters|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2012, protesters calling for an autonomous [[Cyrenaica|eastern region]] stormed the headquarters of the national election commission in Benghazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/02/libya-elections-benghazi-idINDEE86102S20120702|title=Protesters storm Libya election office in Benghazi|agency=Reuters India|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=2 July 2012|first1=Mohammed|first2=Ahmed |last1=Al-Tommy|last2=Al-Rubaie|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic and tribal reconciliation ===
During the civil war, many [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomad tribes in southern Libya supported Gaddafi because of his past support of their people's rebellions in Mali and Niger. This led to tensions between Tuareg and Arab Libyans, and in the aftermath of the war, the NTC sent out delegations to mediate disputes and reconcile the region with the interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-libya-tuareg-idUSTRE7A82S020111109|title=Tense reconciliation begins with Libya's Saharan tribes|first=Oliver|last=Holmes|location=Obari|date=9 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes, who roam Libya's vast desert expanses, are important to security in the region's remote areas, which are often exploited as a safe haven by drug traffickers and Islamist militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/libya-talks-idUSL5E7KU1SZ20110930|title=Libya officer at Tuareg-Arab talks in desert town|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|agency=Reuters|first=William|last=Maclean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fathi Ben Khalifa, president of the [[World Amazigh Congress]], criticized the NTC for not formally recognizing the [[Berber people]], saying that his people is experiencing a "déjà vu feeling", as Libya's rulers also failed to recognize the Berbers when the country [[Libya#Independence and the Kingdom of Libya 1951–1969|gained its independence]] in 1951, making way for Gaddafi's policies of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Khalifa claims that the NTC is adhering to "Arab and Islamist" ideologies that caused "much of what has happened in [Libya] for the last decades", and that the council envisions the new Libya being rooted in an exclusively [[Islam]]ic constitution. According to Khalifa, "no [Berber] will accept this situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15515687,00.html|title=Libya's Berbers feel rejected by transitional government|date=8 November 2011|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|location=Tripoli|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller tribal groups complained they had been neglected in the interim government announced by the NTC on 22 November 2011. Members of the Benghazi-based Awagi and Maghariba tribes protested that their representatives were not selected for key posts. A group calling itself the Libyan Amazigh Congress called for a suspension of relations with the NTC until it "reconciles with the demands of Amazigh Libyans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Christian|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/uk-libya-idUKTRE7AM0WU20111123|title=Libyan tribes protest at new government line-up|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|agency=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2013, the General National Congress elected [[Nouri Abusahmain]], a political independent from the Berber minority, as its new president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/us-libya-congress-idUSBRE95O0VQ20130625 | work=Reuters | title=Libya assembly votes in first Berber as new chief | date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic movement ===
[[Ali al-Sallabi]], a well-known Muslim cleric who played a key role in funneling arms from [[Qatar]] to the anti-Gaddafi fighters during the civil war, has announced the formation of a party with the provisional name [[National Gathering for Freedom, Justice and Development]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-11-21/world/world_europe_arab-spring-europe_1_arab-world-arab-spring-arab-protests/3 |title=Many similarities in Arab Spring, European chaos |publisher=CNN |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |first=Tim |last=Lister }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sallabi, the party is not [[Islamist]], but respects the general principles of Islam and Libyan culture.&lt;ref name=moderateislam/&gt; Sallabi would not oppose [[Hamas]]' armed struggle against Israel and supports the lifting of laws banning [[polygamy]].

On 17 November 2011, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] held its first public conference on Libyan soil in [[Benghazi]] after having been banned for decades under Gaddafi's government. Suleiman Abdelkader, leader of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, said that rebuilding the country "is not a task for one group or one party but for everyone, based on their ability." He also said his organization would not take part in the interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Francois|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-libya-muslim-brotherhood-idUSTRE7AG2OY20111117|title=Muslim Brotherhood goes public with Libya summit|agency=Reuters|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 January 2012, a group of Libyan Muslim scholars announced the formation of a new Islamist party by the name [[Party of Reform and Development]].

=== Legislation ===
The National Transitional Council adopted laws in early May 2012 granting immunity to former rebel fighters for acts committed during the civil war, confiscating all former regime assets, criminalising "praising or glorifying" [[Muammar Gaddafi]] or his regime, and barring criticism of the revolution or the authority of the Libyan government. It also decreed that detained fighters must be charged and tried by 12 July 2012 or else released. It was not immediately clear whether the laws would govern the transitional period only or would else be permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Libya grants immunity to ‘revolutionaries’|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law 37, which prohibits criticism of the revolution and publication of "propaganda", including vocal support for Gaddafi's family or the ideas of the ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|Green Book]]'', is reportedly based on provisions of the Gaddafi-era penal code banning criticism of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Coup d.27.C3.A9tat of 1969|1969 coup]] that brought Gaddafi to power. The law has faced criticism from [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) and other [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], and a group of Libyan human rights lawyers has vowed to oppose it before the [[Supreme Court (Libya)|Supreme Court]], HRW said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/libya-revoke-draconian-new-law |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416002839/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/libya-revoke-draconian-new-law |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 April 2013 |agency=Reuters AlertNet |title=Libya: Revoke Draconian New Law |date=5 May 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June 2012, the Supreme Court nullified the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/14/220628.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|title=Libyan court nullifies law banning Qaddafi ‘glorification’|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Foreign relations of Libya}}
On 19 October 2011, the NTC became the first government in the world to recognize the [[Syrian National Council]] (SNC) as Syria's "legitimate authority." In November, the Libyan authorities met secretly with members of the SNC and offered them money, arms and, potentially, volunteer fighters for the insurgency against the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8917265/Libyas-new-rulers-offer-weapons-to-Syrian-rebels.html |title=Libya’s new rulers offer weapons to Syrian rebels|work=The Telegraph|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Misrata|first=Ruth|last=Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdelhakim Belhadj]], head of the Tripoli Military Council, met with leaders of the [[Free Syrian Army]] to discuss sending Libyan fighters to train the army's troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8919057/Leading-Libyan-Islamist-met-Free-Syrian-Army-opposition-group.html|title=Leading Libyan Islamist met Free Syrian Army opposition group|work=The Telegraph|date=27 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tripoli|first=Ruth|last=Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, thousands of refugees fleeing the escalating violence in Syria were seeking shelter in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8947419/Syrian-refugees-seek-shelter-in-Libya.html|title=Syrian refugees seek shelter in Libya|work=The Telegraph|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, NTC chairman [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]] met with the President of [[Sudan]], [[Omar al-Bashir]], thanking the country for its support of the rebels during the civil war. The Sudanese government supplied the Libyan rebels with arms and ammunition during the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/25/us-sudan-libya-weapons-idUSTRE7AO1R020111125|title=Libya leader, in Khartoum, thanks Sudan for weapons|agency=Reuters|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Khartoum|first=Khalid|last=Abdelaziz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jalil vowed to establish ties with Sudan in all fields and promised "high-level security cooperation" with the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/26/c_122338452.htm|title=Sudanese president says former Libyan regime biggest enemy|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Khartoum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil ===
On 29 December 2011, Libya's [[National Oil Corporation]] (NOC) announced that the country's output of [[crude oil]] had risen to over 1 million [[barrels per day]] (bpd), compared to 1.6 million bpd before the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=7577 |title=Libya Oil Production Reaches 1m BPD, Expects Full Output by Mid-2012 |work=Tripoli Post |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502020344/http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=7577 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's biggest oil terminal, Es Sider, resumed operations as of January 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/libyas-es-sider-oil-port-resumes-exports-2012-01-03|title=Libya's Es-Sider oil port resumes exports|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012|work=Market Watch|first=Benoit|last=Faucon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may take more than a year to be fully repaired.&lt;ref name="oil"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/us-timeline-oil-idUSTRE79R33N20111028 |title=Factbox: Libya's oil returns; fields, refineries, companies|agency=Reuters|date=28 October 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOC has said that local crude and product needs are given priority. Of Libya's total crude distillation capacity of 378,000 bpd, the country's five domestic refineries are refining 160,000 bpd of current production. Libya's largest refinery, [[Ra's Lanuf Refinery]], is expected to remain offline until the end of the year.&lt;ref name="oil"/&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] said the bulk of repairs to oil infrastructure had been undertaken by local petroleum industry staff, but many of the repairs would have to be performed by foreign specialists working for the international oil companies. Most oil companies have deployed small teams to restart production. NOC said it had taken over full control of marketing Libyan oil, which split during the civil war, and that all future deals would give preference to actors who had shown early support during the uprising.&lt;ref name="oil"/&gt;

The Libyan interior ministry reported on 3 May 2012 that the oil fields were operating in a normal fashion and the production was good. He added that the production of oil had reached 1.55 million barrels per day the previous week, almost pre-war levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libyaherald.com/libya-seeks-extradition-of-bashir-salah-from-france/&lt;/ref&gt; However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 barrels per day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts. Many in the armed groups were current and former employees of units set up to secure the oilfields, reacting to corruption and low pay.&lt;ref name="bbc-20130911"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24051371 |title=Why gunmen have turned off Libya's oil taps |author=Rana Jawad |publisher=BBC |date=11 September 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 there were armed clashes near the [[El Sharara oil field]] and the [[Zawiya District|Zawiya]] refinery. After armed opposition groups took control of [[Tripoli]], a rival oil minister, Mashallah al-Zawie, gave a speech at the oil ministry.&lt;ref name="reuters-20140921"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/21/uk-libya-security-idUKKBN0HG0LY20140921 |title=Fighting close to Libyan oilfield and refinery as rival 'oil minister' appears |author=Ayman Al-Warfalli and Feras Bosalum |publisher=Reuters |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/mashallah-al-zawie-the-new-libyan-minister-of-oil-of-the-news-photo/455900770 |title=The new Libyan minister of oil Mashallah al-Zawie |newspaper=Getty Images |date=21 September 2014 |accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public funds ===
At the beginning of the civil war, the [[UN Security Council]] froze an estimated $150 billion in foreign Libyan assets. By late November 2011, $18 billion had been released to the NTC by the council's sanctions committee. $3 billion had been made available to the new Libyan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFN1E7AT16U20111130|title=UN council wants to free more Libyan assets-envoy|agency=Reuters Africa|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=11 December 2011|first=Patrick|last=Worsnip|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, demands for wages, medication and reconstruction were putting a strain on Libya's limited supply of cash, causing prices to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFJOE7A20I120111103| agency=Reuters Africa| title=Libya c.bank looks to IMF amid cash crisis | date=3 November 2011|accessdate=14 January 2012|first1=Jessica|last1=Donati|first2=Ali|last2=Shuaib|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 2011, senior figures in Libya's new leadership wrote a letter to the United Nations, urging it to release the frozen assets which they said were "essential for the economic stability of Libya".&lt;ref name="cashletter"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/10/us-libya-assets-un-idUSTRE7B90MV20111210 | agency=Reuters | title=Libya leaders send U.N. new appeal to unfreeze funds | date=10 December 2011|accessdate=14 January 2012|location=Tripoli|first=Ali|last=Shuaib}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western officials said legal complications prevented the money from being released quickly. A British Foreign Office minister said his administration would release Libyan assets frozen in the [[United Kingdom]] once Libyan authorities demonstrated their ability to manage them effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Stephen |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-09/u-k-says-it-will-release-libya-funds-when-banks-are-accountable.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723083353/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-09/u-k-says-it-will-release-libya-funds-when-banks-are-accountable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=U.K. Says It Will Release Libya Funds When Banks Are Accountable |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2011, the UN Security Council lifted sanctions on [[Central Bank of Libya|Libya's central bank]] and its offshore subsidiary, [[Libyan Foreign Bank]]. Later the same day, the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] said it had unblocked more than $30 billion in Libyan government assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/16/us-libya-assets-un-idUSTRE7BF21N20111216 | agency=Reuters | title=U.N. sanctions lifted on Libya's central bank | date=16 December 2011|accessdate=14 January 2012|first=Patrick|last=Worsnip|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]], the article name doesn't need to be in the first line--&gt;On 3 December 2012, [[Belfast City Council]] voted to limit the days that the [[Union Flag]] (the flag of the [[United Kingdom]]) flies from [[Belfast City Hall]].&lt;ref name=cainbackground&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/identity/flag-2012.htm A background note on the protests and violence related to the Union Flag at Belfast City Hall]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1906, the flag had been flown every day of the year.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; The vote means that it will now be flown no more than 18 days a year, in line with British government guidelines regarding government buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/designated-days-for-union-flag-flying|title=Designated days for Union Flag flying|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to limit the number of days was backed by the council's [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]]s and the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]; it was opposed by the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] councillors.

As a response, [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalists]] held street protests throughout Northern Ireland. They see the Council's decision as part of a wider 'cultural war' against '[[Britishness]]' in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=orangeculturewar&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23267038 "Northern Ireland Orange Order leaders warn of cultural war"].

They want to take everything British away'"]. ''The Observer''. 12 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of the vote, protesters tried to storm City Hall. Throughout December and January, protests were held almost daily and most involved the protesters blocking roads while carrying Union Flags and banners. Some of these protests led to clashes between loyalists and the police, sparking [[riot]]s. Rioters attacked police with [[petrol bomb]]s, bricks, stones and fireworks; police responded with [[plastic bullet]]s and [[water cannon]]. Alliance Party offices and the homes of Alliance Party members were attacked, while Belfast City Councillors were sent death threats. According to police, some of the violence was orchestrated by high-ranking members of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20651159 "Loyalist paramilitaries 'behind some Northern Ireland trouble'"]. BBC News, 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists also put up thousands of Union flags in public places, which has further heightened tension.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt;

After February 2013, the protests have been smaller and less frequent, and have led to greater loyalist protests about related issues, such as restrictions on [[Parades in Northern Ireland|traditional loyalist marches]].&lt;ref name=orangeculturewar/&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|The Troubles|Timeline of the Northern Ireland Troubles and peace process}}
Since the [[Partition of Ireland|formation of Northern Ireland]] in 1921, there has been tension and violence between its two main religious groups. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]]/[[Ulster loyalist]]s (who are mostly [[Ulster Protestant]]) generally want Northern Ireland to remain within the [[United Kingdom]], while [[Irish nationalist]]s/[[Irish republicanism|republican]]s (who are mostly Catholic) generally want it to leave the United Kingdom and join a [[united Ireland]]. The former generally identify with the [[Union Flag]], while the latter generally do not and instead identify with the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]].&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt;

In Northern Ireland, flags are often used as symbols of political allegiance, cultural identity, and to mark territory.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; The flying of flags is [[Northern Ireland flags issue|an issue]] in Northern Ireland, and flying certain flags in certain places can be highly controversial. There have been many protests and clashes involving flags and symbols over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20595646 "Raw emotions in Northern Ireland exposed by issues like flags"]. BBC News, 4 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 there were riots after a republican election candidate put an Irish tricolour (which was then illegal) in the window of his office on the [[Falls Road, Belfast]]. The unionist [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Home Affairs]], responding to pressure from hardliners, ordered police to remove the flag. This sparked fierce clashes between republicans and the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/docs/boyd69.htm 1964: THE TRICOLOUR RIOTS]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt;

Belfast City Council had long been dominated by unionists, mainly the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). However, in May 2011 Irish nationalists ([[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]) won more seats than unionists for the first time.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; The middle-ground [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] held the balance of power on the council.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; Nationalist councillors wanted the Union Jack taken down permanently, and unionist councillors wanted it to keep flying all year. Alliance put forward a compromise: that it would fly on 18 designated days, in line with UK government policy on the flying of the union flag from UK government buildings, which is followed by many city and local governments in Britain.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/CouncilandDemocracy/Information/Pages/FlagFlyingPolicy.aspx "London Borough of Barking and Dagenham Flag Flying Policy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019123754/http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/CouncilandDemocracy/Information/Pages/FlagFlyingPolicy.aspx |date=19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/days-which-flags-flown-lancaster-mor/|title=Lancaster City Council • Flag days|author=, System|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512053911/http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/days-which-flags-flown-lancaster-mor/|archivedate=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] (or Stormont), where the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] meets, the Union Jack is only flown on 15 designated days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21296119 "Stormont union flag: David Ford hints at movement"]. BBC News, 1 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalist and Alliance councillors voted in favour of this compromise and it was passed.

In the weeks leading up to the vote, the DUP had printed and distributed over 40,000 leaflets in East Belfast, with help from the UUP. The leaflets attacked Alliance and called on people to protest against its proposal.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; Alliance accused the unionists of trying to raise tensions.&lt;ref name=bbcqa&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20651163 Q&amp;A: Northern Ireland flag protests]. BBC News, 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 general election]], [[Naomi Long]] of Alliance had defeated [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] of the DUP to win the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast seat]]. This was the first time that a non-unionist party had won the seat. It is thought that many unionists voted for Alliance as a protest at Robinson's financial misdealings.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt; Some commentators believed that the DUP had been waiting for a chance to weaken the Alliance Party and win back their former voters in East Belfast.&lt;ref name=cainbackground/&gt;

During the middle of 2012, particularly in September, heightened tensions led to the [[2012 North Belfast riots]].&lt;ref name="7jan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="12jan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/12/world/europe/northern-ireland-unrest|title=Northern Ireland: Draped in Union flags, protesters march in Belfast|author=Nic Robertson and Peter Taggart, CNN|date=12 January 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unionist protesters see the change as an "attack on their cultural identity".&lt;ref name=bbcqa/&gt; In December 2012 and early 2013 they held almost daily street protests throughout Northern Ireland. Most involved the protesters blocking roads while carrying Union Flags and banners. Some of these protests led to clashes between protesters and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI), sparking [[riot]]s. Attacks were made on Alliance Party offices and the homes of Alliance Party members, while Belfast City councillors were sent death threats. Unlike the Irish nationalist parties, Alliance has offices in loyalist areas.&lt;ref name=bbcqa/&gt; According to police, some of the violence has been orchestrated by high-ranking members of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; These are the two main loyalist [[paramilitary]] groups, who waged armed campaigns during [[the Troubles]] but declared [[ceasefire]]s in 1994. The ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' claimed that some of the violence has been fuelled by youngsters engaging in "recreational rioting".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130420010945/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/kids-are-enjoying-the-riots-too-much-to-stop-says-cleric-16260244.html "Kids are enjoying the riots too much to stop, says cleric"].

The cost of policing the protests has been estimated at £20 million (up to 7 March 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/union-flag-protests-cost-20m-29116278.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Union flag protests cost £20m | date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2012===
On the evening of 3 December, hundreds of protesters gathered outside City Hall as the debate and vote was being held. Minutes after the vote, protesters broke into the back courtyard and tried to force open the doors of the building. Two security staff and a press photographer were injured, and windows of cars in the courtyard were smashed. Protesters then clashed with the police, injuring 15 officers. The Chief Superintendent said:
{{quote|Clearly there was a level of orchestration – some people brought bolt cutters, others put on masks immediately after the vote came through.}}
On 4 December, Alliance Party councillor Laura McNamee was forced to move from her east Belfast home after receiving threats.&lt;ref name=threats&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20720406 "Timeline of attacks on Northern Ireland political parties"].

The rioters ransacked an Alliance Party office and tried to set it on fire. The home of Michael and Christine Bower, Alliance councillors in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20619259 "Police injured and Alliance property attacked during NI trouble"].

Also present were [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP) leader [[Billy Hutchinson]] and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) commander [[Jackie McDonald]]. Some of the protesters burnt an [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]].

On 10 December, a gang of men attacked a police car guarding Naomi Long's office in east Belfast. They smashed the window and threw in a petrol bomb while a policewoman was still inside, but she escaped unharmed.&lt;ref name=threats/&gt; There was rioting in east and south Belfast. In [[Armagh]], protesters attacked a pub owned by the husband of a Sinn Féin councillor. The windows were smashed and rocket fireworks thrown inside.

BBC News, 11 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two large demonstrations at City Hall on 15 December. In response to the violence, several hundred held a "peace vigil" in which they linked arms and encircled the building. Later, up to 1,000 loyalists with Union Flags blocked the roads in front of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20739202 "Hundreds attend Belfast peace vigil"].

Police were attacked in south Belfast, where loyalists blocked a road near the City Hospital with a burning barricade and tried to hijack vehicles. At a protest in [[Portadown]], a man was hurt in a road accident. At [[Carrickfergus]] town hall, protesters disrupted a meeting of [[Carrickfergus Borough Council|the council]] and threatened councillors. Alliance councillor Noel Williams called it "a full frontal attack on democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20763350 "Trouble flares at flag protests in Belfast"].

===January 2013===

====January 1–15====
Each night from 3–8 January, the protests led to clashes between loyalists and police in East Belfast. Rioters threw [[petrol bomb]]s, fireworks, bricks, stones and bottles; police responded with [[plastic bullet]]s and water cannon.&lt;ref name="3jan"/&gt; According to the ''Belfast Telegraph'', much of the East Belfast violence was being directed by a few high-ranking members of the [[UVF East Belfast Brigade]]. They allegedly ignored orders from the UVF leadership to stop the violence. Police sources said that the East Belfast Brigade leader could have stopped the rioting if he wished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130419222909/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/the-beast-from-east-belfast-could-put-an-end-to-flags-violence-right-now-but-he-wonrsquot-16259762.html "The Beast from East Belfast could put an end to flags violence right now... but he won’t"].

On 7 January, Belfast City Council met for the first time since the vote was passed. The PSNI closed roads around City Hall while loyalists protested outside. The protesters called for the decision to be reversed. About 400 people had gathered near the city hall for a peaceful protest for the first time since the vote as a result of a call through [[social media]].&lt;ref name="7jan"/&gt; As protesters passed the Short Strand on their return to East Belfast, clashes again broke out between the protesters and nationalist residents. When police tried to disperse the crowds, they were attacked with petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks and bottles. Officers and their vehicles were also attacked with hatchets and sledge hammers. They responded with plastic bullets and water cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20940126 "Belfast flags trouble: Plastic bullets fired at protesters"].

On 11 January, protesters blocked roads in Belfast, Bangor, Newtownards, [[Dundonald]] and [[Clough]]. There was rioting in Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus. Petrol bombs, fireworks and stones were thrown at police, who responded with plastic bullets and water cannons; four PSNI officers were injured as a result of the rioting.  A press photographer who was covering the riot in Newtownabbey was robbed at knifepoint, while a bus was set alight in the same area and a car was hijacked in north Belfast. [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] suspended almost all its bus services in Belfast. There were also protests in [[Glasgow]] and [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20985521 "Union flag protests: Police attacked and traffic disrupted"].

However, "the vast majority" took an unapproved route and some then donned masks and attacked police. As they passed Short Strand, there were clashes between the loyalists and nationalists and bricks were thrown at houses. Police came under "heavy and sustained" attack after moving in to deal with the rioters; 29 officers were injured. Officers responded with plastic bullets and water cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/29-PSNI-officers-hurt-in-flag-clashes/e0ac2906-7259-42a2-ad81-64362077b034 "29 PSNI officers hurt in flag clashes"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130419032909/http://www.u.tv/News/29-PSNI-officers-hurt-in-flag-clashes/e0ac2906-7259-42a2-ad81-64362077b034 |date=19 April 2013 }}.

The next day over 1,000 people held another "peace rally" outside City Hall. The protesters clapped, cheered, whistled, and banged drums for five minutes as a show of "anti-silence", saying that it represents "the silent majority" opposed to the violence. Later, about 200 loyalists blocked Albertbridge Road and Castlereagh Street, while a line of riot police separated them from a crowd that had gathered at Short Strand. Some missiles were thrown but there was no serious trouble.&lt;ref name="13jan"/&gt;

The rioting of 14 January began when masked loyalist protesters petrol bombed Catholic homes around St Matthew's Church, at the edge of Short Strand. Jim Wilson, a loyalist community worker, confirmed that youths from his community had started the violence. Niall Ó Donnghaile called it a "blatant, well planned and organised sectarian attack ... It is an attempt by unionists to intimidate a small Catholic community". St Matthew's church hall was hosting a social event for children with special needs, but had to be evacuated. Wilson said a crowd of nationalists arrived after the first missiles were thrown and some attacked Protestant homes in retaliation. When police arrived, the loyalists threw dozens of petrol bombs at police jeeps, three of which caught fire. A bus driver was also hurt when his vehicle was stoned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21020296 "Union flag dispute: Trouble flares at Short Strand interface after protest"].

On 17 January, leaflets were distributed to homes in East Belfast, where much of the rioting had taken place, calling for the violence to end. The move was backed by church groups, community groups, and loyalist paramilitary groups; including the UVF, UDA, and [[Red Hand Commando]] (RHC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21066179 "Loyalist leaders call for end to 'wanton destruction' in east Belfast"].

On 4 March, loyalist protesters, angered by the arrest of loyalist activist Willie Frazer, interrupted a meeting of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21658461 | work=BBC News | title=Loyalist protesters interrupt Stormont Assembly proceedings | date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a further riot in Newtownabbey on 8 March, when up to 100 flag protesters attacked police with bricks and bottles. A car was also burnt and the office of Alliance leader [[David Ford]] was attacked. Five police officers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21720384 | work=BBC News | title=Five police officers hurt during rioting in Newtownabbey | date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March, a small loyalist protest was held outside a new leisure centre in Bangor as it was being visited by Sinn Féin's [[Carál Ní Chuilín]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Protest-staged-at-Bangor-pool-preview/6fc85700-8942-4dfd-960e-12573a3a6e3c|title=Protest staged at Bangor pool preview|work=u.tv|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315224159/http://www.u.tv/News/Protest-staged-at-Bangor-pool-preview/6fc85700-8942-4dfd-960e-12573a3a6e3c|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, a man was charged with sending three hoax bomb warnings by detectives investigating offences linked to the flag protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Man-in-custody-over-hoax-alerts/284a1be6-d01e-425c-be66-68dafdf7f399|title=Man in custody over hoax alerts|work=u.tv|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418193314/http://www.u.tv/News/Man-in-custody-over-hoax-alerts/284a1be6-d01e-425c-be66-68dafdf7f399|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March, [[Saint Patrick's Day]], a PSNI officer was injured during rioting in South Belfast. The riot reportedly started when loyalists tried to hold a protest outside pubs in Shaftesbury Square, but were pushed back to Donegall Road by police. Masked loyalists burnt bins on the road and attacked police with bricks and bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Officer-hurt-amid-Belfast-trouble/b3f64c37-7001-4fd8-8646-a0aae4e2cffa|title=Officer hurt amid Belfast trouble|work=u.tv|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419034713/http://www.u.tv/News/Officer-hurt-amid-Belfast-trouble/b3f64c37-7001-4fd8-8646-a0aae4e2cffa|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a St Patrick's Day parade in [[Omagh]] was re-routed after "a huge number" of Union Flags were put up along part of the planned route. Irish nationalist councillors said the flags undermined the plan for a neutral and inclusive parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Row-over-Omagh-St-Patricks-parade/7ff9f096-670c-40ff-9c09-b76ba1ceac15|title=Row over Omagh St Patrick's parade|work=u.tv|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212102/http://www.u.tv/News/Row-over-Omagh-St-Patricks-parade/7ff9f096-670c-40ff-9c09-b76ba1ceac15|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 2013===
On 20 April, Belfast City Council rejected a DUP proposal to fly the Union Flag every day on the [[Belfast Cenotaph]] in the grounds of City Hall. Unionist councillors voted in favour of the proposal but Irish nationalist and Alliance councillors voted against it. The [[Royal British Legion]] was also against the proposal, saying it did not want the cenotaph to become politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22212783 | work=BBC News | title=Union flag dispute: DUP cenotaph proposal fails | date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April, Willie Frazer and Jim Dowson launched a new unionist party known as the [[Protestant Coalition]] at the La Mon Hotel near Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/flag-protesters-launch-new-antipolitics-unionist-party-29220215.html|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130425052206/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/flag-protesters-launch-new-antipolitics-unionist-party-29220215.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 April 2013|title=Flag protesters launch new 'anti-politics' unionist party|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2013===
On 1 May, the DUP officially abandoned its campaign to have the Union Flag flown every day on the cenotaph of Belfast City Hall. A small group of loyalist protesters gathered outside City Hall but there was no trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22373437 | work=BBC News | title=DUP abandons cenotaph Union flag campaign at Belfast City Hall | date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the DUP's Sammy Wilson—Northern Ireland's [[Department of Finance and Personnel|Minister of Finance]]—ordered that the Union Flag be flown from all government buildings run by the Department of Finance. The move could cost up to £10,000 and was criticized by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22434914 "Sammy Wilson orders union flag to be flown from five buildings"]. BBC News, 7 May 2013. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2013===
On 13 June, lawyers of a nationalist resident in East Belfast informed the High Court that the PSNI allowed loyalist protesters to stage illegal marches through Belfast City Centre for up to three months, and that all those involved in the marches should have been
arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-22875945 | work=BBC News | title=Union flag protests: 'Police allowed illegal marches' | date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, around 100 loyalists held the now-weekly loyalist flag protest outside Belfast City Hall, which coincided with a large anti-[[G8]] march taking place in the city centre. According to the PUP's Billy Hutchinson, some loyalist protesters felt that the G8 rally was "anti British". Many loyalists booed and jeered whilst speeches were made during the anti-G8 rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/loyalist-flag-protestors-unhappy-at-how-anti-g8-protest-was-facilitated-1-5190155|title=Loyalist flag protestors unhappy at how anti-G8 protest was facilitated|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/video-billy-hutchinson-joins-loyalist-flag-protestors-amid-anti-g8-rally-1-5190232|title=Video: Billy Hutchinson joins loyalist flag protestors amid anti-G8 rally|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June, Belfast City Council voted to raise the armed forces flag on Belfast City Hall for six days after a request from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The Alliance Party and unionist parties voted in favour of the motion, whilst nationalist parties such as Sinn Féin voted against the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/armed-forces-flag-raised-at-belfast-city-hall-29367208.html|title=Armed Forces flag raised at Belfast City Hall|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 2013===
On 6 August, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Sinn Féin councillor [[Máirtín Ó Muilleoir]] was attacked by a large crowd of loyalists during the reopening of Woodvale Park, forcing the event to be abandoned. The mayor had to be escorted from the park by police and the crowd jostled and heckled him whilst throwing missiles at police. He was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital for a check-up following the incident. Nine PSNI officers were injured.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/community-telegraph/north-belfast/lord-mayor-attacked-by-loyalists-at-woodvale-park-reopening-29478745.html|title=Lord Mayor attacked by loyalists at Woodvale Park re-opening|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2013===
On 21 September, in one of the largest Union Flag protests seen in Belfast since January, more than 3,000 loyalists took part in a march organised by Loyalist Peaceful Protesters. 1,000 loyalists initially gathered at Belfast City Hall, but the march began later than agreed and was thus in breach of a Parades Commission ruling. The number of loyalists in the march grew from 1,000 to 3,000 as it passed through the strongly loyalist [[Shankill Road]] area of West Belfast before ending in the Woodvale area of North Belfast. The parade passed off with no incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24186090 | work=BBC News | title=More than 3,000 protesters join loyalist parade in Belfast | date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/News/Loyalist-parade-passes-off-peacefully/66c08428-a2fa-4177-9692-a87161e9825b|title=Loyalist parade passes off peacefully|work=u.tv|accessdate=25 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111160610/http://www.u.tv/News/Loyalist-parade-passes-off-peacefully/66c08428-a2fa-4177-9692-a87161e9825b|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2013===
On 12 October, ''[[Irish News]]'' editor Noel Doran addressed the PUP annual conference, telling the conference that loyalists had "got it wrong" over the flag protests, and that what they were opposing was a democratic decision. He also said that loyalists could learn from organisations like the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] when it came to issues like community pride and reaching out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24506398 | work=BBC News | title=Loyalists 'got it wrong' over union flag protests | date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October, First Minister Peter Robinson urged loyalists planning large demonstrations leading up to the Christmas period to think about the possible consequences protests would have on business and jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24526486 | work=BBC News | title=Robinson urges Christmas union flag protest caution | date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 2013===
On 17 November, an Alliance Party office in East Belfast was petrol bombed by loyalists. The Alliance Party's East Belfast MP Naomi Long condemned the attack as "an attack on democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24978113 | work=BBC News | title=East Belfast Alliance Party offices petrol bombed | date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November, 1,500 loyalists marched in the city centre to mark one year since Belfast City Council's vote on the Union Flag. The march broke a Parades Commission ruling that it had to leave the city centre by 12:30pm. The march was mostly peaceful, but two PSNI officers were hurt and a man was arrested during scuffles at Crumlin Road.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25167331 | work=BBC News | title=Police injured during loyalist protest march in Belfast | date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/video-parade-loyalists-in-belfast-union-flag-protest-breach-parades-commission-ruling-29798279.html{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2013, [[Willie Frazer]] said that he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the [[Oireachtas|Irish parliament]] building, [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]] and "sarcastically" ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag".

'''Börklüce Mustafa''' was one of the principal disciples of [[Sheikh Bedreddin]]. He lived around the turn of the 14th/15th centuries, and preached a system that can be compared to modern Communism. Between 1415–1416 he gathered [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmen]] peasants, Greek sailors and Jewish merchants on the [[Karaburun]] peninsula in order to rebel against high taxes and other injustices.

==Primary accounts==
Börklüce Mustafa's life is relatively obscure, and well into the 20th century scarcely covered by scholarship, except in the context of his mentor, [[Sheikh Bedreddin]].{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|pp=397–398}} The main primary account on his activities is that of the [[Byzantine]] historian [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]], along with a few scattered references in other sources.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=398}} As a result, not even his name is certain, "Börklüce Mustafa" being but one of the suggested original names for Doukas' Hellenized rendering Περκλιτζία Μουσταφᾶ.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=398}}

==Origin and teachings==
Mustafa himself possibly hailed from [[Samos Island]], since a Cretan hermit on [[Chios]] maintained to Doukas that he had known Mustafa, who was then living as a hermit or [[dervish]] on that island.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=400}} Eventually, Mustafa was won over by the teachings of [[Sheikh Bedreddin]], a supporter of [[Musa Çelebi]] during the [[Ottoman Interregnum]], who had been exiled by Sultan [[Mehmed I]] to [[Iznik]].{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|pp=398–399}}

Mustafa however moved beyond his master in his efforts to approach the common people, and his teachings were "nothing short of revolutionary": apart from the renunciation of wealth and [[common ownership]] of goods, he also espoused the rapprochement and complete equality between Muslims and Christians. According to Doukas, he urged his followers to treat Christians as fellow believers and show them hospitality. Doukas even attributes to him the formulation "Every Turk [i.e., Muslim] who says that the Christians are not faithful to God, is himself an unbeliever".{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=399}} Mustafa himself set the example for his followers by living as a simple [[hermit]], devoting his life entirely to prayer and the propagation of his ideas.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=399}} For the latter purpose, he established a missionary organization, sending forth "apostles" or "''stylarioi''" (after the location of the mountain where he lived). These missionaries were obliged to poverty, and went about clad only in a tunic, without shoes, and with shorn heads.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=400}}

When Sheikh Bedreddin fled from Iznik to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], Mustafa too abandoned this area, seeking to establish himself and his followers in a place of greater safety than the former Ottoman capital. For this reason, he chose the [[Karaburun]] peninsula on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast, where he and his followers settled in large numbers.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|p=401}} In his nightly prayers, he claimed to mystically communicate with the Cretan hermit on Chios, who in turn told Doukas in person that Mustafa came to visit him every other night.{{sfn|Cotsonis|1957|pp=399–400}}

==Revolt==
According to different sources he gathered around 4.000-10.000 people. In the beginning of the rebellion İskender Paşa tried to crush the revolt, but he couldn't because of the narrow alleys of the Karaburun peninsula. The people of Karaburun managed to crush the army of İskender Paşa. After this more Turkmen Muslims and Christians joined the rebellion.

After the defeat Mehmed sent Timurtaş Paşazade Ali Bey with all the troops of the Saruhan province and Aydin to Karaburun. These troops were also defeated by the peasants. Ali Bey managed to flee to Manisa.

Mehmed who heard the news this time sent his son Murat and Bayezid paşa with the troops of Rumelia and reinforcements from Anatolia on Börklüce. On his road to a mountain which was arbitrated by dervishes  Bayezid paşa massacred all the people including women, children and old people. On one hand there was a bloody conflict at the Cehennem valley and on the other hand the Ottoman army controlled the harbors of the Sakiz island in order to prevent people from fleeing. A large number of the followers of Börklüce were massacred. Börklüce tried to flee to the Sakiz island with the rest of the people, but when he arrived he noticed the Ottoman navy. After a bloody battle Börklüce and his men couldn't flee and moved to the north of the peninsula where they were captured. Börklüce was taken hostage and after a lot of torturing he still insisted on his beliefs and demands. As a result, he was crucified and bound on the back of a camel to be ridiculed and shown around. The dervishes who stayed loyal to him were killed in front of his eyes. Meanwhile, there was a similar rebellion in Manisa which was probably linked with the rebellion of Karaburun. The rebellion in Manisa was under the leadership of [[Torlak Kemal]].

== Philosophy and his works ==
Börklüce Mustafa was considered as an important philosopher by many theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. He wrote Tasvîrü'l- Kulûb.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Community Resources for Justice''' is a Massachusetts-based organization that has worked for over 130 years in social justice in issues like ex-offender re-entry, prison conditions, public safety, and crime prevention. CRJ was formed through the merger of several older organizations in the Boston and New England area, and while most of its work today is focused in the northeastern United States, CRJ is also engaged in work in other states around the nation.

== History ==
Community Resources for Justice, CRJ, represents the long evolution of criminal justice organizations in Massachusetts. The oldest organization in CRJ's history, the [[New England Society for the Suppression of Vice]] (NESSV), began in 1878 and worked to create legislation that influence public morality and dissuade crime. The NESSV went through a number of name changes as it took on more goals: in 1891 it was renamed the New England [[Watch and Ward Society]] following its new focus on organized crime in the Boston area. In 1957, that became the New England Citizens Crime Commission, focusing further on specific organized crimes groups
In 1967 the NECCC turned back to crime prevention under the name Massachusetts Council on Crime and Correction.

Shortly after the NESSV began, a parallel organization, the Massachusetts Prison Association, was founded in 1889. It focused on providing temporary amenities for recently released criminals. In 1937, it broadened scope to provide emergency services to the previously incarcerated. The Massachusetts Prison Association continued to merge with other corrections societies such as the John Howard Society and the Friends of Prisoners in 1940.

Following a loss of funding in 1975, these two larger organizations, the Massachusetts Council on Crime and Correction and the Massachusetts Correctional Association, merged to become the Crime and Justice Foundation. The group’s current name, Community Resources for Justice (CRJ), was created in 1999 after merging with MHHI. 

Today, the organization provides services to ex–offenders to re–integrate them into society, and reforming the criminal justice system through public policy development while simultaneously pushing for legislation aiding adults with intellectual disabilities and troubled youth.&lt;ref&gt;Medal, Dominique. [http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m182findbioghist.htm "Historical Note."] Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: Community Resources for Justice Records. Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, July 2013. Web. Accessed 03 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Community Resources for Justice provides services to ex–offenders to re–integrate them into society while also working to reform the criminal justice system through public policy development. CRJ also provides services to adults with intellectual disabilities. CRJ operates group homes, halfway houses, and youth residential facilities in three states.

CRJ's policy work is partially accomplished through its research arm, The Crime and Justice Institute. The Institute collaborates with both regional and national organizations to conduct research and write policy briefs to further inform both scholarly research and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Bureau of Justice Assistance.

==Recent Work==
In 2001, CRJ released a study that showed that corrections overhauls from the late 1980s stripped the focus on rehabilitation from prison life, leaving prisoners unfit to be released. The study states that 62 percent of former state prison inmates will be rearrested within three years of release.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Rick. (2001-01-15) "Tough Justice is Found Failing Released Convicts Likely to Reoffend: [Third Edition]" Boston Globe. Accessed 2014-03-25&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on the study highlighted the increasing likelihood of recidivism, due to the decline in reintegration programs, and discussed law enforcement's challenge in not just putting criminals in prison, but finding methods to help them stop reoffending.&lt;ref&gt;Bellotti, Michael G. (2001-01-27) "How Norfolk County Aims to Curb Recidivism: [Third Edition]" Boston Globe. Accessed 2014-03-25 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

CRJ, along with [[The Boston Foundation]], conducted research with employers, advocates, criminal records officials, landlords, and legislators to give "a first look at the real-world effects of changes to the Criminal Offender Record Information system, widely known by the acronym CORI, which had been lauded by activists as a game-changer for people with criminal records looking to reintegrate into society." CRJ's work helped put the “Ban the Box” provision into place, which prevents employers from asking about criminal records on initial job applications, but their subsequent study showed that while this has allowed more former convicts to get job interviews, it has seldom translated into jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Martine. (2012-05-24) "Ex-convicts in Massachusetts still face tough sell in job market: Change in records law has not been a panacea." Boston Globe. Accessed 2014-03-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
In 1968, [[Tom Murton]] alleged that three human skeletons found on the farm were the remains of inmates who had been subjected to torture, prompting a publicized investigation which found "a prison hospital served as torture chamber and a doctor as chief tormentor."&lt;ref&gt;von Zielbauer, Paul and Joseph Plambeck.

The revelations included allegations of electrical devices connected to the genitalia of inmates.  The [[Arkansas Department of Correction|Arkansas State Penitentiary System]] at that time had already been found to have held inmates at the Cummins Unit under conditions rising to the level of unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, in cases tried by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, among others.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Certain characteristics of the Arkansas prison system serve to distinguish it from most other penal institutions in this country. First, it has very few paid employees; armed [[Trusty system (prison)|trusties]] ["trusted" inmates, according to the source] guard rank and file inmates and trusties perform other tasks usually and more properly performed by civilian or "free world" personnel. Second, convicts not in isolation are confined when not working, and are required to sleep at night in open dormitory type barracks in which rows of beds are arranged side by side; there are large numbers of men in each barracks. Third, there is no meaningful program of rehabilitation whatever at Cummins; while there is a promising and helpful program at [[Tucker Unit|Tucker]], it is still minimal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxpages.com/arklaw/Holt_v_Sarver_II_Part_1 |title=Holt v.

Instead they were told to do as much work as possible. Prisoners deemed to be not doing enough work were beaten.&lt;ref name="Feeley54"/&gt;

Trustee prisoners had authority over other prisoners. At night, all except for two of the free world prison guards left, so trustees kept the order during the night. Prisoners who were not trustees were sub-ranked as "do-pops" and "rankers."&lt;ref name="Feeley54"/&gt; In past eras, trustee prisoners were responsible for the institution's perimeter security.&lt;ref name="Feeley53"/&gt;

During the day, the prison barracks were empty since most prisoners worked on the fields. At night, the two free world employees patrolled the central corridor but did not venture into the barrack units. The trustees, armed with knives, kept the order at night. Some inmates, referred to as "crawlers" and "creepers," stabbed sleeping prisoners. [[Rape by gender#Rape of males by males|Male on male rape]] frequently occurred in the housing units. The prison did not ask trustees to intervene in case of rape, and prison guards rarely intervened.&lt;ref name="Feeley54"/&gt;

Trustees were allowed to leave and re-enter the prison without undergoing searches, so trustees smuggled in alcohol, illegal drugs, and weapons; they then sold those items within the prison. Trustees usually bought these items from one another, since they had large amounts of money. Non-trustees, including "do-pops" and "rankers," had to pay trustees in order to get food, medicine, access to medical staff, access to outsiders, and protection from arbitrary prison punishments. Therefore non-trustees did not have large reserves of extra money.&lt;ref name="Feeley55"/&gt;

In the 1960s, ethnographer [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] began taking photographs of prisoners for his research on African American work songs in prison. Jackson had become friends with the assistant warden at the time, T. Don Hutto, and their friendship provided Jackson with access to prisoners resulting in numerous publications.

According to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be considered a [[puppet state]] under effective Turkish control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milano|first1=Enrico|title=Unlawful Territorial Situations in International Law: Reconciling Effectiveness, Legality And Legitimacy|date=2006|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ph_D_aYHNMC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=puppet+state+trnc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4LiN-7opEU&amp;sig=1zfrjnnAdwUsPiMdTh7s2AKVxRg&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqqtm23aLVAhXC0RQKHV0RAJoQ6AEIYjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=puppet%20state%20trnc&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terry.D.|first1=Gill|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law 2015|date=2016|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENeSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=puppet+state+trnc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3XapsbISz2&amp;sig=UkM53QW6A3m7MG_cq6z0cnuYIJ0&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimsN7F4aLVAhUKXhQKHcbTAxEQ6AEIVDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=puppet%20state%20trnc&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, with the [[Modern history of Cyprus#Interwar period|occupation of the island]] by the [[British Empire]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1878 and subsequent annexation in 1925, the "Cyprus dispute" was identified as the conflict between the people of Cyprus and the [[The Crown|British Crown]] regarding the Cypriots' demand for self-determination. The British administration shifted the dispute from a colonial dispute to an [[Cypriot intercommunal violence|ethnic dispute between the Turkish and Greek islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Eden, "Memoirs, Full Circle, Cassell, London 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The international complications of the dispute stretch beyond the boundaries of the island of Cyprus itself and involve the guarantor powers under the [[Zürich and London Agreement#Treaty of Guarantee|Zürich and London Agreement]] (Turkey, [[Greece]], and the [[United Kingdom]]), the United Nations and the [[European Union]], along with (unofficially) the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FACTBOX: Key issues in Cyprus dispute|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/10/us-cyprus-conflict-factbox-idUSTRE5A94EV20091110|accessdate=10 November 2009 | work=Reuters|date=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état]], ordered and executed by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} was followed five days later by Turkey's invasion/intervention,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1974/scres74.htm&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the occupation of the northern part of the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus. In 1983, the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] community unilaterally declared independence, forming the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a sovereign entity that lacks [[international recognition]] with the exception of Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;U.N. Security Council [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/541%281983%29 resolution 541 (1983)] that deplores the declaration of “independence” by the Turkish-Cypriot authorities as secessionist and declares it legally invalid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.N. Security Council [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/550%281984%29 resolution 550 (1984)] condemning the “TRNC” recognition by Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt; with which Northern Cyprus enjoys full diplomatic relations, in violation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 550|Resolution 550]], adopted on 11 May 1984 by the [[United Nations Security Council]].

As a result of the two communities and the guarantor countries committing themselves to finding a peaceful solution to the dispute, the United Nations maintain a buffer zone (known as the "[[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line]]") to avoid any further intercommunal tensions and hostilities. This zone separates the southern areas of the Republic of Cyprus (predominately inhabited by [[Greek Cypriots]]), from the northern areas (where Turkish Cypriots and [[Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus|Turkish settlers]] are a majority). Recent years have seen warming of relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, with officially [[2014 Cyprus talks|renewed reunification talks]] beginning in early 2014, though the talks have continuously stalled and resumed multiple times since they began.&lt;ref name="Cyprus Mail 11 Feb 2014"&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/11/joint-declaration-final-version-as-agreed-between-the-two-leaders/ Cyprus Mail 11 Feb 2014] Joint Declaration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xypolia|first1=Ilia|title=Are the Cyprus reunification talks doomed to fail again?|url=https://theconversation.com/are-the-cyprus-reunification-talks-doomed-to-fail-again-80251|website=The Conversation|accessdate=5 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background before 1960==
[[File:Cyprus by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|250px|Ottoman admiral, geographer and cartographer [[Piri Reis]]' historical map of [[Northern Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]
The island of Cyprus was first inhabited in [[9th millennium BC|9000 BC]], with the arrival of farming societies who built round houses with floors of [[terazzo]]. Cities were first built during the Bronze Age and the inhabitants had their own [[Eteocypriot language]] until around the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=ecy Linguist List – Description of Eteocypriot]. Retrieved 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The island was part of the [[Hittite Empire]] as part of the [[Ugarit]] Kingdom&lt;ref name="TTW1"&gt;Thomas, Carol G. &amp; Conant, C.: ''The Trojan War'', pages 121–122. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. {{ISBN|0-313-32526-X}}, 9780313325267.&lt;/ref&gt; during the late Bronze Age until the arrival of two waves of Greek settlement.

Cyprus experienced an uninterrupted [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] presence on the island dating from the arrival of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] around 1100 BC, when the burials began to take the form of long ''dromos''.&lt;ref name="BRIMUSBURIAL"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/system_pages/holding_area/ancient_cyprus_british_museum/enkomi/enkomi-late_bronze_age_cyprus/burial_practices.aspx | title= Burial practices on Late Bronze Age Cyprus | date=February 2009 | publisher=[The British Museum]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek population of Cyprus survived through multiple conquerors, including Egyptian and Persian rule. In the 4th century BC, Cyprus was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and then ruled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] until 58 BC, when it was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]]. In the division of the Roman Empire around the 4th century AD, the island was assigned to the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]].

Roman rule in Cyprus was interrupted in 649, when the Arab armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] invaded the island. Fighting over the island between the Muslims and Romans continued for several years, until in 668 the belligerents agreed to make Cyprus a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. This arrangement persisted for nearly 300 years, until a Byzantine army conquered the island in around 965. Cyprus would become a [[Cyprus (theme)|theme]] of the Empire{{which|date=October 2018}} until the late 12th century.

After an occupation by the [[Knights Templar]] and the rule of [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], the island in 1192 came under the rule of the [[Lusignans|Lusignan family]], who established the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]. In February 1489 it was seized by the [[Republic of Venice]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} Between September 1570 and August 1571 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} starting three centuries of Turkish rule over Cyprus.

Starting in the early nineteenth century, ethnic Greeks of the island sought to bring about an end to almost 300 years of Ottoman rule and unite Cyprus with [[Greece]]. The United Kingdom took administrative control of the island in 1878, to prevent Ottoman possessions from falling under Russian control following the [[Cyprus Convention]], which led to the call for union with Greece (''[[enosis]]'') to grow louder. Under the terms of the agreement reached between Britain and the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{cn|date=October 2018}} the island remained an Ottoman territory.

The Christian Greek-speaking majority of the island welcomed the arrival of the British,{{cn|date=October 2018}} as a chance to voice their demands for union with Greece.

When the Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], Britain renounced the Agreement, rejected all Turkish claims over Cyprus and declared the island a British colony.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to [[Constantine I of Greece]] on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===1918 to 1955===
[[File:Cypriot demonstration 1930.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] demonstration in the 1930s in favour of ''[[Enosis]]'' (union) with [[Greece]]]]
Under British rule in the early 20th century, Cyprus escaped the conflicts and atrocities that went on elsewhere between Greeks and Turks; during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], and the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriots consistently opposed the idea of union with Greece.

In 1925 Britain declared Cyprus to be a [[Crown Colony]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} In the years that followed, the determination of Greek Cypriots to achieve ''enosis'' continued. In 1931 this led to open revolt.{{cn|date=October 2018}} A riot resulted in the death of six civilians, injuries to others and the burning of Britain's Government House in [[Nicosia]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}  In the months that followed, about 2,000 people were convicted of crimes in connection with the struggle for union with Greece. Britain reacted by imposing harsh restrictions. Military reinforcements were dispatched to the island and the constitution suspended.&lt;ref name="SPT1"&gt;{{cite news|title=England sends troops to end Cyprus revolt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-ZAnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EE4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6516,2074275&amp;dq=cyprus&amp;hl=en|accessdate=17 June 2010|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=23 October 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HANS1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CYPRUS|journal=Hansard|date=12 November 1931|volume=259|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1931/nov/12/cyprus|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special "epicourical" (reserve) police force was formed consisting of only Turkish Cypriots, &lt;!--''Hidden as no ref given after 3 years'': to fight Cypriot revolutionaries in order to internally divide the Cypriots,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} --&gt; press restrictions instituted&lt;ref name="HANS2"&gt;{{cite web|title=CYPRUS (PRESS RESTRICTIONS)|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1930/jul/02/cyprus-press-restrictions#S5CV0240P0_19300702_HOC_260|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HANS3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CYPRUS (NEWSPAPERS)|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1930/jul/07/cyprus-newspapers#S5CV0241P0_19300707_CWA_32|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political parties banned.

The struggle for ''enosis'' was put on hold during [[World War II]]. In 1946, the British government announced plans to invite Cypriots to form a Consultative Assembly to discuss a new constitution. The British also allowed the return of the 1931 exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Robert F.|title=Britain and the revolt in Cyprus, 1954–1959|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=14|isbn=978-0-19-820538-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of reacting positively, as expected by the British, the Greek Cypriot military hierarchy reacted angrily because there had been no mention of ''enosis''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] had expressed its disapproval, and Greek Cypriots declined the British invitation, stating that ''enosis'' was their sole political aim. The efforts by Greeks to bring about ''enosis'' now intensified, helped by active support of the Church of Cyprus, which was the main political voice of the Greek Cypriots at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} However, it was not the only organisation claiming to speak for the Greek Cypriots. The Church's main opposition came from the [[AKEL|Cypriot Communist Party]] (officially the Progressive Party of the Working People; ''Ανορθωτικό'' ''Κόμμα'' ''Εργαζόμενου'' ''Λαού''; or AKEL), which also wholeheartedly supported the Greek national goal of ''enosis''. However the British military forces and Colonial administration in Cyprus did not see the pro-Soviet communist party as a viable partner.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
&lt;!--commenting out until citations provided:
The issue was hotly contested with the [[Papagos]] Government,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} whose attempt to defend the principle of Cypriot self-determination at the United Nations was particularly threatening to the UK. The British Government turned to the US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], who recruited the votes in the UN to defeat the Greek challenge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} At the same time, British foreign secretary [[Harold Macmillan]] prevailed upon Turkey to alter its policy on Cyprus and make vigorous representations as to its claims and rights on the island.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}--&gt;

By 1954 a number of Turkish mainland institutions were active in the Cyprus issue such as the National Federation of Students, the Committee for the Defence of Turkish rights in Cyprus, the Welfare Organisation of Refugees from Thrace and the Cyprus Turkish Association.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Above all, the Turkish trade unions were to prepare the right climate for the main Turkish goal, the division of the island (''taksim'') into Greek and Turkish parts, thus keeping the British military presence and installations on the island intact. By this time a special Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisation [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]] (TMT) was also established which was to act as a counterbalance to the Greek Cypriot ''enosis'' fighting organisation of [[EOKA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1950, Michael Mouskos, Bishop Makarios of Kition (Larnaca), was elevated to Archbishop [[Makarios III]] of Cyprus. In his inaugural speech, he vowed not to rest until union with "mother Greece" had been achieved.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In [[Athens]], ''enosis'' was a common topic of conversation, and a Cypriot native, Colonel [[George Grivas]], was becoming known for his strong views on the subject. In anticipation of an armed struggle to achieve ''enosis'', Grivas visited Cyprus in July 1951. He discussed his ideas with Makarios but was disappointed by the archbishop's contrasting opinion as he proposed a political struggle rather than an armed revolution against the British. From the beginning, and throughout their relationship, Grivas resented having to share leadership with the archbishop. Makarios, concerned about Grivas's extremism from their very first meeting, preferred to continue diplomatic efforts, particularly efforts to get the United Nations involved. The feelings of uneasiness that arose between them never dissipated. In the end, the two became enemies. In the meantime, in August [Papagos Government] 1954, Greece's UN representative formally requested that self-determination for the people of Cyprus be included on the agenda of the [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]]'s next session.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Turkey rejected the idea of the union of Cyprus and Greece. Turkish Cypriot community opposed Greek Cypriot ''enosis'' movement, as under British rule the Turkish Cypriot minority status and identity were protected. Turkish Cypriot identification with Turkey had grown stronger in response to overt Greek nationalism of Greek Cypriots, and after 1954 the Turkish government had become increasingly involved. In the late summer and early autumn of 1954, the Cyprus problem intensified. On Cyprus the colonial government threatened publishers of seditious literature with up to two years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="TPP1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cypriots on spot|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XqkvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-U0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4511,2773672&amp;dq=sedition+5+years+in+prison+cyprus&amp;hl=en|accessdate=17 June 2010|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=24 November 1956|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December the [[UN General Assembly]] announced the decision "not to consider the problem further for the time being, because it does not appear appropriate to adopt a resolution on the question of Cyprus." Reaction to the setback at the UN was immediate and violent, resulting in the worst rioting in Cyprus since 1931.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===EOKA campaign and creation of TMT, 1955–59===
{{See also|Cyprus Emergency}}
In January 1955, Grivas founded the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (''Ethniki Organosis'' ''Kyprion Agoniston'' – [[EOKA]]). On 1 April 1955, [[EOKA]] opened an armed campaign against British rule in a coordinated series of attacks on police, military, and other government installations in [[Nicosia]], [[Famagusta]], [[Larnaca]], and [[Limassol]]. This resulted in the deaths of 387 British servicemen and personnel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll UK casualties of war] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102127/http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org/roll |date=25 July 2011 }} UK army personnel killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA militant organisation&lt;/ref&gt; and some Greek Cypriots suspected of collaboration; in 2009, a memorial for the British soldiers killed by Greek Cypriot EOKA during 1955–1959 Cyprus Emergency was erected in [[Kyrenia]], Northern Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcyprusmemorial.org ]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this a number of Greek Cypriots began to leave the police. This however did not affect the Colonial police force as they had already created the solely Turkish Cypriot (Epicourical) reserve force to fight EOKA paramilitaries. At the same time, it led to tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In 1957 the Turkish Resistance Organisation (''Türk Mukavemet'' ''Teşkilatı'' [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]]), which had already been formed to protect the Turkish Cypriots from EOKA took action. In response to the growing demand for ''enosis'', a number of Turkish Cypriots became convinced that the only way to protect their interests and identity of the Turkish Cypriot population in the event of ''enosis'' would be to divide the island – a policy known as ''taksim'' ("partition" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] borrowed from (تقسیم)"Taqsīm" in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]) – into a Greek sector in the south and a Turkish sector in the north only.

By now the island was on the verge of civil war. Several attempts to present a compromise settlement had failed. Therefore, beginning in December 1958, representatives of Greece and Turkey, the so-called "mother lands" opened discussions of the Cyprus issue. Participants for the first time discussed the concept of an independent Cyprus, i.e., neither ''enosis'' nor ''taksim''. Subsequent talks always headed by the British yielded a so-called compromise agreement supporting independence, laying the foundations of the Republic of Cyprus. The scene then naturally shifted to London, where the Greek and Turkish representatives were joined by representatives of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots (represented by Arch. Makarios and [[Dr Fazil Kucuk]] with no significant decision making power), and the British. The Zürich-London agreements that became the basis for the Cyprus constitution of 1960 were supplemented with three treaties – the '''Treaty of Establishment''', the '''Treaty of Guarantee''', and the '''Treaty of Alliance'''. The general tone of the agreements was one of keeping the British sovereign bases and military and monitoring facilities intact. Some Greek Cypriots, especially members of organisations such as [[EOKA]], expressed disappointment because ''enosis'' had not been attained. In a similar way some Turkish Cypriots especially members of organisations such as TMT expressed their disappointment as they had to postpone their target for ''taksim'', however most Cypriots that were not influenced by the three so called guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey, and Britain), welcomed the agreements and set aside their demand for ''enosis'' and ''taksim''. According to the Treaty of Establishment, Britain retained sovereignty over 256 square kilometres, which became the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area]], to the northeast of [[Larnaca]], and the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area]] to the southwest of [[Limassol]].

Cyprus achieved independence on 16 August 1960.

==Constitutional breakdown and intercommunal talks, 1960–1974==
{{Main article|Cyprus intercommunal violence}}
{{double image|right|Makarios III and Robert F. Wagner NYWTS cropped.jpg|185|Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F014934-0068, Fazil Kutschuk.jpg|165|President of the [[Republic of Cyprus]], archbishop [[Makarios III]] (left) and Vice President Dr. [[Fazıl Küçük]] (right)}}
According to constitutional arrangements, Cyprus was to become an independent, non-aligned republic with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president. General executive authority was vested in a [[Cabinet (government)|council of ministers]] with a ratio of seven Greeks to three Turks. (The Greek Cypriots represented 78% of the population and the Turkish Cypriots 18%. The remaining 4% was made up by the three minority communities: the Latins, [[Maronite]]s and [[Armenians]].) A [[House of Representatives]] of fifty members, also with a seven-to-three ratio, were to be separately elected by communal balloting on a [[universal suffrage]] basis. In addition, separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Communal Chambers were provided to exercise control in matters of religion, culture, and education. According to Article 78(2) "any law imposing duties or taxes shall require a simple majority of the representatives elected by the Greek and Turkish communities respectively taking part in the vote". Legislation on other subjects was to take place by simple majority but again the President and the Vice-President had the same right of veto—absolute on foreign affairs, defence and internal security, delaying on other matters—as in the Council of Ministers. The judicial system would be headed by a Supreme [[Constitutional Court]], composed of one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot and presided over by a contracted judge from a neutral country. The Constitution of Cyprus, whilst establishing an Independent and sovereign Republic, was, in the words of [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|de Smith]], an authority on Constitutional Law, "Unique in its tortuous complexity and in the multiplicity of the safeguards that it provides for the principal minority; the Constitution of Cyprus stands alone among the constitutions of the world".&lt;ref name="Humanrights.coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm |title=Report Submitted By Cyprus – Recent Political History And Developments |publisher=Humanrights.coe.int |date= |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within a short period of time the first disputes started to arise between the two communities. Issues of contention included taxation and the creation of separate municipalities. Because of the legislative veto system, this resulted in a lockdown in communal and state politics in many cases.

Repeated attempts to solve the disputes failed. Eventually, on 30 November 1963, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] put forward to the three guarantors a [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen-point proposal]] designed, in his view, to eliminate impediments to the functioning of the government. The [[13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|thirteen points]] involved constitutional revisions, including the abandonment of the veto power by both the president and the vice president. Turkey initially rejected it (although later in future discussed the proposal). A few days later, on [[Bloody Christmas (1963)]] 21 December 1963 fighting erupted between the communities in [[Nicosia]]. In the days that followed it spread across the rest of the island. At the same time, the power-sharing government collapsed. How this happened is one of the most contentious issues in modern Cypriot history. The Greek Cypriots argue that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew in order to form their own administration. The Turkish Cypriots maintain that they were forced out. Many Turkish Cypriots chose to withdraw from the government. However, in many cases those who wished to stay in their jobs were prevented from doing so by the Greek Cypriots. Also, many of the Turkish Cypriots refused to attend because they feared for their lives after the recent violence that had erupted. There was even some pressure from the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation|TMT]] as well. In any event, in the days that followed the fighting a frantic effort was made to calm tensions. In the end, on 27 December 1963, an interim peacekeeping force, the Joint Truce Force, was put together by Britain, Greece and Turkey. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/03/09/unficyp-a-living-fossil-of-the-cold-war Cyprus-Mail, 09.03.2014] UNFICYP: a living fossil of the Cold War&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Truce Force held the line until a [[United Nations peacekeeping]] force, [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]], was formed following [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186]], passed on 4 March 1964.

===Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974===
At the same time as it established a peacekeeping force, the Security Council also recommended that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the parties and the Guarantor Powers, designate a mediator to take charge of formal peacemaking efforts. [[U Thant]], then the UN Secretary-General, appointed [[Sakari Tuomioja]], a Finnish diplomat. While Tuomioja viewed the problem as essentially international in nature and saw ''[[enosis]]'' as the most logical course for a settlement, he rejected union on the grounds that it would be inappropriate for a UN official to propose a solution that would lead to the dissolution of a UN member state. The United States held a differing view. In early June, following another Turkish threat to intervene, Washington launched an independent initiative under [[Dean Acheson]], a former Secretary of State. In July he presented a plan to unite Cyprus with Greece. In return for accepting this, Turkey would receive a sovereign military base on the island. The Turkish Cypriots would also be given minority rights, which would be overseen by a resident international commissioner. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] rejected the proposal, arguing that giving Turkey territory would be a limitation on ''enosis'' and would give Ankara too strong a say in the island's affairs. A second version of the plan was presented that offered Turkey a 50-year lease on a base. This offer was rejected by the Greek Cypriots and by Turkey. After several further attempts to reach an agreement, the United States was eventually forced to give up its effort.

Following the sudden death of Ambassador Tuomioja in August, [[Galo Plaza]] was appointed Mediator. He viewed the problem in communal terms. In March 1965 he presented a report criticising both sides for their lack of commitment to reaching a settlement. While he understood the Greek Cypriot aspiration of ''enosis'', he believed that any attempt at union should be held in voluntary abeyance. Similarly, he considered that the Turkish Cypriots should refrain from demanding a federal solution to the problem. Although the Greek Cypriots eventually accepted the report, despite its opposition to immediate ''enosis'', Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the plan, calling on Plaza to resign on the grounds that he had exceeded his mandate by advancing specific proposals. He was simply meant to broker an agreement. But the Greek Cypriots made it clear that if Galo Plaza resigned they would refuse to accept a replacement. U Thant was left with no choice but to abandon the mediation effort. Instead he decided to make his Good Offices available to the two sides via resolution 186 of 4 March 1964 and a Mediator was appointed. In his Report (S/6253, A/6017, 26 March 1965), the Mediator, Dr Gala Plaza, criticised the 1960 legal framework, and proposed necessary amendments which were rejected by Turkey, a fact which resulted in serious deterioration of the situation with constant threats by Turkey against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, necessitating a series of UN Resolutions calling, inter alia, for respect of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.coe.int" /&gt;

The end of the mediation effort was effectively confirmed when, at the end of the year, Plaza resigned and was not replaced.

In March 1966, a more modest attempt at peacemaking was initiated under the auspices of Carlos Bernades, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Cyprus. Instead of trying to develop formal proposals for the parties to bargain over, he aimed to encourage the two sides agree to settlement through direct dialogue. However, ongoing political chaos in Greece prevented any substantive discussions from developing. The situation changed the following year.

On 21 April 1967, a [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|coup d'état in Greece brought to power a military administration]]. Just months later, in November 1967, Cyprus witnessed its most severe bout of intercommunal fighting since 1964. Responding to a major attack on Turkish Cypriot villages in the south of the island, which left 27 dead, Turkey bombed Greek Cypriot forces and appeared to be readying itself for an intervention. Greece was forced to capitulate. Following international intervention, Greece agreed to recall General [[George Grivas]], the Commander of the Greek [[Cypriot National Guard]] and former EOKA leader, and reduce its forces on the island. Capitalising on the weakness of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own provisional administration on 28 December 1967. Makarios immediately declared the new administration illegal. Nevertheless, a major change had occurred. The Archbishop, along with most other Greek Cypriots, began to accept that the Turkish Cypriots would have to have some degree of political autonomy. It was also realised that unification of Greece and Cyprus was unachievable under the prevailing circumstances.

In May 1968, intercommunal talks began between the two sides under the auspices of the Good Offices of the UN Secretary-General. Unusually, the talks were not held between President Makarios and Vice-President Kucuk. Instead they were conducted by the presidents of the communal chambers, [[Glafcos Clerides]] and [[Rauf Denktaş]]. Again, little progress was made. During the first round of talks, which lasted until August 1968, the Turkish Cypriots were prepared to make several concessions regarding constitutional matters, but Makarios refused to grant them greater autonomy in return. The second round of talks, which focused on local government, was equally unsuccessful. In December 1969 a third round of discussion started. This time they focused on constitutional issues. Yet again there was little progress and when they ended in September 1970 the Secretary-General blamed both sides for the lack of movement. A fourth and final round of intercommunal talks also focused on constitutional issues, but again failed to make much headway before they were forced to a halt in 1974.

===1974 Greek coup d'etat and Turkish invasion===

{{Main article|Timeline of events in Cyprus, 1974|1974 Cypriot coup d'état|Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Military operations during the Invasion of Cyprus (1974)}}

After 1967 some hopes arose that a compromise on separate municipalities could be achieved in negotiations between [[Glafcos Clerides]] and [[Rauf Denktaş]] and certainly agreement came close, but the Makarios government could not accept de jure separateness, which would have denied the principle of the unitary, if bi-communal, state.

Inter-communal strife was also overshadowed during this period by a serious rift on the Greek side, between Makarios and the enosist National Front supported by the Greek military junta. Makarios had now become an obstacle to enosis. An attempt was made on his life, and Grivas returned in 1971 to head a new organisation, [[EOKA-B]], with Makarios, rather than the Turkish-Cypriots, in its sight.

Makarios was told from Athens to dismiss his foreign minister and to regard Athens as the National Centre. Makarios rallied supporters successfully against attempts to remove him. He was still popular in Cyprus.

Matters became worse when a new junta came to power in September 1973, and there was less relief from rightist pressure than might have been expected when Grivas died suddenly in January 1974. The pressure mounted until a peace operation in July 1974 allegedly led by a 'hammer of the Turks' [[Nikos Sampson]], overthrew Makarios, who managed to flee the country via a British base. For Turkey this raised the spectre of Greek control of Cyprus.

The Turkish government therefore now demanded that Greece should dismiss Sampson, withdraw all Greek officers from the island and respect the island's independence. The Greek military government refused. For the United States, Kissinger did not seem to be greatly disturbed by the Sampson coup and looked as if he could accept enosis. Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit's assertiveness in foreign policy, reinforced by his junior coalition partner strongly inclined the Turks to intervene. The British were invited to participate in military operations, under the Treaty of Guarantee, but declined. The American envoy Joseph Sisco tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Greek military government to accept Ecevit's conditions for a Cyprus settlement, which included Turkish-Cypriot control of a coastal region in the north and negotiations for a federal solution. The Soviet Union stood aside not wanting to see enosis, which would strengthen NATO and weaken the left in Cyprus.

After failing to secure British support for a joint intervention under the Treaty of Guarantee, [[Bülent Ecevit]], the Turkish prime minister, decided to act unilaterally. On 20 July Turkey ordered a [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|military invasion of the island]]. Within two days, Turkish forces had established a narrow corridor linking the north coast with Nicosia. The intervention led to turmoil in Greece. On 23 July, the military junta collapsed.

Launched with relatively few troops, the Turkish landing had limited success at first, and resulted everywhere on the island in the occupation of Turkish-Cypriot enclaves by the Greek forces. After securing a more or less satisfactory bridgehead Turkish forces agreed to a cease-fire on 23 July 1974. The same day civilian government under Karamanlis took office in Athens, the day the Sampson coup collapsed. Glafcos Clerides became the Acting President in absence still of Makarios.

Two days later formal peace talks were convened in [[Geneva]] between Greece, Turkey and Britain. Over the course of the following five days Turkey agreed to halt its advance on the condition that it would remain on the island until a political settlement was reached between the two sides. Meanwhile, Turkish troops did not refrain from extending their positions, as more Turkish-Cypriot enclaves were occupied by Greek forces. A new cease-fire line was agreed. On 30 July the powers agreed that the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island should be linked to a 'just and lasting settlement acceptable to all parties concerned'. The declaration also spoke of 'two autonomous administrations -that of Greek-Cypriot community and that of the Turkish-Cypriot community'. On 8 August another round of discussion was held in Geneva, Switzerland. Unlike before, this time the talks involved the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. During the discussions the Turkish Cypriots, supported by Turkey, insisted on some form of geographical separation between the two communities. [[Makarios III|Makarios]] refused to accept the demand, insisting that Cyprus must remain a unitary state. Despite efforts to break the deadlock, the two sides refused to budge. On 14 August, Turkey demanded from Clerides acceptance of a proposal for a [[federation|federal state]], in which the Turkish Cypriot community (who, at that time, comprised about 18% of the population and owned about 10% of the land) would have received 34% of the island. Clerides asked for 36 to 48 hours to consult with the Cypriot and Greek governments, but Turkey refused to grant any consultation time, effectively ending the talks. Within hours, Turkey had resumed its second offensive. By the time a new, and permanent, ceasefire was called 36 per cent of the island was under the control of the Turkish military. The partition was marked by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus]] or "green line" running east to west across the island.

The effect of the division was catastrophic for all concerned. Thousands of Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been killed, wounded or missing. A further two hundred thousand Greek and Turkish Cypriots had been displaced. In addition to the entire north coast (Kerynia, Morfou) and the Karpas peninsula, the Greek Cypriots were also forced to flee the eastern port city of [[Famagusta]]. The vast majority of the Turkish occupied area was predominantly populated and owned by Greek Cypriots prior to 1974.
In the process about 160,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www02.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa.nsf/FEB4D72828085695C2256FD50031BF1E/$FILE/MEMOResponse10.3.05.doc&lt;/ref&gt; – 200,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/32.htm |title=Cyprus – Refugees and Social Reconstruction |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek Cypriots who made up 82% of the population in the north became [[refugee]]s; many of them fleeing at the word of the approaching Turkish army. Since 1974, the ceasefire line separates the two communities on the island, and is commonly referred to as the Green Line. The United Nations consented to the transfer of the remainder of the 51,000 Turkish Cypriots that were trapped in the south to settle in the north, if they wished to do so. Many of them had previously moved to the areas under UK sovereign control awaiting permission to be transferred to the areas under Turkish control.

===Division of the island===
[[File:Cyprus districts named.png|thumb|Control of the island by different parties, super-imposed upon the claimed administrative boundaries of the Republic of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus claims sovereignty of all the areas except the British bases (in green), but the dark pink areas are controlled by Northern Cyprus, and the blue buffer zone is administered by the United Nations.]]
At the second Geneva Conference on 9 August, Turkey pressed for a federal solution to the problem against stiffening Greek resistance. Whilst Turkish Cypriots wanted a bi-zonal federation, Turkey, under American advice, submitted a cantonal plan involving separation of Turkish-Cypriot areas from one another. For security reasons Turkish-Cypriots did not favour cantons. Each plan embraced about thirty-four per cent of the territory.

These plans were presented to the conference on 13 August by the Turkish Foreign Minister, [[Turan Güneş]]. Clerides wanted thirty-six to forty-eight hours to consider the plans, but Güneş demanded an immediate response. This was regarded as unreasonable by the Greeks, the British, and the Americans, who were in close consultation. Nevertheless, the next day, the Turkish forces extended their control to some 36 per cent of the island, afraid that delay would turn international opinion strongly against them.

Turkey's international reputation suffered as a result of the precipitate move of the Turkish military to extend control to a third of the island. The British prime minister regarded the Turkish ultimatum as unreasonable since it was presented without allowing adequate time for study. In Greek eyes, the Turkish proposals were submitted in the full awareness that the Greek side could not accept them, and reflected the Turkish desire for a military base in Cyprus. The Greek side has gone some way in their proposals by recognising Turkish 'groups' of villages and Turkish administrative 'areas'. But they stressed that the constitutional order of Cyprus should retain its bi-communal character based on the co-existence of the Greek and Turkish communities within the framework of a sovereign, independent and integral republic. Essentially the Turkish side's proposals were for geographic consolidation and separation and for a much larger measure of autonomy for that area, or those areas, than the Greek side could envisage.

===1975–1979===
On 28 April 1975, [[Kurt Waldheim]], the UN Secretary-General, launched a new mission of Good Offices. Starting in Vienna, over the course of the following ten months Clerides and Denktaş discussed a range of humanitarian issues relating to the events of the previous year. However, attempts to make progress on the substantive issues – such as territory and the nature of the central government – failed to produce any results. After five rounds the talks fell apart in February 1976. In January 1977, the UN managed to organise a meeting in Nicosia between [[Makarios III|Makarios]] and [[Rauf Denktaş|Denktaş]]. This led to a major breakthrough. On 12 February, the two leaders signed a four-point agreement confirming that a future Cyprus settlement would be based on a federation. The size of the states would be determined by economic viability and land ownership. The central government would be given powers to ensure the unity of the state. Various other issues, such as freedom of settlement and freedom of movement, would be settled through discussion. Just months later, in August 1977, [[Makarios III|Makarios]] died. He was replaced by [[Spyros Kyprianou]], the foreign minister.

In May 1979, Waldheim visited Cyprus and secured a further ten-point set of proposals from the two sides. In addition to re-affirming the 1977 High-Level Agreement, the ten points also included provisions for the demilitarisation of the island and a commitment to refrain from destabilising activities and actions. Shortly afterwards a new round of discussions began in Nicosia. Again, they were short-lived. For a start, the Turkish Cypriots did not want to discuss [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], a resort quarter of Famagusta that had been vacated by Greek Cypriots when it was overrun by Turkish troops. This was a key issue for the Greek Cypriots. Second, the two sides failed to agree on the concept of 'bicommunality'. The Turkish Cypriots believed that the Turkish Cypriot federal state would be exclusively Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot state would be exclusively Greek Cypriot. The Greek Cypriots believed that the two states should be predominantly, but not exclusively, made up of a particular community.

===Turkish Cypriots' declaration of independence===
{{Politics of Northern Cyprus}}
In May 1983, an effort by [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], then UN Secretary-General, foundered after the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of all occupation forces from Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots were furious at the resolution, threatening to declare independence in retaliation. Despite this, in August, Pérez de Cuéllar gave the two sides a set of proposals for consideration that called for a rotating presidency, the establishment of a bicameral assembly along the same lines as previously suggested, and 60:40 representation in the central executive. In return for increased representation in the central government, the Turkish Cypriots would surrender 8–13 per cent of the land in their possession. Both Kyprianou and Denktaş accepted the proposals. However, on 15 November 1983, the Turkish Cypriots took advantage of the post-election political instability in Turkey and [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|unilaterally declared independence]]. Within days the [[Security Council]] passed a resolution, no.541 (13–1 vote: only [[Pakistan]] opposed) making it clear that it would not accept the new state and that the decision disrupted efforts to reach a settlement. Denktaş denied this. In a letter addressed to the Secretary-General informing him of the decision, he insisted that the move guaranteed that any future settlement would be truly federal in nature. Although the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' (TRNC) was soon recognised by [[Turkey]], the rest of the international community condemned the move. The [[Security Council]] passed another resolution, no.550&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506115414/http://www.un.int/cyprus/scr550.htm |archivedate=6 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (13–1 vote: again only [[Pakistan]] opposed) condemning the "purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership".

In September 1984, talks resumed. After three rounds of discussions it was again agreed that Cyprus would become a bi-zonal, bi-communal, non-aligned federation. The Turkish Cypriots would retain 29 per cent for their federal state and all foreign troops would leave the island. In January 1985, the two leaders met for their first face-to-face talks since the 1979 agreement. However, while the general belief was that the meeting was being held to agree to a final settlement, Kyprianou insisted that it was a chance for further negotiations. The talks collapsed. In the aftermath, the Greek Cypriot leaders came in for heavy criticism, both at home and abroad. After that Denktaş announced that he would not make so many concessions again. Undeterred, in March 1986, de Cuéllar presented the two sides with a [http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/draft%20agreement%201986.htm/ Draft Framework Agreement]. Again, the plan envisaged the creation of an independent, non-aligned, bi-communal, bi-zonal state in Cyprus. However, the Greek Cypriots were unhappy with the proposals. They argued that the questions of removing Turkish forces from Cyprus was not addressed, nor was the repatriation of the increasing number of Turkish settlers on the island. Moreover, there were no guarantees that the full three freedoms would be respected. Finally, they saw the proposed state structure as being confederal in nature. Further efforts to produce an agreement failed as the two sides remained steadfastly attached to their positions.

===The "Set of Ideas"===
In August 1988, Pérez de Cuéllar called upon the two sides to meet with him in Geneva in August. There the two leaders – [[George Vasiliou]] and [[Rauf Denktaş]] – agreed to abandon the Draft Framework Agreement and return to the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements. However, the talks faltered when the Greek Cypriots announced their intention to apply for membership of the [[European Community]] (EC, subsequently EU), a move strongly opposed by the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey. Nevertheless, in June 1989, de Cuellar presented the two communities with the "Set of Ideas". Denktaş quickly rejected them as he not only opposed the provisions, he also argued that the UN Secretary-General had no right to present formal proposals to the two sides. The two sides met again, in New York, in February 1990. However, the talks were again short lived. This time Denktaş demanded that the Greek Cypriots recognise the existence of two peoples in Cyprus and the basic right of the Turkish Cypriots to self-determination.

On 4 July 1990, Cyprus formally applied to join the EC. The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which had applied for membership in 1987, were outraged. Denktaş claimed that Cyprus could only join the Community at the same time as Turkey and called off all talks with UN officials. Nevertheless, in September 1990, the EC member states unanimously agreed to refer the Cypriot application to the Commission for formal consideration. In retaliation, Turkey and the TRNC signed a joint declaration abolishing passport controls and introducing a customs union just weeks later. Undeterred, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] continued his search for a solution throughout 1991. He made no progress. In his last report to the Security Council, presented in October 1991 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 716]], he blamed the failure of the talks on Denktaş, noting the Turkish Cypriot leader's demand that the two communities should have equal sovereignty and a right to secession.

On 3 April 1992, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the new UN Secretary-General, presented the Security Council with the outline plan for the creation of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that would prohibit any form of partition, secession or union with another state. While the Greek Cypriots accepted the Set of Ideas as a basis for negotiation, Denktaş again criticised the UN Secretary-General for exceeding his authority. When he did eventually return to the table, the Turkish Cypriot leader complained that the proposals failed to recognise his community. In November, Ghali brought the talks to a halt. He now decided to take a different approach and tried to encourage the two sides to show goodwill by accepting eight [[confidence building measures]] (CBMs). These included reducing military forces on the island, transferring [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]] to direct UN control, reducing restrictions on contacts between the two sides, undertaking an island-wide census and conducting feasibility studies regarding a solution. The Security Council endorsed the approach.

On 24 May 1993, the Secretary-General formally presented the two sides with his CBMs. Denktaş, while accepting some of the proposals, was not prepared to agree to the package as a whole. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the European Commission returned its opinion on the Cypriot application for membership. While the decision provided a ringing endorsement of the case for Cypriot membership, it refrained from opening the way for immediate negotiations. The Commission stated that it felt that the issue should be reconsidered in January 1995, taking into account "the positions adopted by each party in the talks". A few months later, in December 1993, [[Glafcos Clerides]] proposed the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Denktaş dismissed the idea, but the next month he announced that he would be willing to accept the CBMs in principle. [[Proximity talks]] started soon afterwards. In March 1994, the UN presented the two sides with a draft document outlining the proposed measures in greater detail. Clerides said that he would be willing to accept the document if Denktaş did, but the Turkish Cypriot leader refused on the grounds that it would upset the balance of forces on the island. Once again, Ghali had little choice but to pin the blame for another breakdown of talks on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas would be willing to accept mutually agreed changes, but Clerides refused to negotiate any further changes to the March proposals. Further proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in an attempt to break the deadlock were rejected by both sides.

===Deadlock and legal battles, 1994–1997===
At the [[Corfu]] [[European Council]], held on 24–25 June 1994, the EU officially confirmed that Cyprus would be included in the Union's next phase of enlargement. Two weeks later, on 5 July, the [[European Court of Justice]] imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the [[European Union]]. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996.

In December 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case – [[Loizidou v. Turkey]] – centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from [[Kyrenia]], who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US$825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated.

After twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever. However, the basic parameters of a settlement were by now internationally agreed. Cyprus would be a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. A solution would also be expected to address the following issues:
* Constitutional framework
* Territorial adjustments
* Return of property to pre-1974 owners and/or compensation payments
* Return of displaced persons
* Demilitarisation of Cyprus
* Residency rights/repatriation of Turkish settlers
* Future peacekeeping arrangements

====August 1996 incidents====
In August 1996, Greek [[Cypriot refugees]] demonstrated with a motorcycle protest in [[Deryneia]] against the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Turkish occupation]] of Cyprus. The demonstrators' demand was the complete withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of [[Cypriot refugees]] to their homes and properties. Among them was [[Tassos Isaac]] who was beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ant1en/1996/96-08-13.ant1en.html Turks kill a peaceful protestor in Cyprus.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another man, [[Solomos Solomou]], was shot to death by Turkish troops during the same protests on 14 August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=1 killed, 11 wounded as Turks shoot at Greek Cypriots armed with stones | date=15 August 1996 |agency=Associated Press   | url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF90A39E013EF3&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | accessdate =29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by authorities of the Republic of Cyprus followed, and the suspects were named as Kenan Akin and Erdan Emanet.

Bombardier Emery was shot in his arm, whilst Gunner Hudson was shot in the leg by a high velocity rifle round and was airlifted to hospital in Nicosia then on to [[RAF Akrotiri]].

====Missile crisis====
The situation took another turn for the worse at the start of 1997 when the Greek Cypriots announced that they intended to purchase the Russian-made [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] anti-aircraft missile system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|date=2016-09-30|title=Militarism in post-war Cyprus: the development of the ideology of defence|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Defence Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=408–426|doi=10.1080/14702436.2016.1229126|issn=1470-2436}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Soon afterwards, the [[Cyprus Missile Crisis]] started. The crisis effectively ended in December 1998 with the decision of the Cypriot government to transfer the S-300s to [[Crete]], in exchange for alternative weapons from [[Greece]].

==EU accession and the settlement process, 1997–present==

In 1997 the basic parameters of the Cyprus Dispute changed. A decision by the [[European Union]] to open up accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus created a new catalyst for a settlement. Among those who supported the move, the argument was made that Turkey could not have a veto on Cypriot accession and that the negotiations would encourage all sides to be more moderate. However, opponents of the move argued that the decision would remove the incentive of the Greek Cypriots to reach a settlement. They would instead wait until they became a member and then use this strength to push for a settlement on their terms. In response to the decision, Rauf Denktaş announced that he would no longer accept federation as a basis for a settlement. In the future he would only be prepared to negotiate on the basis of a confederal solution. In December 1999 tensions between Turkey and the European Union eased somewhat after the EU decided to declare Turkey a candidate for EU membership, a decision taken at the Helsinki European Council. At the same time a new round of talks started in New York. These were short lived. By the following summer they had broken down. Tensions started to rise again as a showdown between Turkey and the European Union loomed over the island's accession.

Perhaps realising the gravity of the situation, and in a move that took observers by surprise, [[Rauf Denktaş]] wrote to [[Glafcos Clerides]] on 8 November 2001 to propose a face-to-face meeting. The offer was accepted. Following several informal meetings between the two men in November and December 2001 a new peace process started under UN auspices on 14 January 2002. At the outset the stated aim of the two leaders was to try to reach an agreement by the start of June that year. However, the talks soon became deadlocked. In an attempt to break the impasse, [[Kofi Annan]], the UN Secretary-General visited the island in May that year. Despite this no deal was reached. After a summer break Annan met with the two leaders again that autumn, first in Paris and then in New York. As a result of the continued failure to reach an agreement, the Security Council agreed that the Secretary-General should present the two sides with a blueprint settlement. This would form the basis of further negotiations. The original version of the UN peace plan was presented to the two sides by Annan on 11 November 2002. A little under a month later, and following modifications submitted by the two sides, it was revised (Annan II). It was hoped that this plan would be agreed by the two sides on the margins of the European Council, which was held in [[Copenhagen]] on 13 December. However, Rauf Denktaş, who was recuperating from major heart surgery, declined to attend. The EU therefore decided to confirm that Cyprus would join the EU on 1 May 2004, along with [[Malta]] and eight other states from [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.

[[File:Border between nort and south cyprus Nicosia.JPG|thumb|The North-South checkpoint has been open since 2003]]
Although it had been expected that talks would be unable to continue, discussions resumed in early January 2003. Thereafter, a further revision (Annan III) took place in February 2003, when Annan made a second visit to the island. During his stay he also called on the two sides to meet with him again the following month in [[The Hague]], where he would expect their answer on whether they were prepared to put the plan to a referendum. While the Greek Cypriot side, which was now led by [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], agreed to do so, albeit reluctantly, [[Rauf Denktaş]] refused to allow a popular vote. The peace talks collapsed. A month later, on 16 April 2003, Cyprus formally signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2003|EU Treaty of Accession]] at a ceremony in [[Athens]].

Throughout the rest of the year there was no effort to restart talks. Instead, attention turned to the [[Elections in Northern Cyprus|Turkish Cypriot elections]], which were widely expected to see a victory by moderate pro-solution parties. In the end, the assembly was evenly split. A coalition administration was formed that brought together the pro-solution [[Republican Turkish Party|CTP]] and the [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democrat Party]], which had traditionally taken the line adopted by Rauf Denktaş. This opened the way for Turkey to press for new discussions. After a meeting between [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and [[Kofi Annan]] in Switzerland, the leaders of the two sides were called to New York. There they agreed to start a new negotiation process based on two phases: phase one, which would just involve the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, being held on the island and phase two, which would also include Greece and Turkey, being held elsewhere. After a month of negotiations in Cyprus, the discussions duly moved to Burgenstock, Switzerland. The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktaş rejected the plan outright and refused to attend these talks. Instead, his son [[Serdar Denktaş]] and [[Mehmet Ali Talat]] attended in his place. There a fourth version of the plan was presented. This was short-lived. After final adjustments, a fifth and final version of the Plan was presented to the two sides on 31 March 2004.

===The UN plan for settlement (Annan Plan)===
{{Main article|Annan Plan for Cyprus}}
[[File:Proposed flag of the United Cyprus Republic.svg|thumb|left|190px|Proposed flag of the United Republic of Cyprus]]
[[File:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Former UN secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] was the creator of the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan plan]].]]
Under the final proposals, the Republic of Cyprus would become the United Cyprus Republic. It would be a loose federation composed of two component states. The northern [[Turkish Cypriot constituent state]] would encompass about 28.5% of the island, the southern [[Greek Cypriot constituent state]] would be made up of the remaining 71.5%. Each part would have had its own parliament. There would also be a [[Bicameralism|bicameral parliament]] on the federal level. In the [[Chamber of Deputies]], the Turkish Cypriots would have 25% of the seats. (While no accurate figures are currently available, the split between the two communities at independence in 1960 was approximately 80:20 in favour of the Greek Cypriots.) The [[Senate]] would consist of equal parts of members of each ethnic group. Executive power would be vested in a presidential council. The chairmanship of this council would rotate between the communities. Each community would also have the right to veto all legislation.

One of the most controversial elements of the plan concerned property. During Turkey's military intervention/invasion in 1974, many Greek Cypriots (who owned 90% of the land and property in the north) were forced to abandon their homes. (A large number of Turkish Cypriots also left their homes.) Since then, the question of restitution of their property has been a central demand of the Greek Cypriot side. However, the Turkish Cypriots argue that the complete return of all Greek Cypriot properties to their original owners would be incompatible with the functioning of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal settlement. To this extent, they have argued compensation should be offered. The Annan Plan attempted to bridge this divide. In certain areas, such as [[Morphou]] (Güzelyurt) and [[Famagusta]] (Gazimağusa), which would be returned to Greek Cypriot control, Greek Cypriot refugees would have received back all of their property according to a phased timetable. In other areas, such as [[Kyrenia]] (Girne) and the [[Karpass Peninsula]], which would remain under Turkish Cypriot control, they would be given back a proportion of their land (usually one third assuming that it had not been extensively developed) and would receive compensation for the rest. All land and property (that was not used for worship) belonging to businesses and institutions, including the Church the largest property owner on the island, would have been expropriated. While many Greek Cypriots found these provisions unacceptable in themselves, many others resented the fact that the Plan envisaged all compensation claims by a particular community to be met by their own side. This was seen as unfair as Turkey would not be required to contribute any funds towards the compensation.

Apart from the property issue, there were many other parts of the plan that sparked controversy. For example, the agreement envisaged the gradual reduction in the number of Greek and [[Turkish Military Forces in Northern Cyprus|Turkish troops]] on the island. After six years, the number of soldiers from each country would be limited to 6,000. This would fall to 600 after 19 years. Thereafter, the aim would be to try to achieve full demilitarisation, a process that many hoped would be made possible by Turkish accession to the European Union. The agreement also kept in place the Treaty of Guarantee – an integral part of the 1960 constitution that gave Britain, Greece and Turkey a right to intervene militarily in the island's affairs. Many Greek Cypriots were concerned that the continuation of the right of intervention would give Turkey too large a say in the future of the island. However, most Turkish Cypriots felt that a continued Turkish military presence was necessary to ensure their security. Another element of the plan the Greek Cypriots objected to was that it allowed many Turkish citizens who had been brought to the island to remain. (The exact number of these Turkish 'settlers' is highly disputed. Some argue that the figure is as high as 150,000 or as low as 40,000. They are seen as settlers illegally brought to the island in contravention of international law. However, while many accepted Greek Cypriot concerns on this matter, there was a widespread feeling that it would be unrealistic – and legally and morally problematic – to forcibly remove every one of these settlers, especially as many of them had been born and raised on the island.)

===Referendums, 24 April 2004===
{{main article|Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004}}
Under the terms of the plan, the Annan plan would only come into force if accepted by the two communities in simultaneous [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004|referendums]]. These were set for 24 April 2004. In the weeks that followed there was intense campaigning in both communities. However, and in spite of opposition from Rauf Denktaş, who had boycotted the talks in [[Switzerland]], it soon became clear that the Turkish Cypriots would vote in favour of the agreement. Among Greek Cypriots opinion was heavily weighted against the plan. [[Tassos Papadopoulos]], the president of Cyprus, in a speech delivered on 7 April called on Greek Cypriots to reject the plan. His position was supported by the centrist Diko party and the socialists of EDEK as well as other smaller parties. His major coalition partner [[AKEL]], one of the largest parties on the island, chose to reject the plan bowing to the wishes of the majority of the party base. Support for the plan was voiced by [[Democratic Rally]] (DISY) leadership, the main right-wing party, despite opposition to the plan from the majority of party followers, and the [[United Democrats]], a small centre-left party led by [[George Vasiliou]], a former president. [[Glafcos Clerides]], now retired from politics, also supported the plan. Prominent members of DISY who did not support the Annan plan split from the party and openly campaigned against it. The Greek Cypriot Church also opposed the plan in line with the views of the majority of public opinion.

The United Kingdom (a Guarantor Power) and the United States came out in favour of the plan. Turkey signalled its support for the plan. The Greek Government decided to remain neutral. However, Russia was troubled by an attempt by Britain and the US to introduce a resolution in the UN [[Security Council]] supporting the plan and used its veto to block the move. This was done because they believed that the resolution would provide external influence to the internal debate, which they did not view as fair.&lt;ref&gt;UN Security Council Press Release SC / 8066 http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8066.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 24 April [[referendum]] the Turkish Cypriots endorsed the plan by a margin of almost two to one. However, the Greek Cypriots resoundingly voted against the plan, by a margin of about three to one.

===The Cyprus dispute after the referendum===
{{Update|section|date=October 2016}}
In 2004, the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot community]] was awarded "observer status" in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE), as part of the Cypriot delegation. Since then, two Turkish Cypriot representatives of [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] have been elected in the Assembly of [[Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140226103031/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=516B38E2EAFF2073525EEB08F7B53903?newsId=105715 Today's Zaman] 2005–2007: CTP Özdil Nami; UBP Huseyin Ozgurgun&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2004, a week after the [[referendum]], Cyprus joined the [[European Union]]. Under the terms of accession the whole island is considered to be a member of the European Union. However, the terms of the ''[[Acquis|acquis communautaire]]'', the EU's body of laws, have been suspended in [[Northern Cyprus]].

After the referendum, in June 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community, despite the objection of the Cypriot government, had its designation at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], of which it has been an observer since 1979, changed to the "[[Turkish Cypriot State]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PwmeRG9QsUC James Ker-Lindsay (UN SG's Former Special Representative for Cyprus)] The Foreign Policy of Counter Secession: Preventing the Recognition of Contested States, p.141: "..despite strong objections from Nicosia, this designation was changed to the "Turkish Cypriot State""&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial hopes that a new process to modify the rejected plan would start by autumn, most of the rest of 2004 was taken up with discussions over a proposal by the European Union to open up direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots and provide €259,000,000 in funds to help them upgrade their infrastructure. This plan has provoked considerable debate. The Republic of Cyprus has argued that there can be no direct trade via ports and airports in Northern Cyprus as these are unrecognised. Instead, it has offered to allow Turkish Cypriots to use Greek Cypriot facilities, which are internationally recognised. This has been rejected by the Turkish Cypriots. At the same time, attention turned to the question of the start of Turkey's future membership of the European Union. At a [[European Council]] held on 17 December 2004, and despite earlier Greek Cypriot threats to impose a veto, Turkey was granted a start date for formal membership talks on condition that it signed a protocol extending the customs union to the new entrants to the EU, including Cyprus. Assuming this is done, formal membership talks would begin on 3 October 2005.

Following the defeat of the UN plan in the referendum there has been no attempt to restart negotiations between the two sides. While both sides have reaffirmed their commitment to continuing efforts to reach an agreement, the UN Secretary-General has not been willing to restart the process until he can be sure that any new negotiations will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on the plan he put forward in 2004. To this end, he has asked the Greek Cypriots to present a written list of the changes they would like to see made to the agreement. This was rejected by President [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] on the grounds that no side should be expected to present their demands in advance of negotiations. However, it appears as though the Greek Cypriots would be prepared to present their concerns orally. Another Greek Cypriot concern centres on the procedural process for new talks. Mr. Papadopoulos said that he will not accept arbitration or timetables for discussions. The UN fears that this would lead to another open-ended process that could drag on indefinitely.

In October 2012, [[Northern Cyprus]] became an "observer member" country of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] under the name "[[Turkish Cypriot State]]".

===Formula One and the Cyprus dispute===
The podium display after the [[2006 Turkish Grand Prix]] caused a controversy, when winner [[Felipe Massa]] received the trophy from [[Mehmet Ali Talat]], who was referred to as the "President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus". The government of the Republic of Cyprus filed an official complaint with the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]. After investigating the incident, the FIA fined the organisers of the Grand Prix $5 million on 19 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17474.html Turks fined only $5m], GrandPrix.com, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Motorsports Federation (TOSFED) and the organisers of the [[Turkish Grand Prix]] (MSO) agreed to pay half the fined sum pending an appeal to be heard by the FIA International Court of Appeal on 7 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17612.html |title=F1 News &gt; Turks to appeal |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOSFED insisted the move was not planned and that Mehmet Ali Talat did fit FIA's criteria for podium presentations as a figure of world standing. Keen to repair their impartiality in international politics, the FIA stood their ground forcing the appeal to be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoracingsport.com/uncategorized/turkey-asks-to-withdraw-fine-appeal |title=Turkey asks to withdraw fine appeal at AutoRacingSport.com |publisher=Autoracingsport.com |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of five tripartite meetings took place from 2010 to 2012, with Ban, Christofias and Eroglu negotiating, but without any agreement on the main issues. When asked about the process in March 2011, Ban replied "The negotiations cannot be an open-ended process, nor can we afford interminable talks for the sake of talks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprusweekly.com.cy/main/92,1,283,0,17663-CYPRUS.aspx|title=inCyprus - News of The Cyprus Weekly newspaper|work=InCyprus|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month saw the 100th negotiation since April 2008 without any agreement over the main issues- a deadlock that continued through the next year and a half despite a renewed push for Cyprus to unite and take over the EU presidency in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/met/turkey/1903256.html|title=Turkish FM hopes for Cyprus reunification referendum in early 2012|date=9 July 2011|work=Trend|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 renewed talks===
{{Main article|2014 Cyprus talks}}
In February 2014, renewed negotiations to settle the Cyprus dispute began after several years of warm relations between the north and the south. On 11 February 2014, the leaders of Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, [[Nicos Anastasiades]] and [[Derviş Eroğlu]], respectively, revealed the following joint declaration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Joint Declaration: final version as agreed between the two leaders |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/11/joint-declaration-final-version-as-agreed-between-the-two-leaders/ |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=11 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
1. The status quo is unacceptable and its prolongation will have negative consequences for the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The leaders affirmed that a settlement would have a positive impact on the entire region, while first and foremost benefiting Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, respecting democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as each other's distinct identity and integrity and ensuring their common future in a united Cyprus within the European Union.

2. The leaders expressed their determination to resume structured negotiations in a results-oriented manner. All unresolved core issues will be on the table, and will be discussed interdependently. The leaders will aim to reach a settlement as soon as possible, and hold separate simultaneous referenda thereafter.
 
3. The settlement will be based on a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council Resolutions and the High Level Agreements. The united Cyprus, as a member of the United Nations and of the European Union, shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, which is defined as the sovereignty which is enjoyed by all member States of the United Nations under the UN Charter and which emanates equally from Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. There will be a single united Cyprus citizenship, regulated by federal law. All citizens of the united Cyprus shall also be citizens of either the Greek-Cypriot constituent state or the Turkish-Cypriot constituent state. This status shall be internal and shall complement, and not substitute in any way, the united Cyprus citizenship.

The powers of the federal government, and like matters that are clearly incidental to its specified powers, will be assigned by the constitution. The Federal constitution will also provide for the residual powers to be exercised by the constituent states. The constituent states will exercise fully and irrevocably all their powers, free from encroachment by the federal government. The federal laws will not encroach upon constituent state laws, within the constituent states' area of competences, and the constituent states' laws will not encroach upon the federal laws within the federal government's competences. Any dispute in respect thereof will be adjudicated finally by the Federal Supreme Court. Neither side may claim authority or jurisdiction over the other.

4. The united Cyprus federation shall result from the settlement following the settlement's approval by separate simultaneous referenda. The Federal constitution shall prescribe that the united Cyprus federation shall be composed of two constituent states of equal status. The bi-zonal, bi-communal nature of the federation and the principles upon which the EU is founded will be safeguarded and respected throughout the island.  The Federal constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and will be binding on all the federation's authorities and on the constituent states. Union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession or any other unilateral change to the state of affairs will be prohibited.

5. The negotiations are based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.

6. The appointed representatives are fully empowered to discuss any issue at any time and should enjoy parallel access to all stakeholders and interested parties in the process, as needed. The leaders of the two communities will meet as often as needed. They retain the ultimate decision making power. Only an agreement freely reached by the leaders may be put to separate simultaneous referenda. Any kind of arbitration is excluded.

7. The sides will seek to create a positive atmosphere to ensure the talks succeed. They commit to avoiding blame games or other negative public comments on the negotiations. They also commit to efforts to implement confidence building measures that will provide a dynamic impetus to the prospect for a united Cyprus.}}

The governments of both Greece and Turkey expressed their support for renewed peace talks.&lt;ref name="DW_Peace"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morley |first=Nathan |date=11 February 2014 |title=Cyprus peace talks resume after two-year break |url=http://www.dw.de/cyprus-peace-talks-resume-after-two-year-break/a-17424693 |newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was also welcomed by the European Union.&lt;ref name="EUObs_Big"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Big expectations as Cyprus peace talks restart |url=http://euobserver.com/foreign/123097 |newspaper=[[EUobserver]] |location=Brussels |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2014, [[Chrysostomos II of Cyprus|Archbishop Chrysostomos]] lent [[Nicos Anastasiades|Anastasiades]] his backing on the Joint Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Anastasiades secures Archbishop's backing |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/13/anastasiades-secures-archbishops-backing/ |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=13 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot negotiator Andreas Mavroyiannis and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Kudret Özersay held their first meeting and agreed to visit Greece and Turkey respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Evripidou |first=Stefanos |date=15 February 2014 |title=Direct access to guarantors |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/15/direct-access-to-guarantors/ |newspaper=Cyprus Mail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions among the Greek Cypriot political parties were mixed. The opposition [[AKEL]] party declared its support for the declaration.&lt;ref name="DW_Peace"/&gt; However, Nicolas Papadopoulos, the leader of [[DIKO]], the main partner to Anastasiades' party [[Democratic Rally|DISY]] in the governing coalition, opposed the declaration, and [[DIKO]]'s executive committee voted on 21 February to recommend to the party's central committee that the party withdraw from the coalition from 4 March.&lt;ref name="CM_Eyes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Psillides |first=Constantinos |date=23 February 2014 |title=All eyes on DIKO's next move |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/23/all-eyes-on-dikos-next-move/ |newspaper=Cyprus Mail |accessdate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February, [[DIKO]] decided to leave the coalition government, with the explanation that the Joint Declaration had conceded separate [[sovereignty]] to [[Turkish Cypriots]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/27/diko-decides-to-leave-coalition/ Cyprus Mail] 27 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2015, in the first [[Mustafa Akıncı|Akıncı]]-Anastasiades negotiation meeting, [[Northern Cyprus]] lifted visa requirement for Greek Cypriots, and Anastasiades presented maps of 28 minefields in the north, near the mountainous region of Pentadaktilos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=2387807&amp;CategoryId=12395|title=Latin American Herald Tribune - Turkish Cypriot Authorities Lift Visa Requirements for Greek Cypriots|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–17 talks===
{{Main article|2015–17 Cyprus talks}}
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, [[Nicos Anastasiades]], and President of Northern Cyprus, [[Mustafa Akıncı]], met for the first time and restarted peace talks on 12 May 2015. On 7 July 2017, UN-sponsored talks held in the Swiss Alps for the past 10 days were brought to a halt after negotiations broke down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/07/cyprus-reunification-talks-collapse-amid-angry-scenes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion on solutions==
A number of observers increasingly suggest partition is the best solution.&lt;ref&gt;For example:

*James Ker-Lindsay (expert advisor to UN Special Advisor on Cyprus): "As the status quo in Cyprus becomes untenable, perhaps the solution lies in a more radical option – partition." {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/03/theunmentionablesolutionpart2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=The unmentionable solution - part 2| author=James Ker-Lindsay|date=3 September 2007|accessdate=18 May 2018}}

*[http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/01/12/our-view-gas-role-in-talks-the-latest-in-long-line-of-fantasies Cyprus Mail, 12 January 2014]: "The only Plan B on offer is partition which may well be the only viable solution after all these years, but this should be made clear."&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, an opinion poll conducted for the CyBC showed that the majority of Greek Cypriots supported partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Cyprus Mail|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/05/majority-want-partition/|date=5 February 2017|title=Why the majority want partition|author=Loucas Charalambous}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An international panel of legal experts proposed the "creation of a Constitutional Convention under European Union auspices and on the basis of the 1960 Cyprus Constitution to bring together the parties directly concerned in order to reach a settlement in conformity with the Fundamental Principles".
&lt;ref&gt;See [http://agora-dialogue.com/?p=26620 "A principled basis for a just and lasting Cyprus settlement in the light of International and European Law"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402130547/http://agora-dialogue.com/?p=26620 |date=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical peace scholars suggest that a solution to the Cyprus conflict can only be found by including society on a broad base, as political elites started to abuse the conflict as a source of power and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectcore.eu/files/CORE_Policy_Brief_2-2013.pdf |author1=Birte Vogel |author2=Oliver Richmond |date=April 2013 |isbn=978-82-7288-509-9|title=Enabling civil society in conflict resolution |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304122216/http://www.projectcore.eu/files/CORE_Policy_Brief_2-2013.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official [[White House]] statement on 8 June 2016, US Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Turkish Prime Minister [[Binali Yildirim]] reaffirmed strong support for "an agreement that reunifies the island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal [[federation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Readout of Vice President Biden’s Call with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim of Turkey |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/08/readout-vice-president-bidens-call-prime-minister-binali-yildirim-turkey |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The White House: Office of the Vice President |date=8 June 2016 |access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''duty to report misconduct''' is one of the ethical duties imposed on attorneys in the [[United States]] by the rules governing [[professional responsibility]].&lt;ref name="model"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 8.3: Reporting Professional Misconduct|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_3_reporting_professional_misconduct.html|website=Model Rules of Professional Conduct|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With certain exceptions, an attorney who becomes aware that either a fellow attorney or a judge has committed an act in violation of the rules of ethical conduct must report that violation. Failure to do so subjects the attorney failing to make the report to discipline.
&lt;ref name="statelist"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Adoption of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/alpha_list_state_adopting_model_rules.html|website=Center for Professional Responsibility|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The duty extends only to actual knowledge possessed by an attorney. An attorney who has a mere suspicion of misconduct is not required to report that suspicion, nor is the attorney required to conduct any sort of investigation to confirm or dispel that suspicion. The conduct at issue must rise to the level of misconduct under the rules of professional responsibility. Thus, an attorney who witnesses another attorney become [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]], engage in [[adultery]], or [[Gambling|gamble]] away a large sum of money is under no duty to report these acts because they are not prohibited by the rules of professional responsibility. Conduct that must be reported, on the other hand, includes matters such as breaching client confidentiality, misusing client funds, tampering with evidence, [[Subornation of perjury|suborning perjury]], offering [[Bribery|bribes]], and committing criminal acts of violence or dishonesty.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt;

==Exceptions==
There are several substantial exceptions to the duty to report misconduct. First and foremost, where an attorney learns of the misconduct through a client, the [[duty of confidentiality]] to the client trumps the duty to report. The attorney must seek permission of the client to report the misconduct, and if the permission is not granted, the attorney may not report it. Moreover, if reporting the misconduct would harm the client, the attorney may not report it at all. For example, where a client who owns a restaurant tells his attorney, Jones, that a different attorney, Smith, suggested that the client bribe a health inspector, Jones may not report Smith's misconduct unless Jones first gets the client's permission. However, if the client reports that Smith not only made a suggestion that the client bribe the health inspector, but assisted the client in paying the bribe, then Jones may not report this at all because doing so would be harmful to the client.

An attorney also may not report misconduct by another attorney who is the client of the first. If Smith has hired Jones to represent Smith in a legal matter, and Smith confides in Jones during the course of that representation that Smith has stolen money from clients, bribed judges, or otherwise violated the rules of professional conduct, Jones must nevertheless abide by his duty of confidentiality to Smith. Jones is therefore prohibited from reporting those violations.

Finally, an attorney who learns of misconduct by another attorney through a Bar-approved [[substance abuse program]] is not required to reveal the misconduct. This is to encourage attorneys who have drug or alcohol problems to seek treatment for those problems by insuring that they may disclose misconduct prompted by their addiction in the course of seeking treatment for it.

{{Apartheid}}

The '''End Conscription Campaign''' was an anti-[[apartheid]] organisation allied to the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) and composed of [[conscientious objector]]s and their supporters in [[South Africa]].  It was formed in 1983 to oppose the [[conscription]] of all white South African men into military service in the [[South African Defence Force]].

== Apartheid government's policy on military conscription ==

The apartheid government had a policy of compulsory conscription for young white men who were expected to perform military service at regular intervals, starting with an extended training which began in the year immediately following the one in which they left school or as soon as they turned 16, whichever came last. Many were granted deferment, for example to attend University and complete an undergraduate degree first, but very few young men were exempted from conscription for any reason other than being medically unfit or for a race classification error.  Valid reasons included conscientious objection based on religious beliefs, but these exceptions were tightened in 1974.{{sfn| Callister|2008}} Increasingly stringent laws were passed increasing periods of service, broadening the base of eligible white men who could be called up, and providing stringent sentences for those men who objected.

Conscripts comprised a significant part of [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF).

== Formation ==

The End Conscription Campaign (ECC) was formed in 1983, in protest against compulsory military service. It mobilised support for its campaigns, proposed service alternatives, supported conscientious objectors and provided a forum for the public with information and education on conscription and the alternatives. The ECC was founded in response to a resolution passed by [[Black Sash]] at their annual conference, which condemned South Africa's occupation of Namibia and charged the SADF with fighting a civil war.{{sfn|Conway|2008a|pp=75–93}}

Conscientious objection was a serious choice as the consequences were severe. The reasons for conscientious objection included political, ethical and religious reasons. Some religious organisations, parent groups and student organisations such as the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS) also engaged in anti-conscription activities.

At its peak, [[conscription in South Africa]] consisted of two years of mandatory military service, followed by camps at intervals. Under apartheid, the call-up applied to all white men after completing their schooling or further studies.

== Objections against war and participation in the Apartheid State ==

Objections to military service and the [[Angolan Civil War|War in Angola]] were generally based on the role of the military and security forces in enforcing the policy of [[apartheid]].  Although South Africa's defence forces were active against various liberation movements in Southern Africa and the frontline states (countries bordering the republic including [[Angola]], [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) and [[Mozambique]]), suppressing a guerrilla war, they also waged war against [[MPLA]] and [[Cuba]]n forces in a conventional war at the [[battle of Cuito Cuanavale]]. The military had also become increasingly active in suppressing a civil war in South Africa's black [[Township (South Africa)|townships]].

Those who refused military service were subject to contempt from the minority white community, and left with the choice of either going underground (internal exile) fleeing the republic (external exile) or imprisonment of up to double the length of the allotted military service. Many conscripts simply went Absent Without Leave (AWOL), failed to arrive at BASICS (training) or got lost in the system.

The End Conscription Campaign, one of many anti-war movements alongside Congress of South African War Resistors (COSAWR) mobilised against the draft, promoted alternatives to military service, provided information about the situation in the townships and support to those brave enough to speak out against the war, as conscientious objectors.

== Troops out of the townships ==

In 1985, the ECC held the "Troops out of the Townships" rally and were overwhelmingly successful in demonstrating the growing dissatisfaction within the white community, with the government of the day

The rally was preceded by a three-week fast by objectors [[Ivan Toms]], [[Harold Winkler (activist)|Harold Winkler]] and Richard Steele.

It was announced in parliament that 7 589 conscripts failed to report for [[National Service]] in January 1985, as opposed to only 1 596 in the whole of 1984. {{efn|At Ease, ECC newsletter, May 1986, cited in Cock, 1991, pg81{{sfn|Cock|1991|p=81}} }} As there were two intakes annually, in January and July, this would suggest a tenfold increase in non-reportees over the previous year.  An estimated additional 7 000 "draft-dodgers" were also said to be living in Europe in 1985.This campaign received as significant boost when at 1983 Durban Conference the National PFP Youth, its Western Cape Chairperson Stephen Drus ( Stephen Darori) endorsed the ECC and proposed a motion calling for Alternative to Conscription. The motion  was passed unanimously.He proposed the  same motion  at the Annual Conference of the PFP in Cape Town a few months later which  passed with little opposition.Following intense backroom negotiations between [[Harry Schwarz]] and Philip Myburg, the Defense Spokesmen of the PFP, the Nationalist Government passed an amendment that introduced a four-year Alternative to Conscription. 1452 people opted for the Alternative to Conscription between 1984 and the cancelling of Conscription in South Africa in 1993.

January 1985 and July 1985 were the first so-called "immigrant intakes" after the involuntary nationalisation of white immigrant men of a predetermined age group in November 1984. The high number of non-reportees was due to many of these immigrants opting to return to their countries of origin rather than do military service, since this opportunity was easily available to them because of their dual citizenship.

== Group of 23 refuse military call-up ==

In 1987, a group of 23 conscientious objectors from the Universities of Cape Town and Stellenbosch, including Cameron Dugmore, then [[University of Cape Town]] [[Students Representative Council]] Chairperson and Jonathan Handler, [[South African Union of Jewish Students]] (SAUJS) Chairperson,  refused to do military service in the South African Defense Force. Handlers' objection was based upon the notion of an "Unjust War" as opposed to the Pacifist position held by many Christian students.

== ECC banning ==

The organisation was [[Ban (law)#Banned persons|banned]] in August 1988 under emergency regulations. In a press statement [[Adriaan Vlok]], then Minister of Law and Order said:  "The changes posed by the activities of the End Conscription Campaign to the safety of the public, the maintenance of public order and the termination of the State of Emergency, leave no other choice than to act against the ECC and to prohibit the organisation from continuing any activities or acts."

The same month, an issue of an alternative newspaper, the [[Mail &amp; Guardian|''Weekly Mail'']], was confiscated by security police, "on the grounds that it had covered, and therefore promoted, opposition to conscription." News coverage included a cartoon, an advertisement from [[War Resisters International]], and "a report on 143 men who stated they would never serve in the South African Defence Force."{{sfn|Merrett &amp; Saunders|2000|pp=473–}}

As a result of the banning of the ECC and confiscation of the ''Weekly Mail'', protests at the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT) and other campuses were held. According to Grassroots, a crowd of 3000 UCT students marched on campus after a meeting condemning the banning.&lt;ref&gt;Grassroots, August 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The paper said, "government fears losing control of white youth. This is the message sent by the banning of the ECC under emergency regulations...the ECC pointed out that there is a civil war in our country, and that the SADF is being used against fellow South Africans....ECC's growing influence, led [[PW Botha]] and [[Magnus Malan]] to close it down. They fear that the message of the ECC will undermine apartheid's defence force."&lt;ref&gt;Grassroots, August 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After the End Conscription Campaign was banned, hundreds of white South African war resisters refused the call-up, and conscription into the [[South African Border War|War in Angola]] and [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|Civil War]] raging in South Africa's Black Townships continued. Some dodged the draft, others fled the country, some stood-up and faced the consequences for what they believed. None were ever given recognition by either the South African government or the newly elected democracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== Shortening of conscription ==

In 1989, conscription was reduced from two years to one year, and during the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiations to end apartheid]] from 1990 to 1994, it was less rigorously enforced. A Kairos campaign against conscription was the 1989 Campaign focussing on the End Conscription Campaign with participation of Alistair Teeling Smith, Rob Watson and Mandy Tailor. Saul Batzofin, 27, a member of the End Conscription Campaign, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in 1989 for refusing to serve in the South African Defence Force. After he had completed his sentence he later told the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] that he wanted to apply for amnesty to clear his criminal record. Although he was proud to have been a conscientious objector, the record caused difficulties with visa applications for foreign countries.

During September 1989, thirty [[Stellenbosch]] conscientious objectors joined more than 700 listed COs nationwide by publicly refusing to do military service. The National Registry of Conscientious Objectors was also launched.&lt;ref&gt;Argus, Thursday 21, September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of conscription ==

On 24 August 1993 Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee announced the end of conscription. In 1994 there would be no more call-ups for the one-year initial training. But although conscription was suspended it was not entirely abandoned. Indeed, in January 1994 for the first time there was no call-up for initial training, but at the same time conscripts who had already undergone training could be subject to "camp" call-ups, as they were technically subject to [[military justice|military law]] rather than civilian law. Actually "camp" call-ups reached record proportions over the period of the April 1994 elections, and for the first time in history the ECC called on conscripts to consider these call-ups to be different from previous call-ups.

* (However, as of 2015 : An ANC-led alliance has reportedly begun pushing for the return of military conscription to the country, in a bid to contain youth unemployment and also instill discipline, patriotism and volunteerism into young people from the ages of 18. ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe has stated he would support the reintroduction of conscription, saying the country moved away from the system “too soon”. Although reintroducing conscription may go against the spirit of the Constitution, Mantashe said “the country must do what it needs to do for the country to work”. The draft plan still needs to be approved, but if so, young South Africans may be forced to attend a compulsory military programme as soon as 2016.)&lt;ref name="busi_Army"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Army conscription may return in South Africa: report | author =  | work = businesstech.co.za | date = 27 July 2015 | accessdate = 2016-09-17 | url = http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/94301/army-conscription-may-return-in-south-africa-report/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscription moratorium ==

Until the August 1994 moratorium on prosecutions for not responding to call-ups, several of those who did not respond to "camp" call-ups were fined. After the first multi-racial [[South African general election, 1994|election]] in 1994, conscription has no longer applied in South Africa and the civilian draft has been exchanged for a professional standing army.
However, conscripts who failed to report for duty, still faced prosecution under South Africa's Defence Act. An amendment to the act promulgated in 2002 allows for absentee members of the SANDF to be regarded as discharged from official duty.

== Absent without leave ==

3 Section 59(3) of the Defence Act determines that: A member of the Regular Force absent from official duty without permission of their commanding officer for more than thirty days is regarded as having been dismissed if an officer, or discharged if of other rank, for misconduct with effect from the day immediately following the day of attendance to duty or last day of official leave, but the Chief of the Defence Force may, with good cause, authorise reinstatement of such conditions as they determine.

According to a Department of Defence bulletin, dated 10 July 2003, "In essence, this means that if a member has absented himself or herself for a continuous period of thirty days, he or she is automatically discharged from the SANDF. It is therefore no longer necessary to approach the Minister of Defence for such a dismissal or discharge, as the individual will effect their own discharge if absent thirty days without permission. Should a member wish to be reinstated in the SANDF, he or she should approach the Chief of the SANDF with sound reasons why he or she was absent without permission."&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defence Bulletin, 10 July 2003: No 43/03&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forces Favourites and musicians against conscription ==

In 1986, [[Shifty Records]] released ''Forces Favourites'' in conjunction with the ECC. Named after a radio programme for sending greetings to the troops fighting on the "border" - the frontline of the Angolan campaign.

The ironically titled ''Forces Favourites'' compilation features some of the strongest political songs of the time.

# "Pambere" - Mapantsula
# "National Madness" - Aeroplanes
# "Potential Mutiny" - Stan James
# "Numbered Again" - The Facts
# "Shot Down In The Streets" - [[James Phillips (musician)|Cherry Faced Lurchers]]
# "Don't Dance" - [[Warrick Sony|Kalahari Surfers]]
# "Whitey" - The Softies
# "Don't Believe" - In Simple English
# "Too Much Resistance" - Nude Red
# "Spaces Tell Stories" - [[Roger Lucey]]
# "Suburban Hum" - [[Jennifer Ferguson]]

== Counter-operations against the ECC ==

Many ECC members were subject to persecution. During 1986 98 members were detained, and others subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation. Meetings, publications and activities of the organisation were banned. [[Disinformation]], death threats, fire-bombings, assaults, break-ins, and anonymous counter-propaganda against the organisation was commonplace. Evidence in a Cape Town court in 1988 revealed that the SADF itself had been running a disinformation campaign against the ECC.{{sfn|Cock|1991|p=88}}

Political and military figures adopted varying and sometimes contradictory methods and messages to try and contain the threat of conscientious objection. National Party politicians characterised ECC activists as naive, malevolent in intent, in league with 'communist revolutionaries' and also as sexually deviant (i.e. homosexual) and cowardly. However, there is evidence that sentencing magistrates and even state prosecutors came to admire objectors for their stand.{{sfn|Conway|2008}}

== Psychiatric oppression and the ECC ==

In order to get out of forced conscription into the SADF, many conscripts allowed themselves to be labeled as mentally ill, sick, or incapable of carrying a weapon. The price was incarceration in one of South Africa's psychiatric facilities. Instances of psychiatric abuse of conscripts who refused national service have also been recorded. The cases of conscripts who ended up in mental hospitals are in the process of being documented by groups such as [[MindFreedom International]].

The '''Expulsion of Poles by Germany''' was a prolonged [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] by violent and terror-inspiring means lasting nearly half a century. It began with the concept of [[Pan-Germanism]] developed in the early 19th century and culminated in the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] that asserted the superiority of the [[Aryan race]]. The removal of Poles by Germany stemmed from historic ideas of [[expansionist nationalism]]. It was implemented at different levels and different stages by successive German governments. It ended with the [[End of World War II in Europe|defeat of Nazi Germany]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="PAN"&gt;[[Polska Akademia Nauk]] (Polish Academy of Sciences), ''Historia Polski'', Vol. III 1850/1864-1918, Part 2 1850/1864-1900, edited by Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, [[Warsaw]] 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[partitions of Poland]] had ended the existence of a sovereign Polish state in the 18th century. With the rise of [[German nationalism]] in mid 19th century, [[Poles]] faced [[Anti-Polish sentiment|increasing discrimination]] on formerly Polish lands. The first mass [[Prussian deportations|deportation of 30,000 Poles]] from territories controlled by the [[German Empire]] took place in 1885. While the ideas of expelling Poles can be found in German political discourse of the 19th century, these ideas matured into nascent plans advocated by German politicians during the [[First World War]], which called for the removal of the Polish population from Polish territories first annexed by the Russian Empire during partitions and then by Germany.&lt;ref name="Geiss"&gt;Imannuel Geiss, ''Der polnische Grenzstreifen 1914-1918. Ein Beitrag zur deutschen Kriegszielpolitik im Ersten Weltkrieg'', Hamburg/Lübeck 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Before and after the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] the [[Nazis]] exploited these ideas when creating their [[Lebensraum]] concept of territorial aggression.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; Large-scale expulsions of Poles occurred during [[World War II]], when Nazi Germany started the [[Generalplan Ost]] campaign of ethnic cleansing in all Polish areas occupied by, and [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|formally annexed to Nazi Germany]]. Although the Nazis were not able to fully implement Generalplan Ost due to the war's turn, up to 2 million Poles were affected by wartime expulsions with additional millions displaced or killed.

== Background ==
[[Poles]] had constituted one of the largest minorities in the [[German Empire]] since its creation in 1871. This was a result of the earlier acquisitions made by [[Prussia]], the [[State (polity)|state]] that initiated the [[Unification of Germany]]. The Electorate of Brandenburg (later Kingdom of Prussia), with its capital in Berlin after 1451, acquired historic lands with significant Polish population in a series of military operations,&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; and, in the second half of the 18th century, had seized western territories of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|the Polish Kingdom]] by taking part in the [[Partitions of Poland]] and the [[Silesian Wars]] with [[Austria]].

[[File:Plaque commemorating the expulsion of Gdynia citizens during the German war occupation.jpg|260px|thumb|Plaque commemorating the expulsion of 50,000 Polish citizens of Gdynia during the German [[Gotenhafen|"aktion Gotenhafen"]] in World War II]]

The idea of [[pan-Germanism]], demanding the unification of all Germans in one state, including the German diaspora east of the imperial border, grew out of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Some pan-Germanists believed that Germans were ethnically superior to other peoples — including [[Slavs]], whom they viewed as inferior to the German "race" and culture. The [[Nazi]] concept of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in turn demanded "living space" for German people, claiming overpopulation of Germany and alleged negative traits of heavy urbanisation in contrast to agricultural settlement. The desired territories were to be taken particularly from Poland. Both pan-Germanism and ''Lebensraum'' theory viewed Poles as an obstacle to German hegemony and prosperity as well as future expansion of the German state.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

== German Empire ==
{{main| Prussian deportations}}
In the territories annexed during the Partitions of Poland, German authorities sought to limit the number of ethnic Poles by their forced [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanisation]] and by a new wave of [[Prussian Settlement Commission|settlement by German colonists]] at their expense.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; Beginning with the [[Kulturkampf]], laws were enacted to restrict Polish culture, religion, language, and rights to property. Bismarck initiated the [[Prussian deportations]] of 1885-1890, which affected some 30,000 Poles and [[Jews]] living in Germany who did not have German citizenship. This is described by E.J. Feuchtwanger as one the precedents to modern policies of [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Faucht"&gt;E.J. Feuchtwanger, "Bismarck", Routledge 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 [[Bernhard von Bülow]], the future [[Chancellor of the German Empire]], advocated expelling Poles by force from territories which were Polish-inhabited and slated to become part of Germany.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;Herbert Arthur Strauss, "Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism 1870-1933-39 Germany - Great Britain-France",Walter de Gruyter 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Germany legalized eviction of Poles from their properties under pressure from pan-[[German nationalist]] groups who hoped this law would be used to reduce the number of Poles in the East.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

== World War I ==
In August 1914 the German imperial army [[Destruction of Kalisz|bombed and burned down]] the city of [[Kalisz]], chasing out tens of thousands of its Polish citizens. However, during World War I, Germany had a frantic need for extra manpower in the East, and hoped to tap into the reservoir of military volunteers among the Poles by making promises of a future independent Polish state. This initiative (led by Bethmann) failed, producing only "a dribble of volunteers" in 1916, but it was a commitment very hard to retract. There were numerous mistakes made, such as the [[Oath Crisis]], caused by poor wording of the oath of the Polish soldiers, which caused consternation among many Polish volunteers.  In general, opinions of the German occupiers were mixed, between those who hoped that the Germans would set up a new Polish state, and those who feared German domination.  In any case, successful attacks by the Russian army, such as the 'Brusilov offensive', forced Germany to consider a quasi independent buffer state between the two empires, hopefully set up only in the former Russian Poland and linked to Germany by its own military means.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=DSc9CraE4OQC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22nominally+independent+buffer+state+in+the+former+Russian+Poland,+with+no+independent+foreign+policy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GHJ-TdHHLfO10QHS7ZjsAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nominally%20independent%20buffer%20state%20in%20the%20former%20Russian%20Poland%2C%20with%20no%20independent%20foreign%20policy%22&amp;f=false  ''Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy'' By David Stevenson.

{{main|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany (1939-1944)}}

With the occupation of Poland following the German invasion of the country, Nazi policies were enacted upon its Polish population on an unprecedented scale. According to Nazi ideology Poles, as [[Untermenschen]], were seen as fit only for [[slavery]] and for further elimination in order to make room for the Germans. [[Adolf Hitler]] had plans for extensive colonisation of territories in the east of the [[Third Reich]]. Poland, itself, would &amp;ndash; according to well documented German plans &amp;ndash; have been cleared of Polish people altogether, as 20 million or so would have been expelled eventually. Up to 3 or 4 million Polish citizens (all peasants) believed to be descendants of German colonists and migrants and therefore considered "racially valuable" would be Germanised and dispersed among the German population.&lt;ref name = "Neu"&gt;Janusz Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczynski, [https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm "Hitler's War; Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe"], 1961, (in) ''Poland under Nazi Occupation'', Polonia Publishing House, [[Warsaw]], pp. 7-33, 164-178.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi leadership hoped that through expulsions to [[Siberia]], [[famine]], mass [[executions]], and slave labour of any survivors, the Polish nation would be eventually completely destroyed.&lt;ref name="Rosz"&gt;Wojciech Roszkowski, Historia Polski 1914–1997, Warsaw 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] expulsions took place within two specific territories: one area annexed to Reich in 1939 and 1941, and another, the [[General Government]], precursor to further expansion of German administrative settlement area. Eventually, as [[Adolf Hitler]] explained in March 1941, the General Government would be cleared of Poles, the region would be turned into a "purely German area" within 15–20 years and in place of 15 million Poles, 4–5 million Germans would live there, and the area would become "as German as the [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref name="Volk"&gt;{{Citation |first=Volker R. |last=Berghahn |title=Germans and Poles 1871–1945 |journal=Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences |publisher=Rodopi |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=j6VCNno2DVMC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;vq=Volker%2BR.%2BBerghahn%2B1999&amp;pg=PA15#v=snippet&amp;q=Volker+R.+Berghahn+1999&amp;f=false |pages=15–34 |isbn=9042006889 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expulsions from Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany ===
{{Main|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany (1939–1944)}}
{{See also|Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany}}

The Nazi plan to ethnically cleanse the territories occupied by Germany in Eastern Europe during World War II, was called the [[Generalplan Ost]] (GPO). [[Germanisation]] began with the classification of people suitable as defined on the Nazi [[Volksliste]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p543 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 1.7 million Poles were deemed Germanizable, including between one and two hundred thousand children who were taken from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Aycoberry, ''The Social History of the Third Reich, 1933-1945'', p 228, {{ISBN|1-56584-549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the rest, expulsion was carried out.

These expulsions were carried out so abruptly that ethnic Germans being resettled there were given homes with half-eaten meals on tables and unmade beds where small children had been sleeping at the time of expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p. 213-4 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of [[Hitler Youth]] and the [[League of German Girls]] were assigned the task of overseeing such evictions to ensure that the Poles left behind most of their belongings for the use of the settlers.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Walter S. Zapotoczny , "[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/hitleryouth.aspx Rulers of the World: The Hitler Youth]"&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Czesław Łuczak]], Germans expelled the following numbers of Poles from territories annexed to the Reich in the period of 1939&amp;ndash;1944:

Combined with "wild expulsions", in four years 923,000 Poles were ethnically cleansed from territories Germany annexed into the Reich.&lt;ref name="Ipnb"&gt;Zygmunt Mańkowski; Tadeusz Pieronek; [[Andrzej Friszke]]; Thomas Urban (panel discussion), "Polacy wypędzeni", Biuletyn IPN, nr5 (40) May 2004 / Bulletin of the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej), issue: 05 /

=== Expulsions from General Government ===
Within the territories of the German protoctorate called General Government there were two main areas of expulsions committed by the German state. The protectorate itself was seen as temporary measure, and served as a [[concentration camp]] for Poles to perform hard labour furthering German industry and war effort. Eventually it was to be cleared of Poles also.

====Zamość====
[[Image:Wysiedlanie-Zamojszczyzna.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[w:Expulsion of Poles by Germany|Expulsion of Poles]] from villages in [[w:Zamość Uprising|Zamość Region]] by SS, December 1942]]
{{Main|Ethnic cleansing of Zamojszczyzna by Nazi Germany}}

Some 116,000 Poles were expelled from the [[Zamość]] region as part of Nazi plans for establishment of German colonies in the conquered territories. Zamość itself was to be renamed Himmlerstadt, later changed to Pflugstadt (Plough City), that was to symbolise the German "Plow" that was to "plough" the East. Additionally almost 30,000 children were kidnapped by German authorities from their parents for potential Germanisation.&lt;ref name="Ipnb"/&gt; This led to massive resistance (see [[Zamość Uprising]]).

====Warsaw====
In October 1940, 115,000 Poles were expelled from their homes in central Warsaw to make room for the Jewish Ghetto, constructed there by German authorities. (Jews were then expelled from their homes elsewhere and forced to move into the Ghetto.) When the [[Warsaw Uprising]] failed, 500,000 people were expelled from the city alone as punishment by German authorities.&lt;ref name="Ipnb"/&gt;

==Demographic estimates==
It is estimated that between 1.6 and 2 million people&lt;ref name="Poles"&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544 "Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128000000/http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=%2Fexport%2Fhome%2Fwww%2Fdoc_root%2Feducation%2Fforeducators%2Finclude%2Fmenu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544 |date=November 28, 2005 }} at US Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt; were expelled from their homes during the German occupation of Poland. The Nazi German organized expulsions—by themselves—affected 1,710,000 Poles directly.&lt;ref name="Ipnb"/&gt; New estimates by Polish historians give the number of 2.478 million people expelled.&lt;ref name="PWN"&gt;Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN. Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 2004,pages 811-812 (volume 8), s. 709 (volume 6). {{ISBN|83-01-14179-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 2.5 to 3 million Poles were taken from Poland to Germany as slave labourers to support the Nazi war effort.&lt;ref name="Rosz"/&gt; These numbers do not include people arrested by the Germans and sent to Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Poles"/&gt;

In many instances, Poles were given between 15 minutes and 1 hour to collect their personal belongings (usually no more than 15 kilograms per person) before they were removed from their homes and transported east (''see: [[World War II evacuation and expulsion#Deportation of Poles|deportations]]'') On top of that about 5 million Poles were sent to [[German camps in occupied Poland during World War II|German labor and concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="bibula-13530"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibula.com/?p=13530 | title=Straty ludności cywilnej | publisher=Bibula – pismo niezalezne | work=Straty ludzkie poniesione przez Polskę w latach 1939-1945 | date=2009-08-31 | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | author=Dr Waldemar Grabowski, [[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]] Centrala | quote=Według ustaleń Czesława Łuczaka, do wszelkiego rodzaju obozów odosobnienia deportowano ponad 5 mln obywateli polskich (łącznie z Żydami i Cyganami).

The '''External Security Organisation''' (ESO) is a government agency, mandated to collect, analyse and process information related to external security threats with the objective of informing national policy makers in [[Uganda]]. Its headquarters are located in a three-story office building that the agency owns on Hannington Road, on [[Nakasero|Nakasero Hill]], in [[Kampala]], Uganda's capital and largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Overview==
ESO was established by an Act of Parliament, the Security Organisations Act 1987. The agency focuses on the assessment of external security threats to Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ulii.org/ug/legislation/consolidated-act/305 | title=Security Organisations Act 1987 | date=13 November 1987 | accessdate=17 August 2016 | publisher=Uganda Legal Information Institute (ULII) | author=Parliament of Uganda | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014/2015 financial year, the agency was allocated a budget of UGX:14 billion.&lt;ref name="Fun"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=17 August 2015 | url=http://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/eso-to-get-more-funding | date=10 July 2016 | title=ESO to Get More Funding | first= Raymond | last=Mujuni | publisher=Uganda Radio Network | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ESO's activities overlap with those of other government spy agencies, including the Internal Security Organisation and the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Museveni wants spy agencies overhauled | accessdate=17 August 2016 | date=15 July 2013 | first=Tabu | last=Butagira | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Museveni-wants-spy-agencies-overhauled/688334-1914988-item-00-661sl9z/index.html | location=Kampala | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Texas (2013)]]'', which ruled that strict scrutiny should be applied to determine the constitutionality of the University's race-sensitive admissions policy.

== Background ==
{{Main|Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)}}
Plaintiffs Abigail Noel Fisher and Rachel Multer Michalewicz applied to the University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and were denied admission. The two women, both white, filed suit, alleging that the University had discriminated against them on the basis of their race in violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richey |first=Warren|title =Affirmative action in college admissions goes back before Supreme Court|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/0221/Affirmative-action-in-college-admissions-goes-back-before-Supreme-Court|  work =The [[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the initial lawsuit was filed, the University of Texas at Austin accepted students in the top 10% of each Texas high school's graduating class, regardless of their race; under [[Texas House Bill 588]], 81% of 2008's freshman class were admitted under the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wermiel|first=Stephen|title=SCOTUS for law students: Barbara Grutter, meet Abigail Fisher|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=129451|publisher=SCOTUSblog|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Starting with the fall 2010 admission class, Senate Bill 175 adjusted this rule to the top 7 percent, but with no more than 75 percent of freshman slots filled under automatic admissions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants who, like Fisher, failed to gain acceptance by automatic admissions can still gain admission by scoring highly in a process that evaluates their talents, leadership qualities, family circumstances, and race.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite news| last= Haurwitz| first= Ralph K.

University of Texas at Austin. Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2012, the court granted ''[[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States#Selection of cases|certiorari]]'' in ''Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin''. The Supreme Court heard the oral argument in October 2012, and handed down its decision on June 24, 2013. In a 7–1 decision, the Court vacated and [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the Fifth Circuit's ruling. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy concluded that the Fifth Circuit failed to apply ''[[strict scrutiny]]'' in its decision affirming the admissions policy. Instead, he wrote, the Fifth Circuit held that Fisher could only challenge "whether the University's decision to use race as an admissions factor 'was made in [[Good faith (law)|good faith]].' Justice Ginsburg was the lone dissenter, who argued in favor of affirming the judgment of the Fifth Circuit in its entirety.

On remand, in November, the Fifth Circuit court heard oral arguments from both sides. On July 15, 2014, the Fifth Circuit announced its decision in favor of UT Austin, with Judge Garza dissenting. Fisher sought a rehearing [[en banc]] with the Fifth Circuit which was denied on November 12, 2014, in a 10–5 decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-50822-CV3.pdf ''09-50822 ON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC 5th Circuit Court of Appeals'', (2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher then filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/02/fisher-ii-reaches-the-court/ “Fisher II” reaches the Court].

==Oral argument==
On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court granted Fisher's second challenge on the UT Austin's admissions policy. The case was assigned docket number 14-981 and oral arguments were heard on December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Mark|title=Supreme Court Will Re-Hear Texas Affirmative Action|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/supreme-court-hear-texas-affirmative-action-32099271|work=ABC News|agency=AP|date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal analysts predicted from the justices' questions that the Court would likely either remand the case again to the lower courts for additional fact-finding, strike down UT Austin's policy, or strike down affirmative action in college admissions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denniston|first1=Lyle|title=Argument analysis: Now, three options on college affirmative action|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/12/argument-analysis-now-three-options-on-college-affirmative-action|work=SCOTUS Blog|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, Justice [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] raised the [[Affirmative action#Mismatching|mismatching]] theory and questioned whether black students admitted to top-tier schools suffer because the courses are too difficult. Scalia commented: "There are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to get them into the University of Texas, where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well. One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mencimer|first1=Stephanie|title=Justice Scalia Suggests Blacks Belong at "Slower" Colleges|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/justice-scalia-suggests-blacks-belong-slower-colleges-fisher-university-texas|work=Mother Jones|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments led to outcry from the University of Texas's African American students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hennessy-Fiske|first1=Molly|title=For black students at Texas, Supreme Court remarks are a burden added|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-black-ut-students-20151213-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spurred the creation of the Twitter hashtag #StayMadAbby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Roberta|title=U. of Texas Supreme Court fight gets hashtag: #StayMadAbby|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/12/13/u-of-texas-supreme-court-fight-gets-hashtag-staymadabby/|work=USA Today College|date=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13, 2016 and Justice Elena Kagan had recused herself, the case was decided by the seven remaining justices.

==Decision==

''Fisher II'' was decided by 4-3. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. The majority upheld the lower court.

The opinion summarized that Fisher I set three controlling principles: strict scrutiny of affirmative action admissions processes, judicial deference to reasoned explanations of the decision to pursue student body diversity, and no judicial deference for the determination of whether the use of race in admissions processes is narrowly tailored. It then noted that the University of Texas' combined Top Ten Percent-holistic admission policy is unique and data on resulting diversity was limited; however, it noted that the university should regularly evaluate available data and "tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances, ensuring that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interest."

The Court refused the petitioner's four arguments against the admissions policy. First, the Court upheld that the university's rationale for diversity-associated goals as "sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Abigail Fisher, et al. v. State of Texas, et al.|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/09-50822/09-50822-cv0.wpd-2011-02-02.pdf |number=No. 09-50822 |date=January 18, 2011 |publisher=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a lack of a numerical quota. The goals that the Court affirmed as sufficiently measurable included the "destruction of stereotypes," promotion of "cross-racial understanding," preparation of students for "an increasingly diverse workforce and society," and cultivation of "leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry." Second, the court found that the university presented sufficient evidence to show that in the seven years between the Hopwood decision and the implementation of the combined academic-holistic admissions process, race-neutral policies and increased outreach efforts were insufficient to achieve these goals. Third, the court found that "consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on the diversity of the University’s freshman class," and that such a limited effect "should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality." Finally, the court found that the petitioner failed "to offer any meaningful way in which the University could have improved upon" its prior race-neutral efforts to achieve diversity-associated goals, including expanding the Top Ten Percent rule, which would leave, as quoted from the ''Grutter'' decision, "a gap in an admissions process seeking to create the multidimensional diversity" envisioned by the ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke|Bakke]]'' decision.

In conclusion, the majority reiterated that the University has an ongoing obligation to use available data "to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a race-conscious policy; and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the affirmative-action measures it deems necessary."

In a lengthy dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, Justice Alito wrote that the university's stated interests in diversity were not sufficiently measurable and upon review were "shifting" as compared to those from Fisher I, "unpersuasive, and, at times, less than candid." Though Alito noted that the articulated goals were "laudable," he wrote that they were "not concrete or precise," and "offer[ed] no limiting principle for the use of racial preferences." Alito questioned how "a court ever be able to determine whether stereotypes have been adequately destroyed" or "whether cross-racial understanding has been adequately achieved[.]" He further noted that "[i]f a university can justify racial discrimination simply by having a few employees opine that racial preferences are necessary to accomplish these nebulous goals, . . . then the narrow tailoring inquiry [of [[strict scrutiny]]] is meaningless. Courts will [effectively] be required to defer to the judgment of university administrators, and affirmative-action policies will be completely insulated from judicial review."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Abigail Fisher, et al. v. State of Texas, et al.|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/09-50822/09-50822-cv0.wpd-2011-02-02.pdf |number=No. 09-50822 |date=January 18, 2011 |publisher=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Alito reiterated the circuit court dissent's claim that the Circuit Court majority believed that automatically admitted minority students were "somehow more homogeneous, less dynamic, and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review."

Justice Thomas also authored a dissent. In this dissent, he reiterated the thoughts expressed in his concurrence in [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher I]], namely that "a State’s use of race in higher education admissions decisions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-345#writing-11-345_CONCUR_5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-981#writing-14-981_DISSENT_4&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd Provisional Government (30 August 1922 – 6 December 1922) was formed by Pro-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] faction of [[Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref name=3rd_Dail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government/Third_D%C3%A1il.html|title=History of Government – Third Dáil|work=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to office following the election of the [[Third Dáil]] on 16 June 1922. The cabinet came to an end when it was superseded by a new cabinet, the [[#1st Executive Council of the Irish Free State|1st Executive Council of the Irish Free State]].

Its formation brought to an end the anomalous system of dual administration that had existed since January, of government under two cabinets simultaneously, the [[Government of the 2nd Dáil#4th Ministry|4th Ministry]] under [[Arthur Griffith]], and the [[Government of the 2nd Dáil#1st Provisional Government|1st Provisional Government]] under [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. Following the death of Collins and Griffith in August 1922, [[W. T. Cosgrave]] decided to merge the two administrations, with himself as head of both. The new cabinet was therefore both the 2nd Provisional Government and the '''5th Ministry''', while Cosgrave was officially both [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State]] and [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]]. Both cabinets were finally, formally abolished when the new [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] came into force in December.

The 1st [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] of the [[Irish Free State]] (6 December 1922 – 19 September 1923) was formed by Pro-Treaty faction of [[Sinn Féin]], which later became the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] party.&lt;ref name=3rd_Dail/&gt; The Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force in December 1922 and under its terms the Second Provisional Government was replaced by the Executive Council.

However elections were not held for the 4th Dáil until August 1923 and so the membership of the 1st Executive Council closely reflected that of the Second Provisional Government of Southern Ireland that had preceded it. The 1st Executive Council was replaced by the 2nd Executive Council shortly after the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 general election]].

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun laws in [[Kuwait]]''' include stringent [[gun control]]. The law does allow firearms to be licensed under specific conditions and regulations:

1- Kuwaiti ( or have an exception from Minister of Interior to own)
2- Age must be above 25 years old and fully capable of handling a weapon. 
3- Must have no criminal records. 
4- Must not be a suspect or under police surveillance. 
5- Must have an occupation or a source of living (must not be homeless or have no source of income).
6- application should be submitted to the 
minister by the criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moi.gov.kw/portal/varabic/ShowPage.aspx?objectID=792bd90c-076a-443b-84dd-574a8bfd68eb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hunting shotguns are the most common licensed weapons in Kuwait also the easiest to get it licensed, hunting and sniper rifles are more difficult to be licensed but firearms chambered for [[.22 LR]] are more commonly licensed, whether with threaded or unthreaded barrel

Automatic rifles or machine guns are not allowed to be licensed in Kuwait but many houses do have such illegal weapons that are either taken by the Kuwaiti resistance  of the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion in 1990]] or taken during the end of [[Gulf War]] when the Iraqi army retreated.

{{Dutch colonial campaigns}}
The '''Guo Huaiyi rebellion''' ({{zh|t=郭懷一事件|p=Guō Huáiyī Shìjiàn|poj=Keh Hoâi-it Sū-kiāⁿ}}; also spelled '''Kuo Huai-i Rebellion''') was a [[peasant revolt]] by Chinese farmers against [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule in Taiwan]] in 1652. Sparked by dissatisfaction with heavy Dutch taxation on them but not the aborigines and extortion by low-ranking Dutch officials and servicemen, the rebellion initially gained ground before being crushed by a coalition of Dutch soldiers and their [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] allies. It is considered the most important uprising against the Dutch during the 37-year period of their colonisation of Taiwan.

==Background==
The burden of Dutch taxes on the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan was a source of much resentment. The falling price of venison, a chief export of the island at the time, hit licensed hunters hard, as the cost of the licenses was based on meat prices before the depreciation.  The [[tax per head|head tax]] (which only applied to Chinese, not aborigines) was also deeply unpopular, and thirdly, petty corruption amongst Dutch soldiers further angered the Chinese residents.&lt;ref name=Andrade&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press|chapter=The Only Bees on Formosa That Give Honey|year=2005|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/|chapterurl=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/andrade08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rebellion==
The revolt was led by '''Guo Huaiyi''' ({{zh|t=郭懷一}}; 1603–1652), a [[sugarcane]] farmer and militia leader originally from [[Quanzhou]] known to the Dutch by the name '''Gouqua Faijit''',&lt;ref name=Andrade/&gt; or '''Gouqua Faet'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1977|series=台灣叢談|script-title=zh:台灣史蹟研究會彙編|publisher=幼獅文化事業|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his planning for an insurrection on 17 September 1652 was leaked to the Dutch authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uas3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=%22Castle+Zeelandia%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA271,M1|title=Development and Decline of Fukien Province in the 17th and 18th Centuries|author=Eduard B. Vermeer|year=1990|isbn=978-90-04-09171-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to waste no time in attacking [[Fort Provintia]], which at the time was only surrounded by a [[bamboo]] wall. On the night of 7 September the rebels, mostly peasants-farmers armed with bamboo spears, stormed the fort.&lt;ref name=Andrade/&gt;

The following morning a company of 120 Dutch [[musketeers]] came to the rescue of their trapped countrymen, firing steadily into the besieging rebel forces and breaking them.&lt;ref name=Andrade/&gt; [[Governor of Formosa|Governor]] [[Nicolas Verburg]] On 11 September the Dutch learned that the rebels had massed just north of the principal Dutch settlement of [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Tayouan]]. Sending a large force of Dutch soldiers and aboriginal warriors, they met the rebels that day in battle and emerged victorious, mainly due to the superior weaponry of the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Development and Decline of Fukien Province in the 17th and 18th centuries|last=Huber|first=Johannes|editor1-last=Vermeer|editor1-first=E.B|chapter=Chinese Settlers Against the Dutch East India Company: The Rebellion Led by Kuo Huai-i on Taiwan in 1652|date=1990|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004091719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple Aboriginal villages in frontier areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression like when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. The [[Wu-lao-wan]] beheaded two Dutch translators, and in a subsequent fight with 30 Wu-lao-wan two Dutch people died, but after an embargo of salt and iron the Wu-lao-wan were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3oWoSKVnVIC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shepherd 1993], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Over the following days, the remnants of Guo's army were either slaughtered by aboriginal warriors or melted back into the villages they came from, with Guo Huaiyi himself being shot, then decapitated, with his head displayed on a spike as a warning.&lt;ref name=Andrade/&gt; In total some 4,000 Chinese were killed during the five-day uprising, approximately 1 in 10 Chinese living in Taiwan at that time. The Dutch responded by reinforcing [[Fort Provintia]] (building brick walls instead of the previous bamboo fence) and by monitoring Chinese settlers more closely. However, they did not address the roots of the concerns which had caused the Chinese to rebel in the first place.

However, the [[Taiwanese Aboriginal]] tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] and defected to [[Koxinga]]'s Chinese forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Covell |first=Ralph R. |date=1998 |title=Pentecost of the Hills in Taiwan: The Christian Faith Among the Original Inhabitants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaP2UFZVGDoC&amp;pg=PA96 |location= |publisher=Hope Publishing House |edition=illustrated |pages=96–97 |isbn=0932727905 |accessdate=10 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty; they proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hsin-Hui |first=Chiu |date=2008 |title=The Colonial 'civilizing Process' in Dutch Formosa: 1624–1662 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QzpJtddFxEC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=BRILL |edition=illustrated |volume=Volume 10 of TANAP monographs on the history of the Asian-European interaction |page=222 |isbn=900416507X |accessdate=10 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Her Majesty's Advocate v Thomas Sheridan and Gail Sheridan''''' was the 2010 criminal prosecution of [[Tommy Sheridan]], a former [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] and his wife Gail Sheridan for [[perjury]] in relation to the earlier civil case ''[[Sheridan v News Group Newspapers]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In Scotland criminal prosecutions in the High Court are normally brought in the name of the [[Lord Advocate]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Tommy Sheridan was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison, whereas Gail was acquitted.

==Background==
{{main|Sheridan v News Group Newspapers}}
In 2006, Tommy Sheridan, formerly convenor of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP), successfully sued the newspaper ''[[News of the World]]'' for defamation after they printed a series of articles containing allegations that an MSP had had affairs and visited a sex club. Sheridan was awarded £200,000 in damages, which he has still not received pending an appeal. Controversy over the case led to a split in the SSP shortly afterwards, with Sheridan forming a breakaway party, [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]].

In August 2006, a number of SSP activists came forward to claim that Sheridan had held meetings with them, where he made admissions inconsistent with his evidence in the court case, in particular admitting that he had had affairs and visited a swingers' club in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Martin [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/scotland/story/0,,1843620,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=19 "Civil war intensifies in Sheridan's party",] ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the ''News of the World'' released a videotape which showed Sheridan admitting that he had visited the club, and admitting that he had admitted this to the SSP Executive.

On 2 October 2006, the [[Procurator Fiscal]] decided that there were grounds for an investigation into perjury, and instructed [[Lothian and Borders Police]] to proceed.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite news|title = Perjury probe over Sheridan trial|work = BBC News|date = 2006-10-02|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5400298.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, the [[Crown Office]] asked Lothian and Borders Police undertake a full inquiry after receiving a preliminary report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1206609.0.0.php Sheridan trial: perjury inquiry stepped up – Herald Scotland].

During late 2006 and early 2007, the police interviewed several SSP members and other witnesses, and seized computing equipment that had been used to type the minutes of SSP meetings.&lt;ref name="seize"&gt;{{cite news|last = Gordon|first = Tom|title = SSP computers to be seized in investigation of Sheridan trial|work = The Herald|date = 2006-10-19|url = http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/72476.html}}

In December 2007, Tommy Sheridan was charged with [[perjury]].  During February 2008, six more people were charged with perjury: Graeme McIver, John Penman, Pat Smith and [[Rosemary Byrne]] (all members of Sheridan's new party [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]] who had been at the disputed SSP executive meeting of November 2004) plus Sheridan's wife, [[Gail Sheridan (politician)|Gail]] and her father, Angus Healy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7245995.stm|work=BBC News|title=Three charged over Sheridan case|date=15 February 2008|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7252672.stm|work=BBC News|title=Sheridan's wife on perjury charge|date=19 February 2008|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February 2008, Gail Sheridan was suspended from her job as a [[flight attendant]] with [[British Airways]] over the alleged theft of miniature bottles of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7260042.stm UK | Scotland | Gail Sheridan charged with theft].

==The trial==

===Preliminary hearings===
At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on 13 July 2009, the indictment against Tommy and Gail Sheridan was made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2519695.0.Sheridan_perjuy_case_full_indictment.php Sheridan perjuy case: full indictment – Herald Scotland]. Theherald.co.uk (2009-07-13). Retrieved on 2011-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both were charged with perjury in relation to several issues at the civil trial, and Tommy Sheridan was also charged with subornation of perjury by attempting to persuade [[Colin Fox (politician)|Colin Fox]] to commit perjury at this trial.

Both accused took pleas in bar of trial on the basis of prejudicial pre-trial publicity, and sought to raise devolution minutes. At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh between 28 and 30 July 2010, the trial judge [[Alastair Campbell, Lord Bracadale|Lord Bracadale]], heard legal arguments on these matters. At the close of the hearing, the preliminary pleas were repelled and the devolution minutes refused. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, Lord Bracadale took the somewhat unusual step of issuing a note, setting forth his reasons for repelling the preliminary pleas and detailing his directions given to the jury with respect to media publicity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2011HCJ001.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution was led by [[Alex Prentice]] QC, his junior was David Nicolson.

Initially, Sheridan hired [[Donald Findlay]] QC to defend him, but he later dropped him in favour of [[Maggie Scott, Lady Scott|Margaret Scott]] QC, who represented [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] in an appeal against his conviction for the [[Lockerbie bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8274218.stm|work=BBC News|title=Sheridan drops Findlay from team|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Junior counsel for Sheridan was Shelagh McCall. Gail was represented by [[Paul McBride]] QC and Billy Lavelle, her solicitor was John Paul Mowbray.

On 11 October it was announced that Sheridan had dismissed Margaret Scott, and would conduct his own defence.  He retained his solicitor [[Aamer Anwar]], who the judge appointed as [[amicus curiae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Tommy-Sheridan-to-keep-his.6576022.jp Tommy Sheridan to keep his own counsel – The Scotsman].

The full trial started on 4 October 2010 at the Glasgow [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]] before [[Alastair Campbell, Lord Bracadale|Lord Bracadale]], with a jury of 13 women and 2 men, mostly younger women with one ethnic minority juror.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Criminal trials in Scotland have a jury of 15 with verdicts by simple majority, see [[Trial by jury in Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 December the judge excused one of the women jurors from serving further, the trial continued with 14 jurors.

On 25 November and again on 2 and 20 December the prosecution removed a number of charges from the indictment.

===Prosecution case===
An important issue was the crucial SSP executive meeting of 9 November 2004, where Sheridan resigned as convenor.  16 witnesses who were present claimed that he did admit to visiting Cupids sex club in Manchester at this meeting.&lt;ref name=BBC1Nov&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11665378 BBC News – Witness claims Tommy Sheridan court win was 'OJ moment'].

An important piece of evidence was a tape which was filmed secretly a few days after this meeting, showing Sheridan making a "foul-mouthed tirade" containing statements inconsistent with his evidence in the civil trial.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian report 11 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under cross-examination [[Alan McCombes]] denied scripting the video, as alleged by Sheridan.&lt;ref name=BBC1Nov/&gt; [[Bob Bird]], Scottish editor of the ''News of the World'', gave evidence about how the paper acquired the tape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11742674 BBC News – Newspaper editor 'stripped to see Tommy Sheridan tape'].

Katrine Trolle, a Danish woman who was the SSP candidate in [[Aberdeen North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen North]] in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003]], claimed that she had had an affair with Sheridan (on one occasion in the bedroom in his home in Glasgow) and visited Cupids sex club with him on 27 September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11609852 Tommy Sheridan 'was not at festival' in Glasgow] BBC News 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by a former housemate of Trolle and her ex-boyfriend who claimed that Sheridan spent the night with Trolle at her home in Dundee.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Times'' 27 October&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Clark (Scottish footballer)|Gary Clark]], a former professional footballer and childhood friend of Sheridan, claimed to have visited a club in Manchester with Sheridan which showed pornographic videos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11621123 BBC News – Tommy Sheridan 'attended porn TV club in Manchester'].

The final chapter of the prosecution case involved a sex party which Sheridan allegedly attended at the Moat House Hotel in Glasgow. All charges related to this matter were dropped following Crown witness Matt McColl's testimony and cross examination. During his appearance in court he was warned for contempt of court due to his reluctance to name his then girlfriend and now wife, as well as agreeing he had previously told police that Mr Sheridan had not been at the Moat House.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11829888 BBC News – Witness in 'omission over seeing Tommy Sheridan'].

===Defence case===
The defence opened its case on 3 December, both Sheridans declined to act as a witnesses themselves.  Many of the witnesses called by Sheridan were members of [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]], his own party, including [[Hugh Kerr]], [[Rosemary Byrne]] and [[Mike Gonzalez (historian)|Mike Gonzalez]].  He also called [[Andy Coulson]], Downing Street director of communications and former ''News of the World'' editor, who denied that he had any knowledge of phone hacking at the ''News of the World'', or that he knew [[Glenn Mulcaire]], the private detective at the centre of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/09/andy-coulson-phone-hacking-sheridan Guardian 9 December&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] had briefed Sheridan's team about alleged phone hacking a few days earlier.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

[[Image:Court entrance - geograph.org.uk - 495852.jpg|thumb|Glasgow High Court, where the trial took place]]
Four witnesses who were present at the crucial SSP executive meeting of 9 November 2004 claimed that Sheridan did ''not'' admit to visiting a sex club at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11674631 BBC News – Court hears Tommy Sheridan denied sex club claims].

===Summations===
Alex Prentice gave his closing speech on 20 December.  Sheridan gave his closing speech on 21–22 December, Lord Bracadale gave his summing-up, the jury then retired to consider their verdict and were later sent home for the night.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12020014 BBC News – Gail Sheridan cleared of perjury charges]. Bbc.co.uk (2010-12-17). Retrieved on 2011-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict===
On 23 December the jury found Sheridan guilty of five of the six outstanding charges of perjury, by majority verdict.  The only one where they acquitted him was lying about his alleged affair with Anvar Khan, they also deleted the mention of lying about having sex with Katrine Trolle in his home.  He was bailed pending background reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Sheridan found guilty of perjury|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12059037|accessdate=23 December 2010|newspaper=BBC website|date=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bail"&gt;{{cite news|title = Tommy Sheridan guilty of perjury|work = Independent|date = 2010-12-23|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tommy-sheridan-guilty-of-perjury-2168111.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Image:HMP Barlinnie.jpg|thumb|HM Prison Barlinnie, where Sheridan began his sentence]]
After the trial, the Crown Office issued a statement saying that no further action would be taken against six other people charged with perjury in relation to the civil trial, five of Sheridan's associates (see above) and Fiona McGuire.  Two witnesses who clashed with the judge avoided punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Scottish Sun'' 24 December&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheridan stated that he may appeal, possibly over trial judge's decision to stop Scottish comic [[Des McLean (comedian)|Des McLean]], who previously impersonated Sheridan on the radio, from giving evidence, and on the grounds of the failure of the ''News of the World'' to hand over crucial e-mails to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Tommy Sheridan in bid to quash quilty verdict|work = Scotland on Sunday|date = 2010-12-28|url = http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/news/Tommy-Sheridan-in-bid-to.6671597.jp?articlepage=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He may produce three new witnesses to give him an alibi for the date when he was supposed to be at Cupids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Tommy Sheridan finds new witnesses to bolster appeal|work = Scotland on Sunday|date = 2011-01-07|url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/Tommy-Sheridan-finds-new-witnesses.6682497.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; although doubts have been expressed about one person's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Sheridan's appeal in disarray as doubts arise over witness|work = The Herald|date = 2011-01-08|url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/news/crime-courts/sheridan-s-appeal-in-disarray-as-doubts-arise-over-witness-1.1078711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Scotland]] broadcast a radio drama based on the trial, with [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]] as Tommy Sheridan, [[Karen Dunbar]] as Gail, and [[Julie Wilson Nimmo]] as Katrine Trolle.&lt;ref&gt;Deanie, Marc.

On 24 December 2010, Tommy Sheridan lodged an intimation of intention to appeal against his conviction. In June 2011, leave to appeal was refused by a single judge at the first sift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Rejects Sheridan Bid for an Appeal|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/judge-rejects-sheridan-bid-for-an-appeal-1.1108146|newspaper=Evening Times|date=23 June 2011|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herald 23 June&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was appealed to a bench of three judges.

In the light of the [[News of the World phone hacking affair]], the Crown Office instructed the Strathclyde Police to reassess the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Kirsty|title=Evidence in Tommy Sheridan trial to be investigated amid phone-hacking revelations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/07/tommy-sheridan-evidence-investigated-phone-hacking|accessdate=7 July 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Simon|title=Phone hacking former News of the World editor Andy Coulson faces perjury investigation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8623072/Phone-hacking-former-News-of-the-World-editor-Andy-Coulson-faces-perjury-investigation.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However [[Paul McBride]] stated that he did not believe that this affair had any bearing on Sheridan's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NoW scandal "does not affect" Tommy Sheridan conviction|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14098176|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complaint submitted to Strathclyde Police in July 2011 led to [[Operation Rubicon]], a major investigation involving 50 officers investigating allegations of phone hacking, breach of data protection and perjury by News of the World.

[[Alex Prentice]] has continued his legal career, twice winning a murder conviction without a body in 2012.  [[Paul McBride]] died suddenly in early 2012.  A few people involved in the case were candidates in the [[Scottish council elections, 2012|May 2012 Glasgow City Council election]]: Gail Sheridan, and [[Frances Curran]] and Joyce Drummond who were witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow City Council website&lt;/ref&gt;

There have since been a few books written on the case: ''Downfall'' by [[Alan McCombes]], ''Tommy Sheridan: From Hero to Zero? A Political Biography'' by [[Gregor Gall]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpgb.org.uk/article.php?article_id=1004849 review of Gall's biography&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Parcel of Rogues'' by Jim Monaghan.

On 30 May 2012 Andy Coulson was charged with perjury in relation to this case.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18262740 BBC 30 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2012 Douglas Wight was charged with various offences in relation to the case, and [[Bob Bird]] was charged with various offences in relation to the earlier civil case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19409581 BBC 29 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 2015, Coulson [[HM Advocate v Coulson|was acquitted]] after the case against him was dismissed by a judge. The cases against Wight and Bird were also dropped without coming to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carrell|first1=Severin|title=Andy Coulson cleared of perjury as Scottish court case collapses|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/andy-coulson-cleared-of-perjury-in-scottish-court|accessdate=4 June 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2012 it was reported that Lothian and Borders Police had referred a police officer who interrogated Gail Sheridan to the Procurator Fiscal, on the basis that criminal offences may have been committed during one of her interviews.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/inquiry-into-police-conduct-at-gail-sheridan-s-interview-welcomed-1-2423438&lt;/ref&gt;

A play about the case, ''I, Tommy'', has had three runs in Scotland, the third with [[Rosie Kane]] playing herself.

In 2015 the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] declined to refer the case to the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/sheridans-fight-against-perjury-conviction-suffers-setback.124974706&lt;/ref&gt;

ISBN, 1881283046, 9781881283041 p148 "Joel's Nineteenth Law: Said in the name of Rabbi Yosi Gordon: Be an advocate of Hebglish (or if you prefer, Engbrew), the new "Yiddish" which is emerging around English rather than German. Use as many real Hebrew nouns in your English conversation as possible.   So let's talk about our version of "Eskimo Snow." While we know that all "Jewish" (Hebrew) words are good because they enhance identity and transmit culture, building a tikkun olam vocabulary is a triple whammy. a. It does all the "cultural uniqueness" stuff. Having a Jewish language.. "&lt;/ref&gt; [[portmanteau]]x combining the words "[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]" and "[[English language|English]]", is a [[slang]] term for a [[macaronic]] combination of the two languages, or [[code-switching]] between them in the same conversation or writing. This may be as a result of poor knowledge of one language or the other or both, or may be usage for introducing a humorous effect.

Hebglish usually consists of either filling in gaps in one's knowledge of Hebrew with English words,  speaking Hebrew in such a manner that (although ostensibly "Hebrew") would be incomprehensible to a Hebrew language speaker who does not also have a working knowledge of English.

It is also used in [[multilingualism|bilingual]] songs in Hebrew and English for appealing to audiences not proficient in Hebrew within Israel or internationally.

Other terms are used, some connecting with Yiddish rather than with Hebrew, and code-switching may be for representation of religious or cultural affiliation in speech, rather than language transfer reasons.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Walt Wolfram, Ben Ward ''American voices: how dialects differ from coast to coast'' Walden / Blackwell 9781405121095; 2002, 2006  Page 251 "Yinglish, Yidgin English, Yidlish, Yiddiglish, Ameridish, Anglish, Heblish, Engdish, Engliddish, Engbrew, Englibrew, Jewish English, Jewish Dialect, Frumspeak, Yeshivish, Hebonics: all of these terms have been used to name a variety of English spoken by Jews in the United States. ... those who identify closely with religious and cultural aspects of Jewish life often represent their affiliation in speech."&lt;/ref&gt;

Homelessness Research in Europe: Festschrift for Bill Edgar and Joe Doherty (2010): 19-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The three countries have very similar definitions of homelessness, with minor variations.&lt;ref&gt;Benjaminsen, Lars, and Evelyn Dyb. "The Effectiveness of Homeless Policies–Variations among the Scandinavian Countries." European Journal of Homelessness 2 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers maintain that measures to counteract homelessness in Sweden are largely dependent on a general premise equating homelessness with addiction, mental illness and deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Löfstrand, Cecilia Hansen. "Reforming the work to combat long-term homelessness in Sweden." Acta Sociologica 53, no. 1 (2010): 19-34.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, youth homelessness is considered a child protection problem.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Karen, Tommy Lundström, and Marie Sallnäs. "A comparison of out-of-home care for children and young people in Australia and Sweden: Worlds apart?." Australian Social Work 64, no. 4 (2011): 416-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street newspapers==
[[File:Situation Sthlm vendor Stockholm.jpg|thumb|Street newspaper vendor in Stockholm]]
There are several [[street newspaper]]s in Sweden. ''[[Situation Sthlm]]'',&lt;ref name="Holender"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=547043 |title=De hemlösas tidningar prisades |last=Holender |first=Robert |date=2006-05-22 |work=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-02-11 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1995 and was Sweden's only street newspaper until ''[[Faktum]]'' and ''[[Aluma (street paper)|Aluma]]'' were founded early in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web | last=Boukhari | first=Sophie | title=The press takes to the street | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001149/114969e.pdf | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | work=[[The UNESCO Courier]] | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the three street newspapers were awarded the grand prize of Publicistklubben ([[Swedish Publicists' Association]]).&lt;ref name="Holender" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/arkiv.asp?DagensDatum=2006-05-22&amp;Artikel=863076 |title=Röster åt utsatta fick publicistpris |date=2006-05-22 |work=[[Ekot]] |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614004653/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/arkiv.asp?DagensDatum=2006-05-22&amp;Artikel=863076 |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a Swedish tech company created software for the homeless newspaper vendors to accept credit card payments via a mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/izettle-mobile-payments-homeless-sweden|title=Stockholm's homeless now accept payments - by debit card|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=18 October 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
In 2015, a Swedish art exhibition at [[Malmö Konsthall]] titled “The Alien Within: A Living Laboratory of Western Society” included two homeless people from Romania. The homeless people were not accepting money from visitors but were paid at hourly rate by the event organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/are-homeless-people-exploited-in-swedish-art-installation-239872|title=Are Homeless People Exploited in Swedish Art Installation? - artnet News|date=2 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Researchers have found that excess mortality among homeless men and women in Stockholm is entirely related to alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Beijer, Ulla, Sven Andreasson, Gunnar Ågren, and Anna Fugelstad. "Mortality and causes of death among homeless women and men in Stockholm." Scandinavian journal of public health 39, no. 2 (2011): 121-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have conducted studies on the oral health of homeless people in Sweden and found that they have fewer remaining teeth than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Patricia, Lars Frithiof, Lena Persson, Björn Klinge, Jan Halldin, and Ulla Beijer. "Oral health of homeless adults in Stockholm, Sweden." Acta Odontologica Scandinavica 63, no. 1 (2005): 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_universal_declaration_of_human_rights_10_December_1948.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Human rights laws in the BVI are based upon the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (pictured).]]
In practice, basic [[human rights]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] (BVI) appear to be respected.  Reports of repression of [[freedom of speech]], interference with [[democracy]] or the [[rule of law]], and arbitrary arrest and [[torture]] are generally unknown. The BVI have been described as “generally free of human rights abuses.”  

However, the [[Law of the British Virgin Islands|laws in the British Virgin Islands]] do openly [[Discrimination|discriminate]] against people who do not hold what is called “[[belonger status]].” This form of discrimination is expressly preserved in the [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|BVI constitution]], which excludes non-belongers from the full scope of its non-discrimination protections.  Belongers and non-belongers share unequal rights to employment and to the right to purchase property, and in certain cases non-belongers are made subject to higher rates of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;For example, under the Land and House Tax Act (Cap 207) belongers pay land tax assessed at US$3 for the first acre of land; non-belongers pay US$50 for the first half-acre of land.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, expats in certain professions, their families and children, are subject to exploitation and abuse which their status makes it more difficult for them to challenge.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/concern-raised-about-tension-abuse-of-expats-in-bvi/ |title=Concern raised about tension, abuse of expats in BVI |publisher=BVI News |date=24 April 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional human rights protections==

Human rights in the British Virgin Islands are codified in the 2007 [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/contents/made|title=British Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 9 of the constitution is entitled ''Fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual'', and provides:
{{cquote|Whereas every person in the Virgin Islands is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual;

Whereas those fundamental rights and freedoms are enjoyed without distinction of any kind, such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, association with a national minority, property, family relations, economic status, disability, age, birth, sexual orientation, marital or other status, subject only to prescribed limitations;

Whereas it is recognised that those fundamental rights and freedoms apply, subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest, to each and all of the following, namely—

(a)	life, equality, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law;

(b)	freedom of conscience, expression, movement, assembly and association; and

(c)	protection for private and family life, the privacy of the home and other property and from deprivation of property save in the public interest and on payment of fair compensation;

Now, therefore, it is declared that the subsequent provisions of this Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to the aforesaid rights and freedoms, and to related rights and freedoms, subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in those provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the protected rights and freedoms by any individual does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.}}

The subsequent sections of the constitution enumerate and elaborate on certain specific basic human rights, including the right to life, equality before the law, protection from inhuman treatment, protection from slavery and forced labour, the right of prisoners to humane treatment, freedom of movement, freedom of conscience, the right to education, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and association.

==Human Rights Commission==

The constitution also provides for the formation of a Human Rights Commission to oversee and ensure the protection of human rights, although to date no such commission has been formed.

In 2017 legislation was introduced in the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands]] to provide for a Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/dont-rush-it-human-rights-bill-introduced/ |title=‘Don’t rush it’ – Human rights bill introduced |publisher=BVI News |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the legislative process became delayed when [[Hurricane Irma]] struck the Territory and the Bill has not yet been passed into law.

==Human rights in the criminal code==

The [[British Virgin Islands Criminal Code]] creates certain specific [[criminal law|criminal offences]] relating to human rights, such as [[genocide]], but does not contain any general statement of human rights.

==Orders-in-council==

Although the BVI have their own constitution and laws, the United Kingdom government retains sovereign power over the islands, and from time to time has exercised that power by issuing so-called “orders-in-council” that have imposed certain laws upon the BVI, including human rights protections, the spirit of which is contrary to the desires of the majority of BVI residents. For example, the UK abolished the BVI's death penalty for murder in 1991, and decriminalised homosexuality on the islands in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human rights in BVI|url=http://ukinbvi.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/uk-in-bvi/human-rights-in-bvi/|work=HM Governor's Office in the British Virgin Islands|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights conventions and covenants==

The following UN human rights conventions and covenants apply to the BVI:
United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination,
1965 (CERD)
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 (ICESCR)
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 (ICCPR)
United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women, 1979 (CEDAW)
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989 (CRC)

[[File:European_Court_of_Human_Rights.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The European Convention of Human rights applies in the BVI, but there is no right of petition to [[European Court of Human Rights|the court]] (pictured).]]
The [[Judiciary of the British Virgin Islands|British Virgin Islands courts]] have also held that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] applies in the Territory through the jurisdiction's constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Union Zone Management Limited'' (BVIHC (Com) 2011/0126).&lt;/ref&gt;  However the applicability is limited in that it does not include any [[Territorial scope of European Convention on Human Rights|right of petition or any of the extant protocols]].

==HRRCC==

The BVI government established the Human Rights Reporting Coordinating Committee (HRRCC) in 1999 to monitor and report on human rights conditions on the islands. Since 2001, the HRRCC has also published pamphlets, held public meetings, and pursued other means of informing the people of BVI about their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean Development Bank|url=http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/economics-statistics/country-poverty-assessment-reports/BVI.vol1.pdf|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belonger status and human rights==

A citizen of the BVI is known as a BOTC, or [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]. Since the passing of the British Overseas Territories Act, 2002 citizens of the BVI are also British citizens with a right to hold British passports and to work in the [[United Kingdom]] and wider [[European Union]].

In addition to citizenship, however, there is a separate concept in the BVI that goes by the name of “[[Belonger status|belonger]].”  The definition of "belonger" status is complex, and is set out in article 2(2) of the Constitution, which provides:

:For the purposes of this Constitution, a person belongs to the Virgin Islands if that person—
::(a) is born in the Virgin Islands and at the time of the birth his or her father or mother is or was—
:::(i) a British overseas territories citizen (or a British Dependent Territories citizen) by virtue of birth, registration or naturalisation in the Virgin Islands or by virtue of descent from a father or mother who was born in the Virgin Islands; or
:::(ii) settled in the Virgin Islands; and for this purpose “settled” means ordinarily resident in the Virgin Islands without being subject under the law in force in the Virgin Islands to any restriction on the period for which he or she may remain, but does not include persons on contract with the Government of the Virgin Islands or any statutory body or Crown corporation;
::(b) is born in the Virgin Islands of a father or mother who belongs to the Virgin Islands by birth or descent or who, if deceased, would, if alive, so belong to the Virgin Islands;
::(c) is a child adopted in the Virgin Islands by a person who belongs to the Virgin Islands by birth or descent;
::(d) is born outside the Virgin Islands of a father or mother who is a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of birth in the Virgin Islands or descent from a father or mother who was born in the Virgin Islands or who belongs to the Virgin Islands by virtue of birth in the Virgin Islands or descent from a father or mother who was born in the Virgin Islands;
::(e) is a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of registration in the Virgin Islands;
::(f) is a person to whom a certificate has been granted under section 16 of the Immigration and Passport Act 1977 of the Virgin Islands (in this subsection referred to as “the Act”, and references to the Act or to any section thereof include references to any enactment amending, replacing or re-enacting the same) and has not been revoked under section 17 of the Act; and (without prejudice to the right of any person to apply for the grant of such a certificate under the Act) a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of naturalisation in the Virgin Islands has a right by virtue of this Constitution to apply for the grant of such a certificate;
::(g) is the spouse of a person who belongs to the Virgin Islands and has been granted a certificate under section 16 of the Act; or
::(h) was immediately before the commencement of this Constitution deemed to belong to the Virgin Islands by virtue of the Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order 1976(a).
A "non-belonger" simply means any person who is not a belonger.

It is also possible for non-belongers and non-BOTCs to obtain a lesser status known as "residency".  This exempts the holder of residency status from the requirement to obtain a work permit in relation to employment and from the requirement to obtain a land-holding licence if they wish to purchase property.  However having residency status does not entitle a person to vote or to hold a British Virgin Islands passport.

===Belonger status and the right to work===

While belongers have an automatic right to work on the islands, non-belongers, as a rule, require work permits. Under the Labour Code 2010, a prospective employer faced with choosing between a belonger who is minimally qualified for the job and a non-belonger who has far higher qualifications must choose the belonger.  Non-belongers are not permitted to remain in the BVI unless they are working and have a work permit. Such permits must be renewed every year.  A non-belonger who changes jobs must apply for a new work permit, which the Commissioner of Labour may or may not choose to grant.  

Non-belongers in relatively unskilled jobs undergo various kinds of abuse and exploitation, including being forced to pay for the renewal of their work permits and being denied new work permits for prospective new jobs.  

The lack of unions for non-belonger workers in many areas restricts their ability to complain effectively about mistreatment.

===Belonger status and the right to buy property===

While belongers have an automatic right to buy property on the islands, non-belongers may purchase property only after the seller has undergone an extensive process of demonstrating that he or she has made a serious but unsuccessful effort to find a belonger interested in buying the property. Also, any belonger wanting to buy property is subject to an investigation by authorities before the sale may go through. In addition, permission for the non-belonger to buy a piece of property may be subject to certain conditions, such as a ban on renting out the property.

===The acquisition of belonger status===

Since 2001, it has become more difficult under BVI law to acquire belonger status. 

A person born in the BVI with one or two belonger parents is automatically considered a belonger and is also a BOTC. 

Persons born in the BVI before 1983 are considered belongers and BOTC. Persons born in the BVI in 2001 or later to parents who are not under Immigration Department control are belongers and BOTC.

Persons born in the BVI before 2001 to parents who are Commonwealth citizens are considered belongers. 

A person born in the BVI to a BOTC mother or (legitimately) to a BOTC father is considered a BOTC but not necessarily a belonger. A person who enjoys BOTC status by virtue of parentage but who was not born in the BVI is not necessarily a belonger.

A person born or resident in the BVI who does not fall into any of the above categories is not considered a belonger or a BOTC and is regarded as a temporary immigrant, although belongership and BOTC can be acquired through marriage or application, as described below. 

Non-belonger women married to men who are belongers by birth, immediate descent,
or naturalisation, or who received a belonger certificate between 1967 and 2001, also become belongers, unless they were divorced before 2001. 

A non-belonger who married a belonger in 2001 or later may apply for belonger status after five years of marriage and BVI residence in the BVI.  Persons who have spent a year or more in prison for committing a criminal offense are denied this status in such cases, however.   

Non-belonger individuals who wish to acquire permanent resident status (that is, to hold a Certificate of Residence), must apply to the Immigration Department. The ensuing bureaucratic process may take years.

An individual over age 18 who was born in or is a resident of the BVI may apply to the governor for belonger status after living in the BVI for at least 10 years and holding a certificate of residence for at least one year.  The governor has no obligation to confer belonger status in such situations.  

A person who has not been under Immigration Department control for at least one year and who has lived in the BVI for at least five years (three if married to a BOTC) may apply to the governor for BOTC status, which would also carry with it belonger status.

The minor children of parents who have been granted a certificate of residence or belonger status may also be granted the same status as their parents.

==LGBT rights==
{{Main|LGBT rights in the British Virgin Islands}}
The rights of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people in the British Virgin Islands are relatively restricted as compared with their rights in most Western countries, including the United Kingdom. Before 2000, the BVI criminal code considered “[[buggery]]” a crime. Same-sex activity was decriminalised in that year by an Order in Council by the British government, which acted only under pressure from the EU and UN and against the wishes of the majority of BVI residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain amends Territory,s Laws and decriminalises homosexuality in compliance with Human Rights Conventions|url=http://www.islandsun.com/archives/2000-December/211200/local3-v4i35.html|work=The Island sun|accessdate=December 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713064306/http://www.islandsun.com/archives/2000-December/211200/local3-v4i35.html|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights efforts==

The office of the governor of the BVI organised a week-long program on “Building Human Rights Capacity” in July 2011, intended to improve the understanding and observance of human rights on the part of government officials, law-enforcement officers, immigration officials, and private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in BVI|url=http://ukinbvi.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/uk-in-bvi/human-rights-in-bvi/|work=HM Governor's office|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group Related by Humanity seeks “to promote Human Rights awareness in the Territory of the Virgin Islands.” On December 10, 2011, it organized the islands' first official celebration of International Human Rights Day in hope that greater awareness could be brought to this very real and harrowing issue.

==Human rights incidents==

Recent reports of human rights incidents in the BVI.
* In 2017 various high risk prisoners were transferred to [[Bordelais Correctional Facility]] in [[Saint Lucia|St. Lucia]] after the prison in the BVI was damaged in [[Hurricane Irma]].  The prisoners complained about being so far removed from their families and violations of their human rights.  Those complaints were rejected by Government officials in the BVI and in St Lucia.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/human-rights-concerns-raised-for-prisoners-in-st-lucia/ |title=Human rights concerns raised for prisoners in St Lucia |publisher=BVI News |date=2 November 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2017 [[UNICEF]] published a controversial report on the state of the British Virgin Islands, which included criticism of discrimination against expats in the Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bvinews.com/new/unicef-report-sparks-fiery-debate-in-bvi/ |title=UNICEF report sparks fiery debate in BVI |publisher=BVI News |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: At the rankings, the highest index reports most democracy. 167 countries participated in the ranking, North Korea was worst (index 1,08) and Norway was best (index 9,93).

[[Freedom House]]'s annual survey of political rights and civil liberties, Freedom in the World 2001-2002, reported that civil liberties declined ''due to the shooting deaths of Palestinian civilians by Palestinian security personnel; the summary trials and executions of alleged collaborators by the Palestinian Authority (PA); extrajudicial killings of suspected collaborators by militias; and the apparent official encouragement of Palestinian youths to confront Israeli soldiers, thus placing them directly in harm's way.''&lt;ref name=FITW2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2002&amp;country=2559 |title=Freedom in the World 2002: Country Reports—Palestinian Authority-Administered Territories |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]] reports ''everyday disagreements and clashes between the various political factions, families and cities that a complete picture of Palestinian society is painted. These divisions have during the course of the al Aqsa Intifada also led to an increasingly violent 'Intra'fada'.&lt;ref name=Regular1204&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/11-of-palestinians-killed-by-other-palestinians-study-shows-1.119390 |title=11% of Palestinians killed by other Palestinians, study shows |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]'' |date=April 12, 2004 |last=Regular |first=Arnon |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrmg.org/intrafada.htm |title=The Intra'fada |publisher=[[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]]|date=April 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606055755/http://www.phrmg.org/intrafada.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2004 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual freedoms and rights==

===Freedom of speech===
The PA has guaranteed [[freedom of assembly]] to the Palestinian population, and its Legislation states this.  Nevertheless,  the right to demonstrate for opponents of the PA regime or of PA policy has become increasingly subject to police control and restriction and is a source of concern for human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

February 2016, [[Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]] has issued report documenting [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] violations in both [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza strip]]. The Euro-Med report, "Strangulation Twice: the Oppressive Practices of [[Palestinian Security Services]]," documents 1,274 arbitrary [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]] in the West Bank in 2015 and 1,089 summonses to appear in front of the police or “interior security.” Most of these actions by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] targeted individuals affiliated with [[Hamas]] or who opposed PA policies. In Gaza, 117 arbitrary detentions and 98 orders to appear were attributed last year to Hamas, which governs the Strip. Like their PA counterparts, the security forces primarily targeted political opponents. The monitor said that the number of [[human rights]] violations committed by PA authorities in the West Bank were significantly greater than those for which Hamas was responsible. However, both organizations are guilty of censorship and oppression. The Euro-Med monitor called both sides, the PA and Hamas, to issue a clear and binding resolution mandating freedom of expression and prohibiting all forms of abusive detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In August 2016, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report about [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] discussing the [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] in the [[Palestinian territories]]. The international organization documented the case of Majd Khawaja, 22, who was arrested by [[security forces]] at intelligence headquarter.  Khawaja was  accused of painting the word ([[intifada]]) uprising on a wall, having weapons and planning to smuggle people into [[Jordan]]. He was subjected to physical torture during interrogation. He published some songs about the [[corruption]] of the PA which considered as a [[criminal offense]]; The songs were removed from [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/29/palestine-crackdown-journalists-activists|title=Palestine: Crackdown on Journalists, Activists|date=2016-08-30|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 2016, Euro Med Human Rights Monitors issued a report regarding the violation of [[human rights]] and the international law in Palestine. As the three lawmakers were staging a sit- in at the office of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|international committee of the Red Cross]], their parliamentary immunity was suspended by the Palestinian president- [[Mahmoud Abbas]]; two of them are accused of embezzlement, weapons smuggling and defamation; as well as they were prevented from the delivery of food, water and visits by journalists. The three lawmakers instead stated that the president committed this as a revenge against them due to their alliance with [[Mohammed Dahlan|Mohammad Dahalan]].  According to the report, breaking the international committee of the Red Cross were considered as a violation of the international laws and conventions.The [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian authority]]'s action was also in direct contradiction of the Palestinian executive system and its commitment to human rights standards as dictated by international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1654|title=PA abrogates human rights by forcing MPs to leave Red Cross office|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Mezan Center for Human Rights|Al-Mizan Center for Human Rights]] published a report about violating the right of expression in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Since the beginning of winter, the electricity cuts began to worsen more, which has negatively impacted on providing the two-million population basic needs. The electricity came on for four hours, followed by a 12-hour blackout. Due to the Israel's closure borders, there was a lack of fuel on the markets in Gaza as well as the humanitarian crisis got much worse: increasing the numbers of deaths, particularly among children and  suffering the notably older, sick and disabled people living in the hundreds of high-rise building without elevator. As a protest against this bad life, on 12 January 2017, most of the thousands of people were gathered in [[Jabalia Camp|Jabaliya]] refugee camp to demonstrate in front of the Electricity Company. Yet, the police separated them by shooting in the air and beating some people with cudgels. Accordingly, Mohammed Al Baba, a journalist at Agence France Presse, was sustained a cut over his left eye and his camera was seized as well as Fares Akram Al Ghoul, a journalist from the Associated Press, was assaulted by them. There are also six other people sustained bruises. As mentioned in the report, the police summoned groups of people for questioning and broke into houses to arrest people with a view of forcing them to sign an unclear documents committing themselves to “respecting the law” and to prevent them from disturbing so called "public security" despite their violating of the Gaza population's right to protest in peaceful way and give their expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mezan.org/en/post/21740/Al+Mezan+Calls+for:+Solution+to+Electricity+Crisis,+End+to+Detention+for+Peaceful+Assembly+and+Immediate+Release+of+Detainees|title=Al Mezan Calls for: Solution to Electricity Crisis, End to Detention for Peaceful Assembly and Immediate Release of Detainees|work=EuroPal Forum|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of the press===
As of 2006, sixteen Palestinian journalists have been killed or wounded by PA security forces or armed groups.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|date=September 19, 2006|title= Gunmen attack Wafa office in Gaza|author=KHALED ABU TOAMEH|publisher=Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=35389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah Issa, Palestinian publisher and editor of the on-line magazine ''Donia al Watan'' was detained in July 2006 by the Palestinian Authority for publishing a story about the theft of $400,000 from PA Foreign Minister [[Mahmoud Zahar]] while visiting [[Kuwait]]. The story cast aspersions on Hamas for having large amounts of cash while the Palestinian people were suffering from poverty.  This story had appeared elsewhere in the Arabic media.  Issa, accused Zahar and Hamas of interfering with freedom of the press in the Palestinian territories and expressed disappointment with Hamas's failure to reign in corruption as promised in their election platform: "Our people have the right to hold Hamas accountable for the deterioration in their living conditions,...We were hoping that the Hamas government would start chasing and arresting all the murderers and thugs who continue to roam the streets of the Gaza Strip and to open all the cases of financial corruption."  ''Donia al Watan'''s offices have been attacked by masked gunmen and there have been death threats against Issa and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PA detains Gazan editor for 'libel'| author= Khaled Abu Toameh |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/PA-detains-Gazan-editor-for-libel |accessdate=July 30, 2006}}h&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] has been blamed for a number of attacks on journalists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Arab television station [[Al-Arabiya]]'s West Bank offices.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In September 2001, Yasser Arafat's [[Tanzim]] kidnapped a Palestinian cameraman who shot film showing Palestinian citizens and police in Ramallah celebrating on 9/11/2001 following the attacks on US targets, and threatened to kill the cameraman if the item the film was shown on air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, a journalist was severely beaten and all the computer equipment in the office of the Palestinian Authority's official news agency [[Wafa]]. Graffiti was sprayed on the wall accusing the agency of a lack of objectivity.  [[Fatah]] officials noted that PA Foreign Minister [[Mahmoud Zahar]] has accused the agency "of waging a {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated campaign of incitement" against him and blamed [[Hamas]] for the attack. [[Khan Yunis]] governor Osama al-Farra condemned the attack, saying it, "reflected the continued state of anarchy and lawlessness in PA-controlled areas".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

The [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]] has further limited the freedom of the press in the PNA territories and the distribution of opposing voices in Hamas-controlled Gaza and the West Bank where Fatah still has more influence. In July 2010, with the easing of the [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of the Gaza Strip]], Israel allowed the distribution of the pro-Fatah newspapers ''[[Al-Quds (newspaper)|al Quds]]'', ''[[Al-Ayyam (Ramallah)|al Ayyam]]'' and ''[[al-Hayat al-Jadida]]'' to Gaza, but Hamas prevented Gazan distributors from retrieving the shipment. The [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]] (PCHR) condemned the Hamas restrictions of distribution of the West Bank newspapers in Gaza, and also condemned the Fatah-led government in the West Bank for restricting publication and distribution of the Gazan newspapers ''[[al-Resala]]'' and ''[[Filastin (newspaper)|Falastin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Repercussions of Fragmentation: Prevention of Publication and Distribution of Palestinian Newspapers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip| url=http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6821:latest-repercussions-of-fragmentation-prevention-of-publication-and-distribution-of-palestinian-newspapers-in-the-west-bank-and-the-gaza-strip-&amp;catid=131:new |accessdate=12 July 2010}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}h&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate appealed for the release of Palestinian journalists arrested by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, warning that freedom of the press had "seriously deteriorated," and that the Palestinian Authority had arrested five Palestinian journalists in September 2012.  Walid Khaled, a journalist for the Palestinian newspaper Falasteen, began a hunger strike in September as well.  A Palestinian judge ordered his release, but the Palestinian Authority has ignored this.  The Palestinian Authority has arrested these journalists on suspicisions of having connections to [[Hamas]], a rival which controls the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="JPost freedom of press"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=287667 | title=Palestinian group to PA: Release jailed journalists | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=October 13, 2012 | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | author=Abu Toameh, Khaled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Al-Jazeera journalist Muhammed Fayyad was reportedly assaulted by multiple police officers while covering a Turkish minister's visit to the Gazan Ministry of Endowments. Fayyad, who said he "was struck on the head by a police officer" as he was ejected from the building, was later arrested. Gaza's Ministry of Internal Affairs released a statement that faulted "some journalists" for "chaos and a disturbance that misrepresented our people's image and embarrassed those responsible for the visit's agenda," and claimed that Fayyad was released pending further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gaza police assault and arrest Al-Jazeera journalist |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Gaza-police-assault-and-arrest-al-Jazeera-journalist-403500 |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades-old [[PGFTU - Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions|Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU)]], which claims to represent all Palestinian workers, was incorporated into the PA upon its inception. Independent unionists assert the PGFTU lacks in internal democracy and transparency, and is dominated by Fateh (all of its general secretaries and most of its unit heads have come from Fateh). In a 2007 press release carried by the Advocacy Project, DWRC noted that internal elections had not been held since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacynet.org/resource/966 Independent Palestinian Unions Establish New Coalition in Drive for Worker Democracy, July 31, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724232349/http://advocacynet.org/resource/966 |date=July 24, 2008 }}, accessed 28 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These critiques have been supported by scholars Joost Hiltermann,&lt;ref&gt;Joost R.

According to the PGFTU, in June 2007 Hamas seized their headquarters and ordered PGFTU staff to discuss how they were to operate under Hamas rule. According to the PGFTU general secretary, the PGFTU's refusal to negotiate led Hamas to attempt to assassinate Rasem Al Bayari, the union's deputy general secretary, three times thereafter.

===Freedom of property ownership===
In the Palestinian National Authority, [[Palestinian land laws|selling land to Jews]] is a crime punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, PA arrest 2 Palestinians for selling Hebron house to Jews, Avi Issacharoff and Nadav Shragai, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/jordan-pa-arrest-2-palestinians-for-selling-hebron-house-to-jews-1.217018 Haaretz] 30.03.07&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
Many Jewish and Christian holy sites remain in areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority.  Under the [[Oslo Accords]], both the Palestinians and Israel agreed to respect and protect religious rights of Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Samaritans by a) protecting the Holy Sites, 2) providing free access to the Holy Sites, and assuring freedom of worship and practice.
a. Protection of the Holy Sites;
b. Free access to the Holy Sites; and
c. Freedom of worship and practice.
The PA, however, has in some cases failed to honor these commitments (see sections below).

A Christian leader claimed that there were "rampant reports" of abuses and persecution in PA-run areas. Anti-Christian riots were reported in [[Ramallah]] and surrounding villages, as well as in towns in the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref name = "YMCA" /&gt; There were also reports of violation of human rights of Christians in the PA-run areas.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzCAqXrBGtU|title=Christy a Palestinian Christian's plea to Dr. Saeb Erekat|date=25 April 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shoebat.com/2014/04/29/heroic-palestinian-christian-girl-defies-world-support-israel/|title=A Heroic Palestinian Christian Girl Defies the World In Support Of Israel|work=Walid Shoebat|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, major Muslim organizations, local mosques, the city's Mufti and municipal leaders in the West Bank town [[Qalqiliya]] requested the interior minister of the Palestinian Authority shut down the [[Young Men's Christian Association]], which had operated in the town since 2000, due to missionary activity.  The manager of the YMCA denied this: "It's not what we're about. There is no missionary activity here whatsoever. The YMCA is in the city to serve the population with financial help, sporting activities and general educational programs," and pointing to the organization's employment of many Muslims, their establishment of community programs including financing a mostly Muslim soccer club that had competed in national games.  The town's Muslim leadership issued a petition demanding that the organization close down the Qalqiliya branch or face violence which read as follows: "We the preachers of the mosques and representatives of major families in Qalqiliya ask you to close the offices of the YMCA because the population of Qalqiliya doesn't need such offices, especially since there are not many Christians in our city..." It warned, "The act of these institutions of the YMCA, including attempting to convert Muslims in our city, will bring violence and tension."  Three days before the delivery of this petitions, many imams spoke about the issue during Friday prayers; the following day Molotov cocktails were thrown at Qalqiliya's YMCA. In September 2006, the YMCA was given a "final notification" by local leaders.  On 11 September 2006, the organization's building was broken into and torched by assailants identified by members of the local government as members of [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] well-known to local security forces.&lt;ref name = "YMCA" /&gt;

==== Christian sites ====
During 2007 many Western and Christian targets were attacked in the West Bank and Gaza. Members of local gangs and terror cells blew up and destroyed institutions linked to Western culture such as American schools, church libraries and dozens of Internet cafes. These events were largely ignored by the media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web | title=Ignoring the chaos, by Avi Issacharoff | work=Haaretz.com | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/855677.html | accessdate=May 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. State Department's Annual Report on Religious Freedom, 2000, "there were periodic reports that some Christian converts from Islam who publicize their religious beliefs have been harassed. Converts complained that they were mistreated and threatened. The draft Palestinian Basic Law specifically forbids discrimination against individuals based on their religion; however, the PA did not take any action against persons accused of harassment".&lt;ref name = "DHRL2000"&gt;{{cite web

After a visit to the Palestinian Authority administered areas, Senator [[Connie Mack III|Connie Mack]] related on the floor of the US Senate the case of a Christian convert from Islam who was falsely charged with selling land to Jews, arrested, beaten and tortured, and held for eight months without trial. Despite being released after his family borrowed thousands of dollars for bribes, his father continued to be held, he believed as insurance of his silence on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Remarks from the Senate Floor, Senator Connie Mack, U.S. Senate -- March 3, 1999, available electronically in the Congressional Record, [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=s2205&amp;dbname=1999_record], pages S2202-2205&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish sites====
[[Joseph's Tomb]] in [[Nablus]] was a site of clashes between Jews and Palestinians.  The Israeli army agreed to withdraw from the site and turn over control to the Palestinian police, who had agreed to protect the site.  Instead, they stood by while mobs ransacked the site and burned holy books.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Richard. "Joseph's Tomb." Washington Post, (October 10, 2000)and Greenburg, Joel. "Palestinians destroy the Israeli site that was the scene of many clashes." New York Times(October 8, 2000) at [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/joetomb.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, prominent members of the PA have denied that there is any Jewish historical connection to many Jewish holy sites, and PA Ministries have embedded such ideas in their press releases:

[[Yasser Arafat]]:
*"That is not the Western Wall at all, but a Muslim shrine". – Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref&gt;Ma'ariv, October 11, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Abraham was neither Jewish nor a Hebrew, but was simply an Iraqi. The Jews have no right to claim part of the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Abraham's resting place, as a synagogue. Rather, the whole building should be a mosque."&lt;ref&gt;Yasser Arafat, Palestinian Television, September 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to education===
According to the ministerial statistic collected in September 2005, there are 2267 schools in general education, 31,001 classes, 1078488 students, and 48674 teachers in the [[Palestinian territories]]. 24% of schools are [[UNRWA]]-operated, 70% are governmental, and 6% are private. Another survey conducted in May 2005 shows that there are 138,139 students enrolled in Higher Education Institutions. Between these students, 9002 (6.5%) are in [[community colleges]], 6034 (4.4%) in [[university colleges]], 46453 (33.6%) in [[Al-Quds Open University]], and 76650 (55.5%) in traditional universities.

Moves by the Hamas-run Education Ministry to impose [[Islamist]] ideals onto the educational system concern many Palestinians and outside observers. In March 2007, the Ministry pulled an anthology of folktales narrated by Palestinian women from the curriculum, removed the book from libraries, and reportedly destroyed 1,500 copies. The anthology was edited by Sharif Kanaana, a novelist and anthropology professor at [[Ramallah]]'s [[Birzeit University]], and Ibrahim Muhawi, a teacher of Arabic literature and the theory of translation. Education Minister Nasser Shaer said that the book is "full of clear sexual expressions." A story entitled, "The Little Bird," mentions private parts, and in the notes the authors say that, "the bird in the story is a symbol of femininity and that sexual subjects are a principal source of humor in Palestinian folklore".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Law enforcement==
According to annual report of the [[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]] in 2005, 385 Palestinian fatalities were recorded.  Of these, 222 Palestinians were killed by Israelis, 113 Palestinians were killed by Palestinians, and 50 Palestinians were killed in unclear circumstances.  9 Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers.  The same year,  51 Israelis were killed by Palestinians; 42 were civilians, 9 were members of the military.  Palestinians killed 10 Palestinians suspected to be Israeli collaborators in 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrmg.org/pressrelease/2005/January%201,%202006.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903231928/http://www.phrmg.org/pressrelease/2005/January%201%2C%202006.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Organization for Human Rights Report===
In December 2012, [[Arab Organization for Human Rights]] (AOHR) released a report that accused the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] (PA) of "inhumane practices and human rights violations" against Palestinian civilians. The AOHR alleges that from 2007-2011, the PA detained 13,271 Palestinians, and tortured 96% of them, resulting in six deaths.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=297746|title=UK-based Arab HR group accuses Palestinian Authority of abuse - Middle East - Jerusalem Post|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report claims that PA law enforcement raided universities, hospitals and houses in order to arrest people wanted for protesting against the Israeli occupation. The report also relates that PA officers confiscated equipment and personal cash after arresting the suspects.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

===Capital punishment===
Capital punishment is legal in the PA.  The PA enacted 5 capital executions in 2005.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Conditions for detainees===
[[Amnesty International]] has published a number of reports documenting the Palestine Authority's [[arrest]] and detention of [[civilian]]s without charge.  In one year at least 400 such detentions were reported, primarily of political [[dissident]]s to the Palestine Authority .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208141705/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aireport/ar98/mde21.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that single year Amnesty International found: "Torture [by the Palestine Authority] of [[detainee]]s remained widespread. Seven detainees died in custody. Unlawful killings, including possible extrajudicial executions, continued to be reported."

==Exposure of civilian targets to military action==
[[File:Israeli soldiers on Palestine street.jpg|thumb|IDF soldiers patrol in Hebron|220px]]
In November 2006, 50 veiled Palestinian women responded to a Hamas radio appeal to act as human shields between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen hiding in a Gaza mosque.  Women acted as a cover against Israeli troops allowing armed men occupying the Mosque to escape.  2 of these women were killed by Israeli forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20698726-1702,00.html Israeli troops kill women in mosque siege]&lt;/ref&gt;  In two further instances in November 2006, civilians were called to protect sites known to be targeted for attack by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], in one instance by the owner of the targeted home, [[Mohammedweil Baroud]], a commander in the [[Popular Resistance Committee]] and by calls broadcast from local Mosques.  The Human Rights Watch has condemned this behavior saying, "There is no excuse for calling civilians to the scene of a planned attack...Whether or not the home is a legitimate military target, knowingly asking civilians to stand in harm's way is unlawful.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/11/22/isrlpa14652.htm|title=Human Rights Watch Statement on our November 22 Press Release - Human Rights Watch|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Palestinian Authority has also been accused of using civilians as human shields and civilian property such as houses as sites for smuggling arms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3326689,00.html|title=Egypt uncovers arms tunnel|work=ynet|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching sites for rockets, and factories to produce munitions, thereby exposing them to harm from [[Israeli Defense Forces]] military operations. Civilian deaths caused by these strikes are widely publicized in the media and create favorable public opinion for the PA and negative public opinion against [[Israel]].
[[Hakam Balawi]] has stated, "... It is prohibited to launch rockets and to fire weapons from houses, and that is a supreme Palestinian interest that should not be violated because the result is barbaric retaliation by the occupying army and the citizenry cannot accept such shooting. Those who do it are a certain group that does not represent the people and nation, doing it without thinking about the general interest and public opinion in the world and in Israel. There is no vision or purpose to the missiles; the Palestinian interest is more important"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Palestinian lawmakers: Arafat evading promises of reform | work=Haaretz.com | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/462724.html  | accessdate=August 11, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041011130341/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/462724.html |archivedate = October 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, on 29 February 2008 Hamas parliamentarian Fathi Hammad spoke of a "death-seeking" culture where women, children and the elderly volunteer as human shields against Israeli military attacks. "[The enemies of Allah] do not know that the Palestinian people have developed its [methods] of death and death-seeking," Hammad is quoted by Memri in a speech televised on Hamas' Al-Aqsa television station. "For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, and so do the [[mujahideen]] and the children," Hammad is quoted as saying. "This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujahideen, in order to challenge the [[Zionist]] bombing machine. It is as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death like you desire life,'" he said.&lt;ref&gt;MEMRI holds copyrights on all translations.

The firing of [[Qassam rocket]]s into Israel has been opposed by those living closest to the firing location due to Israeli military responses. On July 23, 2004 a family attempted to physically prevent the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] from setting up a Qassam rocket launcher outside their house. Members of the brigade shot one member of the family, an Arab boy, and wounded 5 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Personal status issues==

===Status of women===
Women have full suffrage in the PA. In the 2006 elections, women made up 47 per cent of registered voters. Prior to the elections, the election law was amended to introduce a quota for women on the national party lists, resulting in 22 per cent of candidates on the national lists being women. The quota's effectiveness was illustrated in comparison with the district elections, where there was no quota, and only 15 of the 414 candidates were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/236f02cf539aa9418525710600587785!OpenDocument STATEMENT OF PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS: Open and well-run parliamentary elections strengthen Palestinian commitment to democratic institutions"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123032020/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/236f02cf539aa9418525710600587785%21OpenDocument |date=January 23, 2009 }}; European Union Election Observation Commission, West Bank and Gaza 2006, January 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas has begun enforcing some Islamic standards of dress for women in the PA; women must don headscarves in order to enter government ministry buildings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070305/ap_on_re_mi_ea/palestinians_book_ban_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213701/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070305/ap_on_re_mi_ea/palestinians_book_ban_1 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Hamas banned the smoking of [[hookah]] by women in public. They claimed that it was to reduce the increasing amount of divorces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher= Daily Telegraph |date= 18 July 2010 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/7897218/Women-banned-from-smoking-hookah-pipes-in-Gaza.html |title= Women banned from smoking hookah pipes in Gaza |accessdate= 18 July 2010 | location=London | first=Adrian | last=Blomfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honor killings]] are a problem in the PA; the Hamas government has not moved to stop these killings and may have set up infrastructures which participate in them. According to the 2005 Annual report of The [[Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group]], 11 Palestinian women died as a result of honor killings in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, A Question of Security
Violence against Palestinian Women and Girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2006/opt1106/|title=A Question of Security|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that, "a significant number of women and girls in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are victims of violence perpetrated by family members and intimate partners. While there is increasing recognition of the problem and some Palestinian Authority (PA) officials have indicated their support for a more forceful response, little action has been taken to seriously address these abuses. Indeed, there is some evidence the level of violence is getting worse while the remedies available to victims are being further eroded."  The report discusses spousal and child abuse, rape, incest, and "honor" crimes.  The report suggests that reasons for the PA's failure to respond to the violence include, "discriminatory laws that condone and perpetuate such violence and the virtual absence of institutionalized policies to prevent violence, assist victims, and hold perpetrators accountable".  The report outlines Jordanian laws in force in the West Bank and Egyptian laws in Gaza, "include provisions that provide a reduction in penalty to men who kill or attack female relatives committing adultery; relieve rapists who agree to marry their victims from any criminal prosecution; and allow only male relatives to file incest charges on behalf of minors".  In addition, HRW interviewed Palestinian police officers, including chiefs of police who, "downplayed the severity of violence against women in the OPT and questioned the need for their involvement in the dissemination of potentially life-saving information to victims."  The report also noted that, "police officers and clan leaders regularly "mediate" and "resolve" these cases, typically by returning the abused women to the "care and protection" of her attacker, without ever referring the case to the courts or the woman to social or other services she might need". While Human Rights Watch acknowledged, "the severe constraints that the Israeli occupation imposes upon the PA," they concluded that, "notwithstanding these limitations, the PA holds ultimate responsibility for protecting victims and holding perpetrators accountable...and that PA is failing to act diligently to prevent, investigate, and punish violence against women, putting women's health and lives in jeopardy. Ultimately, the PA is denying victims their rights under international human rights law to non-discrimination and an effective judicial remedy for abuse".

Crimes against women accelerated during 2007. Cases of women being beaten are common in the Gaza strip. Women murdered for "family honor" are seldom reported. Most women who are murdered are buried by members of their family in secret, and their deaths are not reported to any official body. The Palestinian media also refrain from reporting on this, for the sake of "family honor."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Israeli officials say Hamas in the Gaza Strip has established hard-line Islamic courts and created the Hamas Anti-Corruption Group, which is described as a kind of "morality police" operating within Hamas' organization. Hamas has denied the existence of the anti-corruption group, but it was recently report to have carried out a high-profile "honor killing" widely covered by the Palestinian media.&lt;ref name = "YMCA" /&gt;

In 2013, [[UNRWA]] canceled its annual marathon in Gaza after Hamas rulers prohibited women from participating in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-cancels-gaza-marathon-over-hamas-ban-on-women/|title=UN cancels Gaza marathon over Hamas ban on women|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of homosexuality===
{{main|LGBT rights in the Palestinian territories}}
Gay Palestinians are often arrested and tortured. According to Shaul Ganon of the Israeli-based gay rights group, Aguda,  "The P.A. 's usual excuse for persecuting gays is to label them collaborators--though I know of two cases in the last three years where people were tried explicitly for being homosexuals...It's now [since the intifada, when police increasingly began enforcing Islamic law] impossible to be an open gay in the P.A."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/refugee-status|title=Refugee Status|work=The New Republic|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/gay-palestinians-are-being-blackmailed-into-working-as-informants|title=Gay Palestinians Are Being Blackmailed Into Working As Informants|work=Vice Media|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.law.tau.ac.il/heb/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/NowheretoRun.pdf|title=Nowhere to Run: Gay Palestinian Asylum-Seekers in Israel|work=Tel Aviv University|date=April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919111957/http://www.law.tau.ac.il/heb/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/NowheretoRun.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/palestine/pseditorials001.htm|title=Palestine’s Oppression of Gays Should Not Be Ignored|work=University of Southern California|date=13 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2002, musician [[Sascha Scatter|Sascha Altman DuBrul]] wrote "Bipolar World", an article published in the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''. The article described his experiences being diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. Among the dozens of e-mails and other correspondence that he received after this publication was a letter from Ashley McNamara, now known as Jacks, an artist and writer who identified strongly with DuBrul's experiences.&lt;ref name=theicarusproject1/&gt; DuBrul and McNamara corresponded for a few weeks before finally meeting in person and deciding to start The Icarus Project. Years later, musician-activist [[Bonfire Madigan Shive]]&lt;ref name="mutha-magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muthamagazine.com/2014/05/mutha-interviews-bonfire-madigan-shive/|title=Mutha Interviews Bonfire Madigan Shive|author=Packebush, Nina|date=May 12, 2014|work=Mutha Magazine|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and counselor/activist [[Will Hall]] became a key leader in The Icarus Project's administration and development.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/growing-push-mad-pride-79919|title=The Growing Push for "Mad Pride"|last=Newsweek Staff|first=|date=May 1, 2009 |work=Newsweek|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of Medical Humanities'', co-founder DuBrul describes The Icarus Project as tied to socioculture movements in [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchism]], [[anti-psychiatry]], [[permaculture]]/sustainable ecology, [[LGBT social movements|LGBTQ]] rights, [[harm reduction]], [[Global justice movement|global justice]] movement, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and [[punk rock]]. He writes, "Our response to the label 'bipolar' was not a 'normal' response, which is why the Icarus Project brought a new perspective to psychic diversity. To create this perspective, we drew inspiration from many social movements and subcultural communities that came before us. So even though our response was unusual, it did not arise in a vacuum. In creating the Icarus Project, we wove together the ideas and practices in these movements to imagine a powerful new counter narrative to the dominant mental health narrative that went beyond a questioning of the language around 'bipolar' and critiqued the system itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first step, they decided, was creating a website where people who identified with "bipolar and other 'mental illness' [could] find real community and contribute to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/off-their-meds/ News feature], ''East Bay Express'', 3 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; DuBrul states that by 2003, "The Icarus Project website was up and running, and a virtual community began to evolve around the discussion forums." He notes that user-generated content online enabled The Icarus Project's growth: "We were attracting interesting people, creating discussion forums with names like 'Alternate Dimensions or Psychotic Delusions' and 'Experiencing Madness and Extreme States.' There was no place else where people who used psych meds and people who did not, people who identified with diagnostic categories and people who did not, could all talk with each other and share stories. Because of the outreach in the anarchist and activist community, there was a high percentage of creative people with a radical political analysis. And with the (seeming) anonymity of the Internet, people felt comfortable being honest and sharing intimate stories about their lives.

The Icarus Project's stated aims&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theicarusproject.net/mission-vision-principles/|title=Mission&amp;Valuespage_TheIcarusProject|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are to provide a "support network and education project by and for people who experience the world in ways that are often diagnosed as mental illness." The national Icarus Collective staff is set up to support local groups instead of creating the smaller organizations themselves. The responsibilities of the local group are to gather people locally for support, education, activism, and access to alternatives to mainstream medical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name=theicarusproject2&gt;[http://www.theicarusproject.net/about-us/icarus-project-mission-statement theicarusproject.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224042920/http://www.theicarusproject.net/about-us/icarus-project-mission-statement |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project advocates self-determination and caution when approaching psychiatric care. It encourages [[harm reduction]], alternatives to the prevailing medical model that is accepted by the vast majority of mental health professionals, and self-determination in treatment and diagnosis. Key members of The Icarus Project state that they "envision a world with more options to navigate mental health issues: options that support self-determination, center people who are most impacted by mental health-based oppression, and most critically, uplift social transformation as central to individual wellbeing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Mental Health: Challenges for the 21st Century, 3rd edition|last=Rosenburg|first=Samuel J. &amp; Jessica|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=978-1-138-91310-3|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Jennifer Itzenson&lt;ref name="Itzenson2005"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070124131211/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2005-11-01/itzenson-bipolardisorder Columbia News Service, Nov 1, 2005 - A new movement views bipolar disorder as a dangerous gift - By Jennifer Itzenson]&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the Icarus Project accepts those with a wide range of perspectives on mental health issues, but also describes "an edge of militancy within the group," particularly among those who reject medication. Itzenson also writes that while medical professionals applaud groups like the Icarus Project for providing a sense of support and community, and combating [[social stigma]]s related to bipolar and other mental health issues, the group's questioning of the medical paradigm is "misguided" and that rejecting medication is a "potentially fatal choice" for those with bipolar disorder. A Newsweek article provides the following perspective on The Icarus Project's stance towards medication: "While some critics might view Icaristas as irresponsible, their skepticism about drugs isn't entirely unfounded. Lately, a number of antipsychotic drugs have been found to cause some troubling side effects."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Itzenson notes that DuBrul has been quoted as saying that he has "superpowers" due to his alleged acute sensitivity to his surroundings.&lt;ref name="Itzenson2005" /&gt;

In contrast, writer Mark Lukach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/author/mark-lukach|title=Mark Lukach|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes his experience asking co-founder Sascha Altman DuBrul about the role of psychiatric medication as a part of his wife's recovery from a bipolar diagnosis. Lukach articulates The Icarus Project's approach to self-determination in psychiatric treatment, "As for medication, DuBrul said that he believed that the answer to the question of whether or not to use pharmaceuticals needed to be far more nuanced than yes or no. The best response might be ''maybe'', ''sometimes'', or ''only certain medications''. For instance, DuBrul shared that he takes lithium every night because he’s confident that, after four hospitalizations and over a decade with the label bipolar, the medication is a positive part of his care. Not the whole solution, but a piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/lovely-wife-psych-ward-95567|title=My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Erica Hua Fletcher describes Icarus Project member's diverse ways of discussing altered mental states in the ''Journal of Medical Humanities''. Dr. Fletcher writes, "While many Icarus contributors have found relief through the use of psycho-pharmaceutical interventions and other bio-psychiatric technologies, they also have experienced the limitations of medical paradigms and language to recognize the fullness of their lives. Because of this, they frequently adopt alternative words and phrases beyond bio-psychiatric terms to describe their mental states such as "neurodivergent processing," "diasporas of distressing symptoms," "sensory/cognitive/emotional trauma," or "cognitive-emotional terror." "Bipolar disorder" is interchangeable with highs and lows; "psychosis" can be seen as a reckoning; and nonconsensus realities can describe extreme experiences, which psychiatrists could label as symptoms of "schizophrenia" (such as [[Hearing Voices Movement|hearing voices]] others do not hear or seeing objects others do not see). Such alternative words and phrases do not diminish the utility of bio- psychiatric terminology nor do they directly undermine medical treatment options, yet they allow for a range of descriptors and call for attention to individual needs and desires. They call us to listen to personal stories, to forces at work within communities, and to reevaluate the languages that enframe mental illness as such." She goes on to state, "Alternative language beyond the biomedical paradigm of mental illness fosters a diversity of paradigms. Moreover, it can create a reflective space for those with mental suffering (and for their healthcare providers) to see themselves outside of a medical identity, reevaluate their self-care regimens, advocate for the care they would like to receive, and connect to others who may have similar concerns about ascribing to solely psycho-pharmaceutical interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28891019|title=Uncivilizing "Mental Illness": Contextualizing Diverse Mental States and Posthuman Emotional Ecologies within The Icarus Project|last=Fletcher|first=Erica Hua|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2018, Icarus Project staff describe their expertise in social activism, herbalism, and labor organizing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theicarusproject.net/welcome-to-the-icarus-project/staff/|title=Staff &amp; Advisory Board|last=|first=|date=|website=Icarus Project|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icarus Project advisory board members describe themselves as educators, artists, activists, writers, healers, community organizers, and other creative types and some identify as Latinx, queer, trans, people of color or mixed race, and trauma survivors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Itzenson2005" /&gt; Leadership currently offers publications on self-care and community care, workshops and training for peers, training and talks for providers, peer support spaces, webinars, and other events.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theicarusproject.net/what-we-do/|title=What We Do|last=|first=|date=|website=Icarus Project|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure / funding==
The Icarus Project is currently under the fiscal sponsorship of FJC, a non-profit 501(c)3 umbrella organization arm of an investment firm, based in New York City. The Icarus Project currently gets the bulk of its money from foundation grants, including the Ittleson Foundation,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but it also has many individual donors. There has been considerable talk for many years of alternate funding structures, and efforts are currently underway to explore 501c3 and cooperative structures. The Icarus Project maintains a financial transparency page which is current as of 2010, receiving grants totaling $16,000 and individual donations of about $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theicarusproject.net/financialtransparency |title=TIP: Financial Reports |publisher=The Icarus Project |date= |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723155417/http://theicarusproject.net/financialtransparency |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Icarus Project does not accept funding from [[pharmaceutical companies]].&lt;ref name=theicarusproject2/&gt; The Icarus Project has a social media presence on Twitter and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical IOCs are [[virus signature]]s and [[IP address]]es, [[MD5 hash]]es of [[malware]] files or [[URL]]s or [[domain name]]s of [[botnet]] command and control servers. After IOCs have been identified in a process of [[incident response]] and [[computer forensics]], they can be used for early detection of future attack attempts using [[intrusion detection system]]s and [[antivirus software]].

For more efficient automated processing there are initiatives to standardize the format of IOCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt | title=The Incident Object Description Exchange Format | publisher=IETF | work=RFC 5070 | year=2007 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cybox.mitre.org/ | title=Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) | publisher=Mitre | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known indicators are usually exchanged within the industry.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">In [[information technology]], benchmarking of [[computer security]] requires measurements for comparing both different IT systems and single IT systems in dedicated situations. The technical approach is a pre-defined catalog of security events (security incident and [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]]) together with corresponding formula for the calculation of security indicators that are accepted and comprehensive.

'''Information security indicators''' have been standardized by the [[ETSI]] Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI. These indicators provide the basis to switch from a qualitative to a quantitative culture in IT Security Scope of measurements: External and internal threats (attempt and success), user's deviant behaviours, nonconformities and/or vulnerabilities (software, configuration, behavioural, general security framework).

The list of Information Security Indicators belongs to the ISI framework that consists of the following eight closely linked Work Items:

# ISI Indicators (ISI-001-1&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 001-1 (V1.1.2): ISI Indicators Part 1; A full set of operational indicators for organizations to use to benchmark their security posture (2015-06) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/00101/01.01.02_60/gs_isi00101v010102p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and Guide ISI-001-2&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 001-2 (V1.1.2): ISI Indicators Part 2; Guide to select operational indicators based on the full set given in part 1 (2015-06) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/00102/01.01.02_60/gs_isi00102v010102p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;): A powerful way to assess security controls level of enforcement and effectiveness (+ benchmarking)
# ISI Event Model (ISI-002&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 002 (V1.2.1): ISI Event Model; A security event classification model and taxonomy (2015-11) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/002/01.02.01_60/gs_isi002v010201p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;): A comprehensive security event classification model (taxonomy + representation)
# ISI Maturity (ISI-003&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 003 (V1.2.1): ISI Key Performance Security Indicators (KPSI) to evaluate the maturity of security event detection (2018-01) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/003/01.02.01_60/gs_isi003v010201p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;): Necessary to assess the maturity level regarding overall [[SIEM]] capabilities (technology/people/process) and to weigh event detection results. Methodology complemented by ISI-005 (which is a more detailed and case by case approach)
# ISI Guidelines for event detection implementation (ISI-004&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 004 (V1.1.1): ISI Guidelines for event detection implementation (2013-12) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/004/01.01.01_60/gs_isi004v010101p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;): Demonstrate through examples how to produce indicators and how to detect the related events with various means and methods (with classification of use cases/symptoms)
# ISI Event Stimulation (ISI-005&lt;ref&gt;ETSI GS ISI 005 (V1.1.1): ISI Guidelines for security event detection testing and assessmeent of detection effectiveness (2015-11) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/ISI/001_099/005/01.01.01_60/gs_isi005v010101p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;): Propose a way to produce security events and to test the effectiveness of existing detection means (for major types of events)
# An ISI-compliant Measurement and Event Management Architecture for Cyber Security and Safety (ISI-006, in preparation): This work item focuses on designing a cybersecurity language to model threat intelligence information and enable detection tools interoperability.
# ISI Guidelines for building and operating a secured SOC (ISI-007, in preparation): A set of requirements to build and operate a secured SOC (Security Operations Center) addressing technical, human and process aspects.
# ISI Description of a whole organization-wide SIEM approach (ISI-008, in preparation): A whole SIEM (CERT/SOC based) approach positioning all ISI aspects and specifications.

Preliminary work on information security indicators have been done by the French Club R2GS. The first public set of the ISI standards (security indicators list and event model) have been released in April 2013.

This slogan was coined by the Urdu poet and Indian freedom fighter [[Hasrat Mohani|Maulana Hasrat Mohani]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4g1_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=zindabad+mohani|title=Indian Philately Digest|last=Pandya|first=Prashant H.|date=2014-03-01|publisher=Indian Philatelists' Forum|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fp.brecorder.com/2005/06/20050618282881|title=LITERACY NOTES: Hasrat Mohani – a unique poet &amp; politician|last=|first=|date=June 18, 2005|work=Business Recorder|access-date=April 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406065746/https://fp.brecorder.com/2005/06/20050618282881/|archive-date=April 6, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/india/india-remembers-maulana-hasrat-mohani-who-gave-the-revolutionary-slogan-inquilab-zindabad_1963758.html|title=India remembers Maulana Hasrat Mohani who gave the revolutionary slogan 'Inquilab Zindabad'|date=2017-01-02|work=Zee News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was popularized by [[Bhagat Singh]] (1907 - 1931) during the late 1920s through his speeches and writings.&lt;ref name="book_bhagat_singh_speeches_writings_2007"/&gt; It was also the official slogan of the 
[[Hindustan Socialist Republican Association]].&lt;ref name="livehistory_2017_inquilab_article"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livehistoryindia.com/snapshort-histories/2017/08/06/inquilab-zindabad-a-war-cry-for-change|title=Inquilab Zindabad: A War Cry for Change|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book_bhagat_singh_speeches_writings_2007"/&gt;
In April 1929, this slogan was raised by Bhagat Singh and his accomplice [[Batukeshwar Dutt|B. K. Dutt]] who had shouted this after bombing the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habib|first=S.

Later, for the first time in an open court, this slogan was raised in June 1929 as part of their [[s:Joint Statement of Bhagat Singh and B. K. Dutt in the Assembly Bomb Case|joint statement]] at the High Court in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/bhagat-singh/1929/06/06.htm|title=Full Text of Statement of S.

N. Gupta|website=archive.org|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, it became one of the rallying cries of the [[Indian independence movement]]. In Indian political novels chronicling the independence movement, a pro-independence sentiment is often characterized by characters shouting this slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Abhv0NUaUC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=inquilab+zindabad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sTV6VIe7GoPzPIr7gYgH&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=inquilab%20zindabad&amp;f=false |title=Indian Political Novel in English |first=O.P. |last=Bhatnagar |publisher=Saruk and Sons |location=Delhi |year=2007 |isbn=9788176257992 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan is now used more frequently by [[socialists]] and [[communists]], especially by those in the [[CPI (M)]], [[Communist Party of India|CPI]] and [[leftist]] political parties.

The '''Institute 22''' organization was created in 1978, by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Russian Ministry of Defense|Ministry of Defense]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Its mission was to investigate [[UFO]]s in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Good2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Timothy|title=Need to Know: UFOs, the Military, and Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tqu7764c2cQC&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=6 December 2015|year=2007|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=9781933648385|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institute 22 was a secret organization for 13 years (until the fall of the Soviet Union), and can be compared to the [[United States|American]] [[Project Blue Book]].

During its existence a great number of soldiers, sailors and pilots of the [[Soviet Army]] were given orders to watch for UFOs and other unexplained events, without any further information. The orders could be handed out quite easily since the Ministry of Defense was involved - thus no questions could be asked.

Institute 22 have investigated around 3000 UFO reports. About 5-10% of all cases remained unexplained when the organization dissolved.

There is a [[conspiracy theory]] that Institute 22 was involved in a cover-up of a near-nuclear launch. In 1982, one of the Soviet Nuclear Bases was brought online, and for no apparent reason a nuclear missile was ready to launch. After 30 seconds of panic and chaos, the launch was aborted as mysteriously as it had appeared. Later, witnesses said that there had been some UFO activity near the area of the base - thus the reason for Institute 22's involvement and cover-up.

The UFOs were explained as flares, which the Army was testing from a higher altitude. The nuclear crisis was explained as a simple test.

'''John Hunt Publishing''' is a publishing company founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001, initially named '''O Books'''. The publisher has 24 active autonomous [[Imprint (trade name)|imprints]], with the largest of these being the '''Zero Books''' imprint founded in 2009.&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;[http://www.theindependentpublishingmagazine.com/2014/02/john-hunt-publishing-reviewed.html John Hunt Publishing – Reviewed], The Independent Publishing Magazine, February 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zero Books imprint was founded with the objective being to combat what they viewed as a trend of anti-intellectualism in contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thequietus.com/articles/16815-zero-books-staff-start-repeater-books Former Zero Books Staff Start Repeater] by Laurie Tuffrey, ''[[The Quietus]]'', 29 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:ZeroBooksLogo1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Zero Books is the largest imprint of John Hunt Publishing.]]
John Hunt Publishing was founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Continuum, ''Directory of Publishing 2001: Continuum and the Publishers Association'' (2000), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Literary Market Place'' (2001), p. 675&lt;/ref&gt; originally named O Books,&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; a name which it continues to use as one of its [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, in the "mind, body, and spirit" market.&lt;ref name="Compass 25"&gt;Suzanne Ruthven, ''Compass Points - The Pagan Writers' Guide: Writing for the Pagan and MB&amp;S Markets'' (2013), p. 25, isbn 1782791078&lt;/ref&gt; Its Zero Books imprint was founded by [[Tariq Goddard]] and [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] in 2009. John Hunt Publishing then underwent a major reorganization in 2010.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; In 2014, Goddard and Fisher left Zero Books to found another publishing house, [[Repeater Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/34319/zer0-books-publisher-leaves-to-start-new-imprint-repeater|title=Zero books publisher leaves to start new imprint Repeater - The Wire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/16815-zero-books-staff-start-repeater-books|title=The Quietus - News - Former Zero Books Staff Start Repeater|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 2014 the imprint has been run by [[Douglas Lain]] along with Ashley Frawley and C Derick Varn and has published critically acclaimed books such as ''Kill All Normies'' and ''Zen City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/07/angela-nagles-kill-all-normies-the-alt-right-and-4chan.html|title=Where Did the Alt-Right Come From? This Book Finds Some Uncomfortable Answers|first=Park|last=MacDougald|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-78535-350-5 A Review of ''Zen City''] by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The imprint began publishing a series called Neglected or Misunderstood in 2017 with the aim of covering neglected or misunderstood left-wing theorists such as [[Shulamith Firestone]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero-books.net/books/neglected-misunderstood-shulasmith-firestone Neglected or Misunderstood: The Radical Feminism of Shulamith Firestone].&lt;/ref&gt; Zero Books states that their goal is to utilize [[critical theory]] to "publish books that make our readers uncomfortable" in order to "reinvent the [[Left-wing politics|left]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero-books.net/about-us.html About Zero Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hunt Publishing "deals directly with authors" and does not require they have an agent. However, "because they are a small publisher, they are unable to pay advances, so [authors] have to wait for the royalties to roll in".&lt;ref name="Freelance"/&gt; Imprints of John Hunt Publishing offer four “levels” of publishing based on the likely popularity of the book,&lt;ref name="Freelance"&gt;Susie Kearley, ''Freelance Writing On Health, Food and Gardens'' (2014), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; with both “traditional publishing deals and what it describes as co-operative publishing for authors,” with about a quarter of books, most prevalently those in fiction, being published “under co-operative terms,”&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; though this will vary by imprint. The company also says that "every title gets treated the same. No bookshop or reviewer is going to know if one title or another has had a subsidy."&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; As with other imprints operations are controlled by authors themselves, who "have gravitated to being involved in publishing, whether coming up through editing, design or marketing."&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; This multiple-imprint author-centric style has been described as, "It can’t work. It shouldn’t work. Yet, somehow, John Hunt Publishing is making it work."&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; A central corporate office continues to manage sales, accounts, and royalties for all imprints.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; As of 2014, the company was publishing "approximately 300 titles per year with global sales and a focus on physical stores."&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

'''''Ketuanan Melayu''''' ([[Jawi script]]: كتوانن ملايو; literally "Malay dominance") is a political concept emphasising [[Malaysian Malays|Malay]] preeminence in present-day [[Malaysia]]. The Malays of Malaysia claimed a special position and special rights owing to their long domicile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Malaysia|page=154|author=Ooi Keat Gin|isbn=0-8108-5955-6|year=2008|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that the present Malaysian state itself evolved from a Malay polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malay Dominance? The Abdullah Rubric |page=34|author=K.Das|isbn=978-0-9679999-0-6 |year=1987|publisher=K Das Ink }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest political institution in Malaysia is the system of [[Malay rulers]] of the nine [[Malay states]]. British colonial government transformed the system and turned it first into a [[Federated Malay States#British Protectorate|system of indirect rule]], then in 1948, using this culturally based institution, they incorporated the Malay monarchy into the blueprints for the independent [[Federation of Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Participation and Ethnic Minorities: Chinese Overseas in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United States|page=74|author=Amy L. Freedman|isbn=978-0-415-92446-7|year=2000|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Tanah Melayu]] in its name which literally means "Malay homeland", assumes proprietorship of the Malay states. In this way Britain strengthened Malay ethno-nationalism, Malay ethnicity and culture and Malay sovereignty in the new nation-state. Though other cultures would continue to flourish, the identity of the emerging political community was to be shaped by the "historic" political culture of its dominant Malay ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nation Building: Five Southeast Asian Histories |page=99|author=Wang Gungwu|isbn=978-981-230-320-2|year=2005|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Indian Malaysian|Indian]] immigrants who form a significant minority in Malaysia, are considered beholden to the Malays for granting them citizenship in return for special privileges as set out in [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]].  This ''[[quid pro quo]]'' arrangement is usually referred to as the [[social contract (Malaysia)|Malaysian social contract]]. The concept of ''ketuanan Melayu'' is usually cited by politicians, particularly those from the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the most influential political party in Malaysia.

Although the idea itself predates Malaysian independence, the phrase ''ketuanan Melayu'' did not come into vogue until the early 2000s decade. Historically, the most vocal political opposition towards the concept has come from non-Malay-based parties, such as the [[Malaysian People's Movement Party]] (Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia) and [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP); in the 2000s decade, the multiracial [[People's Justice Party]] (Parti Keadilan Rakyat, or PKR) also positioned itself against ''ketuanan Melayu'', advocating instead ''ketuanan rakyat'' (supremacy of the people). The idea of Malay supremacy gained attention in the 1940s, when the Malays organised themselves to protest the [[Malayan Union]]'s establishment, and later fought for independence. During the 1960s, there was a substantial effort challenging ''ketuanan Melayu'' led by the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of [[Singapore]] — which was a state in Malaysia from 1963 to 1965 — and the DAP after Singapore's [[secession]]. However, the portions of the Constitution related to ''ketuanan Melayu'' were "[[Entrenchment clause|entrenched]]" after the [[13 May Incident|race riots of 13 May 1969]], which followed an election campaign focused on the issue of non-Malay rights and ''ketuanan Melayu''. This period also saw the rise of "[[ultra (Malaysia)|ultras]]" who advocated a one-party government led by UMNO, and an increased emphasis on the Malays being the "definitive people" of Malaysia — i.e. only a Malay could be a true Malaysian.

The riots caused a major change in the government's approach to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive [[affirmative action]] policy strongly favouring the Malays, the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP). The [[National Culture Policy]], also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] rejected this approach, with his ''[[Bangsa Malaysia]]'' policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ''ketuanan Melayu'' again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.

[[Ethnic Malays]] which make up the majority [[Malaysia#Demographics|population of Malaysia]] at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of [[Austronesian people]] predominantly inhabiting the [[Malay Peninsula]], including the [[Southern Thailand|southernmost parts of Thailand]], the east coast of [[Sumatra]], the coast of [[Borneo]], and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke [[Austronesian languages]] first arrived in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from [[Taiwan]] to [[South East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Malaysia and Singapore|pages=4 &amp; 5|author=Neil Joseph Ryan|isbn=0-19-580302-7|year= 1976|publisher=Oxford University Press| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent genetic studies carried out by HUGO ([[Human Genome Organization]]) involving almost 2000 people across Asia, points to another theory of Asian migration pattern. The HUGO findings support the hypothesis that Asia was populated primarily through a single migration event from the south and that the South East Asian region was populated first which contained the most diversity, then continuing slowly North with its diversity being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8406506.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Genetic 'map' of Asia's diversity | date=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influences arrived through trade contacts with the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The beginning of the first [[Millennium]] saw the rise of ancient Malay states in the coastal areas of [[Malay peninsular]], notably the [[Red Earth Kingdom]] (1st century), [[Gangga Negara]] (2nd century), [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century),  [[Bujang Valley|Kedah]] (2nd century) and [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]] (5th century). Between 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states became part of the [[Srivijaya empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/early.htm |title=Early Malay kingdoms |publisher=Sabrizain.org |accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Malay kingdom centred in [[Palembang]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |page=171|isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kedah|Kadaram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muljana|first=Slamet|authorlink=Slamet Muljana|title= Sriwijaya|editor= F.W.

By the 15th century, the [[Malacca Sultanate]], whose hegemony reached over much of the western Malay archipelago, had become the centre of [[Islamization]] in the east. The Malaccan tradition was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity.&lt;ref name="T.

The present day Malaysian Malays are divided broadly into "Malays proper"  or "Peninsular Malays" (''Melayu Anak Jati'' or ''Melayu Semenanjung'') and "foreign Malays" or "Islander Malay" (''Melayu Anak Dagang'' or "Melayu Kepulauan"). The Malays proper consist of those individuals who adhere to the Malay culture which has developed in the [[Malay peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scientific facilities and information services of the Federation of Malaya and State of Singapore|page=4|author=John O Sutter|asin=B0006D0GHI|year= 1961|publisher=National Science Foundation by the Pacific Scientific Information Center, B.

Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia defines a '''Malay''' as a Malaysian citizen born to a Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is domiciled in Malaysia or Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;A non-Malay Malaysian who converts to Islam can claim to be a Malay, provided they meet the other conditions. Two good examples are:
* [[Jeanne Abdullah]] the wife of Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], who is ethnically Portuguese-Eurasian.
* In Sarawak, [[Melanau]]s, who speak a distinct language different from Malays, are divided into two broad groups: Christian Melanau and Muslim Melanau. Muslim Melanau often regard themselves as Malay and enjoy the same benefit and privilege as the latter.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct in the sense of social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites '''Malays''' from different [[ethnic group]]s as the prevailing [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, [[Kadazan]], [[Iban people|Iban]], Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of '''[[UMNO]]''' (United '''Malays''' National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.

{{Main|Early Malay nationalism}}

===Early Malay nationalism===
Malay nationalism as an organised political movement existed since the invasion by foreign powers. However, the ethnic Chinese and Indian immigrants, forming a minority of the population, did not see themselves as Malayans.&lt;ref name="Lin-Sheng 2003 pp. 26"&gt;Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). ''The Chinese Dilemma'', pp. 26–27. East West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9751646-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in the early 1930s found that "the number of non-Malays who have adopted Malaya as their home is only a very small proportion of the whole population".&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, In-Won (2003). ''Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State under Mahathir'', p. 24. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. {{ISBN|981-230-185-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the British effectively ruled Malaya, ''[[de jure]]'' the Malays were coerced under fictitious agreements to accept the British administration through a residence system. British High Commissioner Sir [[Hugh Clifford]], demonstrated the British ideology which rationalised colonialism in Malaya&lt;ref&gt;Kratoska, Paul H., ed. Honorable Intentions: Talk on the British Empire in Southeast Asia Delivered at the Royal Colonial Institute, 1874-1928. Singapore: Oxford University Press,1983 (introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;  when he urged "everyone in this country [to] be mindful of the fact that this is a Malay country, and we British came here at the invitation of Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers, and it is our duty to help the Malays to rule their own country."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Patrick (2005). ''Ousted!'', p. 140. Media Masters. {{ISBN|981-05-3865-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostensibly the British adopted an open "Pro-Malay" policy so the Malays could, in the words of High Commissioner Sir [[Laurence Guillemard]], be equipped "to take their proper place in the administrative and commercial life of these States."&lt;ref&gt;Roff, W.R. (1974). ''The Origins of Malay Nationalism'', pp. 114, 118. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the non-elite Malays felt marginalised by the economic and political policies of the colonial government, whereas in fact they were the backbone of British rule, and both educational and occupational policies were segregated according to ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, Charles "The Making of Race in Colonial Malaya: Political Economy and Racial Ideology."

The local-born non-Malay communities soon began the fight for self-rule. In 1936, the Malayan-born Indian community asked High Commissioner Sir [[Shenton Thomas]] to grant them a share of administrative appointments. Thomas rejected the request, referring to the local-born Indians as "foreigners".&lt;ref&gt;Roff, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British appeared to view the Chinese as a "transient labor force," with statistics indicating most Chinese migrants eventually returned home, critics contend that the local-born Chinese population was steadily growing. Nevertheless, the British insisted it would be dangerous to consider the Chinese as having "a tendency to permanent settlement"; the locally born Indian community — comprising 20% of the Indian population, the rest being manual labourers having migrated for similar reasons as the Chinese at around the same time — was likewise largely ignored.&lt;ref name="roff_110,111"&gt;Roff, pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British relegated the Malays to their "traditional" peasant lifestyle as far as possible, restricting movement, economic enterprises and education. This policy was maintained in the belief that education of Bengalis in India had led to discontent and rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Metcalf, "Empire Recentered: India in the Indian Ocean Arena," in Colonialism and the Modern World: Selected Studies, eds. Gregory Blue, Martin Bunton, and Ralph Crozier (Armonk NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2002), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; They involved only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues. Despite the exclusion of non-Malays from positions of ostensible authority, much of the civil service rank and file comprised non-Malays, many of them Indians who were specifically brought in for this purpose.&lt;ref name="roff_110,111"/&gt; A number of historians have described the pro-Malay policies as designed merely to preserve the position of the British, rather than to strengthen that of the Malays; many characterised the British approach as one of "[[divide and rule]]", keeping "the races at just the right distance from each other to have the disparate elements of Malaya work in remote harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah, Asma &amp; Pedersen, Paul B. (2003). ''Understanding Multicultural Malaysia'', p. 44. Pearson Malaysia. {{ISBN|983-2639-21-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Rehman (1993). ''A Malaysian Journey'', p. 28. Self-published. {{ISBN|983-99819-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the local-born Chinese, who retained significant economic power, began pushing for a greater role in Malayan government.&lt;ref&gt;Swettenham, Frank. British Malaya: An Account of the Origin and Progress of British Influence in Malaya. By Sir Frank Swettenham, K.C. M. G. Late Governor of the Straits Colony. London: John Lane Co., 1900. (pg 232-4).&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Chinese community, which now made up 45% of the Malayan population, still comprised [[transient labourer]]s. Nevertheless, the [[Straits Chinese]] — which comprised the bulk of local-born Chinese — wanted to be given government positions and recognised as Malayans. One Straits Chinese leader asked, "Who said this is a Malay country? ... When Captain [Francis] [[Francis Light|Light]] arrived, did he find Malays, or Malay villages? Our forefathers came here and worked hard as [[coolie]]s — weren't ashamed to become coolies — and they didn't send their money back to China. They married and spent their money here, and in this way the Government was able to open up the country from jungle to civilization. We've become inseparable from this country. It's ours, our country..." Malay intellectuals objected to this reasoning, claiming that such reasoning is totally absurd and proposing an analogy with the Chinese as masons and Malaya as a house. A paid mason, they argued, was not entitled to a share in the ownership rights to a home he built. As such, they opposed any attempt to grant the Chinese citizenship or other political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Roff, pp. 207–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Indonesian ethnic groups such as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Bugis]] had migrated within the Malay Archipelago throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were most quickly assimilated into the Malay cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah &amp; Pedersen, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Chinese-Malayan appeals appeared to have some impact on the British. In 1927, the Governor of the [[Straits Settlements]] referred to the Chinese as "indigenous inhabitants of British Malaya".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hickling, R.H.]] (1991). ''Essays in Malaysian Law'', pp. 51–52. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-385-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before [[World War II]], Malay nationalism began emphasising ''ketuanan Melayu'', which had once been taken for granted. It was feared that British policies now seemed geared towards creating a common Malayan nationality inclusive of the Chinese and Indians. Some Malays thus sought to preserve the ''[[status quo]]'' with the British as a bulwark against the non-Malays. Others began calling for an independent and sovereign Malay nation, such as "[[Greater Indonesia]]".&lt;ref&gt;Roff, pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Malayan Union (1946–48)===
After World War II, the British announced the establishment of the [[Malayan Union]], which would loosen immigration policies, reduce the sovereignty of the Malay rulers, and not recognise Malay supremacy, establishing Malaya as a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. As local-born residents, most Chinese and Indians qualified for citizenship under the Union's principle of ''[[jus soli]]''. With equal rights guaranteed to all, the Malays became dissatisfied with that. Even their traditional stronghold, the civil service, would be open to all Malayans.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, James P. (1985). ''Nation-building in Malaysia 1946–1974'', p. 42. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-582681-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first place, the Malays did not consider themselves to be included under the label of "Malayans".&lt;ref name="ongkili_59-66"&gt;Ongkili, pp. 59–66, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malays became politically conscious, protesting the Union's formation. At one gathering, placards declared that "Malaya Belongs to the Malays. We do not want the other races to be given the rights and privileges of the Malays."&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; One Malay organisation told the British that the Union's citizenship provisions would lead to "the wiping from existence of the Malay race along with their land and Rulers".&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Malay royalists and civil servants led by Dato' [[Onn Ja'afar]] formed the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) to protest the Malayan Union's formation.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Union was established as planned, the campaign continued; in 1948, the British replaced the Malayan Union with the [[Federation of Malaya]]. The Federation restored sovereignty to the Malay rulers, tightened immigration and citizenship restrictions, and gave the Malays special privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the avowed goal of the British remained the same as in 1946: to introduce "a form of common citizenship open to all those, irrespective of race, who regarded Malaya as their real home and as the object of their loyalty."&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited opposition to ''ketuanan Melayu'' and UMNO during this period came from a coalition between the  [[All-Malaya Council of Joint Action]] (AMCJA) and the [[Pusat Tenaga Rakyat]] (PUTERA). Although one of PUTERA's constituent organisations had insisted on ''ketuanan Melayu'' as a "National Birthright" of the Malays, PUTERA joined the AMCJA in championing equal political rights for non-Malays. After the British refused to heed the PUTERA-AMCJA coalition, it pulled out of talks with the British, later launching a major [[hartal]] (general strike) to protest perceived defects in the new polity. After the Federation was formed over their objections, the coalition disbanded.&lt;ref name="ongkili_59-66"/&gt;

Prior to the Federation, non-Malays were generally uninvolved in Malayan politics and nationalism, both essentially Malay in nature; being more interested in the politics of their respective homelands, non-Malays never significantly backed the Malayan Union openly but their silence was a support to it.&lt;ref&gt;Jawan, Jayum A. (2003). ''Malaysian Politics &amp; Government'', p. 37. Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|983-195-037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The AMCJA, though mostly non-Malay, did not represent a large section of the non-Malay communities in Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of interest in or loyalty to Malaya amongst the non-Malays seemed to justify ''ketuanan Melayu'' — Malay self-rule.

Some historians have argued the Union's failure made the Chinese aware of the need for political representation. The [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) — a communal political party campaigning for Chinese political rights — was formed soon after the Federation's formation.&lt;ref&gt;Ye, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the main driving force behind non-Malay involvement in Malayan politics, and their assertion of certain rights, was the increasing number of local-born non-Malays. The same report from the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies cited earlier stated that Malayan-born non-Malays "have never seen the land of their origin and they claim that their children and their children's children should have fair treatment."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural President of the MCA was [[Tan Cheng Lock]], a local-born Chinese who had led the AMCJA until its breaking up.

===Towards independence===
Its initial goals achieved, UMNO established itself as a political party to fight for independence. At the same time, the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP) launched an armed insurgency to form a communist government in Malaya, culminating in the [[Malayan Emergency]] which lasted until after independence. The insurgency was marked by a clear racial divide; opposition to the insurrection was almost entirely Malay, while Chinese dominated the communist ranks. The British encouraged the establishment of the [[Communities Liaison Committee]] (CLC), comprising the top echelon of Malayan politicians from different communities, to address sensitive issues, especially those related to race. Compromises on a number of issues, including citizenship, education, democracy, and Malay supremacy, were agreed on. Eventually, a "bargain" between the Malays and non-Malays was formulated; in return for giving up ''ketuanan Melayu'', the Malays would be assisted in closing the economic gap between the Malay and non-Malay communities. CLC member [[E.E.C. Thuraisingham]] later said, "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals."&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems continued to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths [[conscription|drafted]] into the army to stave off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ''ketuanan Melayu'', heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, Onn Ja'afar proposed to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, which would have diluted its identity as a champion of ''ketuanan Melayu''. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the [[Independence of Malaya Party]] (IMP). He was succeeded by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] (often known as "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays."&lt;ref&gt;Putra, Tunku Abdul Rahman (1986). ''Political Awakening'', pp. 30, 31. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-136-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races."&lt;ref name="josey_83-84"&gt;Josey, Alex (1980). ''Lee Kuan Yew: The Crucial Years'', pp. 83–84. Times Books International. {{ISBN|981-204-448-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penang State Map.jpg|thumb|During the early 1950s, there was an active [[Straits Chinese]] secessionist movement in Penang agitating against ''ketuanan Melayu''.]]

During this period, some [[Straits Chinese]] began taking interest in local politics, especially in [[Penang]], where there was an active Chinese [[secessionist]] movement. Identifying more with the British than the Malays, they were especially angered by references to them as ''[[pendatang asing]]'' (foreigners). Avoiding both UMNO and the MCA, they believed that while UMNO and Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights, the MCA was too "selfish", and could not be relied on.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, Mohamed Noordin (1976). ''From Malayan Union to Singapore Separation: Political Unification in the Malaysia Region 1945 – 65'', pp. 77 – 78. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt; Uncomfortable about the merger of the Straits Settlements with Malaya, they did not feel a sense of belonging in a "Malaya for the Malays" where they were not considered ''[[bumiputra]]'' ("sons of the soil"). One Straits Chinese leader indignantly declared, "I can claim to be more ''anak Pulau Pinang'' [a son of Penang] than 99 per cent of the Malays living here today." With the government's stout rejection of secession, the movement eventually petered out.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, pp. 61–62, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggested that the non-Malays did not feel loyal to Malaya because they did not consider themselves to be of Malayan [[nationality]] and adhere strictly to their own ethnic cultural backgrounds. To counter this, in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local-born non-Malays, and [[dual citizenship]] prohibited, forcing non-Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Malay's hypothesis, a majority of the non-Malays remained, thus proving their allegiance to Malaya. They are the ancestor of modern-day non-Malay Malaysian.

As Malaya moved to self-government, the British initiated the [[Member System]], modelled on the [[cabinet system]]; like the CLC, it drew on members of different communities, and was later described as setting a precedent for the power-sharing multiracial Malayan and Malaysian cabinets post-independence. At the same time, the British also began laying the framework for a [[education in Malaysia|national education system]] that would create "a sense of common citizenship". The [[Barnes Report]] that they commissioned, however, was strongly objected to by the Chinese community for being "saturated with Malay nationalism" and bolstering ''ketuanan Melayu''. The [[Fenn-Wu Report]], favoured by the Chinese, did not meet with Malay approval. In the end, the Barnes Report's recommendations for English-medium "national schools" were implemented by the 1952 Education Ordinance, over vocal Chinese protests, who were upset by the lack of provision for non-Malay vernacular schools. In 1956, a committee headed by [[Tun Abdul Razak]] re-evaluated the education system. The "Razak Report" recommended that vernacular primary schools be permitted to continue, but share a common syllabus with national schools. Vernacular secondary schools would not be sanctioned; only national secondary schools would be funded. The Chinese community strenuously objected to the Razak Report as well, launching an organised campaign against it; the MCA's refusal to oppose the Report cost it politically in some Chinese constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, pp. 90–91, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Razak Report's recommendations were largely successful, and many of them remain in place as of 2006.

===Possible origins of ''ketuanan Melayu''===
{{See also|Income disparity in Malaysia}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Protest against Malayan Union.jpg|thumb|250px|A rallying call of Malay nationalists during the 1940s was "Malaya for the Malays".]] --&gt;

According to many historians, the root cause of ethnic strife and ''ketuanan Melayu'' was a lack of mixing between the Malays and non-Malays. An exception to this were the Straits Chinese, who managed to assimilate reasonably well, despite the assimilation taking 600 years including intermarriage. According to the [[Ming Shi-lu]], the ancestors of the Straits Chinese were "gifts" given to the Sultan of Malacca as a recognition of both bilateral ties between the Ming Dynasty and the sultanate, and of Malay sovereignty.  At the time, most were rich merchants during British rule instead of manual labourers and many habitually spoke Malay, dressed in the Malay style, and preferred Malay cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British educational policies segregating the different races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays to their own devices — did not help matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.

Another contributing factor to ''ketuanan Melayu'' was the World War II Japanese occupation. The war "awakened a keen political awareness among Malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred". Japanese policies "politicised the Malay peasantry", intentionally fanning the flames of Malay nationalism. Two Malay historians wrote that "The Japanese hostile acts against the Chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of the Malays helped to make the Chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely..." A foreign commentator agreed, stating that "During the occupation period ... Malay national sentiment had become a reality; it was strongly anti-Chinese, and its rallying cry [was] 'Malaya for the Malays'..."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Alliance - 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections===
Although UMNO supported ''ketuanan Melayu'', it formed an "Alliance" with the MCA and the [[Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC) to contest the 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections. This took many by surprise, as the MCA had strenuously insisted on equal political rights for all citizens. Its President, [[Tan Cheng Lock]], was himself a Straits Chinese, albeit not as extremist as the secessionists. Although initially dismissed as a marriage of convenience, the Alliance won 51 out of 52 seats available. The sole remaining seat went to the [[PAS (political party)|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] (PMIP; later known as PAS), a Malay-based party and strong advocate of ''ketuanan Melayu''. The total defeat of non-communal parties led the Alliance to perceive the political atmosphere as inhospitable for multi-racial parties. A coalition government comprising mono-racial parties in which party leaders privately brokered compromise decisions was thought more stable and better suited to Malayan politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar had changed his approach, forming the [[Parti Negara]] after IMP suffered crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies.&lt;ref name="iseas"&gt;Lee, Hock Guan (2001). [http://www.iseas.edu.sg/sc22001.pdf "Political Parties and the Politics of Citizenship and Ethnicity in Peninsular Malay(si)a, 1957-1968"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118155740/http://www.iseas.edu.sg/sc22001.pdf |date=18 January 2006 }}. Retrieved 17 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, pp. 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence and Malaysia==

===Independence and the Constitution===
{{Main|Constitution of Malaysia|Social contract (Malaysia)|Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia}}

The [[Federation of Malaya]] became officially independent of the [[British Empire]] in 1957. The new state's [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]] contained provisions, such as [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]], guaranteeing the [[Malay people|Malays]] certain privileges as a form of [[affirmative action]]. The [[Reid Commission]], which drafted the Constitution, stated that Article 153 was to be temporary in nature, and should be reviewed by [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] 15 years after independence.&lt;ref name="ooi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ooi, Jeff|year=2005|url=http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/08/the_nst_should.php|title=Social Contract: 'Utusan got the context wrong'|accessdate=11 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030165436/http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/08/the_nst_should.php|archivedate =2005-10-30|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution itself did not explicitly state this, however, nor did it clarify the purpose of Article 153. It did declare all Malayans equal under the law, without mention of "Malay sovereignty" or any other ideas related to ''ketuanan Melayu''. ''[[Jus soli]]'' citizenship — the granting of citizenship to anyone born in the Federation — was also granted, albeit without [[retrospective effect]]; it was a major concession by the Malays, who had vigorously campaigned against ''jus soli'' citizenship in the Malayan Union.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Islam]] became the national language and official religion, while the Malay rulers remained. This was taken to mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan would be the same as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many, gave Malaya a Malay identity.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, R.S. &amp; Mauzy, Diane K. (1999). ''Malaysian Politics under Mahathir'', p. 34. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-17143-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One academic suggested that "The Malays have a deep-rooted feeling that they alone are the bumiputras, the sons of the soil, and as such have certain special rights over the land." Indeed, the Tunku said in 1964 that "It is understood by all that this country by its very name, its traditions and character, is Malay. ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields, eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people. But not with the Malays. Therefore, in return, they must appreciate the position of the Malays..."&lt;ref name="josey_83-84"/&gt; It has been suggested that a Malaysian nationality did not emerge because "all the national symbols in Malaysia were derived from the Malay tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional restraint on the size of rural Parliamentary constituencies was later removed, providing what one commentator called "an indirect buttress" to Malay special rights; as Malays were concentrated in rural areas, this indirectly enhanced Malay political power. The original Constitution had implicitly followed "[[one man, one vote]]". The change was denounced as "giving one man one vote, another a number of votes: not on the basis of, say, intellectual ability or geographical accident, but in order to ensure the dominance of a particular group."&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, pp. 69, 166, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutional provisions, which have been referred to as the "[[Malay Agenda]]", evoked little sentiment from non-Malays, despite most of them gaining citizenship and thus becoming theoretically equal to Malay citizens under the Constitution. This could be attributed to acceptance of the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]], of which one historian wrote: "At the elite level, non-Malays recognized that Malays were politically superior by virtue of their indigenous status and that the Malaysian polity would have a Malay character ... Malays were to be assured of safe majorities in both the state and federal parliament ... Malays would control the highest positions of the government and ... dominate members of the federal cabinet." A Malay historian wrote that "In return the Chinese gained more than [[overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]] had dreamed of — equal citizenship, political participation and office holding, unimpaired economic opportunity, and tolerance for their language, religion, and cultural institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some expressed trepidation at Article 153; shortly before independence, the ''[[China Press]]'' suggested that while special rights "may be excusable at the start of the building of a nation," if "the period of 'special rights' is not restricted, or the scope of special rights is not clearly defined, then endless disputes ... will arise later on," and argued that special rights would eventually divide instead of unite Malayans.&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at the time of independence, some historians assert, "there was a genuine sense of common citizenship, common aspirations, a common destiny."&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This was about to change.

===Merger===
In 1961, when the Malayan government began discussing a possible merger with neighbouring [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]],  [[Sarawak]] and [[Brunei]], problems of ethnic power relations arose again. The "Malaysia" proposal sans Sabah and Sarawak went back more than a decade; earlier negotiations had proved fruitless. The Singaporeans themselves were not anxious to be ruled by what they considered a Malay government.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1961, however, Singapore had grown receptive to the idea of joining Malaysia, largely because of the prevailing idea at the time that industrial Singapore could not survive without access to Malayan markets.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malayan government was not keen on having the Chinese Singaporean population push the Malays into a minority position in the new Malaysia. Many Malays felt that upsetting the Malay-dominated nature of the armed forces and police might place them in a dangerous situation. It was also argued that the inferior economic position of the Malays would be emphasised by the entry of even more rich Chinese, setting the stage for major discontent.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Malayans decided to resolve this by merging with Sabah and Sarawak; both British colonies had large native populations whom the government considered "Malay". Under [[Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 160 of the Constitution]], most of them were not Malay; the natives were mainly [[animist]]s or [[Christian]]s instead of Muslims as required. To resolve this issue, the government expanded its informal definition of "Malay" to include these people.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabahans and Sarawakians could not see how they would benefit from merger. Many regarded Malaya as being only for the Malays, a group they did not include themselves in. The spectre of "Malaysia" — the inclusion of the phrase "Malay" being considered frightening — with its official religion of Islam and official language of Malay, did nothing to soothe their fears of "Malay domination". For merger to come about, they insisted the natives of Sabah and Sarawak be awarded the same privileges as Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[20-point agreement (Sabah)|20-point agreement]] between Sabah and the Malayan government, and a slightly different 18-point agreement by Sarawak, was later agreed upon. After much negotiation and a show of support from the British for merger, the impasse was resolved. Although natives of Borneo were denied the privileges of Malays, merger was effected on 16 September 1963.

==="Malaysian Malaysia!"===
{{Main|Malaysian Malaysia}}

In the [[Singapore general election, 1963|1963 Singapore state elections]], the Alliance challenged the governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) through the [[Singapore Alliance Party]]. UMNO politicians actively campaigned in Singapore for the Singapore Alliance, contending that Singaporean Malays were being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s under the Chinese-dominated, though ostensibly multiracial, PAP government. However, all of the UMNO-backed Malay candidates lost to the PAP. The PAP politicians, who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with the Alliance not to contest elections in Malaya and Singapore (respectively), decided to run on the mainland in the [[Malaysian general election, 1964|1964 general election]]. Although the PAP attracted large crowds at its rallies, it won only one seat — that by [[Devan Nair]], who represented the [[Bangsar]] constituency. It is thought by some historians that Finance Minister and MCA President [[Tan Siew Sin]]'s appeal to the Chinese to avoid challenging the Malay special rights and risk merger with Indonesia helped the MCA retain its status as the "undisputed leader of the Chinese in the Malayan peninsula".&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, UMNO leaders were furious with the PAP.&lt;ref&gt;Goh, Cheng Teik (1994).

Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-475-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spark"&gt;{{cite web|author=Goh, Jenny|date=23 July 1997|url=http://sam11.moe.gov.sg/racialharmony/teachers_03.html|title=Small spark can create big mess|work=Straits Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325194847/http://sam11.moe.gov.sg/racialharmony/teachers_03.html|archivedate =2006-03-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lee Kuan Yew.jpg|thumb|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the leader of the Singapore government, publicly opposed ''ketuanan Melayu'', and propagated his idea of a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]".]]

New problems soon cropped up. [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the leader of the Singaporean government and the PAP, declared his open opposition to ''ketuanan Melayu'', calling for a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]" instead of the implied Malay Malaysia.&lt;ref name="iseas"/&gt; He argued that "Malays began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago. Of the 39% Malays in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like ([[Syed Jaafar Albar]]), who came to Malaya from [[Indonesia]] just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour."&lt;ref&gt;Ye, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee later lamented: "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... [once] emotions are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will have the kind of warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?"&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee exacerbated deteriorating [[PAP-UMNO relations]] by constantly demanding that the federal government "smack down their '[[ultra (Malaysia)|ultras]]'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as [[Syed Jaafar Albar]] and [[Syed Nasir Ismail]].&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's statements upset many, especially Alliance politicians. Tan Siew Sin called him the "greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mimposib.html "'Impossible to co-operate with Singapore while Lee is Premier'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310003615/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mimposib.html |date=10 March 2005 }}. (2 June 1965). ''[[Straits Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tunku considered Lee too extremist in his views, while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply pandering to [[Malaysian Chinese]] with his rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Khaw, Ambrose (1998). [http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/lifeline/akimpos.html "This man is making too much noise"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522214050/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/lifeline/akimpos.html |date=22 May 2006 }}. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's statement about allegedly recent Malay migration met with stinging rebuttals; Albar declared: "To say that the Malays are in the same category as other races is an insult..." The UMNO newspaper ''Malaya Merdeka'' warned: "If the Malays are hard-pressed and their interests are not protected," they would merge Malaysia with [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this that the Tunku feared the most. To him, the ultras were not the real extremists — it was those who sought a "Greater Indonesia" to "fix" the Chinese that were the real threat.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strain in race relations led to the Singaporean [[1964 Race Riots]],&lt;ref name="spark"/&gt; which PAP Malay politician [[Othman Wok]] later insinuated were planned beforehand by the [[ultra (Malaysia)|ultras]].&lt;ref&gt;Veloo, Ravi (25 January 1997). [http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/ref/race.html "Othman Wok on race relations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502022606/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/ref/race.html |date=2 May 2015 }}. ''Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: "If I had been going round and saying what [he] has been saying — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be? But I keep on reminding the people that I am a Malaysian. I am learning ''Bahasa Kebangsaan'' [Malay, the national language] and I accept [[Article 153]] of the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee insisted that he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153, saying: "if the immigrant communities ... do not see the problems, if they can't feel what it is like to be a poor Malay, and don't feel for him, then I can say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (1998). ''The Singapore Story'', p. 598. Marshall Cavendish Editions. {{ISBN|981-204-983-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a "Malaysian Malaysia" implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 72–73, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senu Abdul Rahman]], a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" Lee answered: "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 179–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the ''bangsa asing'' (aliens) or ''orang tumpangan'' (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member [[Lim Swee Aun]] insisting "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some went against the common view held in UMNO. [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] told Parliament that "...both the Alliance and the PAP subscribe to the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia," but differed in their methods. Ismail characterised the PAP's approach as "non-communalism straightaway," while the Alliance required "two steps. First, inter-racial harmony; second, and ultimate state of non-communalism." Such statements were dismissed by Lee as [[wikt:lip service|lip service]] that could not be taken seriously unless the ultras were reined in.&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josey, pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation===
Lee continued his campaign, forming the [[Malaysian Solidarity Council]] (MSC) comprising multi-racial parties such as the PAP, the [[People's Progressive Party (Malaysia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) and the [[United Democratic Party (Malaysia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) in 1965. At the MSC's first and only general meeting, several leaders from these parties gave speeches supporting a Malaysian Malaysia. [[D.R. Seenivasagam]] of the PPP accused the Alliance of using Article 153 to "bully non-Malays", while [[Ong Kee Hui]] of the [[Sarawak United People's Party]] (SUPP) said that "We see an attitude of intolerance and mounting signs of denial of political equality to people who are non-Malays. For the sake of our country and ourselves, this must be stopped and the drift to narrow racialism checked. Political equality should be accorded to all who live here and make this country their home, irrespective of their racial origin."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 616–617.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, UMNO [[backbencher]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] attacked Lee in Parliament: "[The Singaporean Chinese] have never known Malay rule and cannot bear the idea that the people they have so long kept under their heels should now be in a position to rule them."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [when Malay becomes the sole national language]. The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 612–613.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the Tunku — fed up with all the politicking and convinced that any further clashes of rhetoric would only degenerate into violence — asked Singapore to secede. Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, with Lee as its first [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ooi, Jeff|year=2005|url=http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/11/i_went_into_act.php|title=Perils of the sitting duck|accessdate=11 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125194719/http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/11/i_went_into_act.php|archivedate=2005-11-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Article 152 of the [[Constitution of Singapore]] names the Malays as "indigenous people" of Singapore and mandates special safeguarding of their rights and privileges, the article does not specify any policies for such safeguarding.

Some later blamed the formation of Malaysia for strengthening ''ketuanan Melayu'': "A reinforcement of Malay rights — which during the previous five or six years [prior to the formation of Malaysia] had been withering away as the Reid Commission might have suspected they would — took place against a background of general unequal treatment" after Malaysia's formation.&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==13 May and the New Economic Policy==

===Issues of language===
The Constitution specified a ten-year delay after independence in changing the national language from English to Malay. As the scheduled date in 1967 drew near some Chinese began to agitate for a more liberal language policy permitting some instances of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] in public affairs. Extremists from UMNO and [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] lashed out against them, but the Alliance proposed a compromise in the National Language Bill establishing Malay as the official language, but permitting English under certain circumstances and the use of non-Malay languages for non-official purposes. The Tunku described it as "a course guaranteeing peace",&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Bill was widely derided by many Malays, who formed the National Language Action Front in hope of repealing or amending it. The leadership of the Tunku was also openly questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===13 May===
{{Main|13 May Incident}}

In 1969, a [[Malaysian general election, 1969|general election]] was held. It was the first to be contested on a major scale by non-Malay-based opposition parties, other than the 1964 election where the PAP challenged the Alliance in Peninsular Malaysia. The two main opposition parties on this front in 1969 were the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) — the Malaysian successor to the PAP, widely seen as Chinese-based — and the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia]] (Gerakan), an ostensibly multiracial party led by former MCA stalwart, [[Lim Chong Eu]], and other [[middle-class]] intellectuals like [[Tan Chee Khoon]] and [[Syed Hussein Alatas]]. Both proposed policies on language, education, and Malay rights that were diametrically opposed to those of the government, with the DAP continuing where Lee Kuan Yew had left off with the "Malaysian Malaysia" campaign. Some, mostly from the DAP, called for the elevation of [[English language|English]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Tamil (language)|Tamil]] to official language status, along with Malay. Stronger government support for the Chinese education stream was also demanded.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 74, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAS, on the other hand, attempted to garner votes by accusing UMNO of selling out the Malays' indigenous rights to "[[pendatang asing]]". When the results were released, PAS had made minor inroads, but the DAP and Gerakan managed to topple the Alliance from power in three states, and nearly eradicated the Alliance's traditional two-thirds majority in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of these gains came at the expense of the MCA, which soon announced that it would not participate in the new government after the election, as the MCA no longer had a mandate to represent Chinese interests in the government. The jubilant DAP and Gerakan organised victory parades in the national capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]] on 11 and 12 May, where participants taunted the Malays while bearing slogans such as "Semua Melayu kasi habis" ("Finish off all the Malays"). An apology was issued soon after the rallies. Nevertheless, the shocked Malays blamed Chinese voters for betraying "the Alliance formula by voting for an opposition that had revived fundamental questions of language and Malay special rights".&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malay extremists welcomed the MCA's move, feeling an UMNO- and Malay-dominated government would better serve their purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, Boo Teik (1995). ''Paradoxes of Mahathirism'', p. 22. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|967-65-3094-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maidin, Zainuddin (1994). ''The Other Side of Mahathir'', pp. 19–21. Utusan Publications &amp; Distributors. {{ISBN|967-61-0486-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO held its own rally, which soon became a riot, on 13 May. This would later be euphemistically labelled as the "[[13 May Incident]]". UMNO supporters gathered at Harun's house on the evening of 13 May, where the rally was due to start, with many brandishing [[Parang (knife)|parang]]s ([[machete]]s) and other weapons. Some leaders condemned the "insults" of the "infidels" at the previous victory parades, calling the counter-rally a means "to teach the Chinese a lesson" for challenging Malay supremacy. Soon, the crowd began attacking passing Chinese motorists, and launched [[arson]] attacks on Chinese homes and shops. The rioting spread, and, despite the military being called in, continued for another two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kamarudin, Raja Petra|year=2000|url=http://www.freeanwar.net/news/facnews160900b.html|title=A Reporter's Account of an Interview With Tunku Abdul Rahman On 13 May Incident|accessdate=10 April 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615215054/http://www.freeanwar.net/news/facnews160900b.html|archivedate =2006-06-15|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the riots, [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] was suspended, and a state of national emergency was declared. A [[National Operations Council]] (NOC) was formed to oversee the administration of the country under emergency rule. Although the rioting had died down, tensions continued to simmer. A non-Malay boycott of Malay goods and services received "near total" support, while many Malays, such as [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and [[Raja Muktaruddin Daim]] began calling for an [[autocracy]] led by UMNO alone, and the removal of the Tunku. According to some sources, one group of "ultras", comprising [[Syed Nasir Ismail]], [[Musa Hitam]], and [[Tengku Razaleigh]], felt that the power-sharing Constitution had failed, and agreed that the country had to be "returned" to the Malays. They allegedly agreed to summon Mahathir to Kuala Lumpur, where he led his anti-Tunku campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Von Vorys, Karl (1975). ''Democracy without Consensus: Communalism and Political Stability in Malaysia'', p. 317. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-07571-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahathir wrote an [[open letter]] to the Tunku, accusing him of "giving the Chinese what they demand ... you have given them too much face." Soon, students at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations, calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore "Malay sovereignty". Sporadic rioting, believed to have been instigated by the Tunku's opponents, broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of bowing to their demands, the Tunku had Mahathir and Musa Hitam expelled from UMNO. The Minister of Home Affairs, [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]], alleged that "These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution. ... Polarisation has taken place in Malaysian politics and the extreme racialists among the ruling party are making a desperate bid to topple the present leadership."&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Malay Dilemma'' and New Economic Policy===
{{Main|Malaysian New Economic Policy}}

Mahathir spent his political exile writing ''[[The Malay Dilemma]]'', where he contended "that the Malays are the original or indigenous people of Malaya and the only people who can claim Malaya as their one and only country. In accordance with practice all over the world, this confers on the Malays certain inalienable rights over the forms and obligations of citizenship which can be imposed on citizens of non-indigenous origin." (Referring to the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]].)&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad, Mahathir bin (1970). ''The Malay Dilemma'', p. 133. Times Books International. {{ISBN|981-204-355-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahathir expressed discomfort with "far too many non-Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays"&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; when "...suddenly it has dawned upon the Malay that he cannot even call Malaya his land. There is no more ''Tanah Melayu'' — land of the Malays. He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And as if this is not enough, he is being asked to give up more and more of his share of influence."&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the "definitive people" line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment."&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bumi discount mod.jpg|frame|Under the NEP, Bumiputra [[real estate]] purchases were subsidised.]]

Mahathir and Musa Hitam later rejoined UMNO and the government under [[Tun Abdul Razak]], the second Prime Minister, whose [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), was based on some of the reforms Mahathir's book had advocated. The NEP's stated goal was elimination of "the identification of race with economic function".&lt;ref&gt;Musa, M. Bakri (1999). ''The Malay Dilemma Revisited'', p. 113. Merantau Publishers. {{ISBN|1-58348-367-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, it targeted a 30% share of the economy for the "Bumiputra" — "sons of the soil," a term referring to Malays and other indigenous peoples — by 1990. This became known as the "30 per cent solution" setting the "Bumiputra quota" for many items, including new public share listings and new private housing schemes. Certain commentators alleged that this fostered "a close to '[[zero-sum]]' attitude chiefly between the Malays and Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEP's stated aim, however, was not to directly redistribute wealth but to enlarge the economic pie while providing a larger share of the gains for Malays, thus increasing participation in the economy for all.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main rationale for the NEP as set out in the [[Second Malaysia Plan]] was to address the "economic imbalance" between the Chinese and Malays. In 1969, the Malay share of equity reportedly stood at 1.5% while the Chinese held 22.8%; the rest was largely in foreign hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Some detractors argued that while the Chinese share of the economy had increased at the Malays' expense, more significant growth in inequality had occurred between the richest and poorest Malays — between 1957 and 1970, the wealthiest 20% of Malays' share in the Malay portion of the economy reportedly increased from 42.5% to 52.5% while the poorest 40% saw a decrease from 19.5% to 12.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Hilley, John (2001). ''Malaysia: Mahathirism, Hegemony and the New Opposition'', p. 33. Zed Books. {{ISBN|1-85649-918-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOC issued a report of its own analysing the root causes of the 13 May violence, suggesting that even in the civil service, a traditional Malay employer, non-Malays outnumbered the Malays in many areas, with substantial Malay majorities only in the Police and Armed Forces. The report concluded: "Allegations that the non-Malays are excluded are regarded by the Malays as deliberate distortion. The Malays who already felt excluded in the country's economic life, now began to feel a threat to their place in the public services. No mention was ever made by non-Malay politicians of the almost closed-door attitude to the Malays by non-Malays in large sections of the private sector in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Ongkili, p. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Second Malaysia Plan, the NEP aimed to "create a Malay commercial and industrial community" through "wholly owned enterprises and joint ventures". Prior to this, the government had, in the words of a local economist, played "administrative, supportive, and regulatory" roles in attempting to address the economic imbalance, but avoided "represent[ing] direct and active efforts in promoting" Malay interests.&lt;ref name="hwang_113"&gt;Hwang, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the government would not only "[limit] access of the Chinese and Indian population to universities, public jobs and public money," but also actively intervene in the economy to give "[the Bumiputra] a bigger piece of the business action".&lt;ref name="pedersen_53"&gt;Abdullah &amp; Pedersen, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of this increased intervention was that UMNO supposedly "became a major beneficiary of the expanded role of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been limited [[affirmative action]] programmes before. However, these mostly focused on the civil service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission to higher education was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies, minimising economic intervention.&lt;ref name="iseas"/&gt; Although some agencies, such as the [[Rural Industrial Development Agency]] (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay [[entrepreneurs]], existed, their programs were criticised as being based on [[handout]]s and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]] (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, pp. 97–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the NEP was aimed at addressing economic imbalances, it soon became associated with ''ketuanan Melayu''. While the two were rarely directly equated, they were often mentioned together, with the implication that the NEP was derived from ''ketuanan Melayu''. The NEP's greater intervention in the economy led some to "equate UMNO's monolithic image as the undisputed champion of Malay supremacy with the party's ability to shore up lucrative business deals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kamarudin, Raja Petra|date=1 August 2005|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/MMblues/2005_08_01_MT_MMblues_archive.htm|title=Umno's relevance lies in ''Ketuanan Melayu''|work=[[Malaysia Today]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218114729/http://www.malaysia-today.net/MMblues/2005_08_01_MT_MMblues_archive.htm|archivedate=2006-02-18|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kamarudin, Raja Petra|date=26 September 2005|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/MMblues/2005_09_26_MT_MMblues_archive.htm|title=Article 153 of Malaysia's Federal Constitution|work=Malaysia Today|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218114809/http://www.malaysia-today.net/MMblues/2005_09_26_MT_MMblues_archive.htm|archivedate=2006-02-18|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad, Maznah (1999).

===Constitutional amendments and other policy changes===
[[File:MalaysianParliament.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] passed several amendments to the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]] soon after the [[13 May Incident]], limiting [[free speech]] and "[[Entrenchment clause|entrenching]]" certain articles related to [[Bumiputra]] special rights.]]

Parliament finally reconvened again in 1971. Although the NEP was passed without its approval, Parliament's consent was required to amend the Constitution. The government-tabled Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971, in conjunction with some amendments to the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]],&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; limited freedom of speech on "sensitive issues" such as the national language, Malay special rights, the Malay rulers, and the provisions for citizenship. These restrictions also applied to Members of Parliament, over-ruling their previous [[Parliamentary immunity]]. The amendments also clarified Article 152's meaning, and included the "natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak" under Article 153, extending the formerly Malay-only rights to all [[Bumiputra]].&lt;ref name="khoo_104"&gt;Khoo, p. 104– 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King) could now direct any [[university]] or [[college]] to implement a proportion-based [[racial quota|quota]] system favouring the Bumiputra. All higher educational institutions immediately enacted quota systems on the orders of the Education Ministry; some later questioned the move's constitutionality on the grounds that the King himself had not issued any directive.&lt;ref&gt;Trinidade, F.A. &amp; Lee, H.P. (eds., 1986). ''The Constitution of Malaysia: Further Perspectives and Developments'', pp. 48–49. Penerbit Fajar Bakti. {{ISBN|967-65-0030-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To cap all this, the amendment of articles touching on the "sensitive issues" mentioned, as well as the clause governing this rule on amendments, was forbidden without the consent of the [[Conference of Rulers]]. Effectively entrenching the "sensitive" Articles, this was heavily criticised by opposition MPs. It was claimed that if Parliament could be prevented from discussing particular issue, [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] was undermined. It was also unclear if the ban from speaking on "sensitive issues" applied to the ban itself. Nevertheless, the provisions were passed.&lt;ref name="khoo_104"/&gt; The [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), which effectively allows the government to detain anyone it deems a threat to national security for an indefinite period without [[judicial review]], was also amended in 1971 to stress the "preservation of intercommunal harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these changes saw fierce opposition in Parliament and abroad. When the proposed changes were first announced, the British press charged they would "preserve as immutable the [[feudal system]] dominating Malay society" by "giving this archaic body of petty constitutional monarchs incredible blocking power". The censorship of sensitive issues was labelled as paradoxical when contrasted with Tun Abdul Razak's speaking of "the full realization that important matters must no longer be swept under the carpet..."&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Fred (8 November 1969). "Malaysia unity call against a background of fear", p. 7. ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics argued that Article 153 was nothing more than a "paper rice bowl", and in any case, did not even include the ''[[orang asli]]'' (native people) or aborigines within the scope of its privileges, rendering its rationale somewhat suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important policy change came in the field of education. In 1970, the government made Malay the medium of instruction for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, replacing English. Although government funding for the Chinese and Tamil education streams continued, many non-Malays considered this new policy to be "the most discriminatory" thus far. The government's rationale was that this would provide better educational opportunities for the Malays, especially those who formerly had to make the transition from Malay-medium primary and secondary schools to English-medium universities. It was also argued that uniting students under one language would provide for greater racial harmony, while indirectly underscoring the "Malay nature of the state".&lt;ref name="hwang_113"/&gt;

The same year that the medium of instruction was changed to Malay, the [[National Culture Policy]] (NCP) was announced. [[Syed Nasir Ismail]] described the government's policies as aimed at creating a "Bumiputra Muslim identity" (''identiti Islam Kebumiputraan'') for Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;b. Maaruf, Shaharuddin (1984). ''Concept of a Hero in Malay Society'', p. 122. Eastern Universities Press. {{ISBN|9971-71-204-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the NCP's goal was to eventually assimilate the non-indigenous peoples into an indigenous Malaysian identity. Despite stiff opposition from Chinese pressure groups, the government refused to withdraw the NCP.&lt;ref&gt;Hilley, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; To foster national unity, the [[Rukunegara]], or national ideology, was also introduced. Although the Rukunegara itself contains no references to ''ketuanan Melayu'' or the social contract, a government commentary mentioned the "position of Malays and other Natives, the legitimate interests of the other communities, and the conferment of citizenship" as key aspects of the Constitution while insisting: "No citizen should question the loyalty of another citizen on the ground that he belongs to a particular community." One political pundit described it as a formal declaration of the social contract or "Racial Bargain".&lt;ref&gt;Means, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and "Malay dominance"===
The old Alliance model, where each race was represented by one party, was repudiated with the formation of the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN, or the National Front) in 1974. Several former opposition parties, including Gerakan, the PPP and PAS, joined the UMNO-led BN. Although the MCA and MIC were included, their influence was diluted by other non-Malay parties in the coalition. In 1977, PAS' expulsion left UMNO as the sole Malay representative in BN, although some ostensibly multiracial parties provided token Malay representation.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 115, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; After its departure, PAS took a different approach to Malay privileges, denouncing the NEP as racial discrimination and "unIslamic".&lt;ref&gt;Musa, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Mahathir was appointed as a Minister in Tun Razak's Cabinet. He became the Deputy Prime Minister just two years later, under [[Tun Hussein Onn]], who had succeeded Tun Razak upon the latter's sudden death.&lt;ref name="khoo_35"&gt;Khoo, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s — the heyday of the NEP — "Malay dominance" was a largely accepted fact of life for Malaysians.&lt;ref name="khoo_35"/&gt; Whereas the 1957 to 1969 period was viewed as a time when "Malay dominance" was at least tempered by a form of "inter-ethnic bargaining" within the Alliance government, from the 13 May Incident onwards, political pundits argued that the political environment was now under marked "hegemonic control" from the Malays and UMNO;&lt;ref name="hwang_10"&gt;Hwang, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970, one Cabinet member pronounced that Malay special rights would remain for "hundreds of years to come".&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Kit Siang (1978). ''Time Bombs in Malaysia'', p. 218 (2nd ed.). Democratic Action Party. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tunku observed in 1977 that "it appears in the minds of the [[non-Bumiputras]] that they are being turned into second-class citizens in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Hickling, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The government's ethnic policies continued to be based on and justified by the two basic arguments Mahathir had applied in his ''Dilemma''; the "historical" status of Malay primacy over Malaya, and the "special needs" of the Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Ye, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; As public discussion or questioning of these issues had been criminalised, there were few locally published works critically discussing Malay supremacy, complicating attempts to evaluate it or establish further grounds for government policy beyond the main two traditionally put forth.

The ''ultras'' who had allegedly plotted to exploit the post-13 May chaos were now in control of the country. Razaleigh, the Finance Minister, was hailed as the "Father of the [[Bumiputra]] Economy" .&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Musa Hitam and Mahathir, both rising stars on the political scene, maintained their image as "ultras", although it is unclear if this was their intention. Journalist [[K. Das]] once claimed Musa had told him "that a young Malaysian politician has to [[race card|play the race card]] to the hilt even if there was not a single chauvinistic bone in his body."&lt;ref&gt;Khoo, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring, Musa said that "the national leaders tend to look for a [[scapegoat]] when faced with a desperate crisis situation" and use racial tactics to fill their "empty stomach".&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

UMNO Youth in particular maintained its "ultra" image from the 1960s. One of its Vice-Presidents said in response to discussion of opening different teams in UMNO based on political ideology that "The original cause of UMNO is to fight for the interests of the Malay race and this must continue. We do not want factions in UMNO."&lt;ref&gt;b. Maaruf, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, [[Tun Hussein Onn]] announced that he would be handing power over to Mahathir due to poor health. Mahathir took office in 1981, with Musa Hitam as his deputy.

==Mahathir administration==

===Affirmative action and Chinese protests===
[[File:Mahathir bin Mohamad.jpg|thumb| The longest-serving Prime Minister of Malaysia [[Mahathir Mohamad]].]]
{{Main|Operation Lalang|1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis}}

The affirmative action policies of the NEP continued under Mahathir. Political pundits considered this administration, in its early period, to be a continuation of the "hegemonic control" of Malaysian politics by the Malays, and by UMNO in particular.&lt;ref name="hwang_10"/&gt; During this time, Mahathir focused on consolidating his power within UMNO and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there was little active confrontation between the Malays and the non-Malays on the issue of ''ketuanan Melayu'' at the time.

In 1981, the MCA assessed the NEP and other government policies from a Chinese point of view. Its findings expressed concern over a number of problems, including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay-dominated civil service, claiming the NEP's goal of eradicating identification of race with economic function had been abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Koon Swan (1982). Introduction. In Federal Territory MCA Liaison Committee (Ed.), ''Malaysian Chinese'', pp. vii–xi. Eastern Universities Press. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was argued that non-Malays were under-represented in Parliament and the Cabinet because of [[gerrymandering]]; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies, despite the total population of urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones.&lt;ref&gt;Yeoh, Michael Oon Kheng (1982). The Politics of Under-Representation. In Federal Territory MCA Liaison Committee (Ed.), ''Malaysian Chinese'', pp. 61–71. Eastern Universities Press. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt; However, UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA over the issue.

Tensions rose after the [[Malaysian general election, 1986|1986 general election]] when it appeared that UMNO on its own commanded a working Parliamentary majority, allowing it to govern without the support of other parties. Several UMNO leaders seriously discussed the possibility of governing alone; one, [[Abdullah Ahmad]], publicly espoused permanent Malay supremacy and relegating non-Malays to second-class citizenship. Such calls for unilateralism were eventually disregarded, and the Barisan Nasional government continued. However, some UMNO officials warned non-Malay parties to avoid "playing with fire" by questioning the Malays' special rights and privileges or ''Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu''. At the UMNO General Assembly that year, Mahathir stated: "We do not wish to rob other people of their rights. But let no one try to rob us of our rights." When Parliament reconvened, the DAP began raising objections to what they alleged was the division of Malaysians into "first and second class citizens". In response, some UMNO MPs began referring to the non-Malays as ''[[pendatang asing]]'' (foreign immigrants, or aliens) in Parliament. When the DAP attempted to enquire about the distribution of economic equity among the races to evaluate the NEP's progress, the Standing Orders of Parliament were amended to forbid such inquiries. This led the DAP to allege that the NEP's aims had been met, and that it could be allowed to expire in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as [[Petaling Jaya]] city councillor [[Richard Yeoh]], believe that Abdullah Ahmad, an aide of Mahathir's, was the first to use the term "''ketuanan Melayu''". Yeoh described the context in which Ahmad used it as "a fairly benign speech and most of us might have had no problem with it, but it has been taken to mean Malay supremacy by some Umno leaders who don't necessarily know what it means."&lt;ref name="flay"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Aidila | last=Razak | authorlink= | title=Forum speakers flay 'Ketuanan Melayu' | date=12 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://malaysiakini.com/news/119722 | work=Malaysiakini | pages= | accessdate=10 February 2010 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210162113/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/119722 | archive-date=10 February 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic tension continued to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]] for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several [[deposit-taking co-operative]]s (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government to bail out the DTCs, citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President [[Lee Kim Sai]] to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. [[Anwar Ibrahim]], then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 149–150, 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gerakan, MCA and DAP held rallies and boycotted classes in Chinese primary schools to protest the move;&lt;ref name="hwang_151"&gt;Hwang, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO Youth held its own rallies to assert ''ketuanan Melayu'', hosting banners with slogans such as "revoke the citizenship of those who opposed the Malay rulers", "13 May has begun", and "soak it [the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', a Malay dagger] with Chinese blood".&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Kit Siang (2000). [http://www.limkitsiang.com/archive/2000/dec00/lks0596.htm "GPMS' extremist demands - a prelude to escalation of ethnic tensions to justify another Operation Lalang mass crackdown to shore up Mahathir and UMNO's tottering position?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223141706/http://www.limkitsiang.com/archive/2000/dec00/lks0596.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}.

Retrieved 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The flames were fanned further when in an unrelated incident, a Malay soldier ran amok in a predominantly Chinese area, killing one and injuring another two.&lt;ref name="hwang_151"/&gt;

The government then launched [[Operation Lalang]] (Weeding Operation), detaining 55 people under the ISA. More were arrested over the next few months. Although most were opposition politicians — including Parliamentary Opposition Leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] — a few from BN were included. All BN politicians were released from detention after two months, while those from the opposition remained in custody for much longer. The government later justified these detentions on grounds of security, stating that the detainees had played up the issue of Chinese education to incite racial sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Mahathir's supporters saw this as a vindication of his rejection of the Tunku's "compromise" with the non-Malays, teaching the non-Malays not to criticise the government and its pro-Malay policies.&lt;ref&gt;Maidin, pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics did not take this explanation seriously. UMNO was in crisis at the time, with Mahathir's faction narrowly defeating [[Razaleigh]]'s in the party elections. Razaleigh's supporters filed a [[lawsuit]] alleging irregularities in the election process which appeared likely to succeed, triggering new party elections. In this context, one MCA politician charged that the government had pursued a "hidden agenda," deflecting public attention from UMNO's crisis with a "deviation in the implementation of the Chinese education policy." The Tunku himself claimed that Mahathir used the issue to mobilise the Malays "as a united force to a common enemy — and the imaginary enemy in this case was the Chinese community."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KualaLumpurAbdulSamadBldg.jpg|thumb|The Lord President of the Supreme Court, [[Salleh Abas]], was sacked by Mahathir soon after he agreed to hear the appeal of Mahathir's opponents within UMNO.]]

In the end, Mahathir's camp "won" the court case when it was held that as the party was an illegal organisation under the Societies Act due to some of its branches not being formally registered, the [[plaintiff]]s' case was invalid; an illegal society could not hold new elections for its leaders. Mahathir immediately set up "UMNO (Baru)" (New UMNO), transferring all of old UMNO's assets to the new party. Most of his supporters also joined UMNO (Baru), and eventually the "(Baru)" was dropped, making it, for all intents and purposes, the same as the old UMNO. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal on the case, the government suspended and later sacked Lord President [[Salleh Abas]] and five other Supreme Court judges, triggering the [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]]. The new Supreme Court later dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 161–162, 164–165, 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Razaleigh then formed the [[Semangat 46]] (Spirit of '46) party to challenge the government. In the [[Malaysian general election, 1990|1990 general election]], ''ketuanan Melayu'' was used as an issue, with UMNO accusing [[Semangat 46]], [[PAS (political party)|PAS]], the DAP and other opposition parties of conspiring to end Malay supremacy. The government also repeatedly warned that the 13 May riots would be repeated if it did not maintain its two-thirds majority in Parliament. Full-page advertisements depicting bloodshed and carnage were published in major national newspapers. Tensions rose further when the Tunku called on voters to support Semangat 46 instead of the new UMNO, with several UMNO politicians demanding that his title of "Bapa Kemerdekaan" (Father of Independence) be withdrawn, and his statue removed from Parliament House. Despite this, the government retained its two-thirds Parliamentary majority, with Semangat 46 winning only eight seats.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 186, 192–194, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviewing and reworking economic policies===
Prior to the expiration of the NEP in 1990, there was much debate over whether the policy should be renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether. The government organised an official review of the NEP in the years leading up to its expiration. The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to [[political corruption]] and other inefficiencies.

One point of dispute was the calculation of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; "[[Ali Baba (Malaysia)|Ali Baba]]" arrangements with "the Malay [Ali] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [Baba] ran the business," were prevalent. Some suggested that the NEP "might have worked, if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes. But more often than not, he just wanted to be rich."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some said the disbursement of shares favoured the politically connected, many of whom immediately sold the shares at market price, reaping the [[arbitrage]] instead of holding on and increasing the Malay share of equity, which the policy was intended to do. Although the NEP managed to create a class of Malay [[millionaire]]s, it was charged that this was mainly due to [[cronyism]], benefiting only the politically connected.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, pp. 178, 180, 181–182, 187, 259, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Some agreed, but argued against taking action; one PAS politician stated: "The Malays do not want justice to affect their interests."&lt;ref&gt;b. Maaruf, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have suggested that although most of the benefits under the NEP accrued to the politically connected, the government intended for them to "[[trickle-down effect|trickle down]] to the Malay masses", and also for the Malay [[nouveau riche]] to provide "entrepreneurial role models" for other Malays.&lt;ref name="pedersen_53"/&gt;

During the 1980s, concern continued to grow about discrimination in higher education. At this point, the Education Minister told Parliament of "dissatisfaction" and "disappointment" among non-Malays concerning "lessening opportunities" for higher education.&lt;ref name="trindade_lee_50"&gt;Trinidade &amp; Lee, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1997, then Education Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] defended the quotas as necessary, claiming that only 5% of all local undergraduates would be Malays if quotas were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism was that the NEP and other affirmative action had actually reduced the Malays' self-confidence, despite Mahathir's intention of building a Malay business class to serve as [[role model]]s for impoverished Malays. One Malay journalist opined: "[U]nder this New Economic Policy, no Bumiputra could ever be sure that such 'victories' as came his way were fully deserved."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEP was also criticised for seeking to improve the Malays' overall share of the economy, even if this share were to be held by a small number of Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Abang (2005). [http://aliran.com/archives/monthly/2005b/7d.html "UMNO: A threat to national prosperity"]. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some quarters accused the NEP of being too heavy-handed in its approach towards affirmative action, maintaining it had "deprived qualified non-Malays of opportunities for higher education and job promotions" and forcing many non-Malays to emigrate instead.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah &amp; Pedersen, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the impressions of the NEP as corrupt and associated with ''ketuanan Melayu'', led to "deep resentment", particularly among the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Branegan, Jay (20 August 1990). [http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir900820.html A Working Racial Bias]. ''[[TIME]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEP was criticised as "set[ting] those Malaysians so honoured with it above the rest, granting them the preferential treatment of the NEP," while "divid[ing] Malaysians into first- and second-class citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, pp. 98, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the NEP was replaced by the [[National Development Policy]] (NDP), which continued most of the NEP-era policies. The Malay share of the economy, though substantially larger, was not near the 30% target according to government figures. In its review of the NEP, the government found that although income inequality had been reduced, some important targets related to overall Malay corporate ownership had not been met. Both Mahathir and the Tunku had expressed concern that the Malays remained too reliant on the Chinese economically.&lt;ref&gt;Maidin, pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Putra, pp. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that the NEP had retarded economic growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP had managed to avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay [[middle class]] and improving [[standard of living|standards of living]] without compromising the non-Bumiputra share of the economy in absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that [[ethnic stereotype]]s had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution.&lt;ref name="pedersen_53"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ye pp. 85, 92, 94, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milne &amp; Mauzy, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Musa, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bangsa Malaysia'' and political liberalisation===
During the 1990s, Mahathir and UMNO made a public about-face on the government's cultural policies, with the formation of the ''[[Wawasan 2020]]'' (Vision 2020) and ''[[Bangsa Malaysia]]'' (Malaysian Race) plans. Mahathir named one obstacle to establishing Malaysia as a developed nation by the year 2020 as: "the challenge of establishing a matured, liberal and tolerant society in which Malaysians of all colours and creeds are free to practice and profess their customs, cultures and religious beliefs and yet feeling that they belong to one nation." Mahathir proposed the establishment of "one ''Bangsa Malaysia'' with political loyalty and dedication to the nation". After the government's [[Malaysian general election, 1995|1995 general election]] victory, Mahathir elaborated: "Bangsa Malaysia means people who are able to identify themselves with the country, speak ''[[Bahasa Malaysia]]'' (the Malaysian or Malay language) and accept the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahathir later explained that "The idea before was that people should become 100 per cent Malay in order to be Malaysian. We now accept that this is a multi-racial country. We should build bridges instead of trying to remove completely the barriers separating us." Such a dramatic change was perceived by the non-Malay communities as a "complete retraction" of earlier policies emphasising assimilation of non-Malays. The government took measures to stress this change, decreasing emphasis on Malay as the one and only national language by permitting local universities to use English as the medium of instruction for certain subjects. [[Diploma]]s from the MCA-sponsored and Chinese-majority [[Tunku Abdul Rahman College]] (TARC) were officially recognised by the government for employment in the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 246–247, 248–249, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, religions other than [[Islam]] were given airtime on state [[radio]] and [[television]], although they were not allowed to proselytise.&lt;ref&gt;Milne &amp; Mauzy, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lion dance]]s — a traditional Chinese performance which had been banned for decades — were not only permitted but even attended by Mahathir and other top government officials.&lt;ref name="hwang_249"&gt;Hwang, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the early 1990s saw marked economic growth, commentators suggested that Mahathir's liberal policies had played the key role in his popularity and the Barisan Nasional's landslide 1995 election victory. One pundit wrote that "Most Malaysians could not remember a time of greater prosperity or lesser inter-ethnic recrimination.&amp;nbsp;... Economic indicators alone would not have captured the pride that Malaysians had discovered, perhaps for [the] first time, in being Malaysian."&lt;ref&gt;Hilley, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim Kit Siang attributed the opposition's defeat to Mahathir's liberalism and the government's adoption of the DAP's stance on issues like "language, culture and education". Some, however, doubted Mahathir's sincerity. One UMNO Youth official suggested that "The Barisan government's flexible move&amp;nbsp;... only shows that we are enjoying the highest level of tolerance purely based on the level of confidence in terms of political and economic position of the Malays. We share the political power with the Chinese. When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese. So, why shouldn't we allow that? We can&amp;nbsp;... achieve a win-win situation. This is a purely political move.&amp;nbsp;... Similarly we [[UMNO|UMNO Youth]] have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.&amp;nbsp;... However, those finished agendas that we have done, such as Islam, ''Bahasa Melayu'' [the Malay language] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, pp. 209, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of the 1990s, government policies were loosened to combat the [[Asian economic crisis]] by encouraging foreign investment. In 1999, a new opposition party supported by Mahathir's former deputy, [[Anwar Ibrahim]] (who had been jailed for [[sodomy]] after his controversial sacking) led to a revival of the "13 May" warnings. However, the government maintained its Parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;Kamarudin, Raja Petra. [http://www.freeanwar.net/news/tenth_general_elections.html "An Analysis of Malaysia's 1999 Tenth General Elections"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907073630/http://www.freeanwar.net/news/tenth_general_elections.html |date=7 September 2006 }}. Retrieved 11 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Mahathir officially resigned as Prime Minister, and was succeeded by his deputy, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]].

==Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, meritocracy, and ''ketuanan Melayu''==

===A new Prime Minister===
[[File:Abdullah badawi.jpg|frame|After [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] succeeded Mahathir as the Prime Minister of Malaysia, ''Ketuanan Melayu'' was introduced into the national [[secondary school]] [[curriculum]].]]

Prior to Abdullah's ascension in 2003, although ''ketuanan Melayu'' had been enunciated by several prominent Malay leaders, it had not been given a proper name. Around this time, the term "ketuanan Melayu" — "tuan" being the Malay word for "lord" or "master" — came into common usage, even entering the government-approved secondary school [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lim, Guan Eng|year=2005|url=http://dapmalaysia.org/english/2005/may05/lge/lge109.htm|title='Merdeka' Constitution Driving Force Towards National Unity|accessdate=19 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821144200/http://dapmalaysia.org/english/2005/may05/lge/lge109.htm|archivedate =2007-08-21|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]] professor of sociology Norani Othman has said that the term is evocative of "notions of enslavement," since "In Malay classical terms, the word 'ketuanan' implies lordship over captives, which is a pre-feudal concept that is out of sync in 1957, 1963 and today."&lt;ref name="flay"/&gt;

A government-approved [[secondary school]] [[history]] [[textbook]] published in 2004 by [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]], the government-owned publishing company, defined ''ketuanan Melayu'' as:

:''Semangat cinta akan apa saja yang berkaitan dengan bangsa Melayu seperti hak [[politics|politik]], [[Malay Language|bahasa]], kebudayaan, warisan, adat istiadat dan [[Malaysia|tanah air]]. Semenanjung Tanah Melayu dianggap sebagai tanah pusaka orang Melayu.''&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Ramlah binti, Samuri, Abdul Hakim bin &amp; Fadzil, Muslimin bin (2004). ''Sejarah Tingkatan 3'', p. 45. Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. {{ISBN|983-62-8285-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[English language|English]] translation is as follows:

:A passion for all that is related to the Malay race, such as political rights, language, culture, heritage, tradition and the homeland. The [[Malay Peninsula|Malay peninsula]] is regarded as the Malays' land by birthright.

In 2003, the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) [[political party]] Youth Information Chief [[Azimi Daim]] stated: "In Malaysia, everybody knows that Malays are the masters of this land. We rule this country as provided for in the federal constitution. Any one who touches upon Malay affairs or criticizes Malays is [offending] our sensitivities."&lt;ref name="hornets"&gt;Gatsiounis, Ioannis (2 October 2004). [http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FJ02Ae05.html "Abdullah stirs a hornets' nest"]. ''Asia Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its proponents claimed that ''ketuanan Melayu'' was directly derived from Article 153 of the Constitution, the [[Reid Commission]] which drafted the framework for the Constitution had stated that the provisions for Malay privileges were to be temporary in nature, and eventually abolished, citing the only reason for their existence as tradition and economic necessity as a form of [[affirmative action]] for the Malays. Despite this, those who challenge ''ketuanan Melayu'' or "Malay rights" were still often berated, especially by politicians from UMNO.&lt;ref name="ooi"/&gt; Many UMNO politicians continued referring to non-Malays as "orang pendatang" or "[[pendatang asing]]" (foreign immigrants).

===Meritocracy===
Before leaving office, Mahathir had condemned Malays who relied on their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays to learn to live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Badawi, Abdullah Ahmad|year=2004|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/0/c3a7ebf8a2bd8cfd48256f180033b236?OpenDocument|title=Moving Forward — Towards Excellence|accessdate=11 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912054147/http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/0/c3a7ebf8a2bd8cfd48256f180033b236?OpenDocument|archivedate=2007-09-12|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His administration began the practice of [[meritocracy]], which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]] (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various [[matriculation]] courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.

Critics dismissed meritocracy as a sham, arguing that it was unfair to consider the two streams equivalent for admissions purposes. Though ostensibly open to non-Bumiputra, critics alleged that most who took matriculation were Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Yeoh, Oon (4 June 2004). [http://www.sun2surf.com/articlePrint.cfm?id=3441 "Meritocracy: The truth must be well told"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316064532/http://www.sun2surf.com/articlePrint.cfm?id=3441 |date=16 March 2005 }}.

Previously, the constitutionality of Malay- or Bumiputra-only matriculation courses had been questioned, as the amended Article 153 prohibited refusal of admission to students on grounds of race alone.&lt;ref name="trindade_lee_50"/&gt; As a result, matriculation courses were opened to non-Bumiputra. However, some in UMNO considered meritocracy too harsh on rural Malay students, disadvantaging them compared to their urban counterparts, and called for the restoration of quotas to avoid an "uneven playing field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=144240 "Johor Umno Says Meritocracy A Form Of Discrimination"]. (9 July 2005). ''BERNAMA''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2004 UMNO General Assembly, Deputy Permanent Chairman [[Badruddin Amiruldin]] waved a book on 13 May Incident, warning: "Fifty-eight years ago we had an agreement with the other races, in which we permitted them to ''menumpang'' [reside temporarily] on this land. ... Let no one from the other races ever question the rights of Malays on this land. Don't question the religion, because this is my right on this land." Then Higher Education Minister [[Shafie Salleh]] also declared at the assembly that non-Bumiputras would never be permitted to enter the [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] (UiTM), which is Bumiputra-only: "I will not compromise on this matter."&lt;ref name="hornets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noor, Farish A. (2005). ''From Majapahit to Putrajaya: Searching for Another Malaysia'', p. 241. Silver Fish Books. {{ISBN|983-3221-05-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then at the following year's General Assembly, Education Minister and UMNO Youth head [[Hishammuddin Hussein]] — the son of [[Tun Hussein Onn]] — brandished the ''[[Kris|keris]]'' while calling for the restoration of the NEP as part of the National Development Policy (NDP) that Mahathir had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;The [[:File:UMNO Flag Sang Saka Bangsa.png|flag of UMNO]] also contains the keris symbol.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hishammuddin, the ''keris'' symbolised the role of UMNO Youth in championing the Malay race. Meanwhile, his deputy, [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] — Abdullah Badawi's [[son-in-law]] — discussed the revival of the NEP in the form of a separate entity titled as the [[New National Agenda]] (NNA).&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, R. Surenthira &amp; Yusop, Husna (29 July 2005). [http://sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10420 Rebranding the NEP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208022546/http://sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10420 |date=8 December 2008 }}. ''The Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hishammuddin would later describe the ''keris'' as a "unifying symbol", stating that "The young people today no longer see it as a symbol to uphold ''ketuanan Melayu''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/08/hishammuddin-keris-is-unifying-symbol.htm|title=Hishammuddin: Keris is a unifying symbol|date=27 August 2006|work=New Straits Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902012907/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-n/2006/08/hishammuddin-keris-is-unifying-symbol.htm|archivedate=2006-09-02|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Racial politics"===
Chinese politicians within the government raised issues with the Constitution in late 2005. [[Lim Keng Yaik]] of Gerakan asked for a re-examination of the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] to ascertain whether ''[[Bangsa Malaysia]]'' could be achieved.&lt;ref name="new_controversy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ooi, Jeff|year=2005|url=http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/08/we_are_16_days.php|title=New controversy: Social Contract and Bangsa Malaysia|accessdate=12 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030165458/http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/08/we_are_16_days.php|archivedate=2005-10-30|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lim was severely criticised by many prominent Malay politicians, including [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] and [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]]. The Malay press, mostly owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Yusoff, Marzuki &amp; Samah, Nazeri Nong (14 August 2005). [http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/content.asp?y=2005&amp;dt=0815&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_03.htm "Kontrak sosial: Kenyataan Keng Yaik bercanggah Perlembagaan Persekutuan"]. ''Utusan Malaysia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lim responded: "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the '[[Negaraku]]' (national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart."&lt;ref name="new_controversy"/&gt;

A year earlier, Abdullah had mentioned the most "significant aspect" of the social contract as "the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians". Although Abdullah went on to state that the character of the nation changed to "one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Badawi, Abdullah Ahmad|year=2004|url=http://domino.kln.gov.my/kln/statemen.nsf/0/eee39330c19514e648256e7c0009f6ee?OpenDocument|title=The Challenges of Multireligious, Multiethnic and Multicultural Societies|accessdate=12 November 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225004256/http://domino.kln.gov.my/kln/statemen.nsf/0/eee39330c19514e648256e7c0009f6ee?OpenDocument|archivedate=2006-02-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the speech went largely unremarked. Finally, Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him. The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief Hishammuddin Hussein warning people not to "bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon, appreciated, understood and endorsed by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=150404 "Don't Raise Social Contract Issue, Umno Youth Chief Warns"]. (15 August 2005). ''[[BERNAMA]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the government announced a [[Rukunegara]] awareness campaign. The government press agency, ''[[BERNAMA]]'', quoted the Tunku as saying in 1986 that "The Malays are not only the natives but also the lords of this country and nobody can dispute this fact". The articles of the Constitution touching on the official religion of [[Islam]], the monarchy, the status of Malay as the national language, and Malay special rights were described as "clearly spell[ing] out the acknowledgment and recognition that the Malays are the indigenous 'pribumi' [natives] of this land." It was then stated that the new emphasis on the Rukunegara was to prevent further questioning of the social contract, which "decides on the political polarity and socio-economic standing of Malaysians".&lt;ref&gt;Ramly, Rosliwaty (25 January 2006). [http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=177338 Appreciating The Rukun Negara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324110139/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=177338 |date=24 March 2007 }}. ''[[BERNAMA]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a survey of Malaysians found that 55% of respondents agreed politicians should be "blamed for segregating the people by playing racial politics". [[Mukhriz Mahathir]] — Mahathir's son and an UMNO Youth leader — defended UMNO's actions because of economic disparities, insisting that "As long as that remains, there will always be people to champion each race to equalise things." [[Shahrir Abdul Samad]], the chairman of the BN Backbenchers' Club, argued that politicians were simply responding to "a country ... divided into different races," asking, "if you talk about Malay issues to the Malay community, is that playing racial politics?" [[M. Kayveas]], the President of the PPP, disagreed: "Every 12 months, the parties go back to one race championing their own causes and, at the end of the day, when the general election comes, we talk about 'Bangsa Malaysia'."&lt;ref&gt;"Racial politics. And so, who's to blame?", p. 12. (21 March 2006). ''[[New Straits Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Dilemma: The Political and Educational Marginality of the Malay Community.

The resulting diplomatic incident, with ensuing denials of marginalisation from Malaysian government politicians, led to Lee issuing an apology for his remarks which also attempted to justify them.

The following month, a controversy arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) issued a report calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% — a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%, used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP. One local analyst suggested that "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next question is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." The report's methodology was criticised for using [[market value]] instead of [[par value]] for its calculations of equity, and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies. It also included government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Abdul Razak &amp; Chow, Kum Hor (22 October 2006). "The nation's economic pie in perspective", pp. 20–21. ''New Sunday Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, however, criticised the government, alleging that par value did not accurately reflect the value of the enterprises studied, and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra-held.&lt;ref&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2006).

Retrieved 5 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was later withdrawn, but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30% mark in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Beh, Lih Yi (1 November 2006).

At the Johor UMNO convention that same month, Johor Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), [[Abdul Ghani Othman]], criticised the ''Bangsa Malaysia'' and "meritocracy" policies. Ghani described ''Bangsa Malaysia'' as a threat to the Malays and their Constitutional position, suggesting it could "threaten national stability" as well. Ghani insisted that the policy "be applied in the context ... with the Malays as the pivotal race", and described meritocracy as a "form of discrimination and oppression" because rural Malay students could not compete with their urban counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Nambiar, Ravi &amp; Nadzmi, Siti Nurbaiyah|date=6 November 2006|url=http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=539|title=Ghani: Bangsa Malaysia is rojak and unacceptable|page=10|work=New Straits Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161427/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=539|archivedate=2007-10-13|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting controversy about his remarks, several federal ministers criticised Ghani, with one saying that ''Bangsa Malaysia'' "has nothing to do with one race given a pivotal role over others", and another arguing that "It does not impinge on the rights of Bumiputeras or other communities."&lt;ref&gt;"'Rejection of concept affects integration efforts'", p. 7. (7 November 2006). ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghani stood by his comments, declaring that the proponents of ''Bangsa Malaysia'' were also advocating a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]", as Lee Kuan Yew had, even though "the government has rejected it from the start." Najib, the Deputy Prime Minister, suggested that any effort to define ''Bangsa Malaysia'' politically would be fruitless, and as such the debate was unnecessary; he also insisted that "It does not question the special rights of the Malays, our quota or anything of that sort."&lt;ref&gt;Nambiar, Ravi &amp; Nadzmi, Siti Nurbaiyah (7 November 2006).

''The Star''.&lt;/ref&gt; The UMNO Annual General Assembly that year was the first to be televised in full; it became a subject of controversy when delegates such as [[Hashim Suboh]] made speeches utilising heavy racial rhetoric; Hishammuddin, who had brandished the ''kris'' again, was asked by Hashim when he would "use it". After the assembly, Hishammuddin insisted that the ''kris'' was not a symbol of Malay supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tan, Joceline|date=26 November 2006|url=http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=985|title=Hisham: The keris is here to stay|work=Malaysia Today|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014171600/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=985|archivedate=2007-10-14|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Lee provoked more debate after suggesting that "If they (Malaysia) would just educate the Chinese and Indians, use them and treat them as their citizens, they can equal us (Singapore) and even do better than us and we would be happy to rejoin them." UMNO Information Chief [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]] responded, telling the press that Malaysia implemented policies to assist economically disadvantaged Malays, instead of neglecting them as Singapore did, stating also that at one point the Malays would have to compete on a level playing field with other Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Carolyn |last=Hong |title=Flap over MM's remarks on non-Malays |date=13 October 2007 |publisher=[[Malaysia Today]] |url=http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=9065 |website=The Straits Times |pages= |accessdate=13 October 2007 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013091228/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=9065 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political watershed===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], BN was returned to power for the first time without its customary 2/3 [[supermajority]] in the ''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'', meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without the support of opposition parties. The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent about the state of the country's economy and increasing ethnic tensions within the country; the three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government's response to widening economic disparities. The month after, the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non-Malays citizenship, the latter should not seek equality or special treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Andrew | last=Ong | title=Tengku Faris: Non-Malays should not seek equality | date=12 April 2008 | publisher=[[Malaysiakini]] | url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/81279 | work=Malaysiakini | pages= | accessdate=13 April 2008 | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, the prince also called for Malay unity to ensure that Malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=TENGKU MAHKOTA OF KELANTAN CALLS FOR MALAY UNITY |date=13 April 2008 |publisher=Yahoo!

[[Anwar Ibrahim]], former UMNO deputy President and former Deputy Prime Minister, whose [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and the ''de facto'' leader of the opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] coalition, chose to instead reject ''ketuanan Melayu'' in favour of "''ketuanan rakyat''" (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Azreen | last=Madzlan | title=Kampung Baru hails 'Ketuanan Rakyat' | date=15 April 2008 | publisher= | url=http://malaysiakini.com/news/81390 | work=Malaysiakini | pages= | accessdate=15 April 2008 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420040914/http://www.malaysiakini.com./news/81390 | archive-date=20 April 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, his wife [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], president of PKR, told the press that "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," urging instead the adoption of ''ketuanan rakyat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=See Hoh` |last=Kong |title=PKR to champion for 'Ketuanan Rakyat' |date=24 April 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=21746 |work=The Sun |pages= |accessdate=24 April 2008 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208022550/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=21746 |archivedate= 8 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long thereafter, Hishammuddin himself apologised for his brandishing of the ''keris'' at the three previous UMNO annual general assemblies, saying he was sorry "if it had affected the non-Malays". He refused to comment on whether he would repeat the act in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Kok Leong | last=Chan | title=Hisham apologises for keris act | date=25 April 2008 | publisher= | url=http://malaysiakini.com/news/81956 | work=Malaysiakini | pages= | accessdate=29 April 2008 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085007/http://malaysiakini.com/news/81956 | archive-date=16 May 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within UMNO; one media outlet described the reaction as such: "The sentiment among many in the party is that the Chinese and Indians betrayed the BN when they voted for Pakatan Rakyat. There is hurt. There is anger. So why should Hishammuddin be too concerned about what non-Malays think of the keris act?" Many felt that the apology itself threatened Malay supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Keris apology fans unrest in divided Umno |date=28 April 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/Keris-apology-fans-unrest-in-divided-Umno/ |work=The Malaysian Insider |pages= |accessdate=29 April 2008 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603065331/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/Keris-apology-fans-unrest-in-divided-Umno/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullah welcomed the apology, saying it was brave and "made it clear to the non-Malays the important role the keris had in the Malay community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Keris apology fans unrest in divided Umno Let's put keris issue to rest, says PM |date=29 April 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/Lets-put-keris-issue-to-rest-says-PM/ |work=The Malaysian Insider |pages= |accessdate=29 April 2008 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603041808/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/Lets-put-keris-issue-to-rest-says-PM/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to questions about the diminishing of Malay supremacy post-elections, he said that it was more about parity for the Bumiputra communities, rejecting the notion of political dominance:

{{blockquote|So when we talk about (Malay supremacy), we mean we must be successful in many fields. It is never about ruling over others, or forcing our power upon them... We are not going to be a race that dominates others. We want to be a party that represents the Malays and that is ready to co-operate for the future of Malays and the people, as Malays will also succeed when all Malaysians are successful. ...

Shortly thereafter, Information Minister [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] insisted that ''ketuanan Melayu'' did not imply a master-slave relationship in any sense between the Malays and non-Malays. Instead, he suggested, it referred to the institution of the Malay monarchs, who had once been the "masters", but gave up their primacy when the Federal Constitution was adopted at independence. Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution, which grants the royalty certain legal immunities, as an example of Malay supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Don't bring politics into Malay supremacy issue, says Ahmad Shabery |date=9 May 2008 |publisher= |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/Dont-bring-politics-into-Malay-supremacy-issue-says-Ahmad-Shabery/ |work=The Malaysian Insider |pages= |accessdate=10 May 2008 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603050822/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/Dont-bring-politics-into-Malay-supremacy-issue-says-Ahmad-Shabery/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the [[Raja of Perlis]] and former [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] [[Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail]] have themselves been critical of ''ketuanan Melayu''; in early 2009, the Raja stated that "In Malaysia, every race is ''tuan'' [master]... I believe that if everyone understands that every individual of any race, should not be deprived of their rights, then the efforts of certain parties who think that the supremacy or rights should only be given to a particular race can be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Equal rights for all Malaysians, says Perlis ruler | date=6 March 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/equal-rights-for-all-malaysians-says-perlis-ruler/ | work =New Straits Times | pages = | accessdate =6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the Cabinet decided to change the curriculum of [[Biro Tata Negara]] (National Civics Bureau, or BTN) programmes, which are mandatory for public servants and students studying on public funds. Many, especially politicians from Pakatan Rakyat, had previously criticised BTN programmes as propaganda for ''ketuanan Melayu''; citing this, the [[Selangor]] state government banned its civil servants and students from attending BTN courses.&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'&gt;{{Cite news|first=Asrul Hadi |last=Abdullah Sani |authorlink= |title=Nazri calls Dr M a racist for defending BTN |date=7 December 2009 |publisher= |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn |work=The Malaysian Insider |pages= |accessdate=7 December 2009 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223732/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn |archivedate=12 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Ministers and former Prime Minister Mahathir defended BTN as necessary to imbue participants with the values of discipline and honesty, denying they had anything to do with ''ketuanan Melayu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Shazwan |last=Mustafa Kamal |authorlink= |title=Dr M says criticisms against BTN an ‘exaggeration’ |date=7 December 2009 |publisher= |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- |work=The Malaysian Insider |pages= |accessdate=7 December 2009 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223735/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- |archivedate=12 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]] insisted the Cabinet was right to demand a change in BTN, calling Mahathir a racist and saying:

{{blockquote|They all know what the syllabus is all about so who are we to say that it did not happen? You want to lie? You make people laugh.

The '''Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac''' ({{lang-sq|Ushtria Çlirimtare e Preshevës, Medvegjës dhe Bujanocit}}, UÇPMB) was an Albanian [[militant]] group fighting for separation from the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] for three municipalities: [[Preševo]], [[Bujanovac]], and [[Medveđa]], home to most of the [[Albanians in Serbia|Albanians in south Serbia]], adjacent to [[Kosovo]]. Of the three municipalities, only [[Preševo]] has an Albanian majority.

UÇPMB's uniforms, procedures and tactics mirrored those of the then freshly disbanded [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA). The 1,500-strong paramilitary launched the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] from 1999 to 2001, with the goal of seceding these municipalities from Yugoslavia and joining them to the [[protectorate]] of [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="ReuvenyThompson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rafael Reuveny|author2=William R.

The EU condemned what it described as the "extremism" and use of "illegal terrorist actions" by the group.&lt;ref name="Staf2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=European Centre for Minority Issues Staf|title=European Yearbook of Minority Issues: 2001/2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkz7lvqGpDkC&amp;pg=PA652|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-1956-6|pages=652–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, a three-mile "Ground Safety Zone" (GSZ) was established between Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|governed by the UN]]) and inner [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Forces]] (VJ) units were not permitted there, and only the lightly armed [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] forces were left in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce-review.org/00/43/kosovonews43.html|title=A calm Kosovo moves towards a tense future|publisher=Ce-review.org|accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exclusion zone included the predominantly Albanian village of [[Dobrosin]], but not [[Preševo]]. Kosovo terrorism was exported across the borders,&lt;ref name="ReuvenyThompson2010"/&gt; with former KLA members quickly established bases in the [[demilitarized zone]], and Serbian police had to stop patrolling the area to avoid being ambushed. Ethnic Albanian politicians opposed to the KLA were attacked, including Zemail Mustafi (the vice-president of the [[Bujanovac]] branch of [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s [[Socialist Party of Serbia]]) who was assassinated.{{When?|date=May 2018}} 

Between 21 June 1999 and 12 November 2000, 294 attacks were recorded, most of them (246) in Bujanovac, 44 in [[Medveđa]] and six in Preševo. These attacks resulted in 14 people killed (of which six were civilians and eight were policemen), 37 people wounded (two UN observers, three civilians and 34 policemen) and five civilians kidnapped. In their attacks, UÇPMB used mostly [[assault rifle]]s, [[machine gun]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and [[sniper rifle]]s, but occasionally also [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s, [[hand grenade]]s, and [[anti-tank mine|anti-tank]] and [[anti-personnel mine]]s.&lt;ref name=VD&gt;{{cite news|first=Ninoslav|last=Krstic|author2=Dragan Zivkovic|title=Извођење операције решавања кризе на југу Србије изазване деловањем наоружаних албанских екстремиста (терориста)| work=Vojno delo|issn=0042-8426|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UÇPMB included [[Minor (law)|minors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2001 - Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|publisher=Child Soldiers International|year=2001|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/498805fbc.html|quote=The UCPMB is an Albanian armed group operating in southern Serbia whose operations are reportedly controlled by the Political Council for Presovo. They are calling for the incorporation of the cities of Preshava, Medvegia and Bujanovci into Kosovo. Estimates of numbers vary between 200 and 15,000.&lt;br&gt;The Guardian newspaper reported in January 2001 that some sixty suspected members of the UCPMB guerrilla had been arrested by peacekeepers. UCPMB recruits include children in their mid teens to men in their forties ... Further confirmation of the participation of child soldiers came when KFOR detained 16 juveniles (aged 15-17) in the first two months of 2001 for alleged involvement in the conflict (although the degree of "involvement" is not clear). The international media claim that there is forced recruitment of juveniles into this group but this is not verified and numbers are small ... A 15-year-old Albanian male was reported shot dead on 23 March 2001 in the Ground Safety Zone near Gnjilane. Although no confirmations have been received, the circumstances suggest he may have been a child soldier.&lt;br&gt;UNICEF, 9/3/01 op. cit.Information (provided by [a] confidential source that requests confidentiality, 3/01)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the situation escalated, [[NATO]] allowed the VJ to reclaim the demilitarized zone on 24 May 2001, at the same time giving the UÇPMB the opportunity to turn themselves over to the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), which promised to only take their weapons and note their names before releasing them. More than 450 UÇPMB members took advantage of KFOR's "screen and release" policy, among them commander Shefket Musliu, who turned himself over to KFOR at a checkpoint along the GSZ just after midnight of 26 May 2001.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Aftermath==
{{further|Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia}}
The former KLA next moved to western Macedonia where they established the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]], which [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|fought against the Macedonian government in 2001]].&lt;ref name="ReuvenyThompson2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">'''Mahtra War''' ({{lang-et|Mahtra sõda}}) was a peasant insurgency at the [[Mahtra]] estate (now in [[Rapla County]], 60 km from [[Tallinn]]) in [[Estonia]], in the then [[Russian Empire]] in May-July 1858.

The revolt was suppressed using the regular army, 14 peasants were wounded and 7 killed on site, 3 died later of wounds. The military casualties included 13 soldiers wounded and 1 officer killed. 60 of 65 peasant defendants were sentenced to death by a court-martial in Tallinn. Baltic governor-general [[Alexander Arkadyevich Suvorov|Suvorov]] later reduced the sentences of 44 peasants to corporal punishment, 35 of whom were sentenced to exile in [[Siberia]], while the remaining 21 defendants were set free. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Estonia and the Estonians |last=Raun |first=Toivo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Hoover Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8179-2852-0 |pages=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YQ1NRJlUrwkC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Mahtra+War%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U0pufdrAxjhrzupbSOe-hmWp6cASw }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
In the [[Reval Governorate|Governorate of Estonia]], [[serfdom]] was abolished in 1816 (in comparison, in the whole Russian Empire [[Emancipation reform of 1861|it was abolished]] in 1861), however the land was not redistributed among the peasants and the ''[[corvée]]'' labor was preserved (until 1876). The March 19, 1856 manifesto of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] spoke about further agrarian reforms, but the implementation was slow, and this sparked the unrest, including the Mahtra revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvglobal.by.ru/history/i06.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524142517/http://dvglobal.by.ru/history/i06.shtml |archivedate=2006-05-24 |df= }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events significantly influenced the work of the committees working on the project of the emancipation of the serfs in Russia.

The '''Malaysian Chinese Association''' ('''MCA'''; {{zh|t=馬來西亞華人公會|s=马来西亚华人公会|p=Mǎláixīyà Huárén Gōnghuì|j=maa5 loi4 sai1 aa3 waa4 jan4 gung1 wui2}}; {{Lang-ms|Persatuan Cina Malaysia}}; formerly known as '''Malayan Chinese Association''') is a uni-racial [[List of political parties in Malaysia|political party in Malaysia]] that seeks to represents the [[Malaysian Chinese]] ethnicity; it is one of the three major component parties of the opposition coalition in [[Malaysia]] called the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) in Malay, or National Front in English.

Along with the largest and third largest component party in BN, i.e. [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) and [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC), MCA has a significant influence over the political arena in Malaysia. Through its holding of companies such as Huaren Holdings, MCA controls [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']], which is Malaysia's best-selling English newspaper.

The party was once the largest party representing the Chinese community in Malaysia, and was particularly dominant in the early period until the late 1960s. Its fortunes fluctuated after the establishment of other political parties in the 1960s that challenged it for the Chinese votes, although it still enjoyed strong support in the mid-1990s to mid-2000s period. However, it has performed poorly in elections since 2008, with the Malaysian Chinese community mostly voting for the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.usm.my/km/32(Supp.2)2014/KM%2032%20Supp.%202_2014-Art.%202%20(25-53).pdf |journal=Kajian Malaysia|volume=32 |issue= supp. 2 |year= 2014|pages= 25–53|title=Thirteenth General Elections (GE13): Chinese votes and Implications on Malaysian Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation and early years ===
[[File:Tcl.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tan Cheng Lock]], first president of MCA]]
The Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) was formed on 27 February 1949 with the implicit support by the post-World War II British colonial administration. A central purpose of the MCA at the time of its founding was to manage the specific social and welfare concerns of the populations interned in the so-called [[New Village]]s created under the [[Briggs' Plan]] in response to the [[Malayan Emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nyce|first=Ray|title=Chinese New Villages in Malaysia|year=1973|publisher=Malaysian Sociological Research Institute|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gin2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ooi Keat Gin|title=Historical Dictionary of Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=assDznc7EN4C|accessdate=16 February 2013|date=11 May 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6305-7|pages=lvii, 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration that announced the MCA as a formal political party in 1951 was written by a prominent [[Straits Chinese]] businessman, [[Tan Cheng Lock]], its first president. In general, its early members were landowners, businessmen, or otherwise better off, while the working classes in the New Villages overwhelmingly joined the [[Malayan Peoples' Socialist Front|Socialist Front]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nyce|first=Ray|title=Chinese New Villages in Malaysia|year=1973|publisher=Malaysian Sociological Research Institute|location=Singapore|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent members of the MCA were also [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) members opposed to the [[Malayan Communist Party]]. [[Leong Yew Koh]], was a KMT major general who became a cabinet minister and later became governor of [[Malacca]]; Malaysia's first minister of finance, [[Henry H.S. Lee]], was a KMT colonel; and [[Lim Chong Eu]], the leader of the [[Radical Party (Malaya)|Radical Party]], and joined the MCA in 1952, was a colonel (medical) doctor in the Kuomintang.&lt;ref&gt;Bayly, Harper, ''Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, MCA joined force with [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) on a local level to contest the [[Kuala Lumpur]] municipal elections which would lead to the formation of the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]]. The alliance was joined by [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] (MIC) in 1954 and they contested the [[Malayan general election, 1955|first Malayan General Election]] in 1955 as one body, and the alliance won 51 of the 52 seat contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1 |editor= Keat Gin Ooi |page=138 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year= 2004 |isbn=9781576077702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MCA won all 15 of the seats allocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBotAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State Under Mahathir|author=In-Won Hwang |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |page=96 |year= 2003 |isbn=978-9812301857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan Cheng Lock was succeeded by Lim Chong Eu after a successful challenge by Lim for the presidency in 1958. Lim attempted to amend the party's Constitution to consolidate the power of the Central Committee, and although amendment was passed narrowly, it also split the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tun-dr-lim-chong-eu/ |title=Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu |work=Malaysian Chinese Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018234517/http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tun-dr-lim-chong-eu/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Malayan general election, 1959|1959 General Election]], Lim pressed for an increase of the allocated number of seats from 28 to 40, but this was refused by UMNO leader [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]. Lim was forced to back down and later resigned as president, with Cheah Toon Lock taking over as acting president. Other members also resigned from MCA to contest the election as independent candidates, which cost the party some seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXkDtR3vCecC&amp;pg=PA371#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Comparative Politics: The politics of Asia |author= Howard J.

=== May 1969–1985 ===
The [[Malaysian general election, 1969|third Malaysian general elections]] were held on 10 May 1969.  MCA faced strong challenges from the new, mainly Chinese, opposition parties [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) and [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]]. Of the 33 parliamentary seats contested, MCA managed to retain only 13.  MCA also lost control of the [[Penang State Legislative Assembly|Penang State Government]] to Gerakan.  The gain by the opposition parties led to tension between different communities which erupted into the [[May 13 Riots]].  Prior to the riots, on 12 May 1969, Tan Siew Sin announced that the party would withdraw from the Alliance, but reconsidered on 20 May and joined the [[National Operations Council]] formed in place of the suspended Parliament after the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mca.org.my/t/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/party-history/3/ |title=Party History |work=Malaysian Chinese Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406201339/http://www.mca.org.my/t/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/party-history/3/ |archivedate=6 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The loss of support for MCA among the Chinese population elicited a comment by the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Ismail Abdul Rahman|Dr Ismail]] that if MCA continue to lose support, UMNO may stop co-operating with it.&lt;ref name="ting"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9EEhjQ3tQAC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124 |title=Chinese Schools in Peninsular Malaysia: The Struggle for Survival |author=Ting Hui Lee |page=124 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To regain Chinese support, Tan attempted to broaden the appeal of the party previously seen as a party of the ''taukeh'' (''[[:zh:头家|tou jia]]'', rich men), and invited professionals to join the party.&lt;ref name="ting"/&gt;  However, many of these were expelled after a dispute involving [[Lim Keng Yaik]] who then joined Gerakan.&lt;ref name="ting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA634#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Cheah Kooi Guan |page=634 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss of support for MCA in the 1969 election, and the enlargement of the Alliance party in 1972 (which later became [[Barisan Nasional]]) to include Gerakan, UMNO became even more dominant and MCA suffered a loss of status within the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Owo39zRMQbwC&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Malaysia: The Making of a Nation|author= Cheah Boon Kheng |publisher= Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2002 |pages=162–163 |isbn=978-9812301543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Tan Siew Sin requested a position as Deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet reshuffle following the death of [[Ismail Abdul Rahman|Tun Dr. Ismail]], but this was refused by [[Tun Abdul Razak]], which angered Tan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Owo39zRMQbwC&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Malaysia: The Making of a Nation|author= Cheah Boon Kheng |publisher= Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2002 |pages=147–148 |isbn=978-9812301543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1974, prior to the [[Malaysian general election, 1974|general election]], Tan Siew Sin resigned all of his party and government posts for health reasons.

[[Lee San Choon]] took over as Acting President following Tan's resignation, and was then elected President in 1975.  After Tan's resignation, the cabinet posts allocated to MCA declined in importance, and MCA lost both the Finance Ministry and Trade and Industry Ministry posts it once held in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4sKEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malaysian Politics Under Mahathir |author= Diane K. Mauzy, R. S. Milne |publisher=Routledge |page=91 |year= 1999 |isbn=978-0415171434 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party performed better in the 1974 election, but lost ground again in the following [[Malaysian general election, 1978|1978 general election]], with the MCA winning only 17 of the 28 parliamentary seats and 44 of the 60 state seats. In 1979, Michael Chen stood against Lee San Choon for the MCA Presidency but lost, and later in 1981 led a group of MCA dissidents to join Gerakan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=EV88Tf0yWqoC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malaysia's 1982 General Election |author=Harold A.

The [[Malaysian general election, 1982|1982 general election]] however saw a shift in fortune for MCA.  Lee accepted a challenge from the opposition [[Democratic Action Party]] which taunted the MCA's leadership for not daring to contest a seat with large urban Chinese majority, and contested the parliamentary seat for [[Seremban]] against the incumbent DAP Chairman Chen Man Hin. Lee won his challenge, and led his party to a resounding victory, winning 24 out of 28 allocated parliamentary seats and 55 out of 62 state seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EV88Tf0yWqoC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malaysia's 1982 General Election|author= Harold A.

=== 1985–2003 ===
In 1985, [[Tan Koon Swan]], who was sacked from the party a year earlier, won the presidential election with the largest majority in the party's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Mr Tan Koon Swan was yesterday elected president of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) by a landslide. |date = 25 November 1985 |publisher = Asian Wall Street Journal |page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = MCA: New Beginning. |date = 1 December 1985 |publisher = Malaysian Business |page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following year, he was charged with abetting criminal breach of trust relating to his private business dealings in Singapore, and resigned from the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Tan Koon Swan |url=http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx |publisher=Malaysian Chinese Association |accessdate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712044805/http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx |archivedate=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koon Swan also originated the Deposit-Taking [[Cooperative]]s (DTCs), which sought to accumulate capital for Chinese Malaysians through investments. The mismanagement of the DTCs' funds led to a scandal, with the central bank, [[Bank Negara Malaysia]], stepping in to freeze the assets of up to 35 DTCs. The total loss was estimated to be RM3.6 billion, and the depositors only recovered 62% of their deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=MCA's irrelevant civil war |url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/mcas-irrelevant-civil-war/ |last1=Wong |first1=Chin Huat |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=The Nut Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koon Swan was succeeded by his deputy [[Ling Liong Sik]] in 1986. He assumed the presidency when the party was still rife with factionalism and faced disillusionment with the Chinese community over the Deposit-Taking Cooperatives scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik and Datuk Seri Ong Ka Ting |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2003/12/31/features/6972955&amp;sec=features |date=31 December 2003 |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020014/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2003%2F12%2F31%2Ffeatures%2F6972955&amp;sec=features |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ling spent his early years as president working to resolve MCA's financial problems, raising funds while restructuring the party's assets.&lt;ref name="ling liong sik"&gt;{{citation|title=Tun Dr Ling Liong Sik |url=http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/DatukSeriDrLingLiongSik.aspx |publisher=Malaysian Chinese Association |accessdate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621112336/http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/DatukSeriDrLingLiongSik.aspx |archivedate=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ling presided over a period of relative peace within the party, and worked to maintain the interests of the Chinese community through a closed-door approach within the government.&lt;ref name="tussle"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721120401/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1766%3Atussle-between-mca-top-two-redux-&amp;Itemid=169 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |title=Tussle between MCA top two – Redux |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1766:tussle-between-mca-top-two-redux-&amp;Itemid=169 |last1=Chin |first1=James |date=29 October 2009 |publisher=Centre for Policy Initiatives |accessdate=5 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the MCA-owned [[Tunku Abdul Rahman College]] through fund-raising and government contributions, and in 2001 set up [[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]].&lt;ref name="ling liong sik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt; Ling led MCA to its best electoral performance thus far in the [[Malaysian general election, 1995|1995 general election]], winning 30 of the 34 allocated parliamentary seats and 71 of the 77 state seats, and secured a majority of Chinese votes at the expense of DAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UCl7VE4VMIC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Southeast Asia |author= Michael Leifer |pages=174–175 |publisher=Routledge |edition= 3rd |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBotAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State Under Mahathir|author=In-Won Hwang |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |pages=260–262 |year= 2003 |isbn=978-9812301857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MCA also performed well in the [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 general elections]], and the successive electoral victory boosted the party's standing within the Barisan Nasional coalition as well as Ling's personal relationship with BN leader and prime minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]].&lt;ref name="ling liong sik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt;

Internal power however struggles persisted. In 1993 Ling's deputy [[Lee Kim Sai]] indicated that he would challenge Ling for the presidency, but withdrew at the eleventh hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA517#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |pages=515–517 |publisher=ISEAS |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee eventually retired in 1996 and was replaced as deputy president by [[Lim Ah Lek]].&lt;ref name="save MCA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Ong Ka Ting or any other ex this or that save MCA? |url=http://www.aliran.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1228:can-ong-ka-ting-or-any-other-former-this-or-that-save-the-mca&amp;catid=96:2010&amp;Itemid=47 |publisher=[[Aliran]] |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the party was again wracked by factionalism. Deputy president Lim Ah Lek announced his intention to retire as a minister and agreed with Ling to nominate his protégé [[Chan Kong Choy]] to the Cabinet after the 1999 elections. However, Ling nominated his own protégé [[Ong Ka Ting]] as a minister at the expense of Chan, causing discontent with members aligned to Lim, which became known as "Team B" among party members. The Ling faction was known as "Team A".&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="save MCA"/&gt; Tensions flared further after MCA, through its holding company Huaren, moved to acquire the independent daily ''[[Nanyang Siang Pau]]''. This was vehemently opposed by Team B, fearing a complete control of the Chinese media by Team A. They were joined by Chinese journalists and non-governmental organisations, who made their opposition public through demonstrations.&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt; The situation turned farcical when chairs were thrown during the 2001 Youth general assembly over the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA Youth launches inquiry into AGM violence |url=http://www0.malaysiakini.com/news/4245 |publisher=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=9 August 2001 |last1=Ng |first1=Boon Hooi }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Huaren eventually succeeded in taking over ''Nanyang Siang Pau''.

Mahathir, as BN leader, eventually stepped in to resolve the conflict, suggesting a "peace plan" among the factions. The scheduled 2002 party elections were cancelled, while Ling and Lim stepped down to be replaced by their respective protégés.&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt;

=== 2003–2008 ===
In May 2003, the leadership transition occurred as planned. Ong Ka Ting, who was then a vice-president succeeded Ling Liong Sik as president, while Chan Kong Choy succeeded Lim Ah Lek as deputy president. The Ong-led MCA contributed to [[Barisan Nasional]]'s overwhelming victory in the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general elections]]. MCA won 31 of the 40 parliamentary seats and 76 of the 90 state seats allocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHtO7JdRLO0C&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Malaysia: Recent Trends and Challenges |editor= Saw Swee-Hock, K Kesavapany |publisher= Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2005 |page=92 |isbn= 978-9812303394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2005 party elections, Teams A and B ran on a united front, easily quashing the challenge by vice-president [[Chua Jui Meng]] (for president) and secretary-general [[Ting Chew Peh]] (for deputy president).&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt;

The Ong-Chan leadership continued the soft approach to protecting the Chinese community's interests,&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt; although tension with UMNO over racial issues flared up now and again after the 2004 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The racial divide widens in Malaysia |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HK23Ae01.html |publisher=[[Asia Times]] |date=23 November 2006 |last1=Gatsiounis |first1=Ioannis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, vice-president and Health Minister [[Chua Soi Lek]], a prominent [[Johor]] member, was involved in a sex scandal.

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|March 2008 general elections]], MCA fared badly, winning only 15 parliamentary seats and 32 state seats, less than half the number of seats they won in the previous election. Ong decided not to contest the presidency during the party elections later that year, to allow a new leader to take over. The October 2008 party election marked a realignment of the party's factions, with the return of Chua Soi Lek to the fold. Ong Ka Ting's anointed successor was vice-president [[Ong Tee Keat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA reform: Real or imaginary? |url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/mca-reform-real-or-imaginary/ |publisher=[[The Nut Graph]] |date=3 October 2008 |last1=Ng |first1=Boon Hooi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Chua entered the race for deputy president, facing among others, [[Ong Ka Chuan]], the elder brother of Ka Ting. Ong Tee Keat won the presidency comfortably, while Chua edged out Ka Chuan. Following his victory, Tee Keat pledged reform and reaching out to more young voters to revive the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tee Keat wins, Soi Lek is MCA No. 2 |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/18/nation/20081018214845&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019174920/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F10%2F18%2Fnation%2F20081018214845&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 October 2008 |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=18 October 2008 |access-date=5 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–present ===
After the 2008 leadership change, factional infighting continued and the relationship between the Ong Tee Keat and Chua Soi Lek remained tense. Chua was sidelined by Ong from taking an active role in the party's leadership, and he was also excluded from government posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Pakatan Rakyat courts Chua Soi Lek |url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/pr-courts-chua-soi-lek |date=30 April 2009 |publisher=[[The Nut Graph]] |last1=Loh |first1=Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sacked by MCA in August 2009 for damaging the party's image with his sex scandal more than a year prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soi Lek expelled |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/111492 |publisher=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Chua's supporters forced an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) which passed a vote of no confidence against incumbent president Ong and annulled the expulsion of Chua. The EGM, however, failed to reinstate Chua as deputy president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA EGM: Delegates make dramatic decisions |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/10/nation/20091010083515&amp;sec=nation |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=10 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011051038/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F10%2F10%2Fnation%2F20091010083515&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=11 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ong refused to resign despite the vote of no confidence, but pledged with Chua to set aside their differences under the "greater unity plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Greater unity plan revealed |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/23/nation/4959154&amp;sec=nation |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=23 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111065100/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F10%2F23%2Fnation%2F4959154&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was opposed by vice-president [[Liow Tiong Lai]] who demanded Ong step down and that new elections be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New EGM mired in legal wrangling while Ong pushes unity plan |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/42346-new-egm-mired-in-legal-wrangling-while-ong-pushes-unity-plan- |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091107094523/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/42346-new-egm-mired-in-legal-wrangling-while-ong-pushes-unity-plan- |archivedate=7 November 2009 |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set in motion a new leadership crisis, which lasted almost six months.

Finally in March 2010, Chua, along with his supporters in the central committee (CC) resigned. Along with the resignations of Liow's supporters in the CC, more than two-thirds of the CC had vacated their seats, paving the way for an election per the party constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soi Lek quits, fresh MCA polls imminent |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/55225-soi-lek-quits-fresh-mca-polls-imminent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306024042/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/55225-soi-lek-quits-fresh-mca-polls-imminent |archivedate=6 March 2010 |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent election saw Chua defeating incumbent Ong Tee Keat and former leader Ong Ka Ting in the race for president, while Liow defeated [[Kong Cho Ha]] in the contest for deputy president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/57823-soi-lek-wins-liow-is-mca-no-2- |title=Soi Lek wins, Liow is MCA No. 2 |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=28 March 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331133609/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/57823-soi-lek-wins-liow-is-mca-no-2- |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chua and his deputy Liow pledged to co-operate, and opened the party to non-Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liow will cooperate with Dr Chua |url=http://www.mmail.com.my/content/31613-liow-will-cooperate-dr-chua |date=28 March 2010 |publisher=[[The Malay Mail]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622013740/http://www.mmail.com.my/content/31613-liow-will-cooperate-dr-chua |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MCA's electoral performance meanwhile continued to deteriorate, as in the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 General Election]], MCA only managed to score only 7 of the 37 parliamentary seats and 11 of the 90 state seats it contested, leading to calls for Chua's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/mca-elders-call-for-soi-leks-head-to-roll |title=MCA elders call for Soi Lek’s head to roll |author=Boo Su-Lyn |date=10 May 2013 |work=The Malaysian Insider |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903055734/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/mca-elders-call-for-soi-leks-head-to-roll |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MCA's poor performance in the two elections, along with continued factionalism, raised concerns over the party's relevance in the Malaysian political arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA's irrelevant civil war |url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/mcas-irrelevant-civil-war/ |date=7 October 2009 |last=Wong |first=Chin Huat |accessdate=23 April 2011 |publisher=[[The Nut Graph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MCA polls: Fight to restore party's relevance |url=https://my.news.yahoo.com/mca-polls-fight-restore-partys-151658904.html |author=Azman Ghani  |date=20 December 2013 |publisher=Yahoo!

Chua did not enter the following party poll for president, and in December 2013, [[Liow Tiong Lai]] was elected the president of MCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/malaysias-former-health-minister-liow-tiong-lai-new-mca-president-201312 |title=Malaysia's former health minister Liow Tiong Lai is new MCA president |author=Lester Kong |work=The Straits Times|date=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/12/13/how-will-chua-soi-lek-be-remembered/ |title=How will Chua Soi Lek be remembered? |author=Leven Woon |date=13 December 2013 |work=Free Malaysia Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liow also reversed the resolution not to serve in the government and re-entered the cabinet in the aftermath of the [[MH370]] incident.&lt;ref name="nst mca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/now-transport-minister-liow-says-finding-mh370-is-job-no-1 |title=MALAYSIA Now transport minister, Liow says finding MH370 is Job No 1|date= 25 June 2014 |author=Syed Jaymal Zahiid |work=The Malay Mail Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 election]], MCA suffered its worst ever defeat, as it has lost all state seats it has contested, and only managed to retain one elected representative in the national parliament - [[Wee Ka Siong]], who represents [[Ayer Hitam (federal constituency)|Ayer Hitam]] constituency in Johor. MCA, as part of the Barisan Nasional coalition, was also relegated to the opposition for the first time since independence. Party leader Liow decided not to stand for party polls after his defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/05/11/report-liow-not-standing-in-mca-polls-this-year/ |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21948">The '''New England Woman Suffrage Association''' ('''NEWSA''') was established in November 1868 to campaign for the right of women to vote in the U.S.  Its principal leaders were [[Julia Ward Howe]], its first president, and [[Lucy Stone]], who later became president.  It was active until 1920, when [[suffrage]] for women was secured by the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]].

[[File:Julia Ward Howe- History of Woman Suffrage volume 2 page 793.jpg|thumb| right| Julia Ward Howe, first president of the New England Woman Suffrage Association]]

The NEWSA was formed during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement and also between one wing of that movement and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement.  Disagreement was especially sharp over the proposal to [[suffrage|enfranchise]] African American men before enfranchising women. The NEWSA, which accepted that approach, was organized partly to counter the activities of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who opposed it, insisting that women and black men should be enfranchised at the same time. The NEWSA also maintained close ties with the abolitionist movement and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] whereas Stanton and Anthony were working toward an independent women's movement.

The NEWSA was the first major political organization with women's suffrage as its goal.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA168 p. 168]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was formed on a regional basis several months before the establishment of two national women's suffrage organizations, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]].  The NEWSA played a key role in the formation of the latter and had overlapping leadership with it.

==Background==

The New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA) was formed during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement and also between one wing of that movement and the abolitionist  movement.  Disagreements had already weakened the [[American Equal Rights Association]], which was formed in 1866 by women's rights advocates and abolitionists to campaign for equal rights, including [[suffrage]], for all citizens regardless of race or sex.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA185 pp. 64,185 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Priority had become an issue: should [[universal suffrage]] be the immediate goal, or should African American men be enfranchised first? After slavery was abolished in the U.S. in 1865, the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] declared that its work would not be finished until African Americans were also guaranteed political equality.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56]&lt;/ref&gt;
By the time of the NEWSA's founding, hope for fulfillment of that goal was embodied in a proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race.  Because it would not also prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex, however, it became a focal point for discord within the women's movement.

Some members of the women's movement, such as [[Abby Kelley Foster]], supported the amendment because they believed that suffrage for African American males was a more pressing need than suffrage for women.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/216/mode/2up p. 216]. Foster is speaking here during the 1867 convention of the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA).&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], opposed any amendment that would in effect [[suffrage|enfranchise]] all men while excluding all women, believing it would create an "aristocracy of sex" by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA185 pp. 174-175,185]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lucy Stone]], who played a leading role in the NEWSA, argued that suffrage for women was more important than suffrage for black men but also supported the Fifteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/384/mode/2up p. 384]. Stone is speaking here during the 1869 AERA convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

The split also involved different assessments of the ruling [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA163 p. 163]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many leading women's suffragists had been introduced to social activism through the anti-slavery movement and felt loyalty to both that movement and to the Republican Party, which had provided political leadership for the abolition of slavery in the U.S. and was still in the difficult process of consolidating that victory.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), pp. 19, 57, 59&lt;/ref&gt;
After the uncomfortably close elections of 1868, Republican leaders recognized the importance of enfranchising African American men, most of whom were recently freed slaves, as a way of helping to preserve the victory over slaveholders during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865).&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162]&lt;/ref&gt;
They and their abolitionist allies increasingly viewed women's suffrage as an objective that, even if successful, would not produce comparable political benefits, and they considered the campaign for it to be a drain on resources that were needed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), pp. 57, 59.  The Constitution was amended in 1870 to theoretically ensure suffrage regardless of race, but, after an initial period during which that promise was meaningfully applied countrywide, voting by African Americans in much of the South was suppressed until the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's rights activists generally had been strong supporters of the abolitionist movement and had also depended heavily on its resources.  Those who distanced themselves from abolitionist and Republican leadership during this period, however, found themselves increasingly cut off from abolitionist resources and sometimes the target of outright hostility from Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), pp. 51, 72-73, 89&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton, Anthony and their allies felt betrayed and began to criticize the Republican Party and some of the abolitionist leadership.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Olympia Brown]], an ally who played a role in the NEWSA's creation, criticized abolitionist leaders by name and said, "We must look for our support to new men".&lt;ref&gt;"What People Say to Us," ''The Revolution'', February 5, 1868, p. 67.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 106.  The full quote is in Garrison (1981); [https://books.google.com/books?id=jYO8lsmiXKkC&amp;pg=PA70 p. 70].&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton and Anthony greatly inflamed feelings by accepting help from [[George Francis Train]], a supporter of women's rights who was also a wealthy Democrat and an outspoken racist.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA93 p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other women's suffrage activists, however, continued to support the abolitionist leadership and the Republican Party to varying degrees.

==History==

=== Planning committee ===

[[Olympia Brown]], who had recently become one of the first ordained woman ministers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stlawu.edu/studentlife/departments/chaplain%27s-office/page/1071 |title=Olympia Brown |author= |date= |work= |publisher=St. Lawrence University |accessdate=March 31, 1013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
initiated the proposal for a [[New England]] women's suffrage organization.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
She hoped to create an association that would limit its activity to a campaign for women's suffrage, believing that campaigning for suffrage for both women and African Americans, as the [[American Equal Rights Association]] had done, would cause women's suffrage to be overshadowed.  She sought to create an organization that would, in her own words, campaign on a "clear-cut, separate and single question."&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolen B. Willis, ed., "Olympia Brown, An Autobiography," ''Annual Journal of Universalist Historical Society'', 4 (1963), 38. Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of [[Abby Kelley Foster]], she announced a meeting in Boston in May 1868 to discuss her proposal and succeeded in gathering a hall full of people.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1911); [https://books.google.com/books?id=QhugAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA76 pp. 76-77]&lt;/ref&gt;
The meeting established a planning committee chaired by [[Caroline Severance]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwood-Akers (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1cJzcHKtw0YC&amp;pg=PA61 p. 61]&lt;/ref&gt;
Brown found herself and her single-issue approach sidelined by the planners of the new organization.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA163 p. 163]&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeking to counter the initiatives of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], the committee launched an organization that supported suffrage for both blacks and women and was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA165 pp. 164-166]. Kerr (1992), page 134, says the planners of the NEWSA's founding convention "invited Stanton and Antony and offered to pay their expenses."  DuBois (1978), page 165, however, says that "When Stanton inadvertently received an invitation, Stephen Foster wrote to her to ask her not to attend."  Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA255 page 255], footnote 14, agrees that Stanton's invitation was withdrawn.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Brown and Severance, key figures in the planning for the new organization included Abby Kelley Foster, her husband [[Stephen Symonds Foster]], and [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], all of whom had been important figures in the abolitionist movement.  [[Lucy Stone]], a pioneering worker for women's rights who later became a leading figure in the new organization, had not yet moved to Boston from New Jersey and was not deeply involved in its planning.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165], including footnote 5 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;
She attended the founding convention, however and was elected to the new organization's executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA168 pp. 165, 168]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding convention===

The New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA) was formed on November 19, 1868, during the second and last day of a regional women's rights convention in Boston, Massachusetts, where the new organization was to be headquartered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Boston Woman's Rights Convention |author= |journal=The Woman's Advocate | location =Boston |date= January 1869 |volume=1 |issue=1 |url= http://womenwriters.library.emory.edu/advocacy/content.php?level=div&amp;id=advocate1_128&amp;document=advocate1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerr (1992), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead of distancing itself from the Republican Party, as Anthony and Stanton were doing, the planners for the NEWSA convention worked to attract Republican support and seated leading Republican politicians, including a U.S. senator, on the speaker's platform.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA165 pp. 165-166]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucy stone.jpg|thumb| left |Lucy Stone]]

At the time of the NEWSA convention, Congress was considering the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race but would not, as many women suffragists had hoped, also prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex.  (The amendment was approved by Congress in February 1869 and ratified by the states in 1870.)  At the convention, Francis Bird, one of the most powerful politicians in Massachusetts, said, "Negro suffrage, being a paramount question, would have to be settled before woman suffrage could receive the attention it deserved."&lt;ref&gt;"Woman's Rights Convention," ''New York Times'', November 20, 1868, p. 1.  Quoted in DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA169 pp. 169, 165]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid increasing confidence that the Fifteenth Amendment was assured of passage, Lucy Stone, a future president of the NEWSA, showed her preference for enfranchising both women and black men by unexpectedly introducing a resolution calling for the Republican Party to "drop its watchword of 'Manhood Suffrage'"&lt;ref&gt;"Woman Suffrage," ''New York Tribune'', November 28, 1868; "Mrs. Lucy Stone and Woman Suffrage," ''Commonwealth'', November 28, 1868. Cited in Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA163 p. 163]&lt;/ref&gt;
and support [[universal suffrage]] instead.  Despite opposition by [[Frederick Douglass]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Frances Harper]], Stone convinced the meeting to approve the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA163 p 163]&lt;/ref&gt;
Two months later, however, when the Fifteenth Amendment was in danger of becoming stalled in Congress, Stone backed away from that position and declared that "Woman must wait for the Negro."&lt;ref&gt;"Stones Holding Their Peace," and "Lucy Stone and the Negro's Hour," ''Revolution'' 3 (February 4, 1869):73,89.  Citied in Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA165 p 165]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NEWSA supported the Fifteenth Amendment, believing that achieving suffrage for all men would be a step toward suffrage for women.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA176 pp. 172,176]&lt;/ref&gt;
The wing of the women's movement associated with the NEWSA expected the Republican Party to push for women's suffrage after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified (an expectation that was not realized). 
&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA199 pp. 199-200]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Ward Howe]], author of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]," was elected as the NEWSA's first president.  A member of a prominent family, she had recently been convinced to join the women's suffrage movement by Higginson and Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1900), 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=n1g4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA374 pp. 374-375]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the convention, Howe said she would not demand suffrage for women until it was achieved for blacks.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===

State affiliates of the NEWSA were formed in most New England states.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 
In January 1869, supporters of the NEWSA began publishing a newspaper called the ''Woman's Advocate'' from the office of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&amp;pg=PA163 p. 163], footnote 2.  In January 1870, the ''Woman's Advocate'' was replaced by the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', which was published by Lucy Stone and her husband [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dudden (2011); [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA164 p. 164]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the NEWSA waited until suffrage for blacks was assured before it began campaigning for women's suffrage at the national level, it pressed at an early stage for laws that would enfranchise women in the District of Columbia and the federal territories.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  
Another of its early initiatives was the collection of 8000 signatures on petitions to the Massachusetts legislature in 1869 in support of women's suffrage in that state, which led to the practice of annual public hearings on that question in the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4,  [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu04stanuoft#page/720/mode/2up p. 721]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The NEWSA's work in subsequent years included fund-raising bazaars, lectures, petitions and legislative hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4,
 [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu04stanuoft#page/700/mode/2up pp. 700-750]&lt;/ref&gt;

The split in the women's movement was formalized in May 1869 when Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton created the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] to represent their wing.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;
The executive committee of the NEWSA responded by laying the groundwork for a rival organization called the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA), which was founded in November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/756/mode/2up pp.  756-757]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Henry Ward Beecher]], a prominent minister, agreed to become the first president of the AWSA, but NEWSA leaders Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe played key roles both in the formation of the AWSA and in its leadership in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/764/mode/2up p. 764]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn (2000). "American Woman Suffrage Association" in ''The Encyclopedia of Women's History in America''], second edition, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13].  New York: Facts on File. {{ISBN|0-8160-4100-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia Ward Howe served as president of the NEWSA until 1877.  Lucy Stone was elected president that year and served until her death in 1893. Howe was again elected president in 1893 and served until her death in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4,  [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu04stanuoft#page/720/mode/2up p. 720]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 6, 
[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu06stanuoft#page/278/mode/2up p. 278]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alice Stone Blackwell]], Lucy Stone's daughter, was president from 1911 until the organization ceased to exist in 1920.  When the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which secured suffrage for women, was ratified in 1920, the NEWSA simply ceased to function rather than formally dissolving.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 6, pp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8393">The '''No More War Movement''' was the name of two [[pacifist]] organisations, one in the [[United Kingdom]]
and one in [[New Zealand]].

==British Group==

The British No More War Movement (NMWM) was founded in 1921 as a pacifist and socialist successor to the [[No-Conscription Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi-Detached Idealists:The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945''. Oxford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-924117-1}} (p. 432).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ls"&gt;Lyn Smith, ''Voices against War : A Century of Protest''. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2009. {{ISBN|1-84596-456-X}} (pp. 63–64).&lt;/ref&gt; For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; It became the British section of [[War Resisters International]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; Chaired by [[Fenner Brockway]], it asked members to strive for [[revolutionary socialism]] but not to take part in any [[war]].&lt;ref name="ls" /&gt; Other notable NMWM members included [[Wilfred Wellock]],&lt;ref name="mp"&gt;Michael Pugh, ''Liberal Internationalism: The Interwar Movement for Peace in Britain''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. {{ISBN|0-230-53763-4}} (p. 94).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Paul, ''Angry Young Man''. Faber, 1951. (pp. 204, 284).&lt;/ref&gt; A. Barratt Brown, Leyton Richards, [[William Joseph Chamberlain|W. J. Chamberlain]]&lt;ref name="mp" /&gt; and [[Monica Whately]]. &lt;ref&gt;"Whateley, Monica Mary BA, (1890-1960)" in Cheryl Law, ''Women, a modern political dictionary.'' London, I.B. Tauris, 2000. {{ISBN|186064502X}} (p.154).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nigel Copsey and Andrzej Olechnowicz, ''Varieties of Anti-Fascism: Britain in the Inter-War Period'' Palgrave Macmillan 2010. {{ISBN|0-230-00648-5}} (p. 108).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Nathan, Heinz Norden, ''Einstein on Peace''. Simon and Schuster, 1960. (p. 91).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a [[white poppy]], in the manner of the [[British Legion]]'s red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the [[Women's Co-operative Guild]].&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the [[Independent Labour Party]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, "Why I Believe in the No More War Movement", supporting the NMWM's aims.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Chamberlain, ''Fighting for Peace: The Story of the War Resistance Movement'', London, 1929. Among the signatories were: [[Harold Laski]], [[Frederick Soddy]], [[Helena Swanwick|H. M. Swanwick]], [[Margaret Llewelyn Davies]], [[Herbert Henry Elvin]], [[John Scurr]], [[Tom Williams, Baron Williams of Barnburgh|Tom Williams]], [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]], [[Emily Frost Phipps|Emily Phipps]], Canon [[Charles E. Raven]], [[Rhys Davies (politician)|Rhys J. Davies]], [[Hamilton Fyfe]], the [[Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford|Marquis of Tavistock]], [[Barbara Ayrton-Gould]] and [[Alfred Salter]].&lt;/ref&gt; The group published two journals: ''The New World'' and ''No More War''.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

After Brockway resigned in 1929, and secretaries [[Walter Ayles]] and [[Lucy Middleton|Lucy Cox]] left in 1932, the group foundered. [[Reginald Reynolds]], a [[Quaker]] influenced by [[Gandhi]], became general secretary, but he could not stop a drift of members to the [[communist]] [[British Anti-War Movement]] and the [[New Commonwealth Society]]. [[Anarchist]]s became increasingly prominent, but most left after the Movement, in accordance with its pacifist principles, refused to support the fighting of either side in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1937 the organisation formally merged with the [[Peace Pledge Union]], although the Midlands Council of the NMWM retained an independent existence for a year or so.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

==New Zealand Group==

The New Zealand NMWM was founded in the 1920s by Fred Page (d. 1926).&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;David Grant, ''Out in the Cold: Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors in New Zealand During World War II''. Reed Methuen, 1986 (pp. 23–24).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Crawford, Ian McGibbon ''New Zealand's Great War: New Zealand, the Allies, and the First World War''. Exisle Publishing, 2007 {{ISBN|0-908988-85-0}} (p. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; It strived to influence public opinion in New Zealand through petitions and public discussion.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt; By the late 1930s it was losing influence to two other New Zealand pacifist bodies: the New Zealand branch of the [[Peace Pledge Union]], and [[Archibald Charles Barrington|Archibald Barrington]] and [[Ormond Burton|Ormond Burton's]] Christian Pacifist Society of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. E. Cookson]], "Pacifism and Conscientious Objection in New Zealand" in Challenge to Mars: essays on pacifism from 1918 to 1945, edited by Peter Brock and Thomas P. Socknat.

The '''''pronoia''''' (plural '''''pronoiai'''''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: πρόνοια, meaning "care" or "forethought")&lt;ref&gt;"Economics in Late Byzantine World," from Foundation of the Hellenic World [http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html]&lt;/ref&gt; was a system of granting dedicated streams of state income to individuals and institutions in the late [[Byzantine Empire| Eastern Roman Empire]].  Beginning in the 11th century and continuing until the empire's conquest in the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;"Economics in Late Byzantine World," from Foundation of the Hellenic World [http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the system differed in significant ways from European [[feudalism]] of the same period.

==The institution==

A ''pronoia'' was a grant that temporarily transferred imperial fiscal rights to an individual or institution.  These rights were most commonly taxes or incomes from cultivated lands, but they could also be other income streams such as water and fishing rights, customs collection, etc. and the various rights to a specific piece of geography could be granted to separate individuals.  Grants were for a set period, usually lifetime, and revokable at will by the Emperor.  When institutions, usually monasteries, received grants they were effectively in perpetuity since the institutions were ongoing.  Grants were not transferable or (excluding certain exceptional cases late in the institution) hereditary; a ''pronoia'' gave the grantee possession, not ownership, which remained Imperial.&lt;ref&gt;"Economics in Late Byzantine World," from Foundation of the Hellenic World [http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The limits and specifics of a ''pronoia'' was recorded in an Imperial document called ''praktika'' ("records"); holders of ''pronoia'' (the grantees, in other words) were called ''pronoiarios'', and those working the income stream in question (for instance, farmers on the land) were called ''paroikoi'' in the documents.  The word ''pronoia'' could refer to the grant itself (land, for instance), its monetary value, or the income it produced.&lt;ref&gt;"Economics in Late Byzantine World," from Foundation of the Hellenic World [http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''pronoia'' were often used to reward military service or other loyalties, they carried no specific military obligation (in contrast to feudal [[fiefs]]), although the threat of revocation provided coercive power for the state.

==Early pronoia system==

By the 11th century, Roman [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s had ceased to hold any significant power.  Honorific titles and power were granted by the [[emperor]] and competition was fierce; the most desired grants were those that involved governance and tax collecting in various pieces of the Empire.  By the reign of [[Constantine IX]] in the middle part of the century they had also begun to assert sovereignty over various parts of the empire, collecting [[tax]]es for themselves and often plotting rebellions against the emperor.

In the late 11th century [[Alexius I]] attempted to reform the aristocracy, taking the pacifying measure of distributing Roman territory amongst its members. Doing so had the added benefit of removing them from [[Constantinople]], making it harder for them to directly challenge the emperor's authority. Most pronoiai granted by Alexius, however, were  to members of his own ([[Comnenus]]) family. Alexius simply legitimized the holding of land by aristocrats, and brought it under centralized state control.

==Pronoia in the 12th century==

Alexius' grandson [[Manuel I Comnenus]] continued to grant land to the aristocrats, but also extended pronoiai to aristocratic officers in the army, in place of giving them a regular salary. Pronoiai developed into essentially a license to [[tax]] the citizens who lived within the boundaries of the grant (the paroikoi). Pronoiars (those who had been granted a pronoia) became something like tax collectors, who were allowed to keep some of the revenue they collected. This idea was not completely new; centuries before, [[Heraclius]] had reorganized the empire's land into military districts called [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Themata]]. Under this system, military officers (strategoi) ran each district and collected rent from the peasants who farmed the land. However, the paroikoi, under either the Thema or pronoia system, were not [[serf]]s as peasants were in the [[feudalism|feudal system]] of western [[Europe]]. They owed no particular loyalty or service to the strategos or pronoiar, as in both cases the emperor was still the legal owner of the land. The pronoiar was most likely not even a native of the land he had been granted.

The size and value of the pronoia, the number of paroikoi, and the duties owed by them were recorded in praktika. A pronoiar would likely be able to collect trade revenue and part of the crop harvested on the land, and could also hold hunting rights and transportation rights. A praktika also recorded the duties owed by the pronoiar to the emperor. If necessary, the emperor could request military service, although the pronoiar could not force his taxpayers to join him. Pronoiars were often reluctant to give military service if he lived a prosperous life on his grant, and they had some autonomy if they chose not to serve. If they could gain the support of their taxpayers, they could lead rebellions against the empire, but these were not as dangerous as rebellions in the capital, which Alexius' system could now more successfully avoid. Neither Alexius, Manuel, or the other 12th century emperors seemed to worry about provincial rebellions, seemingly assuming that a pronoia grant would eventually appease a rebellious noble. During the [[Fourth Crusade]], [[Alexius IV]] still thought this way, and granted [[Crete]] to [[Boniface of Montferrat]], under the assumption that the Crusaders would go away if their leader had some land.

==Pronoia under the Palaeologan Dynasty==

After the Crusaders captured Constantinople in 1204, the pronoia system continued in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], where the emperors ruled in exile. [[John III Ducas Vatatzes]] also gave pronoiai to the church and noblewomen, which had not been done before. When Constantinople was recaptured by [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] in 1261, he allowed pronoiai to be inherited, which made the empire more like the feudal states in Europe. He also audited the pronoiai to make their values more realistic according to contemporary conditions, as the empire had lost much of its land and revenue since the 11th century. Under the [[Palaeologus|Palaeologans]], pronoiars could more easily be organized into military units if the emperor required their service. The emperor could also confiscate the revenues for whatever reason. [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]], for example, used the money raised by the pronoiars to finance military expeditions against the [[Bulgaria]]ns, but he did not require them to provide military service themselves. During this time pronoiars could also attract followers by giving them pronoia grants of their own.

Recruiting pronoiars to form an army helped unite the remnants of the empire after 1261. However, there were by this time only a few thousand pronoiars, and although they paid for their own expenses, the emperors could not afford a full army or navy to strengthen the empire's defenses. The impoverished empire had very little tax revenue, and pronoiars began to extract rents from the paroikoi, turning back to the old Thema system.

The empire continued to lose land to the [[Ottoman Empire]], and Constantinople was finally lost in 1453, but the Ottomans continued to use their own version of the pronoia system, called the [[timar]] system, which they had borrowed from the Eastern Romans during their conquests.

The '''Paris Institute of Political Studies''' ({{lang-fr|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris}}, {{IPA-fr|ɛ̃s.ti.ty de.tyd pɔ.li.tik də pa.ʁi}}), commonly referred to as '''Sciences Po''' ({{IPA-fr|sjɑ̃s po}}), is a prestigious and influential academic institution in the social sciences in France (legally a ''[[grande école]]''). It was founded in 1872 to promote a new class of French politicians in the aftermath of the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/education/20130114.OBS5306/emile-boutmy-l-inventeur-de-sciences-po-modele-du-defunt-richard-descoings.html|title=Emile Boutmy, l'inventeur de Sciences Po, modèle du défunt Richard Descoings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the primary institution of higher learning for French political and administrative elite.

Sciences Po  Alumni include 32 heads of state or government, 7 of the past 8 French Presidents, 3 past heads of the [[International Monetary Fund]], heads of international organizations (including the [[United Nations|UN]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[European Central Bank|ECB]]), and six of the [[CAC 40]] CEOs. The school has also educated numerous intellectual and cultural figures, such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[René Rémond]], [[Paul Claudel]], and [[Raymond Aron]]. In 2018, it was ranked as the world's 4th best school for politics and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2018|website=QS Top Universities}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sciences Po undertook an ambitious reform agenda starting in the mid-1990s, which broadened its focus to prepare students for the private sector, put an emphasis on the internationalization of the school's curriculum and student body, and established a special admission process for underprivileged applicants. It also expanded outside [[Paris]] by establishing additional campuses in [[Dijon]], [[Le Havre]], [[Menton]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Poitiers]], and [[Reims]]. The institution is a member of the [[Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs]] and the [[Global public policy networks|Global Public Policy Network]]. 

==History==
===1872 to 1945: École Libre des Sciences Politiques===
[[File:Émile Boutmy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sciences Po Founder, Émile Boutmy]]
Sciences Po was established in February 1872 as the ''École Libre des Sciences Politiques'' by a group of French intellectuals, politicians and businessmen led by [[Émile Boutmy]], and including [[Hippolyte Taine]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[Albert Sorel]] and [[Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu|Paul Leroy Beaulieu]]. Following defeat in the 1870 war, the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the [[Paris Commune]], these men sought to reform the training of French politicians. Politically and economically, people feared France's international stature was waning due to inadequate teaching of its political and diplomatic corps. ELSP was meant to serve as "the breeding ground where nearly all the major, non-technical state commissioners were trained."&lt;ref name="purpose"&gt;"Sciences Po 1945–1979" ''[http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm Centre d’histoire de Sciences Po] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012215250/http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm |date=12 October 2005 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

New disciplines such as [[International Relations]], [[International Law]], [[Political Economy]] and [[Comparative Government]] were introduced. In August 1894, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] spoke out for the need to advance the study of politics along the lines of ELSP. [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] used the purpose and curriculum of Sciences Po as part of their inspiration for creating the [[London School of Economics]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=Dahrendorf&gt;{{cite book|title= LSE: A History of the London School of Economics and Political Science, 1895–1995|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date= 1 June 1995|page= 73|url= https://books.google.co.jp/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=ja&amp;id=WxC2AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Paris |accessdate=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSP proved very successful at preparing candidates for entry into senior civil service posts, and acquired an image as a major feature of [[Politics of France|France’s political system]]. From 1901 to 1935, 92.5% of entrants to the [[Grands corps de l'État|Grands Corps de l'État]], which comprises the most powerful and prestigious administrative bodies in the [[French Civil Service|French civil service]], had studied there (this figure includes people who took civil service examination preparatory classes at Sciences Po but did not earn a degree).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nord|first1=Philip|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199256464|page=116|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=obsnUMoTM7&amp;sig=EoSMigDiS-FMrjedRZ20PwuSBPE&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuLpv4rUAhWBEpQKHWU-AtAQ6AEIRjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1945: the École Libre des Sciences Politiques becomes Sciences Po ===
Sciences Po underwent significant reforms in the aftermath of [[Liberation of Paris|France's liberation]] from [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation]] in 1945. The humiliation of [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|France's surrender to Nazi Germany]] and moreover the collapse of the [[Vichy regime]] provided the impetus for a major restructuring of the [[Government of France|state's institutions]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/stories/#!/fr/frise/33/de-l-ecole-libre-a-sciences-po/|title=Home|first=Sciences Po, FNSP 27 rue Saint Guillaume 75007|last=Paris|website=Sciences Po Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813084954/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.com/the-stateman/the-modernisation-of-the-country/reform-of-the-civil-service.html|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.com/the-stateman/the-modernisation-of-the-country/reform-of-the-civil-service.html|title=Reform of the civil service|archivedate=13 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles de Gaulle]], as leader of [[Provisional Government of the Fourth French Republic|France's Provisional Government]], appointed [[Michel Debré]] to overhaul of the recruiting and training of public servants. Though eight of thirteen ministers in De Gaulle's government were Sciences Po alumni, the university had also been instrumental in training the class of leaders whom many accused of having given in to Nazi aggression. Communist politicians including [[Georges Cogniot]] proposed abolishing the ELSP entirely and founding a new state-run administration college on its premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=obsnUMoTM7&amp;sig=EoSMigDiS-FMrjedRZ20PwuSBPE&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuLpv4rUAhWBEpQKHWU-AtAQ6AEIRjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&amp;f=false|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199256464|location=Oxford|page=138|last1=Nord|first1=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debré proposed the compromise that was eventually adopted. First, the government established the [[Ecole Nationale d'Administration]] (ENA), an elite postgraduate college for training government officials. From then on, the Grands Corps de l'Etat were obliged to recruit new entrants exclusively from the ENA's graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=obsnUMoTM7&amp;sig=EoSMigDiS-FMrjedRZ20PwuSBPE&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuLpv4rUAhWBEpQKHWU-AtAQ6AEIRjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&amp;f=false|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199256464|location=Oxford|page=141|last1=Nord|first1=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the École libre des sciences politiques was restructured into two separate legal entities: the Institut d'études politiques (IEP) and the Fondation nationale des sciences politiques (FNSP). Though legally a public institution, it was to be managed by a private trust, the newly-established ''Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques'' ({{lang-en|National Foundation of Political Science}}) or FNSP, with [[Roger Seydoux]] as its first president. Though the appointment of high-ranking faculty members now required government approval, the FNSP allowed Sciences Po to retain considerable administrative autonomy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure "the progress and the diffusion, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology".&lt;ref name="purpose" /&gt;

The epithet ''Sciences Po'' was applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.&lt;ref name="duality"&gt;"Le statut juridique de Sciences Po: la dualité FNSP et IEP de Paris" ''[http://www.sciences-po.fr/presse/sciencespo_infos/cc/txt_1.htm Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po]''&lt;/ref&gt; France's Legislature entrusted ''FNSP'' with managing ''IEP Paris'', its library, and budget, and an administrative council assured the development of these activities. The curriculum and methodology of the ''ELSP'' were also the template for creating a network of [[Institut d'études politiques|institutes of political studies]] throughout the country, namely in [[Institut d'études politiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Institut d'études politiques de Lyon|Lyon]], [[Sciences Po Aix|Aix]], [[Institut d'études politiques de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[Grenoble Institute of Political Studies|Grenoble]], [[Institut d'études politiques de Toulouse|Toulouse]], and then in [[Institut d'études politiques de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Sciences Po Lille|Lille]]. They are not to be confused with the seven campuses of Sciences Po in France.

It was now the ENA rather than Sciences Po that fed graduates directly into senior civil service posts. However, Sciences Po became the university of choice for those hoping to enter the ENA, and so retained its dominant place in educating high-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=tntEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=International+Dictionary+of+University+Histories+ecole+nationale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hd4Hj48kGi&amp;sig=EtjBDPjmqL9ONHPqmLGf1WQ1IdY&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrrmEuZTUAhWFupQKHTqDBJUQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ecole%20nationale%20d'administration&amp;f=false|title=International Dictionary of University Histories|date=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|isbn=9781134262175|location=Chicago|page=147|last1=Devine, Summerfield|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1945 to 1997 ===
Between 1952 and 1969, 77.5% of the ENA’s graduate student intake were Sciences Po alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nord|first1=Philip|title=The Jacobin Legacy in Modern France: Essays in Honour of Vincent Wright|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199256464|page=117|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rCfPBj-7g2IC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=Reform,+Conservation+and+Adaptation:+Sciences+Po,+from+the+Popular+Front+to+the+Liberation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=obsnUMoTM7&amp;sig=EoSMigDiS-FMrjedRZ20PwuSBPE&amp;hl=ja&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuLpv4rUAhWBEpQKHWU-AtAQ6AEIRjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Reform%2C%20Conservation%20and%20Adaptation%3A%20Sciences%20Po%2C%20from%20the%20Popular%20Front%20to%20the%20Liberation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''FNSP'' further strengthened its role as a scientific publication center with significant donations from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. ''FNSP'' periodicals such as ''la Revue française de science politique'', ''le Bulletin analytique de documentation'', ''la Chronologie politique africaine'', and the ''Cahiers de la Fondation'' as well as its seven research centres and main publishing house, ''Presses de Sciences Po'', consolidated the university's reputation as a research hub.&lt;ref name="purpose" /&gt;

===The Richard Descoings era (1997–2012)===

Sciences Po underwent various reforms under the directorship of [[Richard Descoings]] (1997–2012). In these years, Sciences Po introduced a compulsory year abroad component to its undergraduate degree, and began to offer a multilingual curriculum in French, English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/29/7-countries-where-americans-can-study-at-universities-in-english-for-free-or-almost-free/|title=7 countries where Americans can study at universities, in English, for free (or almost free)|last=Noack|first=Rick|date=2014-10-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other languages. It was during this period that Sciences Po added its regional campuses.

Sciences Po also implemented reforms in its admissions process. Previously, Sciences Po recruited its students exclusively on the basis of a competitive examination. This system was seen to favor students from prestigious preparatory high schools or those who could afford year-long preparatory courses. In 2001, Science Po founded the Equal Opportunity Program governing council widened its admissions policy.&lt;ref name=NYUsource&gt;"Sciences Po ― an elite institution's introspection on its power, position and worth in French society" ''NYU Department of Journalism'', 9 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This program enables the institution to recruit high-potential students at partner high schools in France who, due to a social and financial constraints, would not otherwise have applied to Sciences Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/an-affirmative-action-success/30333|title=An Affirmative-Action Success|last=Kahlenberg|first=Richard D.|date=2011-09-13|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education Blogs: Innovations|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has been accused of being superficial and being in fact a "lotto for poor people".&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Descoings ou la loterie des pauvres », Marianne 2, January 15, 2009".&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2011, the proportion of scholarship students at Sciences Po went from 6 percent to 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/world/europe/05iht-educLede05.html|title=In France, a Bastion of Privilege No More|date=2011-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descoings was accused of "reigning as almighty master on his school, by distributing material advantages and "small envelopes", and setting up a clientelist and authoritarian "carrot system""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/111009/sciences-po-bienvenue-la-cour-du-roi-richard|title=Sciences-Po: bienvenue à la Cour du roi Richard!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to implement a "management of fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/121009/sciences-po-un-new-management-version-management-de-la-peur|title=Sciences-Po: un "new management" version "management de la peur"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013–2022: reorganization and development under President Frédéric Mion ===
Frédéric Mion, a graduate of Sciences Po, ENA and École Normale Supérieure and former secretary general of [[Canal+]], was appointed president of Sciences Po on 1 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/enseignement-superieur/article/2013/03/02/un-pur-produit-de-l-elite-francaise-pour-sciences-po_1841735_1473692.html|title=Un pur produit de l’élite française pour Sciences Po|last=Brafman|first=Nathalie|date=2013-03-02|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-06-21|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intention to pursue Sciences Po's development as a "selective university of international standing" is detailed in the policy paper "Sciences Po 2022", published in the spring of 2014. The restructuring of Master's study into graduate schools continued with the creation of the School of Public Affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/orientation/actus-et-conseils/detail/article/sciences-po-ouvre-une-ecole-des-affaires-publiques-16671/|title=Sciences Po ouvre une "École des affaires publiques"|work=Le Figaro Etudiant|access-date=2017-06-21|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Urban School in 2015 and the School of Management and Innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/sciences-po-va-ouvrir-son-ecole-du-management-et-de-l-innovation-03-10-2016-2073221_23.php|title=Sciences Po va ouvrir son "école du management et de l'innovation"|last=magazine|first=Le Point,|date=2016-10-03|work=Le Point|access-date=2017-06-21|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016.

In early 2016, Sciences Po updated its governance structure, adopting new statutes for its two constituent bodies: the ''Fondation nationale des sciences politiques'' (FNSP) and the ''Institut d'études politiques de Paris'' (IEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n° 2015-1829 du 29 décembre 2015 portant approbation des statuts de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques|date=29 December 2015|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000031740005|accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reform is "the most significant since 1945" and clarifies Sciences Po's governance with new rules, which address observations made by the Cour de comptes in a 2012 report.

In late 2016, Sciences Po acquired a new site, the Hôtel de l'Artillerie in the 6th arrondissement of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/l-hotel-de-l-artillerie-va-accueillir-le-futur-campus-de-sciences-po-14-05-2017-6948768.php|title=L’hôtel de l’Artillerie va accueillir le futur campus de Sciences-po|last=|first=|date=2017-05-14|work=leparisien.fr|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it intends to make the new heart of its urban campus and a seat of "educational renewal". In April 2018, Sciences Po students peacefully blocked the main entrance to the school in protest against Macron's education reforms which, while giving public Universities the power to set admission criteria and rank applicants, may  violate the principle of free education for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20180418/paris-french-students-blockade-sciences-po-university|title=Paris: French students blockade prestigious Sciences Po university|date=2018-04-18|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sciences Po is not affected by this legislation by virtue of it being a private University, students stood in solidarity with protestors at public Universities. 

==Campuses==

Sciences Po has seven campuses in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/en/about/our-campuses|title=Our campuses|publisher=Sciences Po |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris campus===

The Paris campus hosts undergraduate students enrolled in the general curriculum programme, the dual bachelor's degree with UCL as well as all seven graduate schools. The Paris campus is spread across several buildings concentrated around the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in the 6th and 7th arrondissements (districts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cie.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SciencesPo-map.jpg|title=Le campus|publisher=Sciences Po and University of Toronto|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic centre of Sciences Po at 27 rue Saint-Guillaume houses the head office and central library since 1879. It is also home to Sciences Po's two largest teaching halls, the Amphitheatres Émile Boutmy and Jacques Chapsal. Other buildings include:
{{colbegin}}

In 2016 Sciences Po purchased the Hôtel de l’Artillerie, a 17th-century former monastery located 200 meters from its campus on Rue St.Guillaume. The building was previously the property of the French Ministry of Defense and is 14,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size. The university has announced its intention to refurbish the building as a major addition to its facilities in Paris. It is estimated that this project will cost around 200 million euros in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/lh%C3%B4tel-de-lartillerie|title=/ L'Hôtel de l'Artillerie - Sciences Po|website=www.sciencespo.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vousnousils.fr/2016/06/17/sciences-po-achete-lhotel-de-lartillerie-pour-creer-un-campus-dans-paris-589719|title=Sciences Po achète l’Hôtel de l’Artillerie pour créer un campus dans Paris » VousNousIls|date=17 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hôtel de l’Artillerie will house new facilities for Sciences Po’s graduate programs, including a courtroom for the Law School and a newsroom for the Journalism School. It will also incorporate a cafeteria, study areas and accommodation for 50 to 100 students on scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/17/06/2016/lesechos.fr/0211041464595_sciences-po-se-dote-d-un-grand-campus-au-coeur-de-paris.htm|title=Sciences Po se dote d’un grand campus au cœur de Paris|date=17 June 2016|website=lesechos.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frédéric Mion, the director of Sciences Po, stated his intention to create a campus comparable in quality and capacity to Sciences Po’s most prominent international partner universities such as Columbia University, the London School of Economics and Hong Kong University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/l-hotel-de-l-artillerie-future-vitrine-pedagogique-de-sciences-po.html|title=L’hôtel de l’Artillerie, future vitrine pédagogique de Sciences po Paris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dijon campus ===
Located in the region of [[Burgundy]] in a magnificent 19th century building, the [[Dijon]] campus was created in 2001.

=== Le Havre Campus ===
Located on the coast of [[Normandy]], [[Le Havre]] has hosted the undergraduate Euro-Asian campus since 2007, recently celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the campus in September 2017. With a choice between a history, law, or economics major, students primarily choose to spend their third year abroad in an Asian country. Furthermore, Le Havre is home to six Dual Degree programs, and welcomes international students from over thirty countries from all around the world.

=== Menton campus ===
Established in the [[French Riviera]] city of [[Menton]] in 2005, the campus is located in an entirely renovated 19th century building overlooking the Mediterranean. Menton is home to the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean focus branch of Sciences Po. Students study in one of two tracks (anglophone/francophone) and must take one of three core Oriental languages (Arabic, Farsi, or Turkish) in order to graduate. The third mandatory year abroad is spent in the Middle East (with the exception of derogation and/or national origin, or participation in a dual degree program).

=== Nancy campus ===
Established in the region of [[Lorraine]] in 2000, the Nancy campus is located in a prestigious 18th century heritage site, the Hôtel des Missions Royales.

=== Poitiers campus ===
Opened in 2010, the campus is located in the heart of the historic city of [[Poitiers]] in the Hôtel Chaboureau, a renovated building dating from the 15th century.

In the heart of the Champagne region, the [[Reims]] campus opened in September 2010.  It is housed in the 17th century ''College des Jesuits''.  It is by far the largest of the regional campuses of Sciences Po, hosting both the Europe-North America program and the Europe-Africa Program as well as an exchange program.  In addition to the traditional undergraduate programs, the Reims campus is also host to several dual degree programs, including ones with [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  As of the beginning of the academic year in 2018, there were roughly 1500 students enrolled across all three programs.

In the fall of 2017, a brand new section of the campus, complete with a new cafeteria and amphitheater was opened to accommodate even more students.

==Education==
The academic bodies of Sciences Po consist of the University College, six professional schools, and the Doctoral School. The university also contains a library system, the Presses de Sciences-Po, and holds ties with a number of independent academic institutions, including [[Columbia University]], [[King's College London]], the [[National University of Singapore]], and the Sorbonne Paris Cité [[University of Paris#Successors and legacy|alliance]].

=== Undergraduate level ===
The Sciences Po Undergraduate College offers a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree with a multidisciplinary foundation in the humanities and social sciences with emphasis on civic, linguistic, artistic, and digital training.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencespo.fr/en/education/undergraduate-studies#Dual|title=Undergraduate studies at Sciences Po|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On all campuses, students choose a multidisciplinary major - Politics &amp; Government, Economies &amp; Societies, or Political Humanities. In addition, each campus offers a different regional concentration that anchors students intellectual objectives : Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East-Mediterranean, and North America.

===Reputation and criticism===

Due to its prominent alumni, its selectivity and its history of providing candidates for admission to the École nationale d'administration, Sciences Po is seen in France and abroad as an elite institution.&lt;ref name="Conley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/portfolio/conley/sciencespo.html|title=Sciences Po ― an elite institution's introspection on its power, position and worth in French society|last=Conley|first=Marjorie|date=9 September 2003|website=Portfolio, The Journalism of Ideas|publisher=New York University|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2016 193"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elite Schools: Multiple Geographies of Privilege|last=Koh|first=Aaron|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1--138-77940-2|location=New York; Oxon|pages=193,|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenplan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/04/world/elite-french-college-tackles-affirmative-action.html|title=In France, a Bastion of Privilege No More|last=Guttenplan|first=D.D.|date=4 May 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=10 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was criticised, as well as the École nationale d'administration, for creating in France an oligarchy of disconnected with reality, '...blinkered, arrogant and frequently incompetent people.'&lt;ref name="Lichfield"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/liberte-inegalite-fraternite-is-french-elitism-holding-the-country-back-8621650.html|title=Liberte, inegalite, fraternite: Is French elitism holding the country back?|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=17 May 2013|work=The Independent|access-date=10 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sciences Po is now recognized for its efforts to promote social inclusion in higher education. Central to Sciences Po's policy to diversify its student body is the Equal Opportunity Programme, launched in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/world/europe/05iht-educLede05.html|title=In France, a Bastion of Privilege No More|date=2011-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of scholarship holders among Sciences Po students has increased four-fold over the past ten years, with 27% of students now receiving scholarships or need-based financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2015/01/16/sciences-po-paris-moins-de-candidats-mais-un-recrutement-plus-diversifie_4558138_4401467.html|title=Sciences Po Paris : 64 % des admis viennent de province|last=Maillard|first=Benoît Floc'h et Matteo|date=2015-01-16|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-10-09|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution is partly state-funded, and some have accused it of receiving a disproportionate share of public money. In 2012, a joint statement from Sciences Po Lille students representatives called Sciences Po (Paris) the "coronation of inegalitary State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/bixente-etchecaharreta/sciences-po-le-sacre-de-l_b_1257993.html|title=Sciences Po : le sacre de l'Etat inégalitaire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sciences Po has also been accused of being unduly helped by the media. "Almost every French newspaper is run by an almunus of Sciences Po", and most of the journalists in France are alumni from Science Po, so it would give the school "a mediatic cover without equivalent" and permit it to "cultivate a culture of secrecy" about its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1nfo.net/35102|title=Ce qui ne se dit jamais sur Sciences-Po et les médias...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediapart.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/121009/sciences-po-une-strategie-de-communication-qui-elimine-les-questions-genantes?onglet=full|title=Sciences-Po: une stratégie de communication qui élimine les questions gênantes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sciences-Po is under-criticized," analyzes a professor. Former students are unlikely to criticize it. "Those who teach there have no interest, and not necessarily the urge, to do so. Those who are not there can hope to be there one day."&lt;ref name="mediapart.fr"/&gt; The journalist [[Ariane Chemin]] stated in 2013 that, because so many journalists come from Sciences Po, the school has an undue good public reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Ariane Chemin in [https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/service-public/service-public-05-mars-2013 France Inter, L'école de l'élite : Sciences Pipo ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Political and financial scandals===
Alain Lancelot, director of Sciences Po from 1987 to 1996, was investigated for financial mismanagement by the [[Court of Audit (France)|French Court of Audit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.challenges.fr/france/sciences-po-la-cour-des-comptes-demande-des-poursuites_189798|title=Sciences Po : la Cour des comptes demande des poursuites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, the institution has been hit by a number of scandals, notably concerning the leadership of [[Richard Descoings]], its director from 1997 to 2012.&lt;ref name="mediapart.fr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/culture-idees/dossier/dossier-sciences-po-la-fuite-en-avant-et-les-scandales|title=Dossier: Sciences-Po, la fuite en avant et les scandales - Mediapart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.contrepoints.org/2012/10/12/100252-la-derive-financiere-de-sciences-po-et-la-complaisance-de-letat|title=La dérive financière de Sciences Po et la complaisance de l’État|date=12 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.contrepoints.org/2012/10/12/100252-la-derive-financiere-de-sciences-po-et-la-complaisance-de-letat|title=La dérive financière de Sciences Po et la complaisance de l’État|date=12 October 2012|website=Contrepoints}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descoing, president from 1997 to 2012, had been criticized for offering large sums of money (through salary rise, free accommodation, etc.) to diverse members of staff, included his wife, in spite of the fact that Sciences Po is partly stately funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/131211/les-dirigeants-de-sciences-po-touchent-des-superbonus|title=Les dirigeants de Sciences-Po touchent des superbonus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, it was revealed that an inspector of the French Court of Audit, in charge of investigating the financial behaviour of Sciences Po, was at the same time employed by Sciences Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/200212/quand-sciences-po-salarie-son-controleur-0?onglet=full|title=Quand Sciences-Po salarie son contrôleur|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  3 April 2012, Descoings was found dead in his Manhattan luxury hotel room during a trip to represent Sciences Po in New York. The police initially concluded that his death had been caused by an overdose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120405/midtown/cops-believe-french-scholar-accidentally-overdosed|title=Cops Believe French Scholar Accidentally Overdosed|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913154940/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120405/midtown/cops-believe-french-scholar-accidentally-overdosed|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the final coronary report eventually stated that he died a natural death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/enseignement-superieur/article/2012/05/30/richard-descoings-est-mort-de-causes-naturelles-selon-le-legiste_1709952_1473692.html|title=Richard Descoings est mort|date=30 May 2012|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descoings' energy on this last day and the missing phones and computer have raised questions as to the precise circumstances of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/04/justice/new-york-academic-death/index.html|title=French educator found dead in New York was dynamic, controversial figure - CNN.com|first=By Jethro Mullen|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Court of Audit reprimanded Sciences Po for financial mismanagement, accusing it of opaque remuneration procedures, unwarranted expenses claims and excessive pay-rises for managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.educpros.fr/pierredubois/files/2012/10/sciences-po-paris.pdf|title=Educpros : actualités et services pour les professionnels de l'éducation. - Educpros.fr|website=blog.educpros.fr|access-date=27 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828193613/http://blog.educpros.fr/pierredubois/files/2012/10/sciences-po-paris.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the university’s complex legal status – a public university managed by a private trust – had contributed to dysfunction and waste. It also criticized the [[Government of France|French government]] for increasing state funding for the university without insisting on additional public oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccomptes.fr/Actualites/Archives/Sciences-Po-une-forte-ambition-une-gestion-defaillante#Conclusion|title=Sciences Po : une forte ambition, une gestion défaillante / Archives / Actualités / Accueil / Cour des Comptes - Cour des comptes|first=Cour des|last=comptes|website=www.ccomptes.fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826020100/http://www.ccomptes.fr/Actualites/Archives/Sciences-Po-une-forte-ambition-une-gestion-defaillante#Conclusion|archivedate=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/07/08/la-cour-des-comptes-fustige-la-gestion-de-sciences-po_1730681_3224.html|title=La Cour des comptes fustige la gestion de Sciences Po|first=Benoît|last=Floc'h|date=8 July 2012|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sciences Po has also been accused to prevail results over morals.&lt;ref name="answer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2012/10/10/derives-science-po-la-direction-en-appelle-la-fierte-des-etudiants-236043|title=Document&amp;nbsp;: la réponse de Sciences-Po à la Cour des comptes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, [[Hervé Crès]] has been dismissed by the government, but he sought to president of Sciences Po anyway, saying that Alain Lancelot and Richard Descoings have been found guilty too, but it doesn’t matter for what concerns the presidency of Sciences Po.&lt;ref name="cres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenges.fr/france/20121122.CHA3444/sciences-po-la-cour-des-comptes-demande-des-poursuites.html|title=Sciences Po : l'Etat repousse la nomination d'Hervé Crès|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828231435/http://www.challenges.fr/france/20121122.CHA3444/sciences-po-la-cour-des-comptes-demande-des-poursuites.html|archivedate=28 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Jean-Claude Casanova, the former president of the Foundation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, the private trust which manages Sciences Po, was fined €1500 for failing to properly consult the Foundation’s Administrative Council over budgeting decisions involving public money. The Court of Financial and Budgetary Discipline eventually found Casanova guilty, but sentenced him with leniency because the procedures had some part of regularity and because it wasn’t customary in Sciences Po to follow all the financial rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2015/07/24/scandale-des-salaires-a-sciences-po-jean-claude-casanova-renvoye-devant-la-cour-de-discipline-budgetaire_4696940_1473685.html|title=Scandale des salaires à Sciences Po : Jean-Claude Casanova renvoyé devant la Cour de discipline budgétaire|date=24 July 2015|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/12/04/jean-claude-casanova-condamne-dans-l-affaire-sciences-po_4824373_3224.html|title=Jean-Claude Casanova condamné dans l’" affaire Sciences Po "|first=Benoît|last=Floc'h|date=4 December 2015|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the Court of Audit noted that reforms had been made but stated that greater transparency was still needed. Frédéric Mion, director of Sciences Po since 2013, defended the university’s record and asked the judges to write their report again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/02/10/ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-du-rapport-de-la-cour-des-comptes-2016-en-7-graphes_4862552_4355770.html|title=Ce qu’il faut retenir du rapport de la Cour des comptes 2016 en 7 graphes|first=Les|last=Décodeurs|date=10 February 2016|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.challenges.fr/economie/prise-de-bec-entre-la-cour-des-comptes-et-sciences-po_40260|title=Prise de bec entre la Cour des comptes et Sciences-Po|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values'''&lt;ref&gt;The Scottish League is not to be confused with the Scottish League for Land-Value Taxation,  formed in 1948 "from [the] remaining three leagues established in Scotland at turn of the century"—see {{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_unitedkingdom-r-z.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715003927/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_unitedkingdom-r-z.html |archivedate=15 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is an independent national campaigning organisation that advocates radical reform of Scotland's system of taxation. Known as The Scottish League, the organisation advances the programme of the nineteenth-century American social reformer [[Henry George]]. The League publishes books and other material, and is a participant in the ongoing public debate over the future of Scotland’s land and tax system.

The Scottish League was constituted in 1890, emerging out of the complex reorganisation that year of the [[Scottish Land Restoration League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The League seemed then to have exhausted its energies, and a new organisation was constituted, culminating in the present Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_unitedkingdom-r-z.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715003927/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_unitedkingdom-r-z.html |archivedate=15 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It campaigned vigorously during the public and parliamentary debate surrounding the Land Values (Scotland) Bill at the turn of the twentieth century. That Bill was initiated at the League’s request, and intended to be prototype UK legislation. [[Viscount Ridley]], speaking in the House of Lords in 1908 (before the reforming [[Parliament Act 1911|1911 Parliament Act]]), at the second reading of the ill-starred Bill, claimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Behind this Bill is the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values, and the real support that the Bill gets is from gentlemen who think it would be to the advantage of this country to tax all land values out of existence.... I ask your Lordships to reject the Bill because I believe it to be unfair, incomplete, and impracticable, and that no amount of amendment or modification could affect the principle of the Bill.... It is begotten by fanatical societies out of an ignorant Government; it stands...unsound and vicious.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bill was "passed by the House of Commons by a great majority in 1907, but was rejected by the Lords".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 1909, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish League was also firmly engaged in the legislative process surrounding the 1931 Finance Bill, which it came to repudiate. [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]], Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and future Chancellor of the Exchequer, addressed the Commons:&lt;blockquote&gt; Let us consider whether after three weeks of existence this Bill is in a very happy condition…. We must not suppose that the cursing comes only from the critics, who might be thought to be naturally opposed to this system of taxation. I hold in my hand a communication from the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values. I read it with interest, because we know that if one could look anywhere for the pure milk of the word on this subject it would be to the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values. This is what it says: "The present proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer will penalise the landowners who are putting their land to the best possible use just as much as it punishes the owners who are holding land idle, or making a partial use of it. This in itself condemns the present proposals, and marks the scheme as a political stunt “.&lt;ref&gt;

The Scottish League has been actively involved in Glasgow City Council’s 2009 initiative to reform local taxation on the basis of land values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Formation ==
Ragging has been taking a huge toll of innocent lives and careers for long. But there had been no single civil movement against the evil of ragging. There were websites and online groups, from where some conscientious youths gave birth to a non profit organisation, which later came to fame in the name of the "No Ragging Foundation". Later, the No Ragging Foundation was registered as the Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE).&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite news

Amit Sahai Gangwar, a first year student of NIT-Jalandhar lost his life in October 2005. The news was covered by various media - news channels and dailies.

'''Tea Importation Act of 1897''' was a United States [[public law]] forbidding the [[import]] of [[tea]] into the United States with excessive levels of [[Fluoride toxicity|fluoride]], [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]], [[oxalate]], and [[pesticide]]s. The [[Act of Congress]] established a uniform standard of purity and quality while attempting to achieve the optimal [[health effects of tea]] and [[phenolic content in tea]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}  The statute declared it unlawful to import into the United States "any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the standards kept at customhouses..."&lt;ref name = "21 U.S.C. §§ 301"&gt;21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq&lt;/ref&gt;  For nearly a century, Congress provided that no imported tea could enter the United States unless federal tea-tasters decided that it measured up to preselected standard samples.  The law restricted the [[International trade]] of [[camellia sinensis]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The 1897 [[statute]] superseded the Spurious Tea Importation Act of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/47/session-2/chap-64.pdf |title=Spurious Tea Importation Act of 1883 ~ P.L. 47-64 |date=March 2, 1883 |series=22 Stat. 451 ~ House Bill 7486 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://research.archives.gov/id/5716295 |title=Spurious Tea Importation Act of 1883 ~ House Bill 7486 |date=March 2, 1883 |series=P.L. 47-64 ~ 22 Stat. 451 |publisher= National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was on the books for 99 years before its repeal in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Act of March 2, 1897, ch. 358, 29 Stat. 604 (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. Sec. 41-50 (1994))&lt;/ref&gt;  After repeal, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] still regulates the quality of tea imported to the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.&lt;ref name = "21 U.S.C. §§ 301" /&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The United States statute had twelve sections and authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] to implement the law. 

As codified just before its repeal, the Act instructed the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] each year "to appoint a board, to consist of seven members, each of whom shall be an expert in teas, and who shall prepare and submit to him standard samples of tea."&lt;ref&gt;21 U.S.C. Sec. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  In accordance with the board of experts' recommendations, the Secretary was instructed to "fix and establish uniform standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption of all kinds of teas imported unto the United States" and to deposit samples of these standards in the [[customhouse]]s of various ports of entry.  Tea importers were required to submit samples of their product for comparison with the standard samples kept at the customhouses. The imported samples were then tested "by a duly qualified examiner,"  who would test "the purity, quality, and fitness for consumption of the... [imported tea samples] according to the usages and customs of the tea trade, including the testing of an [[infusion]] of the same in boiling water and, if necessary, chemical analysis."

==Board of Tea Appeals==
'''The Board of Tea Appeals''' was a [[United States]] [[Government agency|federal agency]] under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. From its establishment in 1897 until its abolishment in 1996, it adjudicated the claims of [[tea]] importers whose products were denied entry into the United States by federal tea-tasters.  The Board was authorized to permit delivery or order destruction or exportation of substandard teas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C2.txt Office of the Law Revision Counsel Ch 2 Tea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911112021/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C2.txt |date=September 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment and Repeal of 1897 Act==
The Tea Importation Act of 1908 amended the 1897 public law permitting the import of tea siftings, tea sweepings, or tea waste for the [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] of [[caffeine]] or theine, and other [[Phenolic content in tea|chemical products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/60/publaw-117.pdf |title=Tea Importation Act of 1908 ~ P.L. 60-117 |date=May 16, 1908 |series=35 Stat. 163 ~ Senate Bill 514 |publisher= Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1897 Act was repealed with the United States 104th Congressional session enactment of the Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ128/pdf/PLAW-104publ128.pdf |title=Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996 ~ P.L. 104-128 |date=April 9, 1996 |series=110 Stat. 1198 ~ House Bill 2969 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/2969 |title=H.R. 2969 ~ Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act of 1996 |date=February 23, 1996 |series=P.L. 104-128 ~ 110 Stat. 1198 |publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Imperial Cruise''''' is a non-fiction book authored by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]].  In the book Bradley examines American policy in the Pacific during the [[presidency of Theodore Roosevelt]], and a surrounding a secret diplomatic/Congressional mission to Asia conceived by Roosevelt which would affect United States involvement in Asia.  The material also covers a wide array of other cultural factors that loosely relate to this, the largest diplomatic delegation ever sent to Asia in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="theimperialcruise"&gt;{{cite book

''The Imperial Cruise''.&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the book's themes, Bradley presents evidence in the form of Roosevelt's personal letters and pictures.  Nevertheless, the book's historical accuracy has proved controversial, with some historians, specialists and reviewers pointing out Bradley's methods as faulty.   

==Synopsis==
The book centers on the diplomatic mission of the {{SS|Manchuria|1903|6}} sent by President Theodore Roosevelt in the summer of 1905. On board was the largest diplomatic mission delegation in U.S. history, including some of the highest profile political figures of the time.  They included Secretary of War (and future President) [[William Howard Taft]]; Roosevelt's daughter, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Roosevelt]]; her future husband, Congressman (and later Speaker of the House) [[Nicholas Longworth]]; along with 29 other members of the House and Senate, and their wives; and an array of additional high-ranking military and civilian officials.&lt;ref&gt;''The Imperial Cruise'' - p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his initial description and introduction of the ''SS Manchuria's'' voyage, the author explores brief excerpts of the history behind the period's American domestic and foreign policy, elaborating on its influence, motivation, and consequences, specifically in regard to [[Japan–United States relations|American-Japanese]], [[Sino-Japanese relations|Sino-Japanese]], and [[Japan–Russia relations|Russo-Japanese]] relations.&lt;ref name="theimperialcruise" /&gt;

More broadly, Bradley explores his contention relating to how deep-set [[W.A.S.P. (band)|WASP]]&lt;ref&gt;"White Anglo-Saxon Protestant" - In 1906, Roosevelt wrote: "The world would have halted had it not been for the Teutonic conquests of alien lands." - Bradley, James.

.&lt;/ref&gt; biases and racially deterministic philosophies&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Thomas G. "Theodore Roosevelt and the Idea of Race" Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; fueled and undergirded virtually all U.S. foreign and domestic policy-making in that era pertaining to U.S. relations with other nations and to populations of other racial, cultural or religious heritages.  This included virtually all peoples of non-[[Teutons|Teutonic]] [[Anglo-Saxon]] descent, and resulted, for example, in the slaughter of more than 250,000 [[Filipinos]] during the U.S. colonial take-over of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Imperial Cruise'' - p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Bradley's contention that the actions of one Roosevelt, and the diplomatic cruise in the summer of 1905, lit that fuse that would doom more than 100,000 U.S. military to die in the Pacific theater decades later under another Roosevelt in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Imperial Cruise'' - p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through what Bradley describes as their "bumbling diplomacy", he describes how Teddy Roosevelt and his emissary Taft turned previously friendly Japanese sentiment, against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''The Imperial Cruise'' - p.322.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''The Imperial Cruise'' has received mixed reviews.  Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' Review of Books, Janet Maslin noted that "''The Imperial Cruise'' is startling enough to reshape conventional wisdom about Roosevelt's presidency". At the same time, she criticized the author, which favors "broad strokes and may at times be overly eager to connect historical dots,but he also produces graphic, shocking evidence of the attitudes that his book describes."&lt;ref&gt;name="newyorktimesreview"&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[USA Today]]'' was neutral, calling it useful for readers who think that history "is the story of good guys and bad guys", and expressing disappointment with the "relentlessly sarcastic" tone and lack of ambiguity.  Chiefly, ''USA Today'' noted an unresolved historical issue at the heart of Bradley's thesis, which argues that Japan was inspired by the visit of the U.S. delegation to pursue imperialistic expansion in 1905, when Japan had no such ambitions.  Bradley's book argues that it was the American delegation's seminal influence that both inspired Japanese imperialistic adventurism, including eventually and ironically, their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and also continuing tensions between the United States and Asian nations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Imperial Cruise'' - p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bradley argues that "The U.S. Army had brought the Aryan to the Pacific coast", ''USA Today'' cited his  failure to explain how "in the 1930s, imperial Japan would act on the secret words of a man dead for more than a decade and out of office since 1909."&lt;ref name="usatodayreview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hampson |first=Rick |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2009-11-25-imperialcruise25_ST_N.htm |title='Imperial Cruise' hits rough waters in attack of Roosevelt |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as  M. Patrick Cullinane of Northumbria University rejects Bradley's main themes as extreme exaggerations based on misinterpretations. He says the treatment of Roosevelt is "grossly unfair" and Bradley ignores the Asian role in the multiple catastrophes blamed on Roosevelt.&lt;ref&gt;M. Patrick Cullinane,  "James Bradley, The Imperial Cruise...." ''Journal of American Studies'' 45.#1 (2011): E5. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8195765&amp;fileId=S0021875810002264 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor William N. Tilchin of Boston University attacks "Bradley's stupendously faulty analysis, ''The Imperial Cruise'' is a profoundly ignorant book even on the basic level of undisputed objective facts."  He writes:
:The pomposity and the utter absurdity of ''The Imperial Cruise'' are starkly previewed in a single sentence in the book's sixth paragraph:  "This book reveals that behind [Roosevelt's] Asian whispers that critical summer of 1905 was a very big stick—the bruises from which would catalyze World War II in the Pacific, the Chinese Communist Revolution, the Korean War, and an array of tensions that inform our lives today." (24)  This grandiose, ridiculous assertion is made without even the remotest understanding of Theodore Roosevelt's diplomacy or of either U.S. foreign policy or internal Japanese developments between 1905 and 1941.  The central notion that TR "gave" Korea to Japan—when Japan actually had previously secured control of Korea—is preposterous and, moreover, completely fails to explore the president's main alternative to endorsing Japanese rule:  TR could have gratuitously antagonized Japan over this matter, thereby endangering the U.S. position in the Philippines and, more generally, signaling the Japanese that they should view the United States as a hostile rival.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Tilchin, "James Bradley's ''The Imperial Cruise'' is an Outrage, Pure and Simple," ''Theodore Roosevelt Association Journal'' (2010) 31#4 pp. 39-45 [http://hnn.us/article/140862#sthash.mKgLbR7F.dpuf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkish courts-martial of 1919–20''' were [[courts-martial]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] that occurred soon after the [[Armistice of Mudros]], in the [[aftermath of World War I]].

==Background==

===World War I===
{{see also|World War I}}
Following the reportage by US Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] of the [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian Genocide]] at the city of [[Defense of Van (1915)|Van]], the [[Triple Entente]] formally warned the [[Second Constitutional Era|Ottoman Empire]] on 24 May 1915 that:

{{quote |In view of these new crimes of [[Turkey]] against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the [[Sublime Porte]] that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Government]], as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=hr933&amp;dbname=106&amp; | title = Affirmation of the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide Resolution | author = 106th Congress, 2nd Session, House of Representatives | publisher = The Library of Congress | year = 1915}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.RES.316 | publisher = The Library of Congress | title = Affirmation of the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide Resolution (Introduced in House of Representatives) | author = 109th Congress, 1st Session}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HE00316: | title = H.RES.316 | date = June 14, 2005 | publisher = Library of Congress}}. 15 September 2005 House Committee/Subcommittee:International Relations actions.

In the months leading up to the end of [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire had undergone major restructuring. In July of that 1918, Sultan [[Mehmed V]] died and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Mehmed VI]]. The Ministers of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], including the [[Three Pashas]] who ran the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Government]] between 1913 and 1918, had resigned from office and fled the country soon afterwards. Successful Allied offensives in [[Macedonian Front|Salonika]] posed a direct threat to the Ottoman capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=findley&gt;Findley, Carter Vaughn. ''Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity''. Yale University Press, 2010, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan Mehmed VI appointed [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]] to the position of [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] and tasked him with the assignment of seeking an armistice with the Allied Powers and ending Ottoman involvement in the war.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''The Emergence of Modern Turkey''. Oxford University Press, 1968, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 1918, an [[Armistice of Mudros|armistice]] was signed between the Ottomans, represented by the Minister of the Navy [[Rauf Orbay]], and the Allies, represented by British Admiral Sir [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe]]. The armistice essentially ended Ottoman participation in the war and required the Empire's forces to stand down although there still remained approximately one million soldiers in the field and small scale fighting continued in the frontier provinces into November 1918.&lt;ref name=findley/&gt;

===Surrender of Constantinople===

{{further|Armistice of Mudros|Occupation of Constantinople}}
In November 1918, Britain appointed [[Admiral]] Sir [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe]] as High Commissioner and [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Richard Webb (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Webb]] as Assistant High Commissioner in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=malta/&gt; A French brigade later entered Constantinople on November 12, 1918, and the British Troops first entered the city on November 13, 1918. Early on December in 1918, Allied troops occupied sections of Constantinople and set up a military administration.

The [[US Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] summoned the representatives of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] (a founding member of the [[Freedom and Accord Party]] or ''Liberal Union Party''). The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] established "The Commission on Responsibilities and Sanctions" in January 1919.

On January 2, 1919, Gough-Calthorpe requested from the Foreign Office authority to obtain the arrest and handing over of all those responsible for the incessant breaches of the terms of the Armistice and the continued ill-treatment of Armenians. Calthorpe got together a staff of dedicated assistants, including a notable anti-Turkish Irishman, [[Andrew Ryan (Irish politician)|Andrew Ryan]], later Sir, who in 1951 published his memoirs. In his new role as the chief [[Dragoman]] of the [[British High Commission]] and Second Political Officer, he found himself in charge of the ''Armenian question''. He proved instrumental in the arrest of a large number of the (later to be) Malta deportees. These fell broadly into three categories: Those still breaching the terms of the armistice, those who had allegedly ill-treated Allied prisoners-of-war and those responsible for excesses against Armenians, in Turkey itself and the Caucasus. Calthorpe asked for a personal interview with [[Mustafa Reşit Pasha (1858-1924)|Reshid Pasha]], Ottoman Minister of Foreign Affairs, to impress on him how Britain viewed the Armenian affair and the ill-treatment of POWs as "most important" deserving "the utmost attention". Two days later Calthorpe formally requested the arrest of seven leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). While between 160 and 200 people were arrested, another 60 suspected of participating in the massacre of Armenians remained at large.&lt;ref name=malta&gt;[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-04-19/news/turkeys-eu-minister-judge-giovanni-bonello-and-the-armenian-genocide-claim-about-malta-trials-is-nonsense-308828/ Turkey’s EU Minister, Judge Giovanni Bonello And the Armenian Genocide - ‘Claim about Malta Trials is nonsense’].

[[File:Turkish courts-martial Courtroom.jpg|thumb|A session of the Turkish courts-martial on 3 April 1919.]]
The courts-martial were established on April 28, 1919 while the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] was ongoing. An inquiry commission was established, called the "Mazhar Inquiry Commission", which was invested with extraordinary powers of subpoena, arrest, et cetera, through which the war criminals were summoned to trial. This organization secured Ottoman documents from many provinces of the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Sultan [[Mehmet VI]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], as representatives of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Second Constitutional Era]] were summoned to the Paris Peace Conference. On 11 July 1919, [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] officially confessed to massacres against the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] and was a key figure and initiator of the war crime trials held directly after World War I to condemn to death the chief perpetrators of the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn: Lexikon der Völkermorde.

The [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Government]] in Constantinople (represented by [[Damat Ferid Pasha]]), foisted the blame on a few members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and long-time rivals of his own [[Freedom and Accord Party]], which would ensure that the Ottoman Empire received a more lenient treatment during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vahakn N | last = Dadrian | contribution = The Documentation of the World War I Armenian Massacres in the Proceedings of the Turkish Military Tribunal | title = International Journal of Middle East Studies | number = 23 | year = 1991 | page = 554}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vahakn N | last = Dadrian | contribution-url = http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/28 | contribution = The Turkish Military Tribunal's Prosecution of the Authors of the Armenian Genocide: Four Major Court-Martial Series | publisher = Oxford Journals | title = [[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]] | number = 11 | year = 1997 | page = 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trials helped the party (also called the ''Liberal Union party'') root out the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] from the political arena.&lt;ref name="Grothusen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Detlev Grothusen | first = Klaus | authorlink = Klaus Detlev Grothusen | title = Die Türkei in Europa: Beiträge des Südosteuropa-arbeitskreises der… | publisher = Berghahn Books | language = German | year = 197 | page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 1919, during the [[Erzurum Congress]], General [[Kâzım Karabekir]] was issued a direct order from the Sultanate to place [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]] and [[Rauf Orbay]] under arrest and assume Kemal's position as Inspector-General of the [[Six vilayets|Eastern Provinces]]. He defied the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|government in Constantinople]] and refused to carry out the arrest.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;{{rp|248}}

At that time Turkey had two competing governments in [[Constantinople]] and [[Ankara]]. The [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|government]] in Constantinople supported the Turkish trials with more or less seriousness depending on the current government. While Grand Vizier [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] (4 March - 2 October 1919 and again 5 April - 21 October 1920) stood behind the prosecuting body, the government of Grand Vizier [[Ali Riza Pasha]] (2 October 1919 – 2 March 1920) barely made a mention of the legal proceedings against the war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Taner Akçam: ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility'', Metropolitan Books, New York 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7932-6}}, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; The trials had also blurred the crime of participation in the [[Turkish National Movement]] with the crime of the [[Armenian Genocide]], and ultimately resulted in increasing support for the government in Ankara that would be led later on by Atatürk.&lt;ref&gt;Taner Akçam: ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility'', Metropolitan Books, New York 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7932-6}}, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
The court sat for nearly a year, from April 1919 through March 1920, although it became clear after just a few months that the tribunal was simply going through the motions. The judges had condemned the first set of defendants (Enver, et al.) when they were safely out of the country, but the Tribunal, despite making a great show of its efforts, had no intention of returning convictions. Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe protested to the [[Sublime Porte]], took the trials out of Turkish hands, and removed the proceedings to Malta. There an attempt was made to seat an international tribunal, but the Turks bungled the investigations and mishandled the documentary evidence so that nothing of their work could be used by the international court.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;Shadow of the Sultan's Realm: The Destruction of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East, Daniel Allen Butler, Potomac Books Inc, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1597974967}}, p.211-212&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[European Court of Human Rights]] judge [[Giovanni Bonello]], 'quite likely the British found the continental [[inquisitorial system]] of penal procedure used in Turkey ''repugnant'' to its own paths to criminal justice and doubted the propriety of relying on it'. Or, possibly, the Turkish government never came round to hand over the incriminating documents used by the military courts. Whatever the reason, with the advent of power of Ataturk, all the documents on which the Turkish military courts had based their trials and convictions, were ‘lost’.&lt;ref name=malta/&gt; Admiral [[John de Robeck]] replaced Admiral Gough-Calthorpe on August 5, 1919 as "Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, and High Commissioner, at Constantinople".&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; In August 1920, the proceedings were halted, and Admiral [[John de Robeck]] informed London of the futility of continuing the tribunal with the remark: "Its findings cannot be held of any account at all." &lt;ref name="doc136069"&gt;Public Record Office, Foreign Office, 371/4174/136069 in {{cite book | last = Dadrian | first = Vahakn | authorlink = Vahakn N.

An investigative committee started by Hasan Mazhar was immediately tasked to gather evidence and testimonies, with a special effort to obtain inquiries on civil servants implicated in massacres committed against Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kieser|first=Hans-Lukas|title=Turkey Beyond Nationalism Towards Post-Nationalist Identities.|year=2006|publisher=I.B.

===Verdict===
On July 5, 1919, the court reached a verdict which sentenced the organizers of the massacres, Talat, Enver, Cemal and others to death.&lt;ref name="Herzig 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreopoulos 1997" /&gt; The military court found that it was the intent of the CUP to eliminate the Armenians physically, via its [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Special Organization]]. The pronouncement reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Libaridian|first1=Gerald J.|title=Modern Armenia people, nation, state|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=1412813514|pages=134–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNyKALLaiJoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20|The Court Martial]] taking into consideration the above-named crimes declares, unanimously, the culpability as principal factors of these crimes the fugitives Talaat Pasha, former Grand Vizir, Enver Efendi, former War Minister, struck off the register of the Imperial Army, Cemal Efendi, former Navy Minister, struck off too from the Imperial Army, and Dr. Nazim Efendi, former Minister of Education, members of the General Council of the Union &amp; Progress, representing the moral person of that party;&amp;nbsp;... the Court Martial pronounces, in accordance with said stipulations of the Law the death penalty against Talaat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The courts-martial officially disbanded the CUP and confiscated its assets and the assets of those found guilty. Two of the three Pashas who fled were later assassinated by Armenian vigilantes during [[Operation Nemesis]].

==Detention in Malta and aftermath==
{{further|Malta exiles|Effort to prosecute Ottoman war criminals}}

Ottoman military members and high-ranking politicians convicted by the Turkish courts-martial were transferred from Constantinople prisons to the [[Crown Colony of Malta]] on board of the SS ''Princess Ena'' and the SS HMS ''Benbow'' by the British forces, starting in 1919. Admiral Sir [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe]] was in charge of the operation, together with Lord Curzon; they did so owing to the lack of transparency of the Turkish courts-martial. They were held there for three years, while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to find a way to put them in trial.&lt;ref&gt;Türkei By Klaus-Detlev. Grothusen.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the war criminals were eventually released without trial and returned to Constantinople in 1921, in exchange for 22 British [[POW|prisoners of war]] held by the government in Ankara, including a relative of Lord Curzon. The government in Ankara was opposed to political power of the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|government in Constantinople]]. They are often mentioned as the ''Malta exiles'' in some sources.{{sfn|Bonello|2008}}

According to [[European Court of Human Rights]] judge [[Giovanni Bonello]] the suspension of prosecutions, the repatriation and release of Turkish detainees was amongst others a result of the lack of an appropriate legal framework with [[Jurisdiction|supranational jurisdiction]], because following World War I no international norms for regulating war crimes existed, due to a legal vacuum in international law; therefore contrary to Turkish sources, no trials were ever held in Malta. He mentions that the release of the Turkish detainees was accomplished in exchange for 22 British prisoners held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.{{sfn|Bonello|2008}}&lt;ref name=malta/&gt;

=== Punishment ===
[[File:Operation Nemesis exhibition Tsitsernakaberd.jpg|thumbnail|An exhibition dedicated to Operation Nemesis at the [[Tsitsernakaberd|genocide museum]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]]]
At the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]'s 9th General Congress, which convened in [[Yerevan]] from September 27, to the end of October 1919, the issue of retribution against those personally responsible for organizing the [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide]] was on the agenda. A task force, led by [[Shahan Natalie]], working with Grigor Merjanov, was established to assassinate [[Talaat Pasha]], [[Behbud Khan Javanshir|Javanshir Khan]], [[Said Halim Pasha]], [[Behaeddin Shakir|Behaeddin Shakir Bey]], [[Cemal Azmi|Jemal Azmi]], [[Djemal Pasha|Cemal Pasha]], [[Enver Pasha]], as well as several Armenian collaborationists, in an secret operation codenamed [[Operation Nemesis]].

==Purging of evidence==
A [[WikiLeaks]] [[Diplomatic cable|cable]] [[classified information|classified]] and signed by David Arnett on July 4, 2004&lt;ref name=wikileaks&gt;https://wikileaks.org/cable/2004/07/04ISTANBUL1074.html WIKILEAKS. 04ISTANBUL1074, ARMENIAN "GENOCIDE" AND THE OTTOMAN ARCHIVES&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Consulate]] General of the [[United States of America|US]] in Istanbul states the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''According to [[Sabanci University]] Professor [[Halil Berktay]], there were two serious efforts to purge the archives of any incriminating documents on the Armenian question.  The first took place in 1918, presumably before the Allied forces occupied [[Constantinople|Istanbul]].  Berktay and others point to testimony in the 1919 Turkish Military Tribunals indicating that important documents had been "stolen" from the archives. Berktay believes a second purge was executed in conjunction with Ozal's efforts to open the archives by a group of retired diplomats and generals led by former Ambassador Muharrem Nuri Birgi.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the cable, ambassador Muharrem Nuri Birgi was effectively in charge of destroying evidence during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="barsoumian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barsoumian|first1=Nanore|title=WikiLeaks: Stepping Out of Ottoman Archives, Diplomat Says ‘We Really Slaughtered Them!’|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2011/09/10/wikileaks-stepping-out/|agency=The Armenian Weekly|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the process of eliminating the evidence, ambassador Birgi stated in reference to the Armenians: "We really slaughtered them."&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;&lt;ref name="barsoumian" /&gt; Others, such as Tony Greenwood, the Director of the American Research Institute in Turkey, confirmed that a select group of retired military personnel were "going through" the archives. However, it was noted by a certain Turkish scholar that the examination was merely an effort to purge documents found in the archives.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

== Controversy ==
{{See also|Denial of the Armenian Genocide}}
There is a controversy by revisionist sources about the translations into Western language (mostly English and German) of the verdicts and accounts published in newspapers. Gilles Veinstein, a professor of Ottoman and Turkish history at [[Collège de France]] estimates that the translation made by former Armenian historian Haigazn Kazarian is "highly tendentious, in several locations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Trois questions sur un massacre | title = L’Histoire | language = French | date = April 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish historians Erman Şahin and Ferudun Ata accuse Taner Akçam of mistranslations and inaccurate summaries, including the rewriting of important sentences and the addition of things not included in the original version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Erman | last = Şahin | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.tc-america.org/Erman%20Sahin-Review%20Article.pdf | contribution = A Scrutiny of Akçam's Version of History and the Armenian Genocide | title = Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs | number = 28:2 | page = 308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mepc.org/create-content/book-review | format = Review Essay | contribution = The Armenian Question | title = Middle East Policy | volume = XVII | number = 1 | date = Spring 2010 | pages = 149–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferudun Ata, "An Evaluation of the Approach of the Researchers Who Advocate Armenian Genocide to the Trials Relocation," in ''The New Approaches to Turkish-Armenian Relations'', Istanbul, Istanbul University Publications, 2008, pp. 560-561.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is (as yet) no record of the roles of the African soldiers posted to the Department. However, the presence of a tribal chief indicates they were political influencers and collectors of intelligence.

The '''All-Russian Social-Christian Union for the Liberation of the People''' ({{lang-ru|Всероссийский социал-христианский союз освобождения народа|translit=Vserossiyskiy sotsial-khristianskiy soyuz osvobozhdeniya naroda}}), commonly known by the acronym '''VSKhSON''' (ВСХСОН), was an underground [[anti-Soviet]] organization operated in the [[Soviet Union]] between 1964 and 1967. The Union was founded by [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]] alumni in February 1964, and counted 28 members and 30 candidates.&lt;ref name=sakharov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/museum/expositions/resistance-unfreedom-ussr/|title=Сопротивление несвободе в СССР|publisher=[[Sakharov Center]]|language=ru|accessdate=30 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107133138/http://www.sakharov-center.ru/museum/expositions/resistance-unfreedom-ussr/|archive-date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VSKhSON ideology was named "Social Christianity" and has its roots in the [[Third Position]], that neither communism nor capitalism. It was aimed to project of [[Christian ethics]] on a reformed social and economical structure of Soviet society. In order to achieve that goal, it was supposed to create the Supreme Council with the right to veto any government initiative, which should consist of one-third of members of the highest [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] hierarchy, and two-third of life "outstanding representatives of the nation", while the head of the proposed "Christian state" should be elected by the Supreme Council, then approved by the public vote.&lt;ref name=alexeyeva&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexeyeva|first=Lyudmila|authorlink=Lyudmila Alexeyeva|title=История инакомыслия в СССР: Новейший период|trans-title=The History of Dissident Thought in the USSR: The Latest Period|chapter=Русское национальное движение|trans-chapter=Russian National Movement|chapter-url=http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter19.htm#_VPID_58|location=Vilnius; Moscow|publisher=Vest|date=1992|language=ru}} {{ISBN|9785984400268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VSKhSON members stood for "the abolition of Soviet totalitarianism" and the resurrection of a "healthy balance between the individual, society, and government", and the resurrection of the individual (versus Soviet collectivism). As compared to other secret youth organizations of the 1960s–early 1970s, the bylaws of VSKhSON had stated that every member of the organization "is not only a propagandist and organizer, but a soldier". In many ways the organization can be compared to the white émigré [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]].

In February 1967, after being denounced by an informant, the organization was designated as terrorist by the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name=sakharov/&gt; Twenty one of the organization's members were put on trial and received long terms of internment. Co-founder Igor Ogurtsov was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, eight years of [[labor camp]]s and five years of exile.&lt;ref name=sakharov/&gt; After returning to Russia in 1992 from exile in Germany, Ogurtsov continued a life of political activism.

The organization's founders, Igor Ogurtsov, Yevgeny Vagin, Mikhail Sado and Boris Averichkin, have not been rehabilitated. The Presidium of the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] affirmed the validity of the guilty verdict and sentence of VSKhSON members on 20 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vshson.narod.ru/ippvs.html|title=Из Постановления Верховного Суда РФ по делу ВСХСОН, 1996 г.|language=ru|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vasile Lupu High School Group''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]:''Grupul Liceul "Vasile Lupu"'') was one of the first organized anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] groups in [[Bessarabia]] in the wake of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|its occupation by the Soviet Union]] on June 28, 1940.

==Activity==

It was formed by the students and some teachers of the Vasile Lupu high school in [[Orhei]], which was renamed by the Soviets a ''Pedagogical School''.

After a series of small actions, such as writing anti-Soviets slogans on public walls ("Death to the Stalinist occupiers!", "Go home, barbarians!", "Down with the executioner [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]! Bessarabia to Bessarabians!", "Long live [[Romania]]n nation!"), and spread of anti-Soviet manifestos, they did an extrodinary achievement: during the [[Christmas|Christmas night]] 1940, they took down the Soviet red flags, and put up [[Romanian flag]]s on top of several buildings in [[Orhei]], including the city hall, the [[Communist Party of Romania]] building, the [[NKVD]] headquarters. In January 1941, NKVD managed to crack into the organization and arrest most of its members. The sentence was pronounced on June 24, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istoria.md/articol/818/Grupul_de_rezisten%C5%A3%C4%83_antisovietic%C4%83_din_Orhei___Majadahonda Grupul de rezistenţă antisovietică din Orhei - Majadahonda (1940 - 1941)] istoria.md.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wog''''' is a [[slang]] word in the idiom of [[Australian English]] and [[British English]]. In the UK, it is usually employed as an [[Ethnic slur|ethnic]] or [[racial slur]], and considered [[derogatory]] and offensive. In Australia, it may be used as a slur, but to some extent has been reclaimed and is used as a self-descriptor.

In British English, "wog" is an offensive racial slur usually applied to [[Afro-Caribbean]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Middle East]]ern, [[South Asia]]n or [[Southeast Asia]]n peoples. In Australian English, "wog" is a term used as a racial slur mostly for people from [[Southern Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean region]] in general (Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Greek), including the Mediterranean region of the [[Middle East]] (i.e., the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] or the [[Levant]] and [[North Africa]]: Jews and Arabs) as well as [[Eastern Europe]].

==Origin==
The origin of the term is unclear. It was first noted by lexicographer F.C. Bowen in 1929, in his ''Sea Slang: a dictionary of the old-timers’ expressions and epithets'', where he defines wogs as "lower class [[Babu (title)|Babu]] shipping clerks on the Indian coast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/christopherhowse/8288667/golliwog_is_not_connected_with_wog/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title='Golliwog' is not connected with 'wog' | date=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dictionaries{{which|date=November 2016}} say "wog" derives from the [[golliwogg]], a [[blackface]] [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] doll character from a children's book, ''The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg'' by [[Florence Kate Upton]], published in 1895; or from ''[[pollywog]]'', a dialect term for [[tadpole]] that is used in maritime circles to indicate someone who has not [[Line-crossing ceremony|crossed the equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wog|title=Wog|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2017|website=Your Dictionary|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions that the word is an [[acronym]] for "wily Oriental gentleman", "working on government service", or similar, are examples of [[false etymology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X5LEWiomDiEC&amp;pg=PT87&amp;lpg=PT87&amp;dq=%22wily+oriental+gentleman%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JKnek4nDP3&amp;sig=q7GPDK0Lotg0XRYLn-yAet0okw4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WAxCVMGhFvHW7QbbyYGYCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wily%20oriental%20gentleman%22&amp;f=false |author=Wilton, David |title=Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/wog/ |title=Wog" |website=WordOrigins.org|accessdate= 18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in British English==
"Wog", in the UK, is a derogatory and racially offensive slang word referring to a non-white, Jewish, or [[olive skin|darker-skinned]] white person, including people from the [[Middle East]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], other parts of [[Asia]] such as the [[East Indies]], or the [[Mediterranean]] area, including Southern Europeans.

The saying, "The wogs begin at [[Calais]]" (implying that everyone who is not British is a wog), appears to date from the [[First World War]] but was popularised by [[George Wigg, Baron Wigg|George Wigg]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Dudley]], in 1949 when in a parliamentary debate concerning the [[Bamar|Burmese]], Wigg shouted at the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] benches, "The Honourable Gentleman and his friends think they are all 'wogs'. Indeed, the Right Honourable Member for [[Woodford (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodford]] [i.e., [[Winston Churchill]]] thinks that the 'wogs' begin at Calais."&lt;ref name="George Wigg"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1949/jul/29/africa#S5CV0467P0-09214|title= Hansard|journal= House of Commons 5th series|volume=467 }} col 2845.&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by [[British Jews|English-Jewish]] journalist [[Linda Grant]], people in England have referred to [[Jews]] and [[Israelis]] as "wogs", as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant, Linda|title=The People on the Street: A Writer's View of Israel|publisher=Hatchette Digital|location= London, England |date=2009|accessdate= August 4, 2016}} "It started at once, [Ophir] said, with the geography teacher, 'who we used to call Bullet, who had a map on the wall where Israel appeared as Palestine and to my face he called Jews and Israelis 'terrorist wogs'... As for calling Jews 'wogs,' Ophir was to understand that there was nothing derogatory in the term, it simply meant Western Oriental Gentleman."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 1 Episode 6 - 'The Germans' episode of [[Fawlty Towers]] (a 1975 British TV show), Major Gowen specifically refers to "wog" as meaning any person from India (when speaking about the India vs England cricket game at the Oval to Basil Fawlty).

==Use in Australian English==
In Australia, the term "wog" refers to residents of [[Southern Europe]]an, [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[Middle East]]ern, and [[Eastern Europe]]an ethnicity or appearance. The slur became widely diffused with an increase in immigration from [[Europe]] and the [[Levant]], mainly [[Albania]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Lebanon]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]]  after the [[Second World War]]. These new arrivals were perceived by the majority population as contrasting with the larger predominant [[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|Anglo Protestant]]/[[Anglo-Australian]]/[[Anglo-Celtic Australian]] culture. The term expanded to include not just Southern European peoples, but immigrants from the [[Mediterranean region]] of the [[Middle East]] as well.

Today, "wog" is used particularly in places in Australia with substantial [[Southern Europe]]an, [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], and [[Middle East]]ern populations, mainly Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. As with other slang and'' [[prima facie]]'' profanity used in contemporary [[Australian English]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g., "bastard" and "cunt"&lt;/ref&gt; the term "wog" may be employed either aggressively or affectionately within differing contexts.

In Australian English, "wog" can also be used as a slang word for an illness such as a [[common cold]] or [[influenza]], as in: "I'm coming down with a wog". Such usage is not perceived as derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andc.anu.edu.au/australian-words/meanings-origins?field_alphabet_value=281 |website=Australian National University|title=Meanings and origins of Australian words and idioms|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
More recently, Southern European-Australian performing artists have taken ownership of the term "wog", defusing its original pejorative nature. The popular 1980s stage show ''[[Wogs Out of Work]]'', created by [[Nick Giannopoulos]] and [[Simon Palomares]], is an early example. The production was followed on television with ''[[Acropolis Now]]'', starring Giannopoulos, Palomares, George Kapiniaris, and Mary Coustas, and films such as ''[[The Wog Boy]]'' and ''[[Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos]]'', and parodies such as those of [[Santo Cilauro]] (Italian), [[Eric Bana]] (Croatian-German), [[Vince Colosimo]] (Italian), Nick Giannopoulos (Greek), Frank Lotito (Italian), [[Mary Coustas]] (Greek), and [[SBS Television]]'s offbeat ''[[Pizza (TV series)|Pizza]]'' and later [[Here Come the Habibs]]. TV series have continued this change in [[Australian culture|Australian cultural history]]—with some even classifying a genre of "wogsploitation" of pop culture products being created by and for a proudly "wog" market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dale |first=David |date=17 May 2003 |title=Wogsploitation makes its mark in mainstream |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/16/1052885398860.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent works of the genre have been used by Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds to assert ethnic identity rather than succumb to ethnic stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/vital:828;jsessionid=1F4182ECBFF260960D2D5796D1E1BE08 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811165650/http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/vital:828;jsessionid=1F4182ECBFF260960D2D5796D1E1BE08 |archive-date=2011-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the release of ''Wog Boy 2'', Giannopoulos discussed the contemporary use of the term "wog" in the Australian context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think by defusing the word 'wog' we've shown our maturity and our great ability to adapt and just laugh things off, you know... When I first came [to Greece] and I started trying to explain to them why we got called 'wog' they'd get really angry about it, you know. They were, "Why? Why they say this about the [[Greeks|Greek]] people?" You know? But then when they see what we've done with it—and this is the twist—that we've turned it into a term of endearment, they actually really get into that...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, in contemporary Australia, the term "wog" may, in certain contexts, be viewed as a "[[nickname]]" rather than a pejorative term&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Andrew |date=12 October 2005 |title=A bad word made good |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/13/australia.andrewclark |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—akin to the nicknames ascribed within Australian English to other historically significant cultural groupings such as the English ("[[Alternative names for the British|Poms]]"), the Americans ("[[Yankee|Yanks]]") and New Zealanders ("[[Kiwi (people)|Kiwis]]").

==Use in Canada==
In Canadian [[:wikt:Appendix:Canadian English military slang|military slang]] used by combat arms units (that is, front line fighting forces), "wog" is a derogatory term for any rear echelon personnel and those who are not members of the combat arms. {{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Use in the United States==
[[Duane Clarridge]], a former [[CIA]] officer, explained that the term "wog factor" was used by the CIA "to acknowledge that the motivations that shape decision-making in [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]] are very different from our own."&lt;ref name="Scibner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarridge|first1=Duane|title=A Spy For All Seasons: My Life in the CIA|date=August 13, 2002|publisher=Scibner|isbn=978-0743245364|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientology ==
The word "wog" is used by [[Scientology|Scientologists]] to refer to non-Scientologists. Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] defined wog as a "common, everyday garden-variety humanoid&amp;nbsp;...  He 'is' a body. [He] doesn't know he's there, etc. He isn't there as a spirit at all. He is not operating as a [[thetan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Saint Hill Briefing Course-82 6611C29&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Fishmongers''' (or '''Fishmongers' Company''') is one of the 110 [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]], being an incorporated [[guild]] of [[fishmonger|sellers of fish and seafood]] in the City. The Company ranks fourth in the [[order of precedence]] of City Livery Companies, thereby making it one of the [[Great Twelve City Livery Companies]].&lt;ref name=CFH&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wbguAAAAMAAJ|title=Walks and talks about London|author=John Timbs|chapter=Curiosities of the Fishmongers' Hall|publisher=Lockwood|year=1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Company records an unbroken existence for over 700 years – although undoubtedly it existed earlier – having received its first [[Royal Charter]] in 1272. A predecessor guild was fined as ''[[wikt:adulterine|adulterine]]'' in 1154. It took the name Stock Fishmongers' Company under another Royal Charter granted in 1508. Then, in 1537, it merged with the Salt Fishmongers' Company to form the Company with its present name.&lt;ref name=CFH/&gt;

The most famous City fishmonger is [[William Walworth|Sir William Walworth]], who, as [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]] in 1381, helped bring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] to an end by stabbing the rebel [[Wat Tyler]] to death at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] in the presence of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]].&lt;ref name=CFH/&gt;

In 1383, [[Lord Mayor]] John Comberton de Northampton (a Draper) persuaded the [[City of London Corporation|City Common Council]] to declare that the Fishmongers should no longer have the power to monopolise trade in fish, and this was reaffirmed by Parliament. However, in a Royal Charter granted to the Fishmongers by Richard II in 1399, all their privileges were restored. The same Charter states they should elect six Wardens annually, the number which continues to the present day.

Until the end of the 14th century the Fishmongers convened their own [[court of law]], called ''Leyhalmode'', at which disputes over fish and seafood trade were tried by the Wardens of the Company.

From 1555 to the present day, the Company has acted as Trustee of [[Gresham's School]] at [[Holt, Norfolk]].

In the early 17th century, the Company was granted lands at [[Ballykelly, County Londonderry|Ballykelly]] and [[Banagher, County Londonderry|Banagher]] in modern-day [[Northern Ireland]], by the Crown. It remained a major landowner there until the 20th century, and the villages contain some of the most interesting buildings erected in [[Ulster]] by the [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation companies]].

In 1714, the Irish actor [[Thomas Doggett]] provided money to endow a boat race called [[Doggett's Coat and Badge|Doggett's Coat and Badge Race]] in honour of the new king, [[George I of Great Britain|George I of Hanover]]. The race was originally to be rowed annually on 1 August on the [[River Thames]], by up to six young watermen per boat who were not to be out of their apprenticeship by more than twelve months. The prize for the champion oarsman is a fine red coat embellished with a large silver badge on one arm, depicting the white horse of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] with the word 'liberty' underneath. Since Doggett's death, the Fishmongers' Company continues to organise this event each year, and it is now believed to be the world's longest continuously-running sporting event as well as being the longest boat race in the world – 4&amp;nbsp;miles, 5&amp;nbsp;furlongs (7,400&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name=CFH/&gt;

By the 18th century, references to fish were hard to find in the Fishmongers' Company Court minutes, since the Company's main business had evolved into managing its extensive properties and administering its charities and trusts, such as [[Gresham's School]] as well as [[St. Peter's Hospital (Newington)|St. Peter's Hospital]] and [[almshouse]]s at [[Newington, London|Newington]] in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, Peter, ''[http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft8489p27k&amp;chunk.id=d0e8490&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e8490&amp;brand=eschol;query=Holt#1 The Making of the English Middle Class'', p. 258] (University of California Press, 1989) at escholarship.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Company is governed by its Prime Warden, five other Wardens and its Court of Assistants, comprising 28 appointed Livery members.

In its early history, the Company established a monopoly over the sale of fish in the City of London and its environs.&lt;ref name=CFH/&gt; Although government legislation over the years has reduced such trade restrictions, the Company is still tasked with the important role overseeing the quality of fish imported into the City mostly via [[Billingsgate Market]], the UK's largest [[fish market]]. This responsibility is undertaken by the Company's [[Quality control|fishmeter]]s (inspectors) under powers established by a Royal Charter of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1604.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9288325/The-Fish-Market-Inside-Billingsgate-BBC-Two-review.html BBC: ''Inside Billingsgate'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company is closely involved with monitoring [[salmon]] and [[fresh water]] fishing as well as the catching of shellfish throughout UK waters. It encourages research through grants and sponsorship and also publishes books on fish, such as ''Fish and Shellfish'' and ''The Fishmongers' Company Cook Book''. Thus, the Company retains many of its ancient trade duties, unlike some other Livery Companies, whose trades having become defunct through technological advances, act for the most part as charitable benefactors or ceremonial institutions.

The Fishmongers' Company is also a significant educational charity. As well as Gresham's School, it has also long supported the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] and the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].

The Company comprises about 300 members, including a good representation of working [[fishmonger]]s. Liverymen of all City companies are members of [[Guildhall, London|Common Hall]] which entitles them to vote each year in the election of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], held on [[Michaelmas Day]] (29 September) or the closest weekday, and also in the election of the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Sheriffs of London]] on Midsummer's Day. Voting is by show of hands, but should one [[liveryman]] call for a recount, a ballot is held two weeks later.

The Company's [[livery hall]] in the City of London is known as [[Fishmongers' Hall]] (sometimes shortened in common parlance to Fish Hall); its earliest recorded hall was built in 1310. A new hall, on the present site, was bequeathed to the Company in 1434. Together with 43 other Livery halls, this one was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666 and a replacement hall designed by the architect Edward Jerman opened in 1671. This hall by Jerman was demolished to facilitate the construction of the new [[London Bridge]] in 1827. The Fishmongers' next hall was designed by [[Henry Roberts (architect)|Henry Roberts]] (although his assistant, later the celebrated [[Gilbert Scott|Sir Gilbert Scott]], made the drawings) and built by [[William Cubitt (politician)|William Cubitt &amp; Company]], opening in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202779|title=William Cubitt &amp; Co|publisher=Scottish Architects|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After severe bomb damage during [[the Blitz]], Fishmongers' Hall was restored by Austen Hall (of Whinney, Son &amp; Austen Hall) and reopened in 1951.

==Gresham's School==
Since 1555, the Company has acted as the [[Trustee]] of [[Gresham's School]] in [[Holt, Norfolk]], in accordance with the wishes of Lord Mayor [[John Gresham|Sir John Gresham]] (1492–1556). Among other responsibilities, the Company provides more than half of the school's governors, including the chairman of the governing body, which meets at Fishmongers' Hall.

In 1729, the Fishmongers' Company presented the school with "...a valuable and useful library, not only of the best editions of the Classics and Lexicographers, but also with some books of Antiquities, Chronology, and Geography, together with a suitable pair of globes".&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Paul, ed. ''A Cyclopedia of Education'' (London, Macmillan, 1926), [https://archive.org/stream/cyclopediaofeduc008784mbp/cyclopediaofeduc008784mbp_djvu.txt online edition] of archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1926, in accepting membership of the Company by right of patrimony, the future [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] said: "I hope that it may be possible for me, at some future date, to prove my interest by personally visiting Gresham's School, of which I have frequently heard such excellent accounts".&lt;ref&gt;''Duke of York and Fishmongers: Admitted To Freedom Of The Company'' in ''The Times'', Friday, 21 May 1926; p. 13; Issue 44277; col D&lt;/ref&gt;
