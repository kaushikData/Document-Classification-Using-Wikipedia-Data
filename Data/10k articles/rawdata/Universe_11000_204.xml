      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The '''Advanced Plant Management System (APMS)''' is a [[SCADA]] solution developed in partnership by RWE [[npower (UK)|npower]] and [[Thales Group|Thales UK]].

Based on a real-time application platform, APMS is a monitoring and [[control system]] for any large industrial process. APMS is implemented at more than thirty [[Electricity generation|electric power generation]] units in the UK, including [[Tilbury Power Station|Tilbury]], [[Didcot Power Station|Didcot A]], [[Aberthaw Power Station|Aberthaw]], [[Drax power station|Drax]] and [[Rugeley]] [[power station]]s.

The APMS system replaced the [http://esolangs.org/wiki/CUTLASS Cutlass programming language and application system] - a real-time control system widely implemented during the 1970s in British power plants by the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]] (CEGB) research &amp; development team - in National Power power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.draxgroup.plc.uk/media/features/?id=47763 |title=Farewell to CUTLASS |access-date=2012-07-10 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505161946/http://www.draxgroup.plc.uk/media/features/?id=47763 |archive-date=2013-05-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[PowerGen]] in contrast retained and modernised its Cutlass systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esolangs.org/wiki/CUTLASS CUTLASS - Esolang]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The '''Alabama Army Ammunition Plant''' (ALAAP), was a [[United States]] [[munition]]s plant built and operated during [[World War II]].  The [[military base|facility]] is located four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Childersburg, Alabama]] in [[Talladega County, Alabama]].

==History==
The ALAAP was built in 1941 as a production facility for [[nitrocellulose]] (NC), [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT), [[dinitrotoluene]] (DNT), [[tetryl]], and single-base [[smokeless powder]].&lt;ref name=ArmyPlan5/&gt;  The facility, operated by [[DuPont]], had a peak production rate of nearly 40 million pounds (18 million kg) of munitions per month.  It also produced [[heavy water]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Army Environmental Center Base Closure Division, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA467425 Site Management Plan; Alabama Army Ammunition Plant, Talladega County, Alabama], May 10, 1995.  Page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The facility ceased operation in August 1945 and was placed on standby status after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=ArmyPlan5&gt;United States Army Environmental Center Base Closure Division, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA467425 Site Management Plan; Alabama Army Ammunition Plant, Talladega County, Alabama], May 10, 1995.  Pages 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the war, the plant covered more than 13,000 acres (53&amp;nbsp;km²). 

After the end of the war, various portions of the plant were leased out for commercial operations.  Most of the original structures have been destroyed, although the government retains responsibility for more than 2,000 acres (8&amp;nbsp;km²) of the facility.

==Superfund site designation==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] designated the plant as a [[Superfund]] site in 1987. Chemicals from the manufacturing areas of the site had contaminated [[groundwater]] and soil on the property. The Army began cleanup activities on the site in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0400449 |title=Site Information for Alabama Army Ammunition Plant |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Superfund Site Profile |publisher=EPA |access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asiana Airlines Flight 733''' (OZ733, AAR733, registration HL7229) was a domestic Asiana Airlines passenger flight from [[Gimpo International Airport|Seoul-Gimpo International Airport]] (SEL at the time, now GMP) to [[Mokpo Airport]] (MPK), South Korea. The flight crashed on July 26, 1993 in the Hwawon area of [[Haenam County]], [[South Jeolla Province]], killing 68 of the 116 passengers and crew on board, including the captain and one other crew member.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19930726-1|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737-5L9 HL7229 Mokpo Airport (MPK)|last=Ranter|first=Harro|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft was a Boeing 737-500, which made its maiden flight June 14, 1990. The aircraft was delivered to [[Maersk Air]] on June 26 the same year (with registration OY-MAB).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airfleets.net/crash/crash_report_Asiana%20Airlines_HL7229.htm|title=Accident Asiana Airlines Flight 733 B737 HL7229  -  Airfleets  aviation|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was then leased to Asiana Airlines on November 26, 1992.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Passengers and crew ===
There were three Japanese nationals and two American nationals among the passengers, many of whom were vacationers heading for the popular summer resort there off the Yellow Sea, according to the airline.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/world/south-korean-plane-crashes-in-a-storm-66-reported-killed.html|title=South Korean Plane Crashes in a Storm; 66 Reported Killed|author=|date=27 July 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain was Hwang In-ki, but the first officers name was unknown. There were four flight attendants onboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/62-feared-dead-in-korean-air-crash-1487429.html|title=62 feared dead in Korean air crash|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accident ==
On July 26, 1993, flight 733 departed [[Gimpo International Airport]] in Seoul, bound for Mokpo Airport, which a scheduled arrival by 15:15. At that time, the weather conditions in [[Mokpo]] and [[Yeongam County]] area consisted of heavy rain and wind. However, the weather conditions were not enough to delay the arrival time. The aircraft made its first landing attempt at 15:24, which failed, followed by a second landing attempt at 15:28, which also failed. At 15:38, after two failed landing attempts, the aircraft made a third attempt. At 15:41 the aircraft disappeared from the radar screens and communication was lost. At 15:48 the aircraft crashed into Mt. Ungeo.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; At 15:50, the wreckage was found in the near Masanri, [[Hwasun County]], [[Haenam County]], [[South Jeolla Province]], about 10 kilometers southwest of [[Mokpo Airport]]. The news was reported by two surviving passengers who also survived the crash of [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]],{{Dubious|date=October 2018}} reported to the [[Hwawon]]-myeon branch of the village below the mountain, that the aircraft began to veer off course.&lt;ref name="Asiana had been trying to clean up a tarnished record"&gt;[http://airguideonline.com/2013/07/07/asiana-airlines-had-been-trying-to-clean-up-a-tarnished-safety-record/ Asiana had been trying to clean up a tarnished record], 7 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was also difficulty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Cause ==
Asiana Airlines announced that after the accident, the plane was slowed down by three landing attempts and that it appears to have crashed. Experts said the distance to the runway was 1500 meters shorter in one direction only. The runways did not have an ILS installed. Mokpo Airport was only equipped with [[VOR/DME]], resulting in pilots performing excessive landing attempts in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imnews.imbc.com/20dbnews/history/1993/1757985_3833.html 추락항공기는 조종사가 관제탑 지시 무시]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - MBC 뉴스데스크 1993.7.28&lt;/ref&gt; and was a conntributing cause of the accident. A prosecution in charge of investigating the accident, announced that the aircraft had disappeared from the normal flight route, and pilots were likely to make an unintentional landing with a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://imnews.imbc.com//20dbnews/history/1993/1757939_3833.html 사고 여객기 조종사, 허가 전 착륙 시도]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - MBC 뉴스데스크 1993.7.27&lt;/ref&gt; Chung Jong-hwan, the director general of the Ministry of Transportation said that the cause of the crash was [[pilot error]]; the actions of captain Hwang In-ki, who was killed in the crash, were the main cause of the accident. Hwang had started the aircraft's descent prematurely, while it was flying above a mountain peak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), Hwang flew the aircraft below the minimum safe altitude (1600 feet), as he said "OK, 800 feet" a few seconds before impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
This was Asiana Airlines' first fatal (and as of 2018, deadliest) aircraft crash since the airline was established. After the accident Asiana suspended the Gimpo - Mokpo route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imnews.imbc.com/20dbnews/history/1993/1758030_3833.html 박삼구 아시아나항공 사장, 서울-목포 운항 무기한 중단]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - MBC 뉴스데스크 1993.7.29&lt;/ref&gt; The airline paid compensation to anguished families of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=001&amp;oid=015&amp;aid=0000071736&amp; 한국의 기업변호사 - 해상/항공변호사 ..항공사고 빈발] - 한국경제 1997.11.20&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the time the transportation department was planning to build [[Muan International Airport]] in [[Muan County]], [[Jeolla Province]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://imnews.imbc.com/20dbnews/history/1993/1757978_3833.html 교통부, 전남 무안군에 새 공항 건설]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - MBC 뉴스데스크 1993.7.28&lt;/ref&gt; When Muan International Airport was opened in 2007, Mokpo Airport was closed and converted into a military base. The accident also caused Asiana to cancel their order of [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200's]] and instead ordered the [[Airbus A321]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the crash of flight 733, Asiana Airlines had two more crashes in July the same year, resulting in what the airline referred to as '''the curse of seven.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=112&amp;aid=0002446046|title=[아시아나 사고] 숫자 ‘7’의 저주? 괴담 확산|access-date=2018-10-01|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flight 733 was the deadliest aviation accident in South Korea at that time. It was surpassed by [[Air China Flight 129]], which crashed on April 15, 2002, with 129 fatalities. It was also the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737-500 at that time. It was surpassed by [[Aeroflot Flight 821]], which crashed on September 14, 2008, with 88 fatalities. As of 2018, flight 733 remains the second deadliest crash in both of these categories.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Flight number ===
Asiana Airlines still uses the flight number 733 on the late evening [[Incheon International Airport|Seoul-Incheon]] - [[Noi Bai International Airport|Hanoi]] route.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The '''biological hydrogen production''' with [[algae]] is a method of photobiological water splitting which is done in a [[Closed system|closed]] [[Bioreactor#Photobioreactor|photobioreactor]] based on the [[Hydrogen production|production of hydrogen]] as a [[solar fuel]] by [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/schroeder/bggn227/2014%20Lectures/Mayfield/Gimpel%20COCB%202013.pdf 2013 - Gimpel JA, et al Advances in microalgae engineering and synthetic biology applications for biofuel production]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HemschemeierMelis2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemschemeier|first1=Anja|last2=Melis|first2=Anastasios|last3=Happe|first3=Thomas|title=Analytical approaches to photobiological hydrogen production in unicellular green algae|journal=Photosynthesis Research|volume=102|issue=2–3|year=2009|pages=523–540|issn=0166-8595|doi=10.1007/s11120-009-9415-5|pmid=19291418|pmc=2777220}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algae]] produce hydrogen under certain conditions.

==Truncated antenna==

==History==
In 1939  [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the algae he was studying, ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54456,00.html Algae: Power Plant of the Future?]&lt;/ref&gt; He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlamydomonas moewusii]]'' is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="YangGuarnieri2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Shihui|last2=Guarnieri|first2=Michael T|last3=Smolinski|first3=Sharon|last4=Ghirardi|first4=Maria|last5=Pienkos|first5=Philip T|title=De novo transcriptomic analysis of hydrogen production in the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii through RNA-Seq|journal=Biotechnology for Biofuels|volume=6|issue=1|year=2013|pages=118|issn=1754-6834|doi=10.1186/1754-6834-6-118|pmid=23971877|pmc=3846465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone.  This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/energy-fuels/mg18925401.600-growing-hydrogen-for-the-cars-of-tomorrow.html Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreactor design issues==
* Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a [[proton gradient]].
* Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide.
* Requirement for bicarbonate binding at [[photosystem II]] (PSII) for [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficient photosynthetic activity]].
* Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production.
* Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters.
* A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen.

Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via [[bioengineering]].

[[File:Phospholipids aqueous solution structures.svg|thumb|200px|right|Cross-section view of the structures that can be formed by phospholipids in an aqueous solution]]
A '''biological membrane''' or '''biomembrane''' is an enclosing or separating [[membrane]] that acts as a [[Semipermeable membrane|selectively permeable]] barrier within [[organisms|living things]]. Biological membranes, in the form of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell membrane]]s, consist of a [[phospholipid bilayer]] with embedded, [[Integral membrane protein|integral]] and [[peripheral membrane protein|peripheral proteins]] used in communication and transportation of chemicals and [[ion]]s. The bulk of [[lipid]] in a cell membrane provides a fluid matrix for [[protein]]s to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high [[membrane fluidity]] environment of [[lipid bilayer]] with the presence of an [[annular lipid shell]], consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of [[integral membrane proteins]]. The cell membranes are different from the isolating tissues formed by layers of cells, such as [[mucous membrane]]s, [[basement membrane]]s, and [[serous membrane]]s.

=== Asymmetry ===
[[File:0303 Lipid Bilayer With Various Components.jpg|A fluid membrane model of the phospholipid bilayer.|right|438x438px]]The lipid bilayer consists of two layers- an outer leaflet and an inner leaflet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Revisiting transbilayer distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009308415300402|journal = Chemistry and Physics of Lipids|doi = 10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.08.009|first = Motohide|last = Murate|first2 = Toshihide|last2 = Kobayashi|volume=194|pages=58–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components of bilayers are distributed unequally between the two surfaces to create asymmetry between the outer and inner surfaces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lateral organization, bilayer asymmetry, and inter-leaflet coupling of biological membranes|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009308415300177|journal = Chemistry and Physics of Lipids|doi = 10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2015.07.012|first = Jonathan D.|last = Nickels|first2 = Jeremy C.|last2 = Smith|first3 = Xiaolin|last3 = Cheng|volume=192|pages=87–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This asymmetric organization is important for cell functions such as cell signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Osmoporin OmpC forms a complex with MlaA to maintain outer membrane lipid asymmetry in Escherichia coli|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mmi.13202/abstract|journal = Molecular Microbiology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1365-2958|pages = 1133–1146|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/mmi.13202|first = Zhi-Soon|last = Chong|first2 = Wei-Fen|last2 = Woo|first3 = Shu-Sin|last3 = Chng|pmid=26314242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asymmetry of the biological membrane reflects the different functions of the two leaflets of the membrane.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural Symmetry in Membrane Proteins|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-023008|journal = Annual Review of Biophysics|date = 2015-01-01|pmid = 26098517|pages = 311–337|volume = 44|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-023008|first = Lucy R.|last = Forrest|pmc = 5500171}}&lt;/ref&gt; As seen in the fluid [[membrane models|membrane model]] of the phospholipid bilayer, the outer leaflet and inner leaflet of the membrane are asymmetrical in their composition. Certain proteins and lipids rest only on one surface of the membrane and not the other.   

• Both the plasma membrane and internal membranes have cytosolic and exoplasmic faces
• This orientation is maintained during membrane trafficking – proteins, lipids, glycoconjugates facing the lumen of the ER and Golgi get expressed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. In eucaryotic cells, new phospholipids are manufactured by enzymes bound to the part of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that faces the cytosol.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These enzymes, which use free fatty acids as [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]], deposit all newly made phospholipids into the cytosolic half of the bilayer. To enable the membrane as a whole to grow evenly, half of the new phospholipid molecules then have to be transferred to the opposite monolayer. This transfer is catalyzed by enzymes called [[flippase]]s. In the plasma membrane, flippases transfer specific phospholipids selectively, so that different types become concentrated in each monolayer.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Using selective flippases is not the only way to produce asymmetry in lipid bilayers, however. In particular, a different mechanism operates for glycolipids—the lipids that show the most striking and consistent asymmetric distribution in [[animal cells]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Lipids ===
The biological membrane is made up of lipids with hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level (4 ed.)|last = Voet|first = Donald|publisher = Wiley|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1118129180|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrophobic tails are hydrocarbon tails whose length and saturation is important in characterizing the cell.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lipid and phospholipid fatty acid composition of plasma, red blood cells, and platelets and how they are affected by dietary lipids: a study of normal subjects from Italy, Finland, and the USA.|url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/45/2/443|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 3812343|pages = 443–455|volume = 45|issue = 2|first = R. M.|last = Dougherty|first2 = C.|last2 = Galli|first3 = A.|last3 = Ferro-Luzzi|first4 = J. M.|last4 = Iacono}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipid rafts occur when lipid species and proteins aggregate in domains in the membrane. These help organize membrane components into localized areas that are involved in specific processes, such as signal transduction.

Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, have a unique lipid composition. The bilayer of red blood cells is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Erythrocyte membrane plays a crucial role in blood clotting. In the bilayer of red blood cells is phosphatidylserine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exposure of platelet membrane phosphatidylserine regulates blood coagulation|journal = Progress in Lipid Research|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0163-7827|pmid = 12814644|pages = 423–438|volume = 42|issue = 5|first = Barry R.|last = Lentz|doi=10.1016/s0163-7827(03)00025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, it is flipped to the outer membrane to be used during blood clotting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Proteins ===
Phospholipid bilayers contain different proteins. These [[membrane protein]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have various functions and characteristics and catalyze different chemical reactions. Integral proteins span the membranes with different domains on either side.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Integral proteins hold strong association with the lipid bilayer and cannot easily become detached.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They will dissociate only with chemical treatment that breaks the membrane. Peripheral proteins are unlike integral proteins in that they hold weak interactions with the surface of the bilayer and can easily become dissociated from the membrane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peripheral proteins are located on only one face of a membrane and create membrane asymmetry.

=== Oligosaccharides ===
[[Oligosaccharide]]s are sugar containing polymers. In the membrane, they can be covalently bound to lipids to form [[glycolipid]]s or covalently bound to proteins to form [[glycoprotein]]s. Membranes contain sugar-containing lipid molecules known as glycolipids. In the bilayer, the sugar groups of glycolipids are exposed at the cell surface, where they can form hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Protein transport across membranes: Comparison between lysine and guanidinium-rich carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273615002886|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes|date = 2015-11-01|pages = 2980–2984|volume = 1848|issue = 11, Part A|doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2015.09.004|first = Max|last = Lein|first2 = Brittany M.|last2 = deRonde|first3 = Federica|last3 = Sgolastra|first4 = Gregory N.|last4 = Tew|first5 = Matthew A.|last5 = Holden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolipids provide the most extreme example of asymmetry in the lipid bilayer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Glycolipids perform a vast number of functions in the biological membrane that are mainly communicative, including cell recognition and cell-cell adhesion. Glycoproteins are integral proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They play an important role in the immune response and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = General N-and O-Linked Glycosylation of Lipoproteins in Mycoplasmas and Role of Exogenous Oligosaccharide|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143362|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2015-11-23|pmc = 4657876|pmid = 26599081|pages = e0143362|volume = 10|issue = 11|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0143362|first = James M.|last = Daubenspeck|first2 = David S.|last2 = Jordan|first3 = Warren|last3 = Simmons|first4 = Matthew B.|last4 = Renfrow|first5 = Kevin|last5 = Dybvig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The phospholipid bilayer is formed due to the aggregation of [[membrane lipid]]s in aqueous solutions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aggregation is caused by the [[hydrophobic effect]], where hydrophobic ends come into contact with each other and are sequestered away from water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This arrangement maximises hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic heads and water while minimising unfavorable contact between hydrophobic tails and water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The increase in available hydrogen bonding increases the entropy of the system, creating a spontaneous process.

==Function==
Biological molecules are amphiphilic or amphipathic, i.e. are simultaneously hydrophobic and hydrophilic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The phospholipid bilayer contains charged [[hydrophilic]] headgroups, which interact with polar [[Properties of water|water]]. The lipids also contain [[hydrophobic]] tails, which meet with the hydrophobic tails of the complementary layer. The hydrophobic tails are usually fatty acids that differ in lengths.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Lipid Bilayer|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26871/|date = 2002-01-01|first = Bruce|last = Alberts|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Julian|last3 = Lewis|first4 = Martin|last4 = Raff|first5 = Keith|last5 = Roberts|first6 = Peter|last6 = Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intermolecular force|interactions]] of lipids, especially the hydrophobic tails, determine the [[Lipid bilayer phase behavior|lipid bilayer physical properties]] such as fluidity.

Membranes in cells typically define enclosed spaces or compartments in which cells may maintain a chemical or biochemical environment that differs from the outside. For example, the membrane around [[peroxisome]]s shields the rest of the cell from peroxides, chemicals that can be toxic to the cell, and the cell membrane separates a cell from its surrounding medium. Peroxisomes are one form of vacuole found in the cell that contain by-products of chemical reactions within the cell. Most organelles are defined by such membranes, and are called "membrane-bound" organelles.

===Selective permeability===

Probably the most important feature of a biomembrane is that it is a selectively permeable structure. This means that the size, charge, and other chemical properties of the atoms and molecules attempting to cross it will determine whether they succeed in doing so. Selective permeability is essential for effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings. Biological membranes also have certain mechanical or elastic properties that allow them to change shape and move as required.

Generally, small hydrophobic molecules can readily cross phospholipid bilayers by simple [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

Particles that are required for cellular function but are unable to diffuse freely across a membrane enter through a membrane transport protein or are taken in by means of [[endocytosis]], where the membrane allows for a vacuole to join onto it and push its contents into the cell. Many types of specialized plasma membranes can separate cell from external environment: apical, basolateral, presynaptic and postsynaptic ones, membranes of flagella, cilia, [[microvillus]], [[filopodia]] and [[lamellipodia]], the [[sarcolemma]] of muscle cells, as well as specialized myelin and [[dendritic spine]] membranes of neurons. Plasma membranes can also form different types of "supramembrane" structures such as [[caveolae]], postsynaptic density, [[podosome]], [[invadopodium]], desmosome, [[hemidesmosome]], focal adhesion, and cell junctions. These types of membranes differ in lipid and protein composition.

Distinct types of membranes also create intracellular organelles: endosome; smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum; sarcoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; lysosome; mitochondrion (inner and outer membranes); nucleus (inner and outer membranes); [[peroxisome]]; vacuole; cytoplasmic granules; cell vesicles (phagosome, [[autophagosome]], [[clathrin]]-coated vesicles, [[COPI]]-coated and [[COPII]]-coated vesicles) and secretory vesicles (including [[synaptosome]], [[acrosome]]s, melanosomes, and chromaffin granules).
Different types of biological membranes have diverse lipid and protein compositions. The content of membranes defines their physical and biological properties. Some components of membranes play a key role in medicine, such as the efflux pumps that pump drugs out of a cell.

=== Fluidity ===
The hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer is constantly in motion because of rotations around the bonds of lipid tails.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13874|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2015-11-10|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4653158|pmid = 26512118|pages = 13874–13879|volume = 112|issue = 45|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1512994112|first = Heidi|last = Vitrac|first2 = David M.|last2 = MacLean|first3 = Vasanthi|last3 = Jayaraman|first4 = Mikhail|last4 = Bogdanov|first5 = William|last5 = Dowhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrophobic tails of a bilayer bend and lock together. However, because of hydrogen bonding with water, the hydrophilic head groups exhibit less movement as their rotation and mobility are constrained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This results in increasing viscosity of the lipid bilayer closer to the hydrophilic heads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Below a transition temperature, a lipid bilayer loses fluidity when the highly mobile lipids exhibits less movement becoming a gel-like solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How Lipid Membranes Affect Pore Forming Toxin Activity|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00403|journal = Accounts of Chemical Research|date = 2015-12-07|doi = 10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00403|first = Nejc|last = Rojko|first2 = Gregor|last2 = Anderluh|volume=48|pages=3073–3079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition temperature depends on such components of the lipid bilayer as the hydrocarbon chain length and the saturation of its fatty acids. Temperature-dependence fluidity constitutes an important physiological attribute for bacteria and cold-blooded organisms. These organisms maintain a constant fluidity by modifying membrane lipid fatty acid composition in accordance with differing temperatures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In animal cells, membrane fluidity is modulated by the inclusion of the sterol [[cholesterol]]. This molecule is present in especially large amounts in the plasma membrane, where it constitutes approximately 20% of the lipids in the membrane by weight. Because cholesterol molecules are short and rigid, they fill the spaces between neighboring phospholipid molecules left by the kinks in their unsaturated hydrocarbon tails. In this way, cholesterol tends to stiffen the bilayer, making it more rigid and less permeable.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Cell Biology third edition|last=Alberts, Bray, Hopkin, Johnson, Lewis, Raff, Roberts, Walter|first=Bruce, Dennis, Karen, Alexander, Julian, Martin, Keith, Peter|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC, an informa business|year=2010|isbn=978-0815341291|location=270 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA, and 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, OX14 4RN, UK|pages=370|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all cells, membrane fluidity is important for many reasons. It enables membrane proteins to diffuse rapidly in the plane of the bilayer and to interact with one another, as is crucial, for example, in [[cell signaling]]. It permits membrane lipids and proteins to diffuse from sites where they are inserted into the bilayer after their synthesis to other regions of the cell. It allows membranes to fuse with one another and mix their molecules, and it ensures that membrane molecules are distributed evenly between daughter cells when a cell divides. If biological membranes were not fluid, it is hard to imagine how cells could live, grow, and reproduce.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A '''book paper''' (or publishing paper) is a [[paper]] that is designed specifically for the [[publication]] of printed [[book]]s. 

Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other, and are (usually) made to tighter [[caliper]] or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Typically, books papers are light-weight papers 60 to 90 g/m² and often specified by their caliper/substance ratios (volume basis). For example, a bulky 80 g/m² paper may have a caliper of 120 micrometres (0.12 mm) which would be Volume 15 (120×10/80), whereas a low bulk 80 g/m² may have a caliper of 88 micrometres, giving a volume 11. This volume basis then allows the calculation of a book's PPI (printed pages per inch), which is an important factor for the design of [[Dust jacket|book jackets]] and the [[bookbinding|binding]] of the finished book. 

Different paper qualities can be used as book paper depending on the type of book. [[Coated paper|Machine-finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s, and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.

'''Calcium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ca''' and [[atomic number]] 20. An [[alkaline earth metal]], calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues [[strontium]] and [[barium]]. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after [[iron]] and [[aluminium]]. The most common calcium compound on Earth is [[calcium carbonate]], found in [[limestone]] and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], [[fluorite]], and [[apatite]] are also sources of calcium. The name derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''calx'' "lime", which was obtained from heating limestone.

Some calcium compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. Pure calcium was isolated in 1808 via [[electrolysis]] of its oxide by [[Humphry Davy]], who named the element. Calcium compounds are widely used in many industries: in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, as components in cement and electrical insulators, and in the manufacture of soaps. On the other hand, the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity; still, in small quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking, and sometimes, as a calcium–lead alloy, in making automotive batteries.

Calcium is the most abundant metal and the fifth-most abundant element in the [[human body#Composition|human body]]. As [[electrolyte]]s, calcium ions play a vital role in the [[physiology|physiological]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes of organisms and [[cell (biology)|cell]]s: in [[signal transduction]] pathways where they act as a [[second messenger]]; in [[neurotransmitter]] release from [[neurons]]; in contraction of all [[muscle]] cell types; as cofactors in many [[enzyme]]s; and in [[fertilization]]. Calcium ions outside cells are important for maintaining the [[potential difference]] across excitable [[cell membrane]]s as well as proper bone formation.

==Characteristics==
===Classification===
Calcium is a very ductile silvery metal (sometimes described as pale yellow) whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group, [[strontium]], [[barium]], and [[radium]]. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the [[electron configuration]] [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two [[valence electron]]s in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a [[noble gas]], in this case [[argon]]. Hence, calcium is almost always [[divalent]] in its compounds, which are usually [[ionic compound|ionic]]. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to [[disproportionation]] to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the [[enthalpy of formation]] of MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater [[lattice energy]] afforded by the more highly charged Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation compared to the hypothetical Ca&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium, strontium, barium, and radium are always considered to be [[alkaline earth metal]]s; the lighter [[beryllium]] and [[magnesium]], also in group 2 of the periodic table, are often included as well. Nevertheless, beryllium and magnesium are significantly different from the other members of the group in their physical and chemical behaviour: they behave more like [[aluminium]] and [[zinc]] respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the [[post-transition metal]]s, which is why the traditional definition of the term "alkaline earth metal" excludes them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parish |first=R. V. |date=1977 |title=The Metallic Elements |location=London |publisher=Longman |page=34 |isbn=978-0-582-44278-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is mostly obsolete in English-language sources, but is still used in other countries such as Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fukuma |first=Chihito |date=2013 |title=福間の無機化学の講義　三訂版 |publisher=株式会社 旺文社 |page=126 |isbn=9784010340172 |language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, comparisons with strontium and barium are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112/&gt;

===Physical===
Calcium metal melts at 842&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 1494&amp;nbsp;°C; these values are higher than those for magnesium and strontium, the neighbouring group 2 metals. It crystallises in the [[face-centered cubic]] arrangement like strontium; above 450&amp;nbsp;°C, it changes to an [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] [[hexagonal close-packed]] arrangement like magnesium. Its density of 1.55&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the lowest in its group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112/&gt; Calcium is harder than [[lead]] but can be cut with a knife with effort. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than [[copper]] or [[aluminium]] by volume, it is a better conductor by mass than both due to its very low density.&lt;ref name=Ropp&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&amp;pg=PA16| pages = 12–5 | title = Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds | isbn = 978-0-444-59553-9 | author1 = Ropp | first1 = Richard C. | date = 31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While calcium is infeasible as a conductor for most terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as such in space has been considered.&lt;ref name=Ullmann484&gt;Hluchan and Pomerantz, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
[[File:Ca(aq)6 improved image.tif|thumb|left|Structure of the polymeric [Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center in hydrated calcium chloride, illustrating the high coordination number typical for calcium complexes.]]

The chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce [[calcium hydroxide]] and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] in the air to form a mixture of [[calcium oxide]] and [[calcium nitride]].&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;C. R. Hammond ''The elements'' (p. 4–35) in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% [[relative humidity]] it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.&lt;ref name=Ullmann483&gt;Hluchan and Pomerantz, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the simple oxide CaO, the [[peroxide]] CaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow [[superoxide]] Ca(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; All four dihalides of calcium are known.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are particularly abundant minerals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood122&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 122–5&lt;/ref&gt; Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent [[lanthanide]]s [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]], calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid [[ammonia]] to give a dark blue solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood112/&gt;

Due to the large size of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, high coordination numbers are common, up to 24 in some [[intermetallic compound]]s such as CaZn&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen [[chelate]]s such as [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] and [[polyphosphate]]s, which are useful in [[analytic chemistry]] and removing calcium ions from [[hard water]]. In the absence of [[steric hindrance]], smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large [[polydentate]] [[macrocycle]]s are involved the trend is reversed.&lt;ref name=Greenwood122/&gt;

Although calcium is in the same group as magnesium and [[organomagnesium compound]]s are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible [[catalyst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harder|first1=S.|last2=Feil|first2=F.|last3=Knoll|first3=K.|year=2001|title=Novel Calcium Half-Sandwich Complexes for the Living and Stereoselective Polymerization of Styrene|journal=Angew.

Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium di[[cyclopentadienyl]], Ca(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with [[mercurocene]] or [[cyclopentadiene]] itself; replacing the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand with the bulkier C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 136–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of calcium}}

Natural calcium is a mixture of five stable [[isotope]]s (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, and &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes ([[calcium-48|&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca]], with a half-life of about 4.3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to have six naturally occurring isotopes.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

By far the most common isotope of calcium in nature is &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, which makes up 96.941% of all natural calcium. It is produced in the [[silicon-burning process]] from fusion of [[alpha particle]]s and is the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers; its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] [[potassium-40|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K]]. Adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, which quickly decays via two successive [[electron capture]]s to stable &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca; this makes up 2.806% of all natural calcium and is the second-most common isotope. The other four natural isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, and &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, are significantly rarer, each comprising less than 1% of all natural calcium. The four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the [[oxygen-burning process|oxygen-burning]] and silicon-burning processes, leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron-capturing processes. &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca is mostly produced in a "hot" [[s-process]], as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short-lived &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Ca to capture a neutron. &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca is produced by [[electron capture]] in the [[r-process]] in [[type Ia supernova]]e, where high neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cameron |first1 = A.

&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca and &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca are the first "classically stable" nuclides with a six-neutron or eight-neutron excess respectively. Although extremely neutron-rich for such a light element, &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca is very stable because it is a [[magic number (physics)|doubly magic nucleus]], having 20 protons and 28 neutrons arranged in closed shells. Its [[beta decay]] to &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;[[scandium|Sc]] is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of [[nuclear spin]]: &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca has zero nuclear spin, being [[even and odd atomic nuclei|even–even]], while &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Sc has spin 6+, so the decay is [[forbidden mechanism|forbidden]] by the conservation of [[angular momentum]]. While two excited states of &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Sc are available for decay as well, they are also forbidden due to their high spins. As a result, when &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca does decay, it does so by [[double beta decay]] to &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;[[titanium|Ti]] instead, being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

Calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes. The experimental lower limits for the half-lives of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca and &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Ca are 5.9&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years and 2.8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years respectively.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;

Apart from the practically stable &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, the longest lived [[radioisotope]] of calcium is &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;[[potassium|K]] with a half-life of about a hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an [[extinct radionuclide]] has been inferred from excesses of &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;K: traces of &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca also still exist today, as it is a [[cosmogenic nuclide]], continuously reformed through [[neutron activation]] of natural &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ca to &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, the most stable among them being &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Ca (half-life 163&amp;nbsp;days) and &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Ca (half-life 4.54&amp;nbsp;days). The isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;Ca usually undergo [[beta plus decay]] to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca usually undergo [[beta minus decay]] to isotopes of [[scandium]], although near the [[nuclear drip line]]s [[proton emission]] and [[neutron emission]] begin to be significant decay modes as well.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;

The climate of present-day Italy being warmer than that of Egypt, the [[ancient Roman]]s instead used lime mortars made by heating [[limestone]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); the name "calcium" itself derives from the Latin word ''calx'' "lime".&lt;ref name=Greenwood108/&gt; [[Vitruvius]] noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone, attributing this to the boiling of the water; in 1755, [[Joseph Black]] proved that this was due to the loss of [[carbon dioxide]], which as a gas had not been recognised by the ancient Romans.&lt;ref name=Weeks/&gt;

In 1787, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental [[chemical element]]. In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five "salifiable earths" (i.e., ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (''salis'' = salt, in Latin): ''chaux'' (calcium oxide), ''magnésie'' (magnesia, magnesium oxide), ''baryte'' (barium sulfate), ''alumine'' (alumina, aluminium oxide), and ''silice'' (silica, silicon dioxide). About these "elements", Lavoisier speculated: {{quote|We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218 page 218] of: Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', 4th ed.

Calcium, along with its congeners magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1808. Following the work of [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] and [[Magnus Martin af Pontin]] on [[electrolysis]], Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with [[mercury(II) oxide]] on a [[platinum]] plate which was used as the anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal.&lt;ref name=Greenwood108/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davy | first1 = H. | date = 1808 | title = Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–70 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{Cite book

At 3%, calcium is the fifth [[Abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the third most abundant metal behind [[aluminium]] and [[iron]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood108/&gt; It is also the fourth most abundant element in the [[lunar highlands]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann483/&gt; [[Sedimentary rocks|Sedimentary]] [[calcium carbonate]] deposits pervade the Earth's surface as fossilized remains of past marine life; they occur in two forms, the [[rhombohedral]] [[calcite]] (more common) and the [[orthorhombic]] [[aragonite]] (forming in more temperate seas). Minerals of the first type include [[limestone]], [[dolomite]], [[marble]], [[chalk]], and [[iceland spar]]; aragonite beds make up the [[Bahamas]], the [[Florida Keys]], and the [[Red Sea]] basins. [[Coral]]s, [[sea shell]]s, and [[pearl]]s are mostly made up of calcium carbonate. Among the other important minerals of calcium are [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[anhydrite]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[apatite]] ([Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F]).&lt;ref name=Greenwood108/&gt;

The major producers of calcium are [[China]] (about 10000 to 12000 [[tonne]]s per year), [[Russia]] (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the [[United States]] (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). [[Canada]] and [[France]] are also among the minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; about half of the world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year.&lt;ref name=Ullmann484/&gt; In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten [[calcium chloride]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann484/&gt; Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and [[lathe]] machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood110&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Ullmann484/&gt;

===Geochemical cycling===
{{Main|Carbonate–silicate cycle}}
Calcium provides a link between [[tectonics]], [[climate]], and the [[carbon cycle]]. In the simplest terms, uplift of mountains exposes calcium-bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into surface water. These ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[limestone]] ({{chem|CaCO|3}}), which in turn settles to the sea floor where it is incorporated into new rocks. Dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, along with [[carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions, are termed "[[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]]" (DIC).&lt;ref name=Berner/&gt;

The actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) that forms when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water at seawater [[pH]]:
:{{chem|Ca|2+}} + 2{{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CaCO|3|link=Limestone}}&lt;sub&gt;([[Solid|s]])&lt;/sub&gt; + {{chem|CO|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}
At seawater pH, most of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is immediately converted back into {{chem|HCO|3|-}}. The reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the ocean/atmosphere into the [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Zeebe|date=2006|url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Marine_carbonate_chemistry|title = Marine carbonate chemistry|publisher = National Council for Science and the Environment|accessdate = 2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that each Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule from the surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years. The weathering of calcium from rocks thus scrubs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the ocean and atmosphere, exerting a strong long-term effect on climate.&lt;ref name=Berner&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert|title= The long-term carbon cycle, fossil fuels and atmospheric composition |journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=426|pages= 323–326|doi=10.1038/nature02131|pmid=14628061|issue=6964|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..323B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A negative feedback mechanism for the long-term stabilization of Earth's surface temperature|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JC086iC10p09776/abstract|journal = Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|date = 1981-10-20|issn = 2156-2202|pages = 9776–9782|volume = 86|issue = C10|doi = 10.1029/JC086iC10p09776|language = en|first = James C.

==Uses==
The largest use of calcium is in [[steelmaking]], due to its strong [[chemical affinity]] for oxygen and [[sulfur]]. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime [[aluminate]] and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free [[automotive battery|automotive batteries]], in which the use of 0.1% calcium–[[lead]] alloys instead of the usual [[antimony]]–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, [[aluminium]] is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys.&lt;ref name=Ullmann485&gt;Hluchan and Pomerantz, pp. 485–7&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic [[carbon]] in [[cast iron]], and to remove [[bismuth]] impurities from lead.&lt;ref name=Greenwood110/&gt; Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and [[calcium hydroxide]] that [[Saponification|saponifies]] the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains.&lt;ref name=Rumack/&gt; Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove [[nitrogen]] from high-purity [[argon]] gas and as a [[getter]] for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of [[chromium]], [[zirconium]], [[thorium]], and [[uranium]]. It can also be used to store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid [[calcium hydride]], from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.&lt;ref name=Greenwood110/&gt;

Calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J.|title=Biological control of calcium isotopic abundances in the global calcium cycle|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=June 1997 | volume=61|pages=2505–10|last2=Depaolo|first2=D.

In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Skulan|first1=J.|title=Natural calcium isotopic composition of urine as a marker of bone mineral balance|pmid=17463176|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=2007|volume=53|pages=1155–1158|last2=Bullen|first2=T.|last3=Anbar|first3=A.

In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca/&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a "steady state" with respect to calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fantle|first1=M.|last2=Depaolo|first2=D.|title=Ca isotopes in carbonate sediment and pore fluid from ODP Site 807A: The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)–calcite equilibrium fractionation factor and calcite recrystallization rates in Pleistocene sediments|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|date=2007|volume=71|pages=2524–2546|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2007.03.006|issue=10|bibcode=2007GeCoA..71.2524F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Griffith|first1=Elizabeth M.|title=A Dynamic marine calcium cycle during the past 28 million years|pmid=19074345|journal=Science|date=2008|volume=322|pages=1671–1674|last2= Paytan |first2= Adina |last3= Caldeira |first3= Ken|last4= Bullen |first4= Thomas |last5= Thomas |first5= Ellen |issue=12|doi=10.1126/science.1163614 |bibcode = 2008Sci...322.1671G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many calcium compounds are used in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of [[calcium lactate]], [[calcium diphosphate]], and [[tricalcium phosphate]]. The last is also used as a polishing agent in [[toothpaste]] and in [[antacid]]s. [[Calcium lactobionate]] is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, [[calcium monophosphate]] is used as a [[leavening agent]]. [[Calcium sulfite]] is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, [[calcium silicate]] is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and [[calcium acetate]] is a component of [[liming rosin]] and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.&lt;ref name=Ullmann485/&gt;

Calcium is an [[essential element]] needed in large quantities. The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion acts as an [[electrolyte]] and is vital to the health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion forms stable [[coordination complex]]es with many organic compounds, especially [[protein]]s; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of [[skeleton]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann489&gt;Hluchan and Pomerantz, pp. 489–94&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the [[carboxyl group]]s of [[glutamic acid]] or [[aspartic acid]] residues; through interacting with [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] [[serine]], [[tyrosine]], or [[threonine]] residues; or by being [[chelation|chelated]] by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. [[Trypsin]], a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; [[osteocalcin]], a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as [[osteopontin]] and bone [[sialoprotein]] use both the first and the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the [[phospholipid]] layer of the [[cell membrane]], anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface.&lt;ref name=Ullmann489/&gt; As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, [[monocalcium phosphate]] is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as [[dicalcium phosphate]] with a solubility of 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration|mM]] and the [[hydroxyapatite]] of bones in an organic matrix is [[tricalcium phosphate]] at 100&amp;nbsp;µM.&lt;ref name=Ullmann489/&gt;

About three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains, the rest being accounted for by vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the [[Radical ion|free ion]], and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. [[Parathyroid hormone]] and [[vitamin D]] promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by [[calcitonin]], whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.&lt;ref name=Ullmann489/&gt;

Excess intake of calcium may cause [[hypercalcaemia]]. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours [[metastasize]] within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to [[calcification]] of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of [[vascular wall]]s and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to [[Vulnerable plaque|plaque rupture]] and [[thrombosis]]. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in [[hypocalcaemia]], often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes [[tetany]] and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.&lt;ref name=Ullmann489/&gt;

As calcium is heavily involved in bone manufacture, many bone diseases can be traced to problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, [[osteoporosis]] is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed [[menopause]] as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as [[osteomalacia]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann489/&gt;

Light reflections reveal the curved water surface around the coins. Several coins have sunk to the bottom of the cup, showing that these coins normally do not float.]]

In [[fluid mechanics]], the '''Cheerios effect''' is the phenomenon that occurs when floating objects that don't normally float attract one another. [[Wetting]], an example of the "Cheerios effect," is when [[breakfast cereal]] clumps together or clings to the sides of a bowl of [[milk]].  It is named after the common breakfast cereal [[Cheerios]] and is due to [[surface tension]].  The same effect governs the behavior of bubbles on the surface of [[soft drink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9425907/ | title=Scientists explain the 'Cheerio Effect' | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a purely gravitational phenomena.

==Description==
This clumping behaviour applies to any small macroscopic object that floats or clings to the surface of a liquid. Examples of such objects are hair particles in shaving cream and fizzy beer bubbles. The effect is not noticeable in boats and other large floating objects because the force of surface tension is relatively small at that scale.

==Explanation==
At the interface between a [[liquid]] and air, molecules of the liquid are subject to greater attractive forces from those below than from air molecules.  Opposing these forces is the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of the container.  The result is that the liquid's surface forms a [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] which exhibits [[surface tension]] and acts as a flexible membrane.  This membrane may be curved with the center either higher or lower than the edges. 

The attraction isn't created by the depression or hills per se, but the objects are just following the path of least resistance.

The object that creates the hill does so because it's less dense than water but more dense than air. The object is actually creating a depression, not in the water but in the air above it. Like a heavy ball on a hill of air, the object will fall "down", because all the heavy water "above" it is pushing it. 

The attraction between objects that create depressions can be seen as 2 balls in a trampoline, which have a kind of hill between them but they still fall into each other because the "hill" at the opposite side is larger than that in the middle. You only see the depression around the object where the bend is enough to be noticeable, but it reaches the edges of the container.  

A floating object will seek the highest point of the membrane and thus will find its way to either the center or the edge.  A similar argument explains why bubbles on surfaces attract each other: a single bubble raises the liquid level locally causing other bubbles in the area to be attracted to it.  Dense objects, like paper clips, can rest on liquid surfaces due to surface tension. These objects deform the liquid surface downward. Other floating objects that are seeking to sink but are constrained by surface tension will be attracted to the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=D.Y.C. |last2=Henry |first2=J.D. |last3=White |first3=L.R.|title=The interaction of colloidal particles collected at the fluid interface |work=[[Journal of Colloid and Interface Science]] |volume=79 |issue=9 |pages=410–418 |date=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects with an irregular meniscus also deform the water surface forming "capillary multipoles".  When such objects come close to each other they rotate in the plane of the water surface until they find an optimum relative orientation.  Subsequently, they are attracted to each other by surface tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamou |first1=D. |last2=Duschl |first2=C. |last3=Johannsmann |first3=D.|title=Long-range attraction between colloidal spheres at the air–water interface: The consequence of an irregular meniscus |work=[[Physical Review E]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=5263–5272 |date=2000|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.62.5263 |bibcode = 2000PhRvE..62.5263S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[American Journal of Physics]], [[Dominic Vella]] and [[L. Mahadevan]] of [[Harvard University]] discuss the Cheerios effect and suggest that it may be useful in the study of the [[self-assembly]] of small structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vella |first1=D. |last2=Mahadevan |first2=L. |title=The ''Cheerios'' effect |work=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=73 |issue=9 |pages=817–825 |date=September 2005 |doi=10.1119/1.1898523|arxiv = cond-mat/0411688 |bibcode = 2005AmJPh..73..817V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They calculate the [[force]] between two [[sphere]]s of [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; floating distance &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; apart in liquid of density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; as
 
:&lt;math&gt;
2\pi\gamma RB^{5/2}\Sigma^2K_1\left(\frac{\ell}{L_c}\right)

A '''chemical compound''' is a [[chemical substance]] composed of many identical [[molecule]]s (or [[molecular entity|molecular entities]]) composed of [[atom]]s from more than one [[chemical element|element]] held together by [[chemical bond]]s. A [[chemical element]] bonded to an identical chemical element is not a chemical compound since only one element, not two different elements, is involved.

There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together:
* [[molecule]]s held together by [[covalent bond]]s
* [[ionic compound]]s held together by [[ionic bond]]s
* [[intermetallic compounds]] held together by [[metallic bond]]s
* certain [[Coordination complex|complexes]] held together by [[coordinate covalent bond]]s.

A [[chemical formula]] is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using the standard abbreviations for the chemical elements, and [[subscript]]s to indicate the number of atoms involved. For example, [[water]] is composed of two [[hydrogen atom]]s bonded to one [[oxygen]] atom: the chemical formula is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Many [[chemistry|chemical]] compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS): its [[CAS number]].

A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a [[chemical reaction]]. In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and then bonds are reformed so that new associations are made between atoms.   {{Infobox

Chemical compounds have a unique and defined [[chemical structure]] held together in a defined spatial arrangement by [[chemical bond]]s. Chemical compounds can be [[molecule|molecular]] compounds held together by [[covalent bond]]s, [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] held together by [[ionic bond]]s, [[intermetallic compounds]] held together by [[metallic bond]]s, or the subset of [[Coordination complex|chemical complexes]] that are held together by [[coordinate covalent bond]]s.&lt;ref name="ChemPrinciples"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkins |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Atkins |last2=Jones |first2=Loretta |date=2004 |title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure [[chemical element]]s are generally not considered chemical compounds, failing the two or more atom requirement, though they often consist of molecules composed of multiple atoms (such as in the [[diatomic molecule]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or the [[polyatomic molecule]] S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.).&lt;ref name="ChemPrinciples"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkins |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Atkins |last2=Jones |first2=Loretta |date=2004 |title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[chemistry|chemical]] compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS): its [[CAS number]].

There is varying and sometimes inconsistent nomenclature differentiating substances, which include truly non-stoichiometric examples, from chemical compounds, which require the fixed ratios. Many solid chemical substances—for example many [[silicate mineral]]s—are chemical substances, but do not have simple formulae reflecting chemically bonding of elements to one another in fixed ratios; even so, these [[Crystal structure|crystalline]] substances are often called "[[non-stoichiometric compound]]s".  It may be argued that they are related to, rather than being chemical compounds, insofar as the variability in their compositions is often due to either the presence of foreign elements trapped within the crystal structure of an otherwise known true ''chemical compound'', or due to perturbations in structure relative to the known compound that arise because of an excess of deficit of the constituent elements at places in its structure; such non-stoichiometric substances form most of the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the Earth.  Other compounds regarded as chemically identical may have varying amounts of heavy or light [[isotope]]s of the constituent elements, which changes the ratio of elements by mass slightly.

== Bonding and forces ==
Compounds are held together through a variety of different types of bonding and forces. The differences in the types of bonds in compounds differ based on the types of elements present in the compound.

[[London dispersion forces]] are the weakest force of all [[intermolecular forces]]. They are temporary attractive forces that form when the [[electrons]] in two adjacent atoms are positioned so that they create a temporary [[dipole]]. Additionally, London dispersion forces are responsible for condensing  [[chemical polarity|non polar]] substances to liquids, and to further freeze to a solid state dependent on how low the temperature of the environment is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/liquids/disperse.html|title=London Dispersion Forces|website=www.chem.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-09-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113112106/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/liquids/disperse.html|archivedate=2017-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[covalent bond]], also known as a molecular bond, involves the sharing of electrons between two atoms. Primarily, this type of bond occurs between elements that fall close to each other on the [[periodic table of elements]], yet it is observed between some metals and nonmetals. This is due to the mechanism of this type of bond. Elements that fall close to each other on the periodic table tend to have similar  [[electronegativity|electronegativities]], which means they have a similar affinity for electrons. Since neither element has a stronger affinity to donate or gain electrons, it causes the elements to share electrons so both elements have a more stable [[octet rule|octet]].

[[Ionic bonding]] occurs when [[valence electrons]] are completely transferred between elements. Opposite to covalent bonding, this chemical bond creates two oppositely charged ions. The metals in ionic bonding usually lose their valence electrons, becoming a positively charged [[cation]]. The nonmetal will gain the electrons from the metal, making the nonmetal a negatively charged [[anion]]. As outlined, ionic bonds occur between an electron donor, usually a metal, and an electron acceptor, which tends to be a nonmetal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Fundamentals/Ionic_and_Covalent_Bonds|title=Ionic and Covalent Bonds|date=2013-10-02|work=Chemistry LibreTexts|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183643/https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Fundamentals/Ionic_and_Covalent_Bonds|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen bonding]] occurs when a [[hydrogen atom]] bonded to an electronegative atom forms an [[electrostatic]] connection with another electronegative atom through interacting dipoles or charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/H/H02899.html|title=IUPAC Gold Book - hydrogen bond|last=Chemistry|first=International Union of Pure and Applied|website=goldbook.iupac.org|language=en|doi=10.1351/goldbook.H02899|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709094119/http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/H/H02899.html|archivedate=2017-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/161Ahydrogenbond.html|title=Hydrogen Bonds|website=chemistry.elmhurst.edu|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119185817/http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/161Ahydrogenbond.html|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/liquids/hbond.html|title=Hydrogen Bonding|website=www.chem.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808201000/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/liquids/hbond.html|archivedate=2011-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html|title=intermolecular bonding - hydrogen bonds|website=www.chemguide.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219123038/http://chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html|archivedate=2016-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}
A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a [[chemical reaction]]. In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and then bonds are reformed so that new associations are made between atoms. Schematically, this reaction could be described as {{nowrap|AB + CD → AD + CB}}, where A, B, C, and D are each unique atoms; and AB, AD, CD, and CB are each unique compounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15717">In [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and [[electrolyte]]s, the '''Debye length''' (also called '''Debye radius'''), named after [[Peter Debye]], is a measure of a [[charge carrier]]'s net electrostatic effect in solution and how far its electrostatic effect persists. A '''Debye sphere''' is a volume whose radius is the Debye length. With each Debye length, charges are increasingly [[Electric-field screening|electrically screened]]. Every Debye‐length &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;, the electric potential will decrease in magnitude by 1/e. Debye length is an important parameter in [[plasma physics]], [[electrolytes]], and [[colloids]] ([[DLVO theory]]). The corresponding Debye screening wave vector &lt;math&gt;k_D=1/\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt; 
for particles of density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; at a temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;: k_D^2=4\pi n q^2/k_BT &lt;/math&gt; in Gaussian units. Expressions in MKS units will be given below. The analogous quantities at very low temperatures (&lt;math&gt;T \to 0&lt;/math&gt;) are known as the [[Thomas–Fermi screening|Thomas-Fermi length]] and the Thomas-Fermi wave vector. They are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature.

== Physical origin ==
The Debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges. In a system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; different species of charges, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th species carries charge &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; and has [[concentration]] &lt;math&gt;n_j(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.  According to the so-called "primitive model", these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its [[relative static permittivity]], &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt;.
This distribution of charges within this medium gives rise to an [[electric potential]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies [[Poisson's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon \nabla^2 \Phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\, \sum_{j = 1}^N q_j \, n_j(\mathbf{r}) - \rho_E(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \equiv \varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\rho_E&lt;/math&gt; is a charge density external (logically, not spatially) to the medium.

The mobile charges not only establish &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; but also move in response to the associated [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], &lt;math&gt;- q_j \, \nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;.
If we further assume the system to be in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with a [[heat bath]] at [[absolute temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then the concentrations of discrete charges, &lt;math&gt;n_j(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, may be considered to be thermodynamic (ensemble) averages and the associated [[electric potential]] to be a thermodynamic [[mean field theory|mean field]].
With these assumptions, the concentration of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th charge species is described
by the [[Boltzmann distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt; n_j(\mathbf{r}) = n_j^0 \, \exp\left( - \frac{q_j \, \Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and where &lt;math&gt;n_j^0&lt;/math&gt; is the mean
concentration of charges of species &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.

Identifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the Poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in Boltzmann's distribution yields the [[Poisson–Boltzmann equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon \nabla^2 \Phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\, \sum_{j = 1}^N q_j n_j^0 \, \exp\left(- \frac{q_j \, \Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \right) - \rho_E(\mathbf{r}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Solutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems.  Solutions for more general
systems may be obtained in the high-temperature (weak coupling) limit, &lt;math&gt;q_j \, \Phi(\mathbf{r}) \ll k_B T&lt;/math&gt;, by [[Taylor expansion|Taylor expanding]] the exponential:

:&lt;math&gt; \exp\left(- \frac{q_j \, \Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \right) \approx
1 - \frac{q_j \, \Phi(\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}&lt;/math&gt;.

This approximation yields the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon \nabla^2 \Phi(\mathbf{r}) =
\left(\sum_{j = 1}^N \frac{n_j^0 \, q_j^2}{ k_B T} \right)\, \Phi(\mathbf{r}) -\, \sum_{j = 1}^N n_j^0 q_j - \rho_E(\mathbf{r})
&lt;/math&gt;
which also is known as the [[Debye–Hückel equation]]:&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirby BJ. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices |

The second term on the right-hand side vanishes for systems that are electrically neutral. The term in parentheses divided by &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, has the units of an inverse length squared and by
[[dimensional analysis]] leads to the definition of the characteristic length scale

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_D =
\left(\frac{\varepsilon \, k_B T}{\sum_{j = 1}^N n_j^0 \, q_j^2}\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

that commonly is referred to as the Debye–Hückel length.  As the only characteristic length scale in the Debye–Hückel equation, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D&lt;/math&gt; sets the scale for variations in the potential and in the concentrations of charged species. All charged species contribute to the Debye–Hückel length in the same way, regardless of the sign of their charges. For an electrically neutral system, the Poisson equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2 \Phi(\mathbf{r}) =
\lambda_D^{-2} \Phi(\mathbf{r}) - \frac{\rho_E(\mathbf{r})}{\varepsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;
To illustrate Debye screening, the potential produced by an external point charge &lt;math&gt;\rho_E=Q\delta(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon r}e^{-r/\lambda_D}&lt;/math&gt;
The bare Coulomb potential is exponentially screened by the medium, over a distance of the Debye length.

The Debye–Hückel length may be expressed in terms of the [[Bjerrum length]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_B&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_D =
\left(4 \pi \, \lambda_B \, \sum_{j = 1}^N n_j^0 \, z_j^2\right)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;z_j = q_j/e&lt;/math&gt; is the integer [[charge number]] that relates the charge on the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th ionic
species to the [[elementary charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

== Typical values ==
In space plasmas where the electron density is relatively low, the Debye length may reach macroscopic values, such as in the magnetosphere, solar wind, interstellar medium and intergalactic medium (see table):

: ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
: ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[elementary charge|charge of an electron]],
: ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the temperatures of the electrons and ions, respectively,
: ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of electrons,
: ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of atomic species ''j'', with positive [[ion]]ic charge ''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;q''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;

Even in quasineutral cold plasma, where ion contribution virtully seems to be larger due to lower ion temperature, the ion term is actually often dropped, giving

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e q_e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

although this is only valid when the mobility of ions is negligible compared to the process's timescale.&lt;ref&gt;I. H. Hutchinson ''Principles of plasma diagnostics'' {{ISBN|0-521-38583-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In an electrolyte solution ==
In an [[electrolyte]] or a [[colloids|colloidal suspension]], the Debye length&lt;ref&gt;Russel, W.B., Saville, D.A. and Schowalter, W. R. ''Colloidal Dispersions'', Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; for a monovalent electrolyte is usually denoted with symbol ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0 k_B T}{2\times10^3 N_A e^2 I}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''I'' is the [[ionic strength]] of the electrolyte in [[molar concentration|molar]] units (M or mol/L),
: ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Vacuum permittivity|permittivity of free space]],
: ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Relative static permittivity|dielectric constant]],
: ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]],
: ''T'' is the absolute temperature in [[kelvin]]s,
: ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Avogadro number]].
: &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]],

or, for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte,

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0 R T}{2\times10^3 F^2 C_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''R'' is the [[gas constant]],
: ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]],
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the electrolyte concentration in [[molar concentration|molar]] units (M or mol/L).

Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi \lambda_B N_A \times 10^3 I}} &lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bjerrum length]] of the medium.
For water at room temperature, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.7&amp;nbsp;nm.

At room temperature (25&amp;nbsp;°C), one can consider in water the relation:&lt;ref&gt;Israelachvili, J., ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'', Academic Press Inc., 1985, {{ISBN|0-12-375181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa^{-1}(\mathrm{nm}) = \frac{0.304}{\sqrt{I(\mathrm{M})}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is expressed in [[nanometer]]s (nm)
: ''I'' is the [[ionic strength]] expressed in [[molar concentration|molar]] (M or mol/L)

== In semiconductors ==

The Debye length has become increasingly significant in the modeling of solid state devices as improvements in lithographic technologies have enabled smaller geometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1021/nl071792z| volume = 7| issue = 11| pages = 3405–3409| last = Stern| first = Eric|author2=Robin Wagner |author3=Fred J.

The Debye length of [[semiconductor]]s is given:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{L}_D = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon k_B T}{q^2 N_D}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''ε'' is the dielectric constant,
: ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the Boltzmann's constant,
: ''T'' is the absolute temperature in kelvins,
: ''q'' is the elementary charge, and
: ''N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the net density of dopants (either donors or acceptors).

When doping profiles exceed the Debye length, majority carriers no longer behave according to the distribution of the dopants.  Instead, a measure of the profile of the doping gradients provides an "effective" profile that better matches the profile of the majority carrier density.

In the context of solids, the Debye length is also called the [[Thomas–Fermi screening length]].

[[File:Distancedisplacement.svg|thumb|Displacement versus distance traveled along a path]]
A '''displacement''' is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] whose length is the shortest [[distance]] from the initial to the final [[position (vector)|position]] of a point P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1c.cfm|title=Describing Motion with Words|author=Tom Henderson|work=The Physics Classroom|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies both the distance and direction of an imaginary motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point. A displacement may be identified with the [[translation (geometry)|translation]] that maps the initial position to the final position.

A displacement may be also described as a 'relative position': the final position of a point (x'''''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''''') relative to its initial position (x'''''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''), and a displacement vector can be mathematically defined as the [[Affine space#Subtraction and Weyl's axioms|difference]] between the final and initial positions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{s}=\boldsymbol{s_f-s_i}=\Delta\boldsymbol{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

In considering motions of objects over time the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the object is the rate of change of the displacement as a function of time. The instantaneous [[speed]] then is distinct from velocity, or the [[time rate]] of change of the distance traveled along a specific path. The velocity may be equivalently defined as the time rate of change of the position vector. If one considers a moving initial position, or equivalently a moving origin (e.g. an initial position or origin which is fixed to a train wagon, which in turn moves with respect to its rail track), the velocity of P (e.g. a point representing the position of a passenger walking on the train) may be referred to as a relative velocity, as opposed to an absolute velocity, which is computed with respect to a point which is considered to be 'fixed in space' (such as, for instance, a point fixed on the floor of the train station).

For motion over a given interval of time, the displacement divided by the length of the time interval defines the average velocity. (Note that the average [[velocity]], as a vector, differs from the [[average speed]] that is the ratio of the path length&amp;#8202;—&amp;#8202;a scalar&amp;#8202;—&amp;#8202;and the time interval.)

== Rigid body ==
In dealing with the motion of a [[rigid body]], the term ''displacement'' may also include the [[rotation]]s of the body. In this case, the displacement of a particle of the body is called '''linear displacement''' (displacement along a line), while the rotation of the body is called '''[[angular displacement]]'''.{{cite needed|date=August 2018}}

== Derivatives ==
For a position vector '''''s''''' that is a function of time ''t'', the derivatives can be computed with respect to ''t''.  These derivatives have common utility in the study of [[kinematics]], [[control theory]], [[vibration sensor|vibration sensing]] and other sciences and engineering disciplines.
  
[[Velocity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}=\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{s}}{\text{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; (where d'''''s''''' is an [[Differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimally]] small displacement)

[[Acceleration]]
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{a}=\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{v}}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}^2\boldsymbol{s}}{\text{d}t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Jerk (physics)|Jerk]]
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{j}=\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{a}}{\text{d}t}=\frac{\text{d}^2\boldsymbol{v}}{\text{d}t^2}=\frac{\text{d}^3\boldsymbol{s}}{\text{d}t^3}&lt;/math&gt;

These common names correspond to terminology used in basic kinematics.&lt;ref name='stewart'&gt;{{cite book

|chapter= §2.8 - The Derivative As A Function
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  By extension, the higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion.  Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function.  Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as [[Taylor series|a sum of an infinite series]], enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics. The fourth order derivative is called [[jounce]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">'''Environmental impact-minimizing vehicle tuning''' is the [[car tuning|modification]] (or tuning) of [[car]]s to reduce [[energy consumption]].

==General tuning==
*[[Hybrid electric vehicle|Hybridization]]: change to a [[hybrid electric vehicle]]. One can use an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] kit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=21291 Plug-in Hybrid Retrofit Kit]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[powertrain]] or use a [[hybrid adapter]] trailer.
* Modifying key engine-selection parameters in the [[Battery Management System]] of a hybrid vehicle. Vehicles as mild hybrids have a parameter for the threshold speed on which the vehicle is to switch from electric propulsion to the internal combustion engine. Introducing a higher speed as a parameter can reduce emissions and increase [[fuel efficiency]] (although it may increase strain on the battery).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lusciousgarage.com/services/sections/cat/modifications Modifying key parameters in the battery management system]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Plug-in hybrid|Pluginization]] of hybrid or electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greengears.net/about.php Pluginization of electric vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid which has additional battery capacity and the ability to be recharged from an external electrical outlet. A [[plug-in electric vehicle]] is basically the same, without an extra internal combustion engine. In addition, modifications are made to the vehicle's control software. The vehicle can be used for short trips of moderate speed without needing the internal combustion engine (ICE) component of the vehicle, thereby saving fuel costs. In this mode of operation the vehicle operates as a pure battery electric vehicle with a weight penalty (the ICE). The long range and additional power of the ICE power train is available when needed.
*[[Electric vehicle conversion]]. An electric vehicle conversion is the modification of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) driven vehicle to battery electric propulsion, creating a battery electric vehicle. In some cases the vehicle may be built by the converter, or assembled from a [[kit car]]. In some countries, the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no installation costs (it is called preconversion or previous conversion).
* Modifying the engine to [[ICE fuel conversion|run an alternative fuel]]. These include [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas]] conversion of gasoline-powered cars and [[Vegetable oil used as fuel|Vegetable oil conversion]] of diesel cars. Cars with [[Diesel engine]]s can be converted reasonably cheaply and easily to run on 100% vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is often cheaper and cleaner than petrodiesel, but local laws often levy harsh fines to users who fail to pay [[fuel tax]]es when acquiring their fuel outside regular distribution channels. [[Liquid nitrogen]], [[Hydrogen fuel enhancement|Hydrogen fuel conversions]] and [[Ethanol fuel conversion|Ethanol]] conversions are other alternative fuel conversions that can be done with internal combustion engines. The first two will eliminate all vehicle emissions, while the third one will only slightly decrease emissions.
* Replacing the [[internal combustion engine]] of a hybrid vehicle with a [[hydrogen fuel cell]] to make the vehicle completely emissionless; even in recharging mode.
* Adding a [[hydrogen fuel cell]] to a [[battery electric vehicle]] to increase its driving range.
* Adding more electric batteries to a [[battery electric vehicle]] to increase driving range. Besides placing more batteries, this operation often requires additional modification of the [[Battery Management System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elektor.com/magazines/2008/january/e-blocks-more-than-100-mpg-from-a-toyota-prius.321726.lynkx Adding more electric batteries to BEV]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">'''Floodline''' is the flood warning system used in the United Kingdom to issue flood alerts and warnings to the public, emergency organisations and businesses. 
The system uses observed data from rain, river and coastal gauges, combined with weather forecasts to accurately predict the likelihood and timing of flooding. When flooding is predicted within an area, a message is issued through the Floodline service. The service is accessed online or by the dedicated phone line, 0345 988 1188. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different messages the Floodline gives depending on the situation:

 FLOOD ALERT
Flooding is possible, be prepared. 
The Environment Agency endeavour to issue this message up to 24 hours in advance of expected river and coastal flooding, but warning time may be as little as 2 hrs. 
Flooding of low lying land is expected. 
Flood Alerts are early warning messages about possible flooding. They prompt you to remain alert and vigilant and provide people with time to make early preparations for potential flooding. 
Flood Alerts are issued for geographically representative areas, usually matching Local Authority boundaries.
They are generally 9am-5pm, 7 days a week.In exceptional circumstances, alerts may be issued outside these hours.
 

 FLOOD WARNING
Flooding is expected, immediate action required.
The target for these to be issued is 3-6 hours in advance of expected flooding. It may not be possible to give 3 hours’ notice in areas prone to rapid flooding or when water levels have escalated quicker than expected.
Flooding is imminent.
Immediate action is required, take measures to protect yourself and your property.
They are issued 24 hours a day.
 
 SEVERE FLOOD WARNING 
Severe flooding, danger to life.
These are issued whenever severe flooding is likely to cause significant risk to life, destruction of properties or local communities. 
Flooding is imminent and could pose a risk to life and cause significant disruption to essential services, such as water and electricity supplies. 
Prepare to evacuate and co-operate with the emergency services.
These are issued 24 hours a day.
 
 NO LONGER IN FORCE MESSAGES 
These are issued to notify you when warnings and alerts are no longer in force.
No further flooding is currently expected for your area.
[[Flood]] waters may still be around but you can start the clean up process.
24 hours a day.

You can check if there are flood alerts and warnings near you by going to http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood/31618.aspx 


It is operated by:

*The [[Environment Agency]], in England
*[[Natural Resources Wales]]

This article chronicles the '''history and origins of the Teller–Ulam design''', the technical concept behind modern [[thermonuclear weapons]], also known as [[Nuclear weapon design#Hydrogen bombs|hydrogen bombs]].  This design, the details of which are military secrets known to only a handful of major nations, is believed to be used in virtually all modern nuclear weapons which make up the arsenals of the major nuclear powers.

==History==

===Teller's "Super"===
[[File:EdwardTeller1958 fewer smudges.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Physicist [[Edward Teller]] was for many years the chief force lobbying for research into developing fusion weapons.]] 
The idea of using the energy from a fission device to begin a fusion reaction was first proposed by the Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] to his colleague [[Edward Teller]] in the fall of 1941 during what would soon become the [[Manhattan Project]], the World War II effort by the United States and United Kingdom to develop the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. Teller soon was a participant at [[Robert Oppenheimer]]'s summer conference on the development of a fission bomb held at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he guided discussion towards the idea of creating his "Super" bomb, which would hypothetically be many times more powerful than the yet-undeveloped fission weapon. Teller assumed creating the fission bomb would be nothing more than an engineering problem, and that the "Super" provided a much more interesting theoretical challenge.

[[File:Ivy King - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ivy King]], the largest pure [[nuclear fission|fission]] [[nuclear weapon|bomb]] tested by the US, yielding 500 kt (November 16, 1952)]]

For the remainder of the war, however, the effort was focused on first developing fission weapons. Nevertheless, Teller continued to pursue the "Super", to the point of neglecting work assigned to him for the fission weapon at the secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos lab]] where he worked (much of the work Teller declined to do was given instead to [[Klaus Fuchs]], who was later discovered to be a spy for the [[Soviet Union]]). Teller was given some resources with which to study the "Super", and contacted his friend [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer|Maria Göppert-Mayer]] to help with laborious calculations relating to [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]. The "Super", however, proved elusive, and the calculations were incredibly difficult to perform, especially since there was no existing way to run small-scale tests of the principles involved (in comparison, the properties of fission could be more easily probed with [[cyclotron]]s, newly created [[nuclear reactor]]s, and various other tests).

After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings of Japan]], many scientists at Los Alamos rebelled against the notion of creating a weapon thousands of times more powerful than the first atomic bombs. For the scientists the question was in part technical—the weapon design was still quite uncertain and unworkable—and in part moral: such a weapon, they argued, could only be used against large civilian populations, and could thus only be used as a weapon of genocide. Many scientists, such as Teller's colleague [[Hans Bethe]] (who had discovered [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], the nuclear fusion which takes place in the [[star]]s), urged that the United States should not develop such weapons and set an example towards the Soviet Union. Promoters of the weapon, including Teller and Berkeley physicists [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], argued that such a development was inevitable, and to deny such protection to the people of the United States—especially when the Soviet Union was likely to create such a weapon themselves—was itself an immoral and unwise act. Still others, such as Oppenheimer, simply thought that the existing stockpile of fissile material was better spent in attempting to develop a large arsenal of tactical atomic weapons rather than potentially squandered on the development of a few massive "Supers". &lt;!--[any page no. (i.e. more narrower than 267-347)? &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;(Galison and  Bernstein 1989)&lt;/span&gt;--&gt;

When the Soviet Union exploded their own atomic bomb (dubbed "[[Joe 1]]" by the U.S.) in 1949, it caught Western analysts off guard, and in early 1950 President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered a program to develop a hydrogen bomb. Many scientists returned to Los Alamos to work on the "Super" program, but the initial attempts still seemed highly unworkable. In the "classical Super", it was thought that the ''heat'' alone from the fission bomb would be used to ignite the fusion material, but this proved to be impossible. For a while, many scientists thought (and many hoped) that the weapon itself would be impossible to construct.

}}
The exact history of the Teller–Ulam breakthrough is not completely known, due in part to numerous conflicting personal accounts and continued classification of documents which would reveal which was closer to the truth. Previous models of the "Super" had apparently placed the fusion fuel either surrounding the fission "trigger" (in a spherical formation) or at the heart of it (similar to a "boosted" weapon) in the hopes that the closer the fuel was to the fission explosion, the higher the chance it would ignite the fusion fuel by the sheer force of the heat generated.

In 1951, after still many years of fruitless labor on the "Super", a breakthrough idea from the Polish émigré mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]] was seized upon by Teller and developed into the first workable design for a megaton-range hydrogen bomb.  This concept, now called "staged implosion" was first proposed in a classified scientific paper,  ''On Heterocatalytic Detonations I. Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors''&lt;ref&gt;The term "heterocatalytic" was Teller and Ulam's jargon for their new idea; using an atomic explosion to ignite a secondary explosion in a mass of fuel located ''outside'' the initiating bomb.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teller"&gt;{{cite journal

This is the original classified paper by Teller and Ulam proposing staged implosion. This declassified version is heavily redacted, leaving only a few paragraphs.&lt;/ref&gt; by Teller and Ulam on March 9, 1951. The exact amount of contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the "[[Teller–Ulam design]]" is not definitively known in the public domain—the degree of credit assigned to Teller by his contemporaries is almost exactly commensurate with how well they thought of Teller in general. In an interview with ''[[Scientific American]]'' from 1999, Teller told the reporter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I contributed; Ulam did not. I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt way. Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach. He came to me with a part of an idea which I already had worked out and difficulty getting people to listen to. He was willing to sign a paper. When it then came to defending that paper and really putting work into it, he refused. He said, "I don't believe in it."&lt;ref&gt;*Gary Stix, "Infamy and honor at the Atomic Café: Edward Teller has no regrets about his contentious career," ''[[Scientific American]]'' (October 1999): p.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The long pipes would receive the first bits of radiation from the ''primary'' and ''secondary'' ("Teller light") just before the device fully detonated.]]

The issue is controversial. Bethe in his “Memorandum on the History of the Thermonuclear Program” (1952) cited Teller as the discoverer of an “entirely new approach to thermonuclear reactions”, which “was a matter of inspiration” and was “therefore, unpredictable” and “largely accidental.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bethe, Hans | title=Memorandum on the History of the Thermonuclear Program |year=1952 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=2007-12-15 |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm |authorlink=Hans Bethe}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Oppenheimer hearing, in 1954, Bethe spoke of Teller’s “stroke of genius” in the invention of the H-bomb.&lt;ref name="testimony"&gt;
{{cite web |author=Bethe, Hans |title=Testimony in the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer |year=1954 | publisher=Atomic Archive |accessdate=2006-11-10 |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Oppenheimer/OppyTrial2.shtml | authorlink=Hans Bethe}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And finally in 1997 Bethe stated that “the crucial invention was made in 1951, by Teller.” &lt;ref&gt;* H.A. Bethe, " J. Robert Oppenheimer 1904-1967," ''National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Biographical Memoirs'' (1997, vol. 71, pp. 175–218; on 197)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as [[J. Carson Mark]]) have claimed that Teller would have never gotten any closer without the idea of Ulam. The nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] was clear about assigning credit for the basic staging and compression ideas to Ulam, while giving Teller the credit for recognizing the critical role of radiation as opposed to hydrodynamic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|2012|pp=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teller became known in the press as the "father of the hydrogen bomb", a title which he did not seek to discourage. Many of Teller's colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled "The Work of Many People," which appeared in ''Science'' magazine in February 1955, emphasizing that he was not alone in the weapon's development (he would later write in his memoirs that he had told a "white lie" in the 1955 article, and would imply that he should receive full credit for the weapon's invention).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/phisci/Newsletters/newslet_52.html "Edward Teller's Memoirs: a book review by S. Uchii"], ''PHS Newsletter'' (Philosophy and History of Science, [[Kyoto University]]), no. 52, July 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Bethe, who also participated in the hydrogen bomb project, once drolly said, "For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife."&lt;ref&gt;Schweber, S.S. ''In the shadow of the bomb: Bethe, Oppenheimer, and the moral responsibility of the scientist'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000). {{ISBN|0-691-04989-0}}; p. 166)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castle Bravo Blast.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The dry-fuel device detonated in the "[[Castle Bravo]]" shot demonstrated that the Teller–Ulam design could be made deployable, but also that the final fission stage created large amounts of [[nuclear fallout]].]]

The Teller–Ulam breakthrough—the details of which are still classified—was apparently the separation of the fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the radiation produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel before igniting it. Some sources have suggested that Ulam initially proposed compressing the ''secondary'' through the [[shock waves]] generated by the ''primary'', and that it was Teller who then realized that the [[radiation]] from the ''primary'' would be able to accomplish the job (hence, "[[radiation implosion]]"). But compression alone would not have been enough and the other crucial idea—staging the bomb by separating the ''primary'' and ''secondary''—seems to have been exclusively contributed by Ulam. The elegance of the design impressed many scientists, to the point that some who previously wondered if it were feasible suddenly believed it was inevitable, and that it would be created by both the USA and USSR. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea "technically sweet". The "George" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]] in 1951 tested the basic concept for the first time on a very small scale (and the next shot in the series, "Item", was the first [[boosted fission weapon]]), raising expectations to a near certainty that the concept would work.

On November 1, 1952, the Teller–Ulam configuration was tested in the "[[Ivy Mike]]" shot at an island in the [[Enewetak]] atoll, with a yield of 10.4 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] (over 450 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki during World War II). The device, dubbed the ''Sausage'', used an extra-large fission bomb as a "trigger" and liquid [[deuterium]]—kept in its liquid state by 20 tons of [[cryogenic]] equipment—as its fusion fuel, and weighed around 80 tons altogether. Though an initial press blackout was attempted, it was soon announced that the U.S. had detonated a megaton-range hydrogen bomb.

[[File:Castle Romeo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Like the Bravo test, [[Castle Romeo]] "[[Castle Bravo#High yield cause|ran away]]," producing a much higher yield than originally estimated (11 megatons instead of 4), making it the third largest test ever conducted by the US. The Romeo "shrimp" device derived its [[Lithium hydride|lithium deuteride]] from natural instead of "enriched" [[lithium]]]]

The elaborate refrigeration plant necessary to keep its fusion fuel in a liquid state meant that the "Ivy Mike" device was too heavy and too complex to be of practical use. The first ''deployable'' Teller–Ulam weapon in the U.S. would not be developed until 1954, when the liquid [[deuterium]] fuel of the "Ivy Mike" device would be replaced with a dry fuel of lithium deuteride and tested in the "[[Castle Bravo]]" shot (the device was code-named the ''Shrimp''). The dry lithium mixture performed much better than it was expected to, and the "Castle Bravo" device that was detonated in 1954 had a yield two and a half times greater than expected (at 15 Mt, it was also the most powerful bomb ever detonated by the United States). Because much of the yield came from the final fission stage of its uranium 238 tamper,&lt;ref name="LIFE 1955"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Why the H-Bomb Is Now Called the 3-F |journal=LIFE |date=5 Dec 1955 |pages=54–55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;pg=PA54&amp;redir_esc=y#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it generated much [[nuclear fallout]], which caused one of the worst nuclear accidents in U.S. history when unforeseen weather patterns blew it over populated areas of the atoll and Japanese fishermen on board the ''[[Daigo Fukuryu Maru]]''.

After an initial period focused on making multi-megaton hydrogen bombs, efforts in the United States shifted towards developing miniaturized Teller–Ulam weapons which could outfit [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile]]s and [[Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile]]s. The last major design breakthrough in this respect was accomplished by the mid-1970s, when versions of the Teller–Ulam design were created which could fit on the end of a small [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRVed]] missile.

===Soviet research===
In the [[Soviet Union]], the scientists working on their own [[Soviet atomic bomb project|hydrogen bomb project]] also ran into difficulties in developing a megaton-range fusion weapon. Because [[Klaus Fuchs]] had only been at Los Alamos at a very early stage of the hydrogen bomb design (before the Teller–Ulam configuration had been completed), none of his espionage information was of much use, and the Soviet physicists working on the project had to develop their weapon independently.

The first Soviet fusion design, developed by [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] in 1949 (before the Soviets had a working fission bomb), was dubbed the ''Sloika'', after a Russian layered puff pastry, and was not of the Teller–Ulam configuration, but rather used alternating layers of fissile material and [[lithium deuteride]] fusion fuel spiked with [[tritium]] (this was later dubbed Sakharov's "First Idea"). Though nuclear fusion was technically achieved, it did not have the scaling property of a "staged" weapon, and their first "hydrogen bomb" test, "[[Joe 4]]" is no longer considered to be a "true" hydrogen bomb, and is rather considered a hybrid fission/fusion device more similar to a large [[boosted fission weapon]] than a Teller–Ulam weapon (though using an order of magnitude more fusion fuel than a boosted weapon). Detonated in 1953 with a yield equivalent to 400 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]] (only 15%–20% from fusion), the ''Sloika'' device did, however, have the advantage of being a weapon which could actually be delivered to a military target, unlike the "Ivy Mike" device, though it was never widely deployed. Teller had proposed a similar design as early as 1946, dubbed the "Alarm Clock" (meant to "wake up" research into the "Super"), though it was calculated to be ultimately not worth the effort and no prototype was ever developed or tested.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rsd 37 nuclear test.JPG|right|thumb|222px|Sakharov's "Third Idea", the Soviet version of the Teller–Ulam configuration, was first tested in "[[RDS-37]]" on November 1955.]] --&gt;
Attempts to use a ''Sloika'' design to achieve megaton-range results proved unfeasible in the USSR as it had in the calculations done in the USA (though its value as a practical weapon — being 20 times more powerful than their first fission bomb — should not be underestimated), and the Soviet physicists calculated that at best the design might yield a single megaton of energy if pushed to its limits. After the U.S. tested the "Ivy Mike" device in 1952, proving that a multimegaton bomb could be created, the Soviets searched for an additional design, while continuing to work on improving the ''Sloika'' (the "First Idea"). The "Second Idea", as Sakharov referred to it in his memoirs, was a previous proposal by Ginzburg in November 1948 to use lithium deuteride in the bomb, which would, in the course of being bombarded by neutrons, produce [[tritium]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;*David Holloway, ''Stalin and the bomb: The Soviet Union and atomic energy, 1939–1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994). {{ISBN|0-300-06056-4}}; p. 299 and 314, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1953, physicist [[Viktor Davidenko]] achieved the first breakthrough, that of keeping the ''primary'' and ''secondary'' parts of the bombs in separate pieces ("staging"). The next breakthrough was discovered and developed by Sakharov and [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Yakov Zeldovich]], that of using the [[X-ray]]s from the fission bomb to compress the ''secondary'' before fusion ("radiation implosion"), in the spring of 1954. Sakharov's "Third Idea", as the Teller–Ulam design was known in the USSR, was tested in the shot "[[RDS-37]]" in November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 Mt.

If the Russians had been able to analyze the fallout data from either the "Ivy Mike" or "Castle Bravo" tests, they would have potentially been able to discern that the fission ''primary'' was being kept separate from the fusion ''secondary'', a key part of the Teller–Ulam device, and potentially that the fusion fuel had been subjected to high amounts of compression before detonation. &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;(De Geer 1991)&lt;/span&gt; One of the key Soviet bomb designers, [[Julii Borisovich Khariton|Yuli Khariton]], later said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At that time, Soviet research was not organized on a sufficiently high level, and useful results were not obtained, although radiochemical analyses of samples of fallout could have provided some useful information about the materials used to produce the explosion. The relationship between certain short-lived isotopes formed in the course of thermonuclear reactions could have made it possible to judge the degree of compression of the thermonuclear fuel, but knowing the degree of compression would not have allowed Soviet scientists to conclude exactly how the exploded device had been made, and it would not have revealed its design.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuli Khariton]] and Yuri Smirnov, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qQwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=1 The Khariton version]" ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' Vol. 49, No. 4 (May 1993): p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Tsar01.jpg|right|229px|thumb|Fireball of the [[Tsar Bomba]] (RDS-220), the largest weapon ever detonated (1961). Dropped from over 10 km and detonated at 4 km high, its [[Nuclear fireball|fireball]] would have touched the ground were it not for the shock wave from the explosion reflecting off the ground and striking the bottom of the fireball,&lt;ref name="nuclearweaponarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html|title=The Tsar Bomba ("King of Bombs")|quote=from fireball radius scaling laws, one would expect the fireball to reach down and engulf the ground ...

The RDS-220 test demonstrated how "staging" could be used to develop arbitrarily powerful weapons.]]
Sakharov stated in his memoirs that though he and Davidenko had fallout dust in cardboard boxes several days after the "Mike" test with the hope of analyzing it for information, a chemist at [[All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics|Arzamas-16]] (the Soviet weapons laboratory) had mistakenly poured the concentrate down the drain before it could be analyzed. Only in the fall of 1952 did the Soviet Union set up an organized system for monitoring fallout data.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; Nonetheless, the ''memoirs''{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} also say that the yield from one of the American tests, which became an international incident involving Japan, told Sakharov that the US design was much better than theirs, and he decided that they must have exploded a separate fission bomb and somehow used its energy to compress the lithium deuteride. But how, he asked himself, can an explosion to one side be used to compress the ball of fusion fuel within 5% of symmetry? Then it hit him! Focus the X-rays!{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The Soviets demonstrated the power of the "staging" concept in October 1961 when they detonated the massive and unwieldy ''[[Tsar Bomba]]'', a 50 Mt hydrogen bomb which derived almost 97% of its energy from fusion rather than fission—its uranium tamper was replaced with one of lead shortly before firing, in an effort to prevent excessive nuclear fallout. Had it been fired in its "full" form, it would have yielded at around 100 Mt. The weapon was technically deployable (it was tested by dropping it from a specially modified bomber), but militarily impractical, and was developed and tested primarily as a show of Soviet strength. It was the largest nuclear weapon developed and tested by any country.

==Other countries==

===United Kingdom===

The details of the development of the Teller–Ulam design in other countries are less well known. In any event, United Kingdom had initial difficulty in its development of it, failing in its first attempt in May 1957 (its "[[Operation Grapple|Grapple I]]" test failed to ignite as planned, though much of its energy did come from fusion in its secondary), though succeeded in its second attempt in its November 1957 "[[Operation Grapple|Grapple X]]" test (which yielded 1.8 Mt). The British development of the Teller–Ulam design was apparently independent, though they were allowed to share in some U.S. fallout data which may have been useful to them. After their successful detonation of a megaton-range device (and thus their practical understanding of the Teller–Ulam design "secret"), the United States agreed to exchange some of its nuclear designs with Great Britain, leading to the [[1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement]].

===China===

The People's Republic of China detonated its first device using a Teller–Ulam design June 1967 ("[[Test No. 6]]"), a mere 32 months after detonating its first fission weapon (the shortest fission-to-fusion development yet known), with a yield of 3.3 Mt. Little is known about the Chinese thermonuclear program, however.

===France===

Very little is known about the French development of the Teller–Ulam design beyond the fact that they detonated a 2.6 Mt device in the "[[Canopus (nuclear test)|Canopus]]" test in August 1968.

===India===

In 1998, India claimed to detonate a "hydrogen bomb" in its [[Operation Shakti]] tests ("[[Operation Shakti#Shakti I|Shakti I]]", specifically), though [[seismograph]]ic readings have led many non-Indian experts to conclude that this is unlikely, or at least it was unlikely to have been a success as claimed, because of its low yield (claimed to be around 45 kt, though outside experts estimate it at around 30 kt, both extremely low for a successful thermonuclear detonation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaRealYields.html "What Are the Real Yields of India's Test?"], ''Nuclear Weapon Archive'', November 2001&lt;/ref&gt; However even low-yield tests can have a bearing on thermonuclear capability, as they can provide information on the behavior of ''primaries'' without the full ignition of ''secondaries''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html "India's Nuclear Weapons Program: Operation Shakti, 1998], ''Nuclear Weapon Archive'', March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===

North Korea claimed to have tested its miniaturised thermonuclear bomb on 6 January 2016. North Korea's first three nuclear tests (2006, 2009 and 2013) were relatively low yield and do not appear to have been of a thermonuclear weapon design. In 2013, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of Korea)|South Korean Defense Ministry]] has speculated that North Korea may be trying to develop a "hydrogen bomb" and such a device may be North Korea's next weapons test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/573302.html|title=North Korea could be developing a hydrogen bomb|author=Kim Kyu-won|publisher=The Hankyoreh|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/02/116_130000.html|title=North Korea may detonate H-bomb|author1=Kang Seung-woo |author2=Chung Min-uck |publisher=Korea Times|date=February 4, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/328038-north-korea-earthquake-nuclear/|title=North Korea claims fully successful hydrogen bomb test |publisher=Russia Today|date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though only a magnitude 5.1 seismic event was detected at the time of the test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10004bnm|title=M5.1 - 21km ENE of Sungjibaegam, North Korea|publisher=USGS|date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar magnitude to the 2013 test of a 6-9&amp;nbsp;kt atomic bomb.

==Public knowledge==
[[File:W80 nuclear warhead.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Photographs of warhead casings, such as this one of the [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]] nuclear warhead, allow for some speculation as to the relative size and shapes of the ''primaries'' and ''secondaries'' in U.S. thermonuclear weapons.]]

The Teller–Ulam design was for many years considered one of the top nuclear secrets, and even today it is not discussed in any detail by official publications with origins "behind the fence" of [[Classified Information|classification]]. [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) policy has been, and continues to be, that they do not acknowledge when "leaks" occur, because doing such would acknowledge the accuracy of the supposed leaked information. Aside from images of the warhead casing (but never of the "[[physics package]]" itself), most information in the public domain about this design is regulated to a few terse statements by the DOE and the work of a few individual investigators.

Below is a short discussion of the events which led to the formation of these "public" models of the Teller–Ulam design, with some discussions as to their differences and disagreements with those principles outlined above.

=== Early knowledge ===
The general principles of the "classical Super" design were public knowledge even before thermonuclear weapons were first tested. After President Truman ordered the crash program to develop the H-bomb in January 1950 the ''Boston Daily Globe'' published a cutaway description of a hypothetical H-bomb with the caption ''Artist's conception of how H-bomb might work using atomic bomb as a mere "trigger" to generate enough heat to set up the H-bomb's "thermonuclear fusion" process.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Hail Truman H-Bomb Order |journal=Boston Daily Globe |page=1 |date=February 1, 1950 |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1950-02-01-Boston-Daily-Globe-Hail-Truman-H-bomb-Order.jpg }} – reprinted in {{Cite web |title=What If Truman Hadn’t Ordered the H-bomb Crash Program? |author=Alex Wellerstein |date=June 18, 2012 |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/06/18/what-if-truman-didnt-order-h-bomb-crash-program/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that a large proportion of the yield of a thermonuclear device stems from the fission of a uranium 238 tamper (fission-fusion-fission principle) was revealed when the [[Castle Bravo]] test "ran away," producing a much higher yield than originally estimated and creating large amounts of nuclear fallout.&lt;ref name="LIFE 1955" /&gt;

===DOE statements===

In 1972, the DOE declassified a statement that "The fact that in thermonuclear (TN) weapons, a fission 'primary' is used to trigger a TN reaction in thermonuclear fuel referred to as a 'secondary'", and in 1979 added: "The fact that, in thermonuclear weapons, radiation from a fission explosive can be contained and used to transfer energy to compress and ignite a physically separate component containing thermonuclear fuel." To this latter sentence they specified that "''Any elaboration of this statement will be classified.''" &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;(emphasis in original)&lt;/span&gt; The only statement which may pertain to the ''sparkplug'' was declassified in 1991, "Fact that fissile and/or fissionable materials are present in some secondaries, material unidentified, location unspecified, use unspecified, and weapons undesignated." In 1998, the DOE declassified the statement that "The fact that materials may be present in channels and the term 'channel filler,' with no elaboration", which may refer to the polystyrene foam (or an analogous substance). &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;(DOE 2001, sect. V.C.)&lt;/span&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

Whether these statements vindicate some or all of the models presented above is up for interpretation, and official U.S. government releases about the technical details of nuclear weapons have been purposely equivocating in the past (e.g. [[Smyth Report]]). Other information, such as the types of fuel used in some of the early weapons, has been declassified, though precise technical information has not been.

===''The Progressive'' case===
{{main|United States v. The Progressive}}

Most of the current ideas of the Teller–Ulam design{{Clarify|date=January 2013}} came into public awareness after the DOE attempted to [[prior restraint|censor]] a magazine article by U.S. anti-weapons activist [[Howard Morland]] in 1979 on the "secret of the hydrogen bomb". In 1978, Morland had decided that discovering and exposing this "last remaining secret" would focus attention onto the [[arms race]] and allow citizens to feel empowered to question official statements on the importance of nuclear weapons and nuclear secrecy. Most of Morland's ideas about how the weapon worked were compiled from highly accessible sources—the drawings which most inspired his approach came from the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''. Morland also interviewed (often informally) many former [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] scientists (including Teller and Ulam, though neither gave him any useful information), and used a variety of interpersonal strategies to encourage informational responses from them (i.e., asking questions such as "Do they still use sparkplugs?" even if he wasn't aware what the latter term specifically referred to). &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;(Morland 1981)&lt;/span&gt;

Morland eventually concluded that the "secret" was that the ''primary'' and ''secondary'' were kept separate and that [[radiation pressure]] from the ''primary'' compressed the ''secondary'' before igniting it. When an early draft of the article, to be published in ''[[The Progressive]]'' magazine, was sent to the DOE after falling into the hands of a professor who was opposed to Morland's goal, the DOE requested that the article not be published, and pressed for a temporary injunction. After a short court hearing in which the DOE argued that Morland's information was (1). likely derived from classified sources, 2. if not derived from classified sources, itself counted as "secret" information under the "[[born secret]]" clause of the 1954 [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1954|Atomic Energy Act]], and (3). dangerous and would encourage [[nuclear proliferation]], Morland and his lawyers disagreed on all points, but the injunction was granted, as the judge in the case thought that it was safer to grant the injunction and allow Morland, et al., to appeal,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} which they did in ''[[United States v. The Progressive, et al.]]'' (1979).

Through a variety of more complicated circumstances,{{Clarify|date=January 2013}} the DOE case began to wane, as it became clear that some of the data they were attempting to claim as "secret" had been published in a students' encyclopedia a few years earlier. After another H-bomb speculator, [[Chuck Hansen]], had his own ideas about the "secret" (quite different from Morland's) published in a Wisconsin newspaper, the DOE claimed ''The Progressive'' case was moot, dropped their suit and allowed the magazine to publish, which it did in November 1979. Morland had by then, however, changed his opinion of how the bomb worked, suggesting that a foam medium (the polystyrene) rather than radiation pressure was used to compress the ''secondary'', and that in the ''secondary'' was a ''sparkplug'' of fissile material as well. He published these changes, based in part on the proceedings of the appeals trial, as a short errata in ''The Progressive'' a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://progressive.org/images/pdf/1179.pdf |title= "The H-Bomb Secret: How we got it and why we're telling it" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183818/http://www.progressive.org/images/pdf/1179.pdf |archivedate= September 27, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.48&amp;nbsp;MB)}} , ''[[The Progressive]]'', vol. 43, no. 11, November 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Morland published a book, ''The secret that exploded'', about his experience, describing in detail the train of thought which led him to his conclusions about the "secret".

Because the DOE sought to censor Morland's work—one of the few times they violated their usual approach of not acknowledging "secret" material which had been released—it is interpreted as being at least partially correct, though to what degree it lacks information or has incorrect information is not known with any great confidence. The difficulty which a number of nations had in developing the Teller–Ulam design (even when they understood the design, such as with the United Kingdom) makes it somewhat unlikely that this simple information alone is what provides the ability to manufacture thermonuclear weapons.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Nevertheless, the ideas put forward by Morland in 1979 have been the basis for all current speculation on the Teller–Ulam design.

'''Liquid oxygen'''—abbreviated '''LOx''', '''LOX''' or '''Lox''' in the [[aerospace]], [[submarine]] and [[gas]] industries—is one of the physical forms of [[Chemical element|elemental]] [[oxygen]].

Because of its cryogenic nature, liquid oxygen can cause the materials it touches to become extremely brittle. Liquid oxygen is also a very powerful oxidizing agent: organic materials will burn rapidly and energetically in liquid oxygen. Further, if [[Oxyliquit|soaked in liquid oxygen]], some materials such as coal briquettes, [[carbon black]], etc., can detonate unpredictably from sources of ignition such as flames, sparks or impact from light blows. [[Petrochemical]]s, including [[asphalt]], often exhibit this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

[[Liquid nitrogen]] has a lower boiling point at −196&amp;nbsp;°C (77 K) than oxygen's −183&amp;nbsp;°C (90 K), and vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air: when most of the nitrogen has evaporated from such a vessel there is a risk that liquid oxygen remaining can react violently with organic material. Conversely, liquid nitrogen or [[liquid air]] can be oxygen-enriched by letting it stand in open air; atmospheric oxygen dissolves in it, while nitrogen evaporates preferentially.

In commerce, liquid oxygen is classified as an [[industrial gas]] and is widely used for industrial and medical purposes. Liquid oxygen is obtained from the [[oxygen]] found naturally in [[air]] by [[fractional distillation]] in a [[Air separation|cryogenic air separation plant]].

Air forces have long recognized the strategic importance of liquid oxygen, both as an oxidizer and as a supply of gaseous oxygen for breathing in hospitals and high-altitude aircraft flights. In 1985 the USAF started a program of building its own oxygen-generation facilities at all major consumption bases.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Mark.

Liquid oxygen was used in the [[Robert_H._Goddard#First_flight|very first liquid fueled rocket]]. The [[World War II]]  [[V-2 rocket|V2]] missile also used liquid oxygen under the name ''A-Stoff'' and ''Sauerstoff''. In the 1950's, during the [[Cold War]] both the United States' [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] and [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]] rockets, and the [[USSR|Soviet]] [[R-7 Semyorka]] used liquid oxygen. Later, in the 1960's &amp; 70's, the ascent stages of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Apollo Saturn rockets]], and the [[Space Shuttle main engines]] used liquid oxygen.

In 2018, many rockets use liquid oxygen: &lt;!-- excluding retiring rockets --&gt;

==History==
*By 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist. Six gases, however, resisted every attempt at liquefaction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceclarified.com/Co-Di/Cryogenics.html Cryogenics]. Scienceclarified.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and were known at the time as "permanent gases". They were oxygen, [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitric oxide]].
*In 1877, [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] in France and [[Raoul Pictet]] in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air.
*The first measurable quantity of liquid oxygen was produced by Polish professors [[Zygmunt Wróblewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]] ([[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków) on April 5, 1883.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16143">The '''London Electrical Society''' was established in 1837 to enable amateur electricians to meet and share their interests in “experimental investigation of Electrical Science in all its various branches”.&lt;ref name=Annals&gt;{{cite book  | last = Sturgeon | first = William | title = The Annals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Chemistry| publisher =  Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper| series =  | volume = 1 | edition =  | date = 1837 | location =  London| pages =  416| language =  | url = | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it initially flourished the society soon showed weaknesses in its organisation and ways of working. After a period of considerable financial difficulty it closed in 1845.

==Rise and fall==
The London Electrical Society&lt;ref&gt;Initially called “The Electrical Society of London”&lt;/ref&gt; was founded at a meeting held on 16 May 1837 at Edward M Clarke’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54036?docPos=7 | title =  Clarke, Edward Marmaduke (c.1806–1859), scientific instrument maker | last =  | first =  | date =  | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press| access-date = 3 January 2017  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Laboratory of Science” in Lowther Arcade, near the Strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://londonstreetviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/edward-clarke | title = Edward Clarke, optician and magnetician | last =  | first =  | date =  | website = London Street Views | publisher = Baldwin Hamey | access-date = 3 January 2017  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the Society had arisen from discussions during a course of lectures on electricity delivered by [[William Sturgeon]] at the same venue. He was assisted in establishing the Society by operative chemist William Leithead;  [[John Peter Gassiot]], an amateur scientist with a particular interest in electricity; and [[Charles Vincent Walker]], an electrical engineer.

The London Electrical Society’s aim was to provide a forum for amateur scientists and to foster their interest in the practical applications of electricity. It served to strengthen the informal links which many of the experimenters had already made. In “The Uses of Experiment: Studies in the Natural Sciences” Secord&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Secord |first=James A. |editor1-last= Gooding |editor1-first= David |editor2-last= Pinch |editor2-first= Trevor |editor3-last= Schaffer |editor3-first= Simon | title= The Uses of Experiment: Studies in the Natural Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date= 1989 |pages=362 |chapter= Extraordinary Experiment: Electricity and the Creation of Life in Victorian England |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that:
&lt;blockquote class="templatequote"&gt;
The bulk of its membership were 'amateur experimentalists', as founder and first president Sturgeon admitted. Typical of the group were the instrument-maker Edward M. Clarke, the young Manchester electrician James Prescott Joule, and William Leithead, employed by the Gallery as a demonstrator. Others, like Walter Hawkins, William G Lettsom, John Peter Gassiot and [Andrew] Crosse were either successful men business or independently wealthy. Conspicuously absent were the real controlling interests in the London scientific world, men like [[John Herschel]], [[William Robert Grove|William Grove]] and [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Membership was made up of resident (living within 20 miles of London) and non-resident participants, with annual fees set at two guineas and one guinea respectively.&lt;ref name=Annals /&gt; Non-resident members were elsewhere in Great Britain (e.g. Bath and Shrewsbury), or abroad (e.g. Amsterdam and Marseille). At first, members styled themselves Mem. Elec. Soc., but later they used the post-nominal MES.

In the early days the Society met in Clarke’s Laboratory of Science, but at the first annual general meeting, on 7 October 1837 (with John P Gassiot, Treasurer, in the chair), it was announced that future meetings would be held at the nearby Adelaide Gallery on the Strand, to accommodate the growing membership. The gallery’s proprietors generously made their electrical apparatus freely available for the use of the Society’s members.

The meetings, initially held on the first and third Saturdays of the month at 7:00pm, involved the reading and discussion of experimental papers by members and their guests. Roughly half of the first 120 papers had an emphasis on technology, typically describing an improvement in a technique, or of a piece of apparatus. An example is Charles V Walker’s “An Account of Experiments with a ‘Constant Voltaic Battery’” read in October 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Walker| first = Charles V.| title = The Transactions, and the Proceedings of the London Electrical Society, from 1837 to 1840  | publisher = Smith, Elder &amp; Co. | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | date = 1841| location = London | pages = 57–65 | language =  | url =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described the results of assembling and testing a 160-cell battery of zinc and copper electrodes immersed in saturated copper sulphate solution. Other papers were of a more theoretical nature, such as Thomas Pollock’s “On the Connection between the Atomic Arrangement and the Conducting power of Bodies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pollock | first = Thomas | title = The Transactions, and the Proceedings of the London Electrical Society, from 1837 to 1840  | publisher = Smith, Elder &amp; Co. | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | date = 1841| location = London | pages = 145–147 | language =  | url =  | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Electrical Society had decided early on that it would not prepare standing Rules and Regulations or formally elect Officers until the membership had reached 50. At the October AGM that threshold was raised to 100 resident members, a number which it never reached. Nonetheless, the Society flourished in the early days:  membership grew and papers were published.

Then signs began to appear that all was not well. There was a gap of about a year in which meetings did not take place.  Membership fell, and the Society’s debts began to grow. This was made worse by the decision to publish many extra copies of the Proceedings and distribute them widely to other organisations in the hope of attracting new members. These factors, and internal rows over ownership of experimental findings, and the departure of Sturgeon for Manchester, all contributed to the Society’s downfall. The story is more fully explained by Morus in “Currents from the Underworld".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Morus  | first = Iwan Rhys| author-link = | title = Currents from the Underworld: Electricity and the Technology of Display in Early Victorian England | journal = Isis | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–69  | date = 1993 | jstor = 235553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known how many of the total were all members at the same time, although the number listed here is consistent with Morus's observation that "In 1839 the membership was no greater than eighty of whom only about half were resident members. Reminiscing almost half a century later, Walker recalled that membership had peaked at seventy-six."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Morus | first = Iwan Rhys | title = Frankenstein's Children: electricity, exhibition, and experiment in early-nineteenth-century London | publisher =  Princeton University Press | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | date = 1998 | location =  Princeton| pages =  120| language =  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 9780691605272 | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12153">'''Mandatory renewable energy targets''' are part of government legislated schemes which require [[electricity]] retailers to source specific proportions of total electricity sales from [[renewable energy]] sources according to a fixed time frame. The purpose of these schemes is to promote renewable energy and reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s. If this results in an additional cost of electricity, the additional cost is distributed across most customers by increases in other tariffs. The cost of this measure is therefore not funded by government budgets, except for costs of establishing and monitoring the scheme and any audit and enforcement actions. As the cost of renewable energy has become cheaper than other sources, meeting and exceeding a renewable energy target will also reduce the cost of electricity to consumers.

At least 67 countries have [[renewable energy policy]] targets of some type. In Europe, 28 [[European Union]] members states and 8 [[Energy Community]] Contracting Parties have legally binding renewable energy targets. The EU baseline target is 20% by 2020, while the United States also has a national RET of 20%. Similarly, Canada has 9 provincial RETs but no national target. Targets are typically for shares of electricity production, but some are defined as by primary energy supply, installed capacity, or otherwise. While some targets are based on 2010-2012 data, many are now for 2020, which ties in with the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] suggested [[greenhouse gas emission]] cuts of 25 to 40% by Annex I countries by 2020, although some are for 2025.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf at page 22 retrieved 150508&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[Image:Alternative Energies.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]], [[Sun]], and [[biomass]] are three renewable energy sources]]
Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to [[Energy security and renewable technology|world energy security]], reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, and provide opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2006/renewable_factsheet.pdf ''Renewables in global energy supply: An IEA facts sheet'' (PDF)] OECD, 34 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency]] has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies, reaching back over 100 years:

*''First-generation technologies'' emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] [[combustion]], [[geothermal power]] and heat.  These technologies are quite widely used.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Second-generation technologies'' include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]], and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the oil crises  ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]) of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Third-generation technologies'' are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

First-generation technologies are well established. However, second-generation technologies and third-generation technologies  depend on further promotion by the public sector.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; The introduction of mandatory renewable energy targets is one important way in which governments can encourage the wider use of renewables.

Renewable energy targets exist in at least 66 countries around the world, including the 27 European Union countries, 29 U.S. states, and 9 Canadian provinces.  Most targets are for shares of electricity production, primary energy, and/or final energy for a future year.  Most targets aim for the 2010–2012 timeframe, although an increasing number of targets aim for 2020, and there is now an EU-wide target of 20% of final energy by 2020, and a Chinese target of 15% of primary energy by 2020.&lt;ref name=seven&gt;[[REN21]] (2008).

==Targets by country==

===Australia===
{{See also|Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets}}
In 2001, the federal government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target of 9,500 GWh of new generation, with the scheme running until at least 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orer.gov.au/publications/mret-overview.html Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator: "Mandatory Renewable Energy Target"] Feb 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an increase of new renewable electricity generation of about 4% of Australia's total electricity generation and a doubling of renewable generation from 1997 levels. Australia's renewable energy target does not cover heating or transport energy like Europe's or China's, Australia's target is therefore equivalent of approximately 5% of all energy from renewable sources.

An Expanded Renewable Energy Target was passed on 20 August 2009, to ensure that renewable energy obtains a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. To ensure this, the Labor government committed that the MRET will increase from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. The scheme was to continue until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026000000/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2020, the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme and improved efficiencies from innovation and manufacture was expected to allow the MRET to be phased out by 2030.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The target was criticised as unambitious and ineffective in reducing Australia's fossil fuel dependency, as it only applied to generated electricity, but not to the 77% of energy production exported, nor to energy sources which are not used for electricity generation, such as the oil used in transportation. Thus 20% renewable energy in electricity generation would represent less than 2% of total energy production in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themonthly.com.au/renewable-energy-comment-guy-pearse-2988 Guy Pearse: ''Renewable Energy''], in [[The Monthly]], February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the 'expanded MRET' was split into two schemes: a Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) of 41,000 GWh for utility-scale renewable generators, and an uncapped Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme for small household and commercial-scale generators. Following the 2014 Warburton Review initiated by the [[Abbott Government]], and subsequent negotiations with the Labor Opposition, in June 2015 the LRET target was reduced to 33,000 GWh.&lt;ref&gt;''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/History-of-the-scheme|title=Renewable Energy Target - History of the scheme |website=www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au|date=30 November 2016|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{See also|Renewable portfolio standard}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}
As at July 2010, 30 US states and DC have established mandatory renewable energy targets, and a further 6 have voluntary targets.&lt;ref&gt;Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency, http://www.dsireusa.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has set a target for {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuel produced annually by 2022. Of that, {{convert|21|e9USgal|m3}} shall be advanced biofuels (derived from feedstock other than corn starch). Of the {{convert|21|e9USgal|m3}}, 16 billion shall come from cellulosic ethanol. The remaining {{convert|5|e9USgal|m3}} shall come from biomass-based diesel and other advanced biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, P.L. 110-140&lt;/ref&gt; For sources other than biofuels, The United States carries no mandatory renewable energy targets although they do support the growth of renewable energy industries with subsidies, feed-in tariffs, tax exemptions, and other financial support measures.&lt;ref&gt;Renewables 2007 Global Status Report, http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28639">'''Mechanical screening''', often just called '''screening''', is the practice of taking [[Granule (geology)|granulated]] [[ore]] material and separating it into multiple [[Ore grade|grade]]s by [[particle size]].

This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and [[mineral processing]], agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.

[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]

==General categories==
Screening fall under two general categories: dry screening and wet screening.  From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally the machines can be categorised into moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.

==Applications==
The mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications.  For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher.  Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with {{convert|0.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick shielding screening.  Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller.  Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range.

==Process==
[[File:Screener model of process.jpg|thumb|Model of Screening Process]]
A screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.

There are physical factors that makes screening practical.  For example, vibration, [[gravity|g force]], bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut.  [[Electrostatic force]]s can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.

As with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is.  Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.

In addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens.  Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.

Finally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.

==Physical principles==
*[[Vibration]] - either [[sinusoidal]] vibration or [[gyratory]] vibration.
**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.
**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.
*[[Gravity]] - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media.
*[[Density]] - The density of the material relates to material stratification.
*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.

==Screening terminology==

Like any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.
*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant ''g'' ([[g-force]]).
*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces
*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darbywiremesh.com/wire-mesh-glossary.html Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.
*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.
**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.
**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.
**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.
*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.
*Frequency - Measured in [[hertz]] (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).
*Gradation, grading - Also called "cut" or "cutting."  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm Soil Gradation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091535/http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ Pit &amp; Quarry - Lesson 7 – Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140310145342/http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ |date=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.
*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mesh -  The number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/woven-wire-mesh-wire-cloth-glossary.htm The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping is removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.

==Types of mechanical screening==

There are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.

*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html WS Tyler » F-Class&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919205532/http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html |date=2007-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth.

===Tumbler screening technique===
{{main|Tumbler screening technique}}

An improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821011917/http://almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |archivedate=2013-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circle-throw vibrating equipment===
{{main|Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment}}

[[Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment]] is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.

This type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.

Also this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.

===High frequency vibrating equipment===
{{main|High Frequency Vibrating Equipment}}
High frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3&amp;nbsp;mm) down to a +150 mesh.

These shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.

These shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.
[[File:Gyratory Screener.gif|thumb|Gyratory Screener]]

===Gyratory equipment===
{{main|Gyratory equipment}}

This type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.

The shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.

These types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.

These shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.

===Trommel screens===
{{main|Trommel screen}}

Trommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.

==Screen Media Attachment Systems==

There are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.

===Tensioned screen media===
Tensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned.  Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box.  When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 Crown curve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313004650/http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).

Commonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tensioned mesh sieves|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/tensioned-mesh-sieves.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular screen media===
Modular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schenckprocess.com/site/screenex/products/Polyurethane-Modular-Screening-Systems.html Panels Dimensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temaisenmann.com/%28S%28nztvbymhap5oxom5nrx0xv55%29A%28RTR6-qEDzgEkAAAANDk4OTk0MGItZGI4Zi00MWI5LThlNmEtZDM0ODcxZTI2NjdlINHvMedPqZ_pCwg2vcJqC7glRzw1%29%29/handbook/pdfs/WS-851.pdf ISEPREN WS 85  brochure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel Modular panels types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002019/http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&amp;hl=fr&amp;q=Screen+and+screen+element#hl=fr&amp;q=vibrating+screen+panel&amp;tbm=pts Google Patent - vibrating screen panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorwire.cc/en/products/flex-mat-3-modular Flex-Mat 3 Modular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Screen Media==
There are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular.

===Woven Wire Cloth ([[Mesh]])===
Woven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.

Today wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO 9044:1999 - Industrial woven wire cloth -- Technical requirements and tests|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28424|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glossary|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/glossary.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;a = \left ( \frac{25.4}{b} \right ) - c&lt;/math&gt;

where a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.

[[File:Woven wire mesh.png|alt=Woven wire mesh|thumb|2 mesh with an intermediate crimp]]
Other calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Woven wire mesh calculator|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/calculator.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their [[standard wire gauge]] (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.

Traditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ Haver &amp; Boeker history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001927/https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528134025833/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 1 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528227359157/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 2 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life.  Slotted opening woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okutanikanaami.co.jp/img/second/kanaami/toncap03-b.jpg Photo of a slotted opening woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html Weave Types (see type E for Flat Top)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002335/http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.

===Perforated &amp; Punch Plate===
On a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates&lt;ref&gt;[http://samscreen.com/product/replacement-punch-plate-screen/ Perforated Plate &amp; Punch Plate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aggregatesandminingtoday.com/improving-the-standard-grizzly-screen,2010-1,823,0,0,featured-story.aspx Grizzly Screen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.

===Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane)===
Synthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216225336/http://rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg |date=2014-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/6262/flex-mat-3-modular-locking-system-options-significantly-increase-open-area-without-costly-screen-box-modifications “7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-Cleaning Screen Media===
Self-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to [[vibration|vibrate]] between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meister-siebe.de/en/screens/wire-cloths/harp-screen-type-b.html “Self-Cleaning” woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires).  One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giron.fr/english/screen-mesh/Anti-clogging.htm Giron’s Anti-clogging products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/s1/4112/flex-mat-vibrating-wire-technology-celebrates-15th-anniversary Flex-Mat 15th anniversary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agg-net.com/news/major-wire-make-it-a-double Hook to hook vibration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggman.com/flex-mat%C2%AE-3-increases-throughput-of-spec-product-while-solving-blinding-pegging-and-clogging-problems/ "Flex-Mat® 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration [[frequency]] of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in [[hertz]]) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.

'''Michael J. Zucchet''' (born December 24, 1969) is an [[United States|American]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[politician]], a former member of the [[San Diego City Council]], and a former Deputy Mayor of San Diego. In 2005, he briefly served as the Acting Mayor of San Diego.

==Early life and career==
Zucchet earned a bachelor's degree in Business Economics and Environmental Studies from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and a master's degree in Environmental Economics and Policy from [[Duke University]].

He worked as a renewable energy economist with the Energy Information Administration of the [[United States Department of Energy]] in [[Washington, DC]], then returned to San Diego in 1996 to work as a City Council aide to councilmember Valerie Stallings. From 1998 through 2002, he served as the legislative and community affairs director for the San Diego City Fire Fighters.

Zucchet has also done work with the non-profit Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara while in college. He has served as president of the San Diego [[League of Conservation Voters]], vice-president of the Pacific Beach Town Council, been elected member of the Pacific Beach Community Planning Committee, and appointed member of the city's Select Committee on Government Efficiency and Fiscal Reform. He is a graduate of LEAD San Diego.

==San Diego City Council==
Michael Zucchet served as a San Diego city councilmember representing the city's Second District. He won the seat by defeating challenger [[Kevin Faulconer]] in the [[San Diego City Council elections, 2002|2002 election]]. In December 2014, Zucchet became Deputy Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hall |first1=Matthew T. |title=As trial looms, Zucchet prepares to take reins {{!}} The San Diego Union-Tribune |url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20050427/news_1n27zucchet.html |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |work=legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com |agency=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=April 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Deputy Mayor, Zucchet became acting mayor after [[Dick Murphy]] resigned July 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/sdcounty/article_91b0a113-bfb1-538d-9da6-d0f41f94db49.html|title=Zucchet to be named interim mayor as his trial continues|date=July 18, 2005|work=North County Times|accessdate=2 September 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption allegations ===
Three days after becoming acting Mayor, Zucchet resigned from the City Council after he was convicted in [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California|U.S. District Court]] of one count of conspiracy, five counts of wire fraud and three counts of extortion. This was in connection with an alleged scheme also involving fellow City Council members [[Ralph Inzunza]] and [[Charles L. Lewis (California politician)|Charles L. Lewis]] to get the city's "no touch" laws at strip clubs repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-07-19-sandiego-resigns_x.htm|title=Convicted San Diego councilman resigns|date=July 19, 2005|work=USA Today|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2005, citing lack of evidence, a judge overturned the convictions against Zucchet. He acquitted Zucchet on seven of the original nine charges and ordered a new trial on the remaining two indictments. The convictions against two co-defendants were upheld.

On September 1, 2009, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Zucchet's acquittals. In the decision, the Court emphasized the lack of evidence against Zucchet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/09/01/05-50902.pdf Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, September 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining two charges against him were finally dropped in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=20101014tza|title=Justice undone: Michael Zucchet and Ralph Inzunza|last=Coffey|first=Daniel|date=October 14, 2010|work=San Diego Daily Transcript|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-City Council career ==
After leaving the city council, Zucchet worked at the Utility Consumers' Action Network (UCAN) as a Project Manager starting in 2006. In 2009 he became the general manager of the San Diego Municipal Employees Association, the union that represents city workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sdmea.org/union/staff/MikeZucchet.aspx|title=Michael Zucchet - General Manager|work=San Diego Municipal Employees Association|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he was appointed to serve as one of San Diego's three representatives on the San Diego Port Commission, which governs the [[Port of San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sdbj.com/news/2017/jun/19/michael-zucchet-sworn-port-commissioner/|title=Michael Zucchet Sworn In as Port Commissioner|last=Graves|first=Brad|date=June 19, 2017|work=San Diego Business Journal|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Personal life==
Zucchet lives in the [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]] area of San Diego with his wife Teresa and his daughter and son.

On July 2, 2013, Zucchet (an avid bridge and card player at Duke University), finished in 4th place for $143,642 in Event #54, $1,000 No-Limit Hold'em, at the World Series of Poker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pokernews.com/live-reporting/2013-world-series-of-poker/event-54-1-000-no-limit-hold-em/chips.66494.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&amp;n=99271&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Midlands Electricity Board''' was the [[public sector]] [[utility company]] responsible for electricity generation and electrical infrastructure maintenance in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of [[England]] prior to 1990. As ''Midlands Electricity plc'' it was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and was once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

==History==
The ''Midlands Electricity Board'' was formed in 1947, under the [[Electricity Act 1947 (UK)|Electricity Act]] of that year. The counterpart of the [[East Midlands Electricity|East Midlands board]], it served southern, and western parts of [[Warwickshire]], as well as the counties of [[Worcestershire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Shropshire]], and [[Staffordshire]], as well as most of [[Gloucestershire]], the [[West Midlands conurbation]] and northern [[Oxfordshire]].

As with the EMEB, it kept a network of showrooms across its area, to allow customers to pay bills, and order many types of electrical goods. The [[Midlands Electricity Board|MEB]], [[Southern Electric]] and [[Eastern Electricity]] merged their showrooms, forming the [[Powerhouse (shop)|Powerhouse]] store chain in the early 90's.

In 1990, as part of the privatisation of the UK electricity industry, the board became '''Midlands Electricity''' plc. The new business was split up, and sold several times: the supply business to [[npower (UK)|npower]] in 1999, the distribution business to [[GPU Power]], and [[Aquila, Inc.]], under whose ownership it was renamed Aquila Networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aquila Completes Purchase of Ownership Interest in Midlands Electricity. |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25324036_ITM |work=Business Wire |date=2002-05-08 |accessdate=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before finally being purchased by [[E.ON UK|Powergen]] in 2004, becoming [[E.ON UK|Central Networks]], part of [[E.ON]].

In [[supersymmetry]], the '''neutralino'''&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|pp=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical particle. In the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),]] a popular model of realization of supersymmetry at a low energy, there are four neutralinos that are [[fermion]]s and are electrically neutral, the lightest of which is stable in an [[R-parity]] conserved scenario of MSSM.  They are typically labeled {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 1}} (the lightest), {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 2}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 3}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Neutralino 4}} (the heaviest) although sometimes &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\chi}_1^0, \ldots, \tilde{\chi}_4^0&lt;/math&gt; is also used when &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\chi}_i^\pm&lt;/math&gt; is used to refer to [[chargino]]s.  These four states are mixtures of the [[Gaugino|bino]] and the neutral [[Wino (particle)|wino]] (which are the neutral electroweak [[gaugino]]s), and the neutral [[higgsinos]].  As the neutralinos are [[Majorana fermion]]s, each of them is identical to its [[antiparticle]].  Because these particles only interact with the weak vector bosons, they are not directly produced at [[hadron collider]]s in copious numbers. They would primarily appear as particles in cascade decays of heavier particles (decays that happen in multiple steps) usually originating from [[Quantum chromodynamics|colored]] supersymmetric particles such as [[squark]]s or [[gluino]]s.

In [[R-parity]] conserving models, the lightest neutralino is stable and all supersymmetric cascade-decays end up decaying into this particle which leaves the detector unseen and its existence can only be inferred by looking for unbalanced momentum in a detector.

The heavier neutralinos typically decay through a neutral [[Z boson]] to a lighter neutralino or through a charged [[W boson]] to a light chargino:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The mass splittings between the different neutralinos will dictate which patterns of decays are allowed.

Up to present, neutralinos have never been observed or detected in an experiment.

==Origins in supersymmetric theories==
In supersymmetry models, all [[Standard Model]] particles have partner particles with the same [[quantum number]]s except for the quantum number [[Spin (physics)|spin]], which differs by {{frac|1|2}} from its partner particle.  Since the superpartners of the [[Z boson]] ([[Zino (disambiguation)|zino]]), the [[photon]] ([[photino]]) and the [[higgs boson|neutral higgs]] ([[higgsino]]) have the same quantum numbers, they can [[quantum superposition|mix]] to form four [[eigenstate]]s of the mass operator called "neutralinos".  In many models the lightest of the four neutralinos turns out to be the [[lightest supersymmetric particle]] (LSP), though other particles may also take on this role.

==Phenomenology==
The exact properties of each neutralino will depend on the details of the mixing&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt; (e.g. whether they are more higgsino-like or gaugino-like), but they tend to have masses at the weak scale (100&amp;nbsp;GeV ~ 1&amp;nbsp;TeV) and couple to other particles with strengths characteristic of the [[weak nuclear force|weak interaction]]. In this way they are phenomenologically similar to [[neutrinos]], and so are not directly observable in particle detectors at accelerators.

In models in which [[R-parity]] is conserved and the lightest of the four neutralinos is the LSP, the lightest neutralino is stable and is eventually produced in the decay chain of all other superpartners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such cases supersymmetric processes at accelerators are characterized by the expectation of a large discrepancy in energy and momentum between the visible initial and final state particles, with this energy being carried off by a neutralino which departs the detector unnoticed.&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;{{cite journal

This is an important signature to discriminate supersymmetry from Standard Model backgrounds.

As a heavy, stable particle, the lightest neutralino is an excellent candidate to form the universe's [[cold dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Neutralino dark matter could be observed experimentally in nature either indirectly or directly.  For indirect observation, gamma ray and neutrino telescopes look for evidence of neutralino annihilation in regions of high dark matter density such as the galactic or solar centre.&lt;ref name="Feng"/&gt; For direct observation, special purpose experiments such as the [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search]] (CDMS) seek to detect the rare impacts of WIMPs in terrestrial detectors. These experiments have begun to probe interesting supersymmetric parameter space, excluding some models for neutralino dark matter, and upgraded experiments with greater sensitivity are under development.

'''New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441''' (NZ441) was a scheduled flight of the [[National Airways Corporation (New Zealand)|New Zealand National Airways Corporation]] from [[Whenuapai]], Auckland to [[Tauranga]]. On 3 July 1963 at approximately 9:09 am [[NZST]] the flight, a [[Douglas DC-3|Douglas DC-3 Skyliner]], flew into a vertical rock face in the [[Kaimai Ranges]] near Mount Ngatamahinerua, at an altitude of 2460 feet (750 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630703-0 |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty three people were on board. Twenty two were killed instantly; there is evidence that one person survived the impact but died shortly afterward. Three extra passengers were supposed to be on the flight, but changed their plans at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10545462 |title=New Zealand's worst air disasters |date=28 November 2008 |publisher=New Zealand Herald |accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand|Civil Aviation Authority]] investigators, a [[downdraft]] carried the aircraft below the level of the crests of the range, where under the very poor weather conditions prevailing at the time, the aircraft encountered an area of extreme [[turbulence]] from which it was impossible for the crew to recover altitude. On the day of the crash, another plane was caught in strong downdrafts in the Kaimai Ranges but managed to recover.

Furthermore, the crew was probably unaware of the true position of the aircraft and initiated a premature descent. However, it must be appreciated that the crew decided to descend only to the level officially designated as the minimum safe altitude in the area of the descent.

Following this accident, the Civil Aviation Authority made the decision to classify the Kaimai Ranges as mountainous terrain, which raised the minimum safe altitude for the area by 1000&amp;nbsp;feet (305&amp;nbsp;m).

Due to the remoteness of the crash, the wreckage was not recovered but secured on site by the [[New Zealand Army]] in 1964. This is similar to New Zealand's other major air disaster, [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]], which remains on the slopes of [[Mount Erebus]] in [[Antarctica]] where it crashed.

{{Nuclear physics}}
'''Nuclear binding energy''' is the ''minimum'' [[energy]] that would be required to disassemble the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]] into its component parts. These component parts are [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s, which are collectively called [[nucleon]]s.  The binding is always a positive number, as we need to spend energy in moving these nucleons, attracted to each other by the [[strong nuclear force]], away from each other. The [[mass]] of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the individual masses of the free [[Wiktionary:constituent|constituent]] protons and neutrons, according to Einstein's equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This 'missing mass' is known as the '''[[mass defect]]''', and represents the energy that was released when the nucleus was formed.

The term "nuclear binding energy" may also refer to the energy balance in processes in which the nucleus splits into fragments composed of more than one nucleon. If new [[binding energy]] is available when light nuclei fuse ([[nuclear fusion]]), or when heavy nuclei split ([[nuclear fission]]), either process can result in release of this binding energy. This energy may be made available as ''nuclear energy'' and can be used to produce electricity, as in [[nuclear power]], or in a [[nuclear weapon]]. When a large nucleus [[nuclear transmutation|splits]] into pieces, excess energy is emitted as photon (gamma rays) and as the kinetic energy of a number of different ejected particles ([[nuclear fission]] products).

These nuclear binding energies and forces are on the order of a million times greater than the [[Ionization energy|electron binding energies]] of light atoms like hydrogen.&lt;ref name=GSU-bindEnergy&gt;{{Cite web

The mass defect of a nucleus represents the amount of mass equivalent to the 
binding energy of the nucleus (E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the difference between the [[mass]] of a nucleus and the [[summation|sum]] of the individual masses of the nucleons of which it is composed.&lt;ref name=Purdue-U/&gt;

==Introduction==
Nuclear binding energy is explained by the basic principles involved in nuclear physics.

===Nuclear energy===
An absorption or release of nuclear energy occurs in [[nuclear reaction]]s or [[radioactive decay]]; those that absorb energy are called [[endothermic]] reactions and those that release energy are [[exothermic]] reactions. Energy is consumed or liberated because of differences in the nuclear binding energy between the incoming and outgoing products of the nuclear transmutation.&lt;ref name=nuclearEnergy-tx&gt;{{Cite web

The best-known classes of exothermic nuclear transmutations are [[atomic fission|fission]] and [[atomic fusion|fusion]]. Nuclear energy may be liberated by atomic fission, when heavy atomic nuclei (like uranium and plutonium) are broken apart into lighter nuclei. The energy from fission is used to generate electric power in hundreds of locations worldwide. Nuclear energy is also released during atomic fusion, when light [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] like [[hydrogen]] are combined to form heavier nuclei such as helium. The Sun and other stars use nuclear fusion to generate thermal energy which is later radiated from the surface, a type of stellar nucleosynthesis. In any exothermic nuclear process, nuclear mass might ultimately be converted to thermal energy, given off as heat.

In order to quantify the energy released or absorbed in any nuclear transmutation, one must know the nuclear binding energies of the nuclear components involved in the transmutation.

===The nuclear force===
[[Electrons]] and nuclei are kept together by [[electric charge|electrostatic attraction]] (negative attracts positive). Furthermore, electrons are sometimes [[covalent bond|shared by neighboring atoms]] or transferred to them (by processes of [[quantum physics]]), and this link between atoms is referred to as a [[chemical bond]], and is responsible for the formation of all [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref name=NucPhys/&gt;

The force of electric attraction does not hold nuclei together, because all [[protons]] carry a positive charge and repel each other. Thus, [[Electromagnetism|electric forces]] do not hold nuclei together, because they act in the opposite direction. It has been established that binding [[neutrons]] to nuclei clearly requires a non-electrical attraction.&lt;ref name=NucPhys/&gt;

Therefore, another force, called the ''[[nuclear force]]'' (or ''residual strong force'') holds the [[nucleon]]s of nuclei together. This force is a residuum of the [[strong interaction]], which binds quarks into nucleons at an even smaller level of distance.

The nuclear force must be stronger than the electric repulsion at short distances, but weaker far away, or else different nuclei might tend to clump together. Therefore, it has short-range characteristics. An analogy to the nuclear force is the force between two small magnets: magnets are very difficult to separate when stuck together, but once pulled a short distance apart, the force between them drops almost to zero.&lt;ref name=NucPhys&gt;{{Cite web

Unlike [[gravity]] or electrical forces, the nuclear force is effective only at very short distances. At greater distances, the electrostatic force dominates: the protons repel each other because they are positively charged, and like charges repel. For that reason, the protons forming the nuclei of ordinary [[hydrogen]]—for instance, in a balloon filled with hydrogen—do not combine to form [[helium]] (a process that also would require some protons to combine with electrons and become [[neutrons]]). They cannot get close enough for the nuclear force, which attracts them to each other, to become important. Only under conditions of extreme [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] (for example, within the core of a [[star]]), can such a process take place.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr&gt;{{Cite web

===Physics of nuclei===
{{main|Atomic nucleus}}
There are around 94 naturally occurring [[Chemical element|element]]s on earth. The [[atom]]s of each element have a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]  containing a specific number of [[proton]]s (always the same number for a given element), and some number of [[neutron]]s, which is often roughly a similar number. Two atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as [[isotope]]s of the element. Different isotopes may have different properties - for example one might be stable and another might be unstable, and gradually undergo [[radioactive decay]] to become another element.

The hydrogen nucleus contain just one proton, Its isotope [[Deuterium|deuterium, or heavy hydrogen]], contains a proton and a neutron.  Helium contains two protons and two neutrons, and carbon, nitrogen and oxygen - six, seven and eight of each particle, respectively. However, a helium nucleus weighs less than the sum of the weights of the two hydrogen nuclei which combine to make it. The same is true for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For example, the carbon nucleus is slightly lighter than three helium nuclei, which can combine to make a carbon nucleus. This difference is known as the mass defect.

====Mass defect====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Mass defect (not to be confused with [[mass excess]] in nuclear physics or [[mass defect (mass spectrometry)|mass defect in mass spectrometry]]) is the difference between the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its parts. For example, a helium atom containing 4 nucleons has a mass about 0.8% less than the total mass of four hydrogen nuclei (which contain one nucleon each).

The "mass defect" can be explained using [[Albert Einstein]]'s formula [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], describing the [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalence of energy and mass]]. By this formula, adding energy also increases mass (both weight and inertia), whereas removing energy decreases mass. In the above example, the helium nucleus has four nucleons bound together, and the [[binding energy]] which holds them together is, in effect, the missing 0.8% of mass.

If a combination of particles contains extra energy—for instance, in a molecule of the explosive TNT—weighing it reveals some extra mass, compared to its end products after an explosion. (The weighing must be done after the products have been stopped and cooled, however, as the extra mass must escape from the system as heat before its loss can be noticed, in theory.) On the other hand, if one must inject energy to separate a system of particles into its components, then the initial mass is less than that of the components after they are separated. In the latter case, the energy injected is "stored" as [[potential energy]], which shows as the increased mass of the components that store it. This is an example of the fact that energy of all types is seen in systems as mass, since mass and energy are equivalent, and each is a "property" of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lilley|first1=J.S.|title=Nuclear physics : principles and applications|date=2006|publisher=J. Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=0-471-97936-8|pages=7|edition=Repr. with corrections Jan. 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter scenario is the case with nuclei such as helium: to break them up into protons and neutrons, one must inject energy. On the other hand, if a process existed going in the opposite direction, by which hydrogen atoms could be combined to form helium, then energy would be released. The energy can be computed using ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ''m''&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for each nucleus, where Δ''m'' is the difference between the mass of the helium nucleus and the mass of four protons (plus two electrons, absorbed to create the neutrons of helium).

For lighter elements, the energy that can be released by assembling them from lighter elements decreases, and energy can be released when they fuse. This is true for nuclei lighter than [[iron]]/[[nickel]]. For heavier nuclei, more energy is needed to bind them, to the point that energy is released by breaking them up into 2 fragments (known as [[atomic fission]]). Nuclear power is generated at present by breaking up uranium nuclei in nuclear power reactors, and capturing the released energy as heat, which is converted to electricity. 

As a rule, very light elements can fuse comparatively easily, and very heavy elements can break up via fission very easily; elements in the middle are more stable and it is difficult to make them undergo either fusion or fission in an earthly environment such as a laboratory.

The reason the trend reverses after iron is the growing positive charge of the nuclei, which tends to force nuclei to break up. It is resisted by the [[strong nuclear interaction]], which holds nucleons together.  The electric force may be weaker than the strong nuclear force, but the strong force has a much more limited range: in an iron nucleus, each proton repels the other 25 protons, while the nuclear force only binds close neighbors. So for larger nuclei, the electrostatic forces tend to dominate and the nucleus will tend over time to break up.

As nuclei grow bigger still, this disruptive effect becomes steadily more significant. By the time [[polonium]] is reached (84 protons), nuclei can no longer accommodate their large positive charge, but emit their excess protons quite rapidly in the process of alpha radioactivity—the emission of helium nuclei, each containing two protons and two neutrons. (Helium nuclei are an especially stable combination.) Because of this process, nuclei with more than 94 protons are not found naturally on Earth (see [[periodic table]]). The isotopes beyond uranium (atomic number 92) with the longest half-lives are plutonium-244 (80 million years) and curium-247 (16 million years).

====Solar binding energy====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The [[nuclear fusion]] process works as follows: five billion years ago, the new Sun formed when gravity pulled together a vast cloud of [[Interstellar gas|hydrogen]] and dust, from which the Earth and other planets also arose. The gravitational pull released energy and heated the early Sun, much in the way [[Helmholtz]] proposed.

Thermal energy appears as the motion of atoms and molecules: the higher the temperature of a collection of particles, the greater is their velocity and the more violent are their collisions. When the temperature at the center of the newly formed Sun became great enough for collisions between hydrogen nuclei to overcome their electric repulsion, and bring them into the short range of the attractive [[nuclear force]], nuclei began to stick together. When this began to happen, protons combined into deuterium and then helium, with some protons changing in the process to neutrons (plus positrons, positive electrons, which combine with electrons and become neutral). This released nuclear energy now keeps up the high temperature of the Sun's core, and the heat also keeps the gas pressure high, keeping the Sun at its present size, and stopping gravity from compressing it any more. There is now a stable balance between gravity and pressure.

Different nuclear reactions may predominate at different stages of the Sun's existence, including the proton-proton reaction and the carbon-nitrogen cycle—which involves heavier nuclei, but whose final product is still the combination of protons to form helium.

A branch of physics, ''the study of [[Nuclear power|controlled nuclear fusion]]'', has tried since the 1950s to derive useful power from nuclear fusion reactions that combine small nuclei into bigger ones, typically to heat boilers, whose steam could turn turbines and produce electricity. Unfortunately, no earthly laboratory can match one feature of the solar powerhouse: the great mass of the Sun, whose weight keeps the hot plasma compressed and confines the nuclear furnace to the Sun's core. Instead, physicists use strong magnetic fields to confine the plasma, and for fuel they use heavy forms of hydrogen, which burn more easily. Magnetic traps can be rather unstable, and any plasma hot enough and dense enough to undergo nuclear fusion tends to slip out of them after a short time. Even with ingenious tricks, the confinement in most cases lasts only a small fraction of a second.

====Combining nuclei====
Small nuclei that are larger than hydrogen can combine into bigger ones and release energy, but in combining such nuclei, the amount of energy released is much smaller compared to hydrogen fusion. The reason is that while the overall process releases energy from letting the nuclear attraction do its work, energy must first be injected to force together positively charged protons, which also repel each other with their electric charge.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr/&gt;

For elements that weigh more than [[iron]] (a nucleus with 26 protons), the fusion process no longer releases energy. In even heavier nuclei energy is consumed, not released, by combining similar sized nuclei. With such large nuclei, overcoming the electric repulsion (which affects all protons in the nucleus) requires more energy than what is released by the nuclear attraction (which is effective mainly between close neighbors). Conversely, energy could actually be released by breaking apart nuclei heavier than iron.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr/&gt;

With the nuclei of elements heavier than [[lead]], the electric repulsion is so strong that some of them spontaneously eject positive fragments, usually nuclei of helium that form very stable combinations ([[alpha particles]]). This spontaneous break-up is one of the forms of [[radioactivity]] exhibited by some nuclei.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr/&gt;

Nuclei heavier than lead (except for [[bismuth]], [[thorium]], and [[uranium]]) spontaneously break up too quickly to appear in nature as [[primordial element]]s, though they can be produced artificially or as intermediates in the [[decay chain]]s of lighter elements. Generally, the heavier the nuclei are, the faster they spontaneously decay.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr/&gt;

Iron nuclei are the most stable nuclei (in particular [[iron-56]]), and the best sources of energy are therefore nuclei whose weights are as far removed from iron as possible. One can combine the lightest ones—nuclei of hydrogen (protons)—to form nuclei of helium, and that is how the Sun generates its energy. Or else one can break up the heaviest ones—nuclei of uranium or plutonium—into smaller fragments, and that is what nuclear power reactors do.&lt;ref name=RevNucStr/&gt;

===Nuclear binding energy===
An example that illustrates nuclear binding energy is the nucleus of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C (carbon-12), which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The protons are all positively charged and repel each other, but the [[nuclear force]] overcomes the repulsion and causes them to stick together. The nuclear force is a close-range force (it is strongly attractive at a distance of 1.0&amp;nbsp;fm and becomes extremely small beyond a distance of 2.5fm), and virtually no effect of this force is observed outside the nucleus. The nuclear force also pulls neutrons together, or neutrons and protons.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

The energy of the nucleus is negative with regard to the energy of the particles pulled apart to infinite distance (just like the gravitational energy of planets of the solar system), because energy must be utilized to split a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons. [[Mass spectrometers]] have measured the masses of nuclei, which are always less than the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons that form them, and the difference—by the formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—gives the binding energy of the nucleus.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

====Nuclear fusion====
The binding energy of helium is the energy source of the Sun and of most stars. The sun is composed of 74 percent hydrogen (measured by mass), an element whose nucleus is a single proton. Energy is released in the sun when 4 protons combine into a helium nucleus, a process in which two of them are also converted to neutrons.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

The conversion of protons to neutrons is the result of another nuclear force, known as the [[weak force|weak (nuclear) force]]. The weak force, like the strong force, has a short range, but is much weaker than the strong force. The weak force tries to make the number of neutrons and protons into the most energetically stable configuration. For nuclei containing less than 40 particles, these numbers are usually about equal. Protons and neutrons are closely related and are collectively known as nucleons. As the number of particles increases toward a maximum of about 209, the number of neutrons to maintain stability begins to outstrip the number of protons, until the ratio of neutrons to protons is about three to two.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

The protons of hydrogen combine to helium only if they have enough velocity to overcome each other's mutual repulsion sufficiently to get within range of the strong nuclear attraction. This means that fusion only occurs within a very hot gas. Hydrogen hot enough for combining to helium requires an enormous pressure to keep it confined, but suitable conditions exist in the [[Solar core|central regions]] of the Sun, where such pressure is provided by the enormous weight of the layers above the core, pressed inwards by the Sun's strong gravity. The process of combining protons to form helium is an example of nuclear fusion.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

The earth's oceans contain a large amount of hydrogen that could theoretically be used for fusion, and helium byproduct of fusion does not harm the environment, so some consider nuclear fusion a good alternative to supply humanity's energy needs. Experiments to generate electricity from fusion have so far only partially succeeded. Sufficiently hot hydrogen must be ionized and confined. One technique is to use very strong magnetic fields, because charged particles (like those trapped in the Earth's radiation belt) are guided by magnetic field lines. Fusion experiments also rely on [[heavy hydrogen]], which fuses more easily, and gas densities can be moderate. But even with these techniques far more net energy is consumed by the fusion experiments than is yielded by the process.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

====The binding energy maximum and ways to approach it by decay====
In the main [[isotope]]s of light nuclei, such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, the most stable combination of neutrons and of protons are when the numbers are equal (this continues to element 20, calcium). However, in heavier nuclei, the disruptive energy of protons increases, since they are confined to a tiny volume and repel each other. The energy of the strong force holding the nucleus together also increases, but at a slower rate, as if inside the nucleus, only nucleons close to each other are tightly bound, not ones more widely separated.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

The net binding energy of a nucleus is that of the nuclear attraction, minus the disruptive energy of the electric force. As nuclei get heavier than helium, their net binding energy per nucleon (deduced from the difference in mass between the nucleus and the sum of masses of component nucleons) grows more and more slowly, reaching its peak at iron. As nucleons are added, the total nuclear binding energy always increases—but the total disruptive energy of electric forces (positive protons repelling other protons) also increases, and past iron, the second increase outweighs the first. [[Iron-56]] (&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe) is the most efficiently bound nucleus&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt; meaning that it has the least average mass per nucleon. However, [[nickel-62]] is the most tightly bound nucleus in terms of energy of binding per nucleon &lt;ref&gt; N R Sree Harsha, "The tightly bound nuclei in the liquid drop model", Eur. J. Phys. 39 035802 (2018), https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6404/aaa345 &lt;/ref&gt;. (Nickel-62's higher energy of binding does not translate to a larger mean mass loss than Fe-56, because Ni-62 has a slightly higher ratio of neutrons/protons than does iron-56, and the presence of the heavier neutrons increases nickel-62's average mass per nucleon).

To reduce the disruptive energy, the weak interaction allows the number of neutrons to exceed that of protons—for instance, the main isotope of iron has 26 protons and 30 neutrons. Isotopes also exist where the number of neutrons differs from the most stable number for that number of nucleons. If the ratio of protons to neutrons is too far from stability, nucleons may spontaneously change from proton to neutron, or neutron to proton.

The two methods for this conversion are mediated by the weak force, and involve types of [[beta decay]]. In the simplest beta decay, neutrons are converted to protons by emitting a negative electron and an antineutrino. This is always possible outside a nucleus because neutrons are more massive than protons by an equivalent of about 2.5 electrons. In the opposite process, which only happens within a nucleus, and not to free particles, a proton may become a neutron by ejecting a [[positron]]. This is permitted if enough energy is available between parent and daughter nuclides to do this (the required energy difference is equal to 1.022 MeV, which is the mass of 2 electrons). If the mass difference between parent and daughter is less than this, a proton-rich nucleus may still convert protons to neutrons by the process of [[electron capture]], in which a proton simply electron captures one of the atom's K orbital electrons, emits a neutrino, and becomes a neutron.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy/&gt;

Among the heaviest nuclei, starting with tellurium nuclei (element 52) containing 106 or more nucleons, electric forces may be so destabilizing that entire chunks of the nucleus may be ejected, usually as [[alpha particles]], which consist of two protons and two neutrons (alpha particles are fast helium nuclei). ([[Beryllium-8]] also decays, very quickly, into two alpha particles.) Alpha particles are extremely stable. This type of decay becomes more and more probable as elements rise in atomic weight past 106.

The curve of binding energy is a graph that plots the binding energy per nucleon against atomic mass. This curve has its main peak at iron and nickel and then slowly decreases again, and also a narrow isolated peak at helium, which as noted is very stable. The heaviest nuclei in nature, uranium &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, are unstable, but having a half-life of 4.5 billion years, close to the age of the Earth, they are still relatively abundant; they (and other nuclei heavier than helium) have formed in stellar evolution events like supernova explosions &lt;ref name="Turning Lead into Gold"&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/cs/generalchemistry/a/aa050601a.htm Turning Lead into Gold]&lt;/ref&gt; preceding the formation of the solar system. The most common isotope of thorium, &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, also undergoes alpha particle emission, and its half-life (time over which half a number of atom&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;s decays) is even longer, by several times. In each of these, radioactive decay produces daughter isotopes that are also unstable, starting a chain of decays that ends in some stable isotope of lead.&lt;ref name=BindEnergy&gt;{{Cite web

==Determining nuclear binding energy==
Calculation can be employed to determine the nuclear binding energy of nuclei. The calculation involves determining the ''mass defect'', converting it into energy, and expressing the result as energy per mole of atoms, or as energy per nucleon.&lt;ref name=Purdue-U/&gt;

===Conversion of mass defect into energy===
Mass defect is defined as the difference between the mass of a nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the nucleons of which it is composed. The mass defect is determined by calculating three quantities.&lt;ref name=Purdue-U/&gt; These are: the actual mass of the nucleus, the composition of the nucleus (number of protons and of neutrons), and the masses of a proton and of a neutron. This is then followed by converting the mass defect into energy. This quantity is the nuclear binding energy, however it must be expressed as energy per mole of atoms or as energy per nucleon.&lt;ref name=Purdue-U&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fission and fusion==
Nuclear energy is released by the splitting (fission) or merging (fusion) of the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[atom]](s). The conversion of nuclear [[mass]]-[[energy]] to a form of energy, which can remove some mass when the energy is removed, is consistent with the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula:

Δ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ''m''&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

in which,

Δ''E'' = energy release,

Δ''m'' = [[mass defect]],

and ''c'' = the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] (a [[physical constant]] 299,792,458 m/s by definition).

Nuclear energy was first discovered by [[France|French]] physicist [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896, when he found that photographic plates stored in the dark near [[uranium]] were blackened like [[X-ray]] plates (X-rays had recently been discovered in 1895).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Nickel-62]] has the highest binding energy per [[nucleon]] of any [[isotope]]. If an atom of lower average binding energy is changed into two atoms of higher average binding energy, energy is given off. Also, if two atoms of lower average binding energy fuse into an atom of higher average binding energy, energy is given off. The chart shows that fusion of [[hydrogen]], the combination to form heavier atoms, releases energy, as does fission of uranium, the breaking up of a larger nucleus into smaller parts. Stability varies between isotopes: the isotope [[Uranium-235|U-235]] is much less stable than the more common [[Uranium-238|U-238]].

Nuclear energy is released by three ''exoenergetic'' (or [[exothermic]]) processes:
*[[Radioactive decay]], where a neutron or proton in the [[radioactive]] nucleus decays spontaneously by emitting either particles, [[electromagnetic radiation]] (gamma rays), or both. Note that for radioactive decay, it is not strictly necessary for the binding energy to increase. What is strictly necessary is that the mass decrease. If a neutron turns into a proton and the energy of the decay is less than 0.782343 MeV (such as [[rubidium-87]] decaying to [[strontium-87]]), the average binding energy per nucleon will actually decrease.
*[[nuclear fusion|Fusion]], two atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus
*[[nuclear fission|Fission]], the breaking of a heavy nucleus into two (or more rarely three) lighter nuclei

==Binding energy for atoms==

The binding energy of an atom (including its electrons) is not the same as the binding energy of the atom's nucleus. The measured mass deficits of [[isotopes]] are always listed as mass deficits of the [[Neutral particle|neutral]] [[atom]]s of that isotope, and mostly in [[MeV]]. As a consequence, the listed mass deficits are not a measure for the stability or binding energy of isolated nuclei, but for the whole atoms. This has very practical reasons, because it is very hard to totally [[ion]]ize heavy elements, i.e. strip them of all of their [[electron]]s.

This practice is useful for other reasons, too: stripping all the electrons from a heavy unstable nucleus (thus producing a bare nucleus) changes the lifetime of the nucleus, or the nucleus of a stable neutral atom can likewise become unstable after stripping, indicating that the nucleus cannot be treated independently. Examples of this have been shown in [[Beta_decay#Bound-state_β−_decay|bound-state β decay]] experiments performed at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research|GSI]]) heavy ion accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Jung |first1=M. |display-authors=etal |year=1992 |title=First observation of bound-state β&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; decay |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=69 |issue=15 |pages=2164–2167 |bibcode=1992PhRvL..69.2164J |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2164 |pmid=10046415}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bosch |first1=F. |display-authors=etal |year=1996 |title=Observation of bound-state beta minus decay of fully ionized &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re: &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Re–&lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os Cosmochronometry |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=77 |issue=26 |pages=5190–5193 |bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5190B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190 |pmid=10062738}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is also evident from phenomena like [[electron capture]]. Theoretically, in [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] models of heavy atoms, the electron orbits partially inside the nucleus (it does not ''orbit'' in a strict sense, but has a non-vanishing probability of being located inside the nucleus).

A [[nuclear decay]] happens to the nucleus, meaning that properties ascribed to the nucleus change in the event. In the field of physics the concept of "mass deficit" as a measure for "binding energy" means "mass deficit of the neutral atom" (not just the nucleus) and is a measure for stability of the whole atom.

==Nuclear binding energy curve==
[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|500px|right]]

In&amp;nbsp;the [[periodic&amp;nbsp;table of elements]], the series of light elements from [[hydrogen]] up to [[sodium]] is observed to exhibit generally increasing binding energy per nucleon as the [[atomic mass]] increases. This increase is generated by increasing forces per nucleon in the nucleus, as each additional nucleon is attracted by other nearby nucleons, and thus more tightly bound to the whole.

The region of increasing binding energy is followed by a region of relative stability (saturation) in the sequence from [[magnesium]] through [[xenon]]. In this region, the nucleus has become large enough that nuclear forces no longer completely extend efficiently across its width. Attractive nuclear forces in this region, as atomic mass increases, are nearly balanced by repellent electromagnetic forces between protons, as the [[atomic number]] increases.

Finally, in elements heavier than xenon, there is a decrease in binding energy per nucleon as atomic number increases. In this region of nuclear size, electromagnetic repulsive forces are beginning to overcome the strong nuclear force attraction.

At the peak of binding energy, [[nickel-62]] is the most tightly bound nucleus (per nucleon), followed by [[iron-58]] and [[iron-56]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fewell | first = M. P. | title=The atomic nuclide with the highest mean binding energy | journal=American Journal of Physics | year=1995 | volume=63 | issue=7 | pages=653–658 | bibcode=1995AmJPh..63..653F | doi=10.1119/1.17828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the approximate basic reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since they are produced profusely as end products in [[supernova]]e and in the final stages of [[silicon burning]] in stars. However, it is not binding energy per defined nucleon (as defined above), which controls which exact nuclei are made, because within stars, neutrons are free to convert to protons to release even more energy, per generic nucleon, if the result is a stable nucleus with a larger fraction of protons. In fact, it has been argued that [[photodisintegration]] of &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Ni to form &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe may be energetically possible in an extremely hot star core, due to this beta decay conversion of neutrons to protons.&lt;ref&gt;M.P. Fewell, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion is that at the pressure and temperature conditions in the cores of large stars, energy is released by converting all matter into &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe nuclei (ionized atoms). (However, at high temperatures not all matter will be in the lowest energy state.) This energetic maximum should also hold for ambient conditions, say ''T'' = 298 K and ''p'' = 1 atm, for neutral condensed matter consisting of &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe atoms—however, in these conditions nuclei of atoms are inhibited from fusing into the most stable and low energy state of matter.

It is generally believed that iron-56 is more common than nickel isotopes in the universe for mechanistic reasons, because its unstable progenitor [[nickel-56]] is copiously made by staged build-up of 14 helium nuclei inside supernovas, where it has no time to decay to iron before being released into the interstellar medium in a matter of a few minutes, as the supernova explodes. However, nickel-56 then decays to [[cobalt-56]] within a few weeks, then this radioisotope finally decays to iron-56 with a half life of about 77.3 days. The radioactive decay-powered light curve of such a process has been observed to happen in [[type II supernova]]e, such as [[SN 1987A]]. In a star, there are no good ways to create nickel-62 by alpha-addition processes, or else there would presumably be more of this highly stable nuclide in the universe.

===Binding energy and nuclide masses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The fact that the maximum binding energy is found in medium-sized nuclei is a consequence of the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces that have different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force ([[strong nuclear force]]), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However, the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the additional repelling force of additional protons more than offsets any binding energy that results between further added nucleons as a result of additional strong force interactions. Such nuclei become increasingly less tightly bound as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter) are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller nuclei.

[[Nuclear fusion]] produces energy by combining the very lightest elements into more tightly bound elements (such as hydrogen into [[helium]]), and [[nuclear fission]] produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]) into more tightly bound elements (such as [[barium]] and [[krypton]]). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.

As seen above in the example of deuterium, nuclear binding energies are large enough that they may be easily measured as fractional [[mass]] deficits, according to the equivalence of mass and energy. The atomic binding energy is simply the amount of energy (and mass) released, when a collection of free [[nucleons]] are joined together to form a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].

Nuclear binding energy can be computed from the difference in mass of a nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the number of free neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus. Once this mass difference, called the mass defect or mass deficiency, is known, Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''² can be used to compute the binding energy of any nucleus. Early nuclear physicists used to refer to computing this value as a "packing fraction" calculation.

For example, the [[atomic mass unit]] (1 u) is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom—but the atomic mass of a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H atom (which is a proton plus electron) is 1.007825 ''u'', so each nucleon in &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C has lost, on average, about 0.8% of its mass in the form of binding energy.

===Semiempirical formula for nuclear binding energy===
{{main|Semi-empirical mass formula}}
For a nucleus with ''A'' nucleons, including ''Z'' protons and ''N'' neutrons, a [[semi-empirical mass formula|semi-empirical formula]] for the binding energy (BE) per nucleon is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{BE}}{A \cdot \text{MeV}} = a - \frac{b}{A^{1/3}} - \frac{c Z^2}{A^{4/3}} - \frac{d \left(N - Z\right)^2}{A^2} \pm \frac{e}{A^{7/4}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are given by: &lt;math&gt;a = 14.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;b = 13.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;c = 0.585&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;d = 19.3&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;e = 33&lt;/math&gt;.

The first term &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the saturation contribution and ensures that the binding energy per nucleon is the same for all nuclei to a first approximation. The term &lt;math&gt;-b/A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; is a surface tension effect and is proportional to the number of nucleons that are situated on the nuclear surface; it is largest for light nuclei. The term &lt;math&gt;-cZ^2/A^{4/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the Coulomb electrostatic repulsion; this becomes more important as &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; increases. The symmetry correction term &lt;math&gt;-d(N-Z)^2/A^2&lt;/math&gt; takes into account the fact that in the absence of other effects the most stable arrangement has equal numbers of protons and neutrons; this is because the n-p interaction in a nucleus is stronger than either the n-n or p-p interaction. The pairing term &lt;math&gt;\pm e/A^{7/4}&lt;/math&gt; is purely empirical; it is + for even-even nuclei and - for [[odd-odd nuclei]].

==Example values deduced from experimentally measured atom nuclide masses==
The following table lists some binding energies and mass defect values.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish K. Tuli, Nuclear Wallet Cards, 7th edition, April 2005, Brookhaven National Laboratory, US National Nuclear Data Center&lt;/ref&gt; Notice also that we use 1&amp;nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|u]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(931.494028&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.000023)&amp;nbsp;MeV. To calculate the binding energy we use the formula ''Z''&amp;nbsp;(''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;nuclide&lt;/sub&gt; where ''Z'' denotes the number of protons in the nuclides and ''N'' their number of neutrons. We take
''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(938.2720813±0.0000058)&amp;nbsp;MeV, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0.5109989461±0.000000003)&amp;nbsp;MeV and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(939.5654133&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0000058) MeV. The letter ''A'' denotes the sum of ''Z'' and ''N'' (number of nucleons in the nuclide). If we assume the reference nucleon has the mass of a neutron (so that all "total" binding energies calculated are maximal) we could define the total binding energy as the difference from the mass of the nucleus, and the mass of a collection of ''A'' free neutrons. In other words, it would be (''Z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''N'')&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;nuclide&lt;/sub&gt;. The "''total'' binding energy per nucleon" would be this value divided by ''A''.

&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe has the lowest nucleon-specific mass of the four nuclides listed in this table, but this does not imply it is the strongest bound atom per hadron, unless the choice of beginning hadrons is completely free. Iron releases the largest energy if any 56 nucleons are allowed to build a nuclide—changing one to another if necessary, The highest binding energy per hadron, with the hadrons starting as the same number of protons ''Z'' and total nucleons ''A'' as in the bound nucleus, is &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Ni. Thus, the true absolute value of the total binding energy of a nucleus depends on what we are allowed to construct the nucleus out of. If all nuclei of mass number ''A'' were to be allowed to be constructed of ''A'' neutrons, then &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe would release the most energy per nucleon, since it has a larger fraction of protons than &lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;Ni. However, if nuclei are required to be constructed of only the same number of protons and neutrons that they contain, then nickel-62 is the most tightly bound nucleus, per nucleon.

|}

In the table above it can be seen that the decay of a neutron, as well as the transformation of tritium into helium-3, releases energy; hence, it manifests a stronger bound new state when measured against the mass of an equal number of neutrons (and also a lighter state per number of total hadrons). Such reactions are not driven by changes in binding energies as calculated from previously fixed ''N'' and ''Z'' numbers of neutrons and protons, but rather in decreases in the total mass of the nuclide/per nucleon, with the reaction. (Note that the Binding Energy given above for hydrogen-1 is the atomic binding energy, not the nuclear binding energy which would be zero.)

The '''OKC Oilfield Expo''' was an annual oil and gas industry exhibition focused on providing a venue for industry professionals to network, view new oilfield technologies, compare products and services, and make business deals.  The event was held each October at the [[Cox Convention Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]], and was the largest energy industry [[trade fair]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="texasclassicproductions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Classic Productions press releases|url=http://www.texasclassicproductions.com/press-releases.php|publisher=Texas Classic Productions LLC|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Equity Partners, LLC|url=http://www.eventequitypartners.com/|publisher=Event Equity Partneres LLC|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, the expo featured 335 participating companies across 445 exhibitor booths, and attracted energy industry participants from 25 U.S. states and six different countries.&lt;ref name="texasclassicproductions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Jay|title=Texas company brings oil expo to Oklahoma City|url=http://newsok.com/texas-company-brings-oil-expo-to-oklahoma-city/article/3894723|accessdate=4 December 2013|newspaper=The Oklahoman|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plumbide''' can refer to one of two things: an [[intermetallic]] compound that contains [[lead]], or a [[Zintl phase]] compound with lead as the anion.

==Zintl phase==
[[File:Nonaplumbide-anion-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|[Pb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; from [K(18-crown-6)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;·(en)&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Plumbides can be formed when lead forms a Zintl phase compound with a more metallic element. One salt that can be formed this way is when [[cryptand]] reacts with [[sodium]] and lead in [[ethylenediamine]] (en) to produce {{chem|[Na(crypt)]|2|+}}[Pb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is red in solution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lead can also create anions with [[tin]], in a series of anions with the formula [Sn&lt;sub&gt;9−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Lead can also form the [Pb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; anion, which is emerald green in solution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of a plumbide is CeRhPb. The lead atom has a [[coordination number]] of 12 in the crystal structure of this compound. It is bound to four [[rhodium]]s, six [[cerium]]s, and two other lead atoms in the crystal structure of the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other plumbides are the M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb plumbides, where M is a [[rare-earth element]], and the intermetallic additionally contains a [[palladium]]. These plumbides tend to exhibit antiferromagnetism, and all of them are conductors.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A third plumbide is Ti&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4.8&lt;/sub&gt;. Like the above plumbides, it is an intermetallic, but it only contains [[titanium]] as the other metal, and not any rare earths.&lt;ref&gt;

Plumbides can also be [[Zintl phase]] compounds, such as [K(18-crown-6)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;·(en)&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''pressuron''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] which couples to both gravity and matter theorised in 2013.&lt;ref name="2013PhRvD..88d1504M"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minazzoli, O. |author2=Hees, A. |date=August 2013 |title= Intrinsic Solar System decoupling of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=041504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=2013PhRvD..88d1504M |arxiv=1308.2770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally postulated without self-interaction potential, the pressuron is also a [[dark energy]] candidate when it has such a potential.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli, O.|author2=Hees, A. |date=July 2014  |title= Late-time cosmology of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal multiplicative coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=90 |issue= 2 |pages=023017 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhRvD..90b3017M|arxiv = 1404.4266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressuron takes its name from the fact that it decouples from matter in pressure-less regimes,&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H/&gt; allowing the [[scalar-tensor theory]] of gravity involving it to pass [[Tests of general relativity#Post-Newtonian tests of gravity|solar system tests]], as well as tests on the [[equivalence principle]], even though it is fundamentally coupled to matter. Such a decoupling mechanism could explain why gravitation seems to be well described by [[general relativity]] at present epoch, while it could actually be more complex than that. Because of the way it couples to matter, the pressuron is a special case of the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]].&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D&gt;{{cite journal|author=Damour, T.|author2=Polyakov, A.M. |date=July 1994  |title= The string dilaton and a least coupling principle |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=423 |issue=  |pages=532–558 |doi= 10.1016/0550-3213(94)90143-0|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321394901430|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  1994NuPhB.423..532D|arxiv = hep-th/9401069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is one of the possible solutions to the present non-observation of various signals coming from massless or light scalar fields that are generically predicted in string theory.

== Mathematical formulation ==

The action of the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;S= \frac{1}{c}\int  d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \sqrt{\Phi} \mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi) +

The gravitational field equations therefore write&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \kappa~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Phi}}T_{\mu \nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_{\mu} \nabla_{\nu} -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi

and

and &lt;math&gt;T = g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is its [[Trace_(linear_algebra)|trace]].

=== Decoupling mechanism ===

If one considers a pressure-free [[perfect fluid]] (also known as a "dust"), the effective material Lagrangian becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88b7506M&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Minazzoli, O.
|date=July 2013
|title=Conservation laws in theories with universal gravity/matter coupling
|journal=Physical Review D
|volume=88
|issue=2
|pages=027506
|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.027506
|url= http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.027506

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ith particle, &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; its position, and &lt;math&gt;\delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac delta function]], 
while at the same time the trace of the stress-energy tensor reduces to &lt;math&gt;T = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, there is an exact cancellation of the pressuron material source term &lt;math&gt; \left(  T -  \mathcal{L}_m \right) &lt;/math&gt;, and hence the pressuron effectively decouples from pressure-free matter fields.

In other words, the specific coupling between the scalar field and the material fields in the Lagrangian leads to a decoupling between the scalar field and the matter fields in the limit that the matter field is exerting zero pressure. 

=== Link to string theory ===

The pressuron shares some characteristics with the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]],&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D/&gt;&lt;ref name=Minazzoli2014119&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli O. |date=July 2014  |title= On the cosmic convergence mechanism of the massless dilaton|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=735 |issue= 2 |pages=119–121 |doi=  10.1016/j.physletb.2014.06.027|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314004304|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhLB..735..119M|arxiv = 1312.4357}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can actually be viewed as a special case of the wider family of possible dilatons.&lt;ref name=PhysRevD.65.023508&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gasperini, M.|author2=Piazza, F.|author3=Veneziano, G.|last-author-amp=yes |date=December 2001  |title= Quintessence as a runaway dilaton |journal=Physical Review D |volume=65 |issue= 2 |pages=023508 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2002PhRvD..65b3508G|arxiv = gr-qc/0108016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since perturbative [[string theory]] cannot currently give the expected coupling of the string dilaton with material fields in the effective 4-dimension action, it seems conceivable that the pressuron may be the string dilaton in the 4-dimension effective action.

== Experimental search ==

=== Solar System ===

According to Minazzoli and Hees,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt; [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian]] tests of gravitation in the Solar System should lead to the same results as what is expected from [[general relativity]], except for gravitational redshift experiments, which should deviate from [[general relativity]] with a relative magnitude of the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega_0} \frac{P}{c^2 \rho} \sim \frac{10^{-6}}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current cosmological value of the scalar-field function &lt;math&gt;\omega(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the mean pressure and density of the Earth (for instance). Current best constraints on the gravitational redshift come from [[Gravity Probe A|gravity probe A]] and are at the &lt;math&gt;10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; level only. Therefore, the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron is weakly constrained by Solar System experiments.

=== Cosmological variation of the fundamental coupling constants ===

Because of its non-minimal couplings, the pressuron leads to a variation of the [[Coupling constant|fundamental coupling constants]]&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is a classical effect, and it should not be confused with the [[Coupling constant#Running coupling|quantum running]] of the coupling constants&lt;/ref&gt; in regimes where it effectively couples to matter.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H /&gt; However, since the pressuron decouples in both the [[matter-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by pressure-less material fields) and the [[dark-energy-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by dark energy&lt;ref&gt;In the context of the pressuron, dark energy can either be a [[cosmological constant]] or due to a non-vanishing scalar potential &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), the pressuron is also weakly constrained by current cosmological tests on the variation of the coupling constants.

=== Test with binary pulsars ===

Although no calculations seem to have been performed regarding this issue, it has been argued that [[binary pulsar]]s should give greater constraints on the existence of the pressuron because of the high pressure of bodies involved in such systems.&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt;

The [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] '''''Rockets''''' were lightweight, [[streamliner#USA|streamlined]] [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] passenger trains built by the [[Budd Company]]. These six trains were the first streamlined equipment purchased by the Rock Island, as well as being its first diesel-powered passenger trains. Four of the trains consisted of three cars each, the other two each had four cars.

The [[stainless steel]] trains were each powered by an [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Electro-Motive Corporation]] model [[EMC TA|TA]] [[locomotive]]. Unlike many other early streamlined trains, the locomotives were not permanently attached to the trains.

The trains were [[articulated]] except for the [[observation car]]s.

The six trains as originally assigned were:&lt;ref&gt;http://railwayclassics.com/crip01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jcoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IOIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4530,3491529&amp;dq=zephyr&amp;hl=en|title=Streamliners Now Obsolete With 1937 Model on "Market"|date=16 October 1936|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw oil shale is crushed to a fine particles. Heat is transferred to oil shale by heat-carrying ceramic balls of size {{convert|6|to|8|mm|in}}. Raw oil shale is preheated in fluidized bed at the temperature of {{convert|600|°F|°C|sp=us|-1}} in the case if oxygen is used as fluidizing medium, or at {{convert|650|°F|°C|sp=us|-1}} if non-oxidizing gases are used. Heated ceramic balls fall then through the bed in counter-current direction.  The  preheated oil shale is further heated in the retorting vessel.  The retorted [[spent shale]] is cooled in a fast-fluidized bed by the recirculated cool pellets from the preheater; while cooling the spent shale ceramic balls are heated by the spent shale.&lt;ref name=gwyn&gt;

'''Silicon nitride''' is a chemical compound of the elements [[silicon]] and [[nitrogen]]. {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} is the most thermodynamically stable of the silicon nitrides. Hence, {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} is the most commercially important of the silicon nitrides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It is a white, high-melting-point solid that is relatively chemically inert, being attacked by dilute [[Hydrogen fluoride|HF]] and hot [[Sulfuric acid|{{chem|H|2|SO|4}}]]. It is very hard (8.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness#Intermediate hardness|mohs scale]]). It has a high thermal stability.

==Production==
The material is prepared by heating powdered silicon between 1300&amp;nbsp;°C and 1400&amp;nbsp;°C in a nitrogen environment:
:3 Si + 2 {{chem|N|2}} → {{chem|Si|3|N|4}}

The silicon sample weight increases progressively due to the chemical combination of silicon and nitrogen.  Without an iron catalyst, the reaction is complete after several hours (~7), when no further weight increase due to nitrogen absorption (per gram of silicon) is detected.  In addition to {{chem|Si|3|N|4}}, several other silicon nitride phases (with chemical formulas corresponding to varying degrees of nitridation/Si oxidation state) have been reported in the literature, for example, the gaseous disilicon mononitride ({{chem|Si|2|N}}); silicon mononitride (SiN), and silicon sesquinitride ({{chem|Si|2|N|3}}), each of which are stoichiometric phases.  As with other [[refractories]], the products obtained in these high-temperature syntheses depends on the reaction conditions (e.g. time, temperature, and starting materials including the reactants and container materials), as well as the mode of purification.  However, the existence of the sesquinitride has since come into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It can also be prepared by [[Diazene|diimide]] route:&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; 
:{{chem|SiCl|4}} + 6 {{chem|NH|3}}  → {{chem|Si(NH)|2}} + 4 {{chem|NH|4|Cl}}(s) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at 0&amp;nbsp;°C
:3 {{chem|Si(NH)|2}} → {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} + {{chem|N|2}} + 3 {{chem|H|2}}(g) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C

[[Carbothermal reduction]] of silicon dioxide in nitrogen atmosphere at 1400–1450&amp;nbsp;°C has also been examined:&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; 
:3 {{chem|SiO|2}} + 6 C + 2 {{chem|N|2}} → {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} + 6 CO

The nitridation of silicon powder was developed in the 1950s, following the "rediscovery" of silicon nitride and was the first
large-scale method for powder production. However, use of low-purity raw silicon caused contamination of silicon nitride by [[silicate]]s and [[iron]]. The diimide decomposition results in amorphous silicon nitride, which needs further annealing under nitrogen at 1400–1500&amp;nbsp;°C to convert it to crystalline powder; this is now the second-most important route for commercial production. The carbothermal reduction was the earliest used method for silicon nitride production and is now considered as the most-cost-effective industrial route to high-purity silicon nitride powder.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

Electronic-grade silicon nitride films are formed using [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), or one of its variants, such as [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD):&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

For deposition of silicon nitride layers on semiconductor (usually silicon) substrates, two methods are used:&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;
#Low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technology, which works at rather high temperature and is done either in a vertical or in a horizontal tube furnace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crystec.com/kllcompe.htm|title =Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Comparison of vertical and horizontal tube furnaces in the semiconductor industry|work=crystec.com|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
#Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology, which works at rather low temperature and vacuum conditions.
The [[lattice constant]]s of silicon nitride and silicon are different. Therefore, [[tension (physics)|tension]] or [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] can occur, depending on the deposition process. Especially when using PECVD technology this tension can be reduced by adjusting deposition parameters.&lt;ref name=dep&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.crystec.com/kllnitre.htm|title = Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, deposition of silicon nitride layers|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon nitride [[nanowires]] can also be produced by [[sol-gel]] method using carbothermal [[Redox|reduction]] followed
by nitridation of [[silica gel]], which contains ultrafine carbon particles. The particles can be produced by decomposition of [[dextrose]] in the temperature range 1200–1350&amp;nbsp;°C. The possible synthesis reactions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Processing==
Silicon nitride is difficult to produce as a bulk material—it cannot be heated over 1850&amp;nbsp;°C, which is well below its [[melting point]], due to dissociation to silicon and nitrogen. Therefore, application of conventional [[Hot isostatic pressing|hot press sintering]] techniques is problematic. Bonding of silicon nitride powders can be achieved at lower temperatures through adding additional materials (sintering aids or "binders") which commonly induce a degree of liquid phase sintering.&lt;ref name=azom&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=53|title = Silicon Nitride – An Overview|accessdate = 2009-06-06|work=azom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cleaner alternative is to use [[spark plasma sintering]] where heating is conducted very rapidly (seconds) by passing pulses of electric current through the compacted powder. Dense silicon nitride compacts have been obtained by this techniques at temperatures 1500–1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

There exist three [[crystallographic]] structures of silicon nitride ({{chem|Si|3|N|4}}), designated as α, β and γ phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hardmaterials.de/html/alpha-si3n4__beta-si3n4.html|title = Crystal structures of Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|work=hardmaterials.de|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The α and β [[phase (matter)|phases]] are the most common forms of {{chem|Si|3|N|4}}, and can be produced under normal pressure condition.

[[File:Si3N4strength.jpg|thumb|230px]]
The α- and β-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}} have [[trigonal]] ([[Pearson symbol]] hP28, [[space group]] P31c, No. 159) and [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] (hP14, P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, No. 173) structures, respectively, which are built up by corner-sharing {{chem|SiN|4}} [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]]. They can be regarded as consisting of layers of silicon and nitrogen atoms in the sequence ABAB... or ABCDABCD... in β-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}} and α-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}}, respectively. The AB layer is the same in the α and β phases, and the CD layer in the α phase is related to AB by a c-glide plane. The {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} tetrahedra in β-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}} are interconnected in such a way that tunnels are formed, running parallel with the c axis of the unit cell. Due to the c-glide plane that relates AB to CD, the α structure contains cavities instead of tunnels. The cubic γ-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}} is often designated as c modification in the literature, in analogy with the cubic modification of [[boron nitride]] (c-BN). It has a [[spinel]]-type structure in which two silicon atoms each coordinate six nitrogen atoms octahedrally, and one silicon atom coordinates four nitrogen atoms tetrahedrally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peng|Peng]], pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer stacking sequence results in the α-phase having higher hardness than the β-phase. However, the α-phase is chemically unstable compared with the β-phase. At high temperatures when a liquid phase is present, the α-phase always transforms into the β-phase. Therefore, β-{{chem|Si|3|N|4}} is the major form used in {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==
In general, the main issue with applications of silicon nitride has not been technical performance, but cost. As the cost has come down, the number of production applications is accelerating.&lt;ref name=ornl&gt;{{cite book

===Automobile industry===
One of the major applications of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in [[diesel engine]]s, [[glowplug]]s for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; [[turbocharger]] for reduced engine lag and emissions. In [[spark-ignition engine]]s, silicon nitride is used for [[rocker arm]] pads for lower [[wear]], turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in [[Internal combustion engine|exhaust gas control valves]] for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=azom/&gt;&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt;

===Bearings===
[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; bearing parts]]
Silicon nitride bearings are both full ceramic bearings and [[Ball bearing#Ceramic hybrid ball bearings using ceramic balls|ceramic hybrid bearings]] with balls in ceramics and [[race (bearing)|races]] in steel. Silicon nitride [[ceramic]]s have good [[shock (mechanics)|shock]] resistance compared to other ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the main engines of the NASA's [[Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher =NASA|url = http://ipp.nasa.gov/innovation/Innovation15/CeramicBalls.html|title = Ceramic Balls Increase Shuttle Engine Bearing Life|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher =NASA|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/ssme.html
| title = Space Shuttle Main Engine Enhancements|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since silicon nitride ball bearings are harder than metal, this reduces contact with the bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings.&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt; Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than [[tungsten carbide]] balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings can be found in high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, [[wind turbine]]s, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and [[skateboard]]s. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.&lt;ref name=azom/&gt;

Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was first demonstrated as a superior bearing in 1972 but did not reach production until nearly 1990 because of challenges associated with reducing the cost.
Since 1990, the cost has been reduced substantially as production volume has increased. Although {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} bearings are still 2–5 times more expensive than the best steel bearings, their superior performance and life are justifying rapid adoption. Around 15–20&amp;nbsp;million {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} bearing balls were produced in the U.S. in 1996 for machine tools and many other applications. Growth is estimated at 40% per year, but could be even higher if ceramic bearings are selected for consumer applications such as in-line skates and computer disk drives.&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt;

===High-temperature material===
[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|Silicon nitride thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellants]]
Silicon nitride has long been used in high-temperature applications. In particular, it was identified as one of the few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320&amp;nbsp;°C material temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/5000/5130eckel.html |title=Silicon Nitride Rocket Thrusters Test Fired Successfully |date=1999 |author=Eckel, Andrew J. |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404161958/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1999/5000/5130eckel.html |archivedate=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 silicon nitride was used as the main material in the thrusters of the [[JAXA]] space probe [[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|Akatsuki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100706_akatsuki_e.html Orbit Control Maneuver Result of the Venus Climate Orbiter 'AKATSUKI'].

===Metal working and cutting tools===
The first major application of {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} was abrasive and [[cutting tool material|cutting tools]]. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride is used as a material for [[cutting tool]]s, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to [[wear]]. It is especially recommended for high speed [[machining]] of [[cast iron]]. Hot hardness, fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide.&lt;ref name=azom/&gt; The use of {{chem|Si|3|N|4}} cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, face milling of gray cast iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased tool life from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional [[tungsten carbide]] tools.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt;

[[File:Locos (microtechnology) process.svg|thumb|Example of [[LOCOS|local silicon oxidation]] through a Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mask]]
Silicon nitride is often used as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] and chemical barrier in manufacturing [[integrated circuits]], to electrically isolate different structures or as an [[Etching (microfabrication)|etch]] mask in [[bulk micromachining]]. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to [[silicon dioxide]], as it is a significantly better [[diffusion barrier]] against water molecules and [[sodium]] ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a [[dielectric]] between [[polysilicon]] layers in [[capacitor]]s in analog chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Not only silicon nitride, but also various ternary compounds of silicon, nitrogen and hydrogen (SiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) are used insulating layers. They are plasma deposited using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

:2 {{chem|SiH|4}}(g) + {{chem|N|2}}(g) → 2 SiNH(s) + 3 {{chem|H|2}}(g)
:{{chem|SiH|4}}(g) + {{chem|NH|3}}(g) → SiNH(s) + 3 {{chem|H|2}}(g)

These SiNH films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5&amp;nbsp;MV/cm).&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384|title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology

These silicon films are also thermally stable to high temperatures under specific physical conditions.
Silicon nitride is also used in [[Xerography|xerographic process]] as one of the layer of the photo drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Schein, L.B. |title = Electrophotography and Development Physics, Springer Series in Electrophysics|volume = 14|publisher = Springer-Verlag, Berlin |year = 1988|isbn=978-3-642-97085-6}}{{Page needed|add pages and/or choose chapter from http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-97085-6/page/1

(17 April 2001) "Ignition system for a gas appliance" {{US patent|6217312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its good elastic properties, silicon nitride, along with silicon and silicon oxide, is the most popular material for [[cantilever]]s — the sensing elements of [[atomic force microscope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 605|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SOt_yFjV-xwC|title = The materials science of thin films: deposition and structure|author = Ohring, M. |publisher =Academic Press|year = 2002|isbn = 0-12-524975-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first preparation was reported in 1857 by [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] and [[Friedrich Wöhler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jlac.18571040224|title=Ueber das Stickstoffsilicium|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=104|issue=2|pages=256|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their method, silicon was heated in a crucible placed inside another crucible packed with carbon to reduce permeation of oxygen to the inner crucible.  They reported a product they termed silicon nitride but without specifying its chemical composition.  [[Paul Schuetzenberger]] first reported a product with the composition of the tetranitride,  {{chem|Si|3|N|4}}, in 1879 that was obtained by heating silicon with brasque (a paste made by mixing charcoal, coal, or coke with clay which is then used to line crucibles) in a blast furnace.  In 1910, Ludwig Weiss and Theodor Engelhardt heated silicon under pure nitrogen to produce {{chem|Si|3|N|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Silicon nitride remained merely a chemical curiosity for decades before it was used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several [[patent]]s on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite journal

British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of [[gas turbine]]s and resulted in the development of reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] placed a US$17&amp;nbsp;million contract with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] for two ceramic gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 27|title = Ceramic Materials: Science and Engineering

Even though the properties of silicon nitride were well known, its natural occurrence was discovered only in the 1990s, as tiny inclusions (about 2&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] × 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm in size) in [[meteorite]]s. The mineral was named [[nierite]] after a pioneer of [[mass spectrometry]], [[Alfred O. C. Nier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Spider9 Inc.''' is an American, [[environmental technologies]] company headquartered in [[Northville, MI]] which develops and manufactures advanced [[control systems]] for [[energy storage]] and [[solar fields]]. It was founded in 2011 by Glynne Townsend ([[A123 Systems]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Townsend Company Team Profiles | url=http://www.thetownsendco.com/index_files/Page499.htm | date=July 2011 | accessdate= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Park (former Vice President of Production at Wave Crest Energy Systems), Dave Smith (former chairman of [[United States Council for Automotive Research|USABC]]), and Bill Beckman (former Vice President of Finance at [[Johnson Controls]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Consolidating cultures and strategies: Turning five companies into one | url=http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/consolidating-cultures-and-strategies-turning-five-companies-one | date=31 December 2010 | accessdate= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spider9 acquired control system technology from the [[University of Michigan]], Office of [[Technology Transfer]] and is developing the technology at their facilities at the Water Wheel Centre, in the historic [[Ford Valve Plant]].

== History ==
Spider9 was founded on control system technology patents licensed from the University of Michigan Real-Time Computing Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Regents of the University of Michigan|title=License Agreement|date=January 2012| volume=Files 4302, 4442, 4625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= Cleantech start up spider9 launches from the University of Michigan | url= http://www.thebatteryshow.com/cleantech-start-up-spider9-launches-from-the-university-of-michigan | date= March 2012| accessdate= March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2011, the Spider9 leadership team brought the technology out of the Office of Technology Transfer where it had been incubating. In July 2011, Spider9 pivoted the technology’s business plan to target [[grid energy storage]] and solar field optimization rather than electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Ann Arbor SPARK| title=Michigan Energy Forum: Advanced Energy Storage, October 25th in Novi, Michigan | url=http://snre.umich.edu/updates/2011-10-21/michigan_energy_forum_advanced_energy_storage_october_25th_in_novi_michigan | date=25 October 2011| accessdate=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 3, 2011, Spider9 received a Michigan [[Economic Development Corporation]] (MEDC) grant to install a solar field on the roof of the Water Wheel Centre in Northville, MI.

==Technology==
Spider9 systems are capable of reconfiguring the architecture of systems through in-house developed hardware and software algorithms. Using a Spider9 system, individual cells and panels are monitored and managed. The system architecture is dynamically reconfigured around the components to deliver a consistent voltage output, compensating for performance variances and failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tom Henderson | title= Spider9's technology helps customers keep the power flowing | url= http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20120304/SUB01/303049986/spider9s-technology-helps-customers-keep-the-power-flowing#

Mich spinout Spider9 offering dynamic control systems for grid-scale batteries and solar arrays | url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/03/u-mich-spinout-spider9-offering-dynamic-control-systems-for-grid-scale-batteries-and-solar-arrays.html
 | date= 20 March 2012| accessdate= March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
Spider9’s facilities are equipped with a [[waterwheel]] designed by [[Albert Kahn (architect)]] which once provided constant, sustainable [[hydroelectric]] power to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Ford Valve Plant (Northville) | url=http://detroit1701.org/Ford%20Valve%20Plant.html| date= December 2006| accessdate= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waterwheel no longer fulfills the electricity needs of the building. Spider9 is designing a control system for an 85&amp;nbsp;kW rooftop solar field with backup battery storage to supply the building with renewable power.

The '''Stonehenge Archer''' is the name given to a [[Bronze Age]] man whose body was discovered in the outer ditch of [[Stonehenge]].  Unlike most burials in the [[Stonehenge Landscape]], his body was not in a [[Tumulus|barrow]], although it did appear to have been deliberately and carefully buried in the ditch.

Examination of the [[skeleton]] indicated that the man was local to the area and aged about 30 when he died.  [[Radiocarbon]] dating suggests that he died around 2300 BCE, making his death roughly contemporary with the [[Amesbury Archer]] and the [[Boscombe Bowmen]] buried 3 miles away in [[Amesbury]].

He came to be known as an archer because of the [[stone wrist-guard]] and a number of [[flint]] [[arrowheads]] buried with him.  In fact, several of the arrowheads' tips were located in the skeleton's bones, suggesting that the man had been killed by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

His body was excavated in 1978 by [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] and [[John G. Evans (archaeologist)|John G. Evans]] who had been re-examining an older [[Trench#Archaeology|trench]] in the ditch and bank of Stonehenge.  His remains are now housed in the [[Salisbury Museum]] in [[Salisbury]].

He describes [[nature]] as a force previously independent of human beings, but which is now directly [[Human impact on the environment|affected by the actions of people]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the waves crash up against the beach, eroding dunes and destroying homes, it is not the awesome power of [[Mother Nature]].

'''''The Sacred Balance''''' is a book by environmentalist [[David Suzuki]], which is in its second edition as of 2007.  The book explores human society's impact on the natural world, both for the planet and the people living on it. Suzuki reveals how dependent humankind is upon the planet's water, soil, sunlight, and the breath of its vegetation.  Threats to the planet's balance, ranging from [[toxic pollution]] to [[global warming]] are also discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SFC/is_2007_Dec/ai_n24217603 The Sacred Balance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/books/books.php?id=6614 The Sacred Balance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Théophile Ernest de Donder''' ({{IPA-fr|də dɔ̃dɛʁ|lang}}; 19 August 1872 – 11 May 1957) was a [[Belgian]] mathematician and physicist famous for his work (published in 1923) in developing correlations between the Newtonian concept of [[chemical affinity]] and the Gibbsian concept of [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]].

==Education==
He received his doctorate in physics and mathematics from the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] in 1899, for a thesis entitled ''Sur la Théorie des Invariants Intégraux'' (''On the Theory of Integral Invariants'').&lt;ref&gt;Acad. Roy. Belg., Bull. Cl. Sc., page 169, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was professor between 1911 and 1942, at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]. Initially he continued the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Élie Cartan]]. From 1914 on, he was influenced by the work of [[Albert Einstein]] and was an enthusiastic proponent of the [[theory of relativity]]. He gained significant reputation in 1923, when he developed his definition of [[chemical affinity]]. He pointed out a connection between the [[chemical affinity]] and the [[Gibbs free energy]].

He is considered the father of [[thermodynamics]] of irreversible processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perrot | first = Pierre | title = A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-19-856556-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  De Donder’s work was later developed further by [[Ilya Prigogine]]. De Donder was an associate and friend of [[Albert Einstein]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15362">As used in [[mechanical engineering]], the term '''tractive force''' can either refer to the total [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] a vehicle exerts on a surface, or the amount of the total traction that is parallel to the direction of [[motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref&gt;SAE J2047, Tire Performance Technology, dated February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In railway engineering, the term '''tractive effort''' is often used [[synonym]]ously with tractive force to describe the pulling or pushing capability of a [[locomotive]].  In automotive engineering, the terms are distinctive:  [[tractive effort]] is generally higher than tractive force by the amount of [[rolling resistance]] present, and both terms are higher than the amount of [[drawbar pull]] by the total resistance present (including [[drag (physics)|air resistance]] and [[grade (slope)|grade]]).  The published tractive force value for any vehicle may be theoretical&amp;mdash;that is, calculated from known or implied mechanical properties&amp;mdash;or obtained via testing under controlled conditions.  The discussion herein covers the term's usage in mechanical applications in which the final stage of the power transmission system is one or more [[wheel]]s in [[friction]]al contact with a [[roadway]] or [[railroad track]].

==Defining tractive effort==
The term '''tractive effort''' is often qualified as '''starting tractive effort''', '''continuous tractive effort''' and '''maximum tractive effort'''.  These terms apply to different operating conditions, but are related by common mechanical factors: [[torque|input torque]] to the driving wheels, the wheel diameter, [[coefficient of friction]] ('''μ''') between the driving wheels and supporting surface, and the weight applied to the driving wheels ('''m''').  The [[product (mathematics)|product]] of '''μ''' and '''m''' is the [[factor of adhesion]], which determines the maximum torque that can be applied before the onset of [[wheelspin]] or [[locomotive wheelslip|wheelslip]].

*'''Starting tractive effort''': Starting tractive effort is the tractive force that can be generated at a standstill.  This figure is important on railways because it determines the maximum train weight that a locomotive can set into motion.
*'''Maximum tractive effort''': Maximum tractive effort is defined as the highest tractive force that can be generated under any condition that is not injurious to the vehicle or machine.  In most cases, maximum tractive effort is developed at low speed and may be the same as the starting tractive effort.
*'''Continuous tractive effort''': Continuous tractive effort is the tractive force that can be maintained indefinitely, as distinct from the higher tractive effort that can be maintained for a limited period of time before the power transmission system overheats. Due to the relationship between [[power (physics)|power]] (''P''), velocity (''v'') and force (''F''), described as:

:''P'' = ''vF''  or  ''P''/''v'' = ''F''

: tractive effort inversely varies with speed at any given level of available power.  Continuous tractive effort is often shown in graph form at a range of speeds as part of a '''tractive effort curve'''.&lt;ref name=dynamics/&gt;

Vehicles having a [[fluid coupling|hydrodynamic coupling]], [[torque converter|hydrodynamic torque multiplier]] or [[electric motor]] as part of the power transmission system may also have a '''maximum continuous tractive effort''' rating, which is the highest tractive force that can be produced for a short period of time without causing component harm.  The period of time for which the maximum continuous tractive effort may be safely generated is usually limited by thermal considerations. such as temperature rise in a [[traction motor]].

==Tractive effort curves==

Specifications of locomotives often include tractive effort curves,&lt;ref name=railpage/&gt;&lt;ref name=voith/&gt;&lt;ref name=vossloh/&gt;&lt;ref name=siemens/&gt; showing the relationship between tractive effort and velocity.

[[File:Schematic tractive effort curve.JPG|thumb|500px|Diagram of tractive effort versus speed for a hypothetical locomotive with power at rail of ~7000 kW]]

The shape of the graph is shown at right. The line AB shows operation at the maximum tractive effort, the line BC shows continuous tractive effort that is inversely proportional to speed (constant power).&lt;ref name=marks/&gt;

Tractive effort curves often have graphs of [[rolling resistance]] superimposed on them—the intersection of the rolling resistance graph&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The graphs typically show rolling resistance for standard train lengths or weights, on the level or on an uphill gradient&lt;/ref&gt; and tractive effort graph gives the maximum velocity (when net tractive effort is zero).

==Rail vehicles==

In order to start a train and accelerate it to a given speed, the locomotive(s) must develop sufficient tractive force to overcome the train's drag (resistance to motion), which is a combination of [[inertia]], [[axle]] [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] [[friction]], the friction of the wheels on the rails (which is substantially greater on curved track than on tangent track), and the force of [[gravity]] if on a [[grade (slope)|grade]].  Once in motion, the train will develop additional drag as it accelerates due to [[aerodynamic force]]s, which increase with the square of the speed.  Drag may also be produced at speed due to [[hunting oscillation|truck (bogie) hunting]], which will increase the rolling friction between wheels and rails.  If acceleration continues, the train will eventually attain a speed at which the available tractive force of the locomotive(s) will exactly offset the total drag, causing acceleration to cease.  This top speed will be increased on a downgrade due to gravity assisting the motive power, and will be decreased on an upgrade due to gravity opposing the motive power.

Tractive effort can be theoretically calculated from a locomotive's mechanical characteristics (e.g., steam pressure, weight, etc.), or by actual testing with [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] [[strain gauge|strain sensor]]s and a [[dynamometer car]].  Power at rail is a railway term for the available power for traction, that is, the power that is available to propel the train.

===Steam locomotives===
An estimate for the tractive effort of a single cylinder steam locomotive can be obtained from the cylinder pressure, cylinder bore, [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] of the piston&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Half the stroke distance is about the same as the radial distance from the coupling of the driving rod to the centre of the driven wheel&lt;/ref&gt; and the diameter of the wheel. The torque developed by the linear motion of the piston depends on the angle that the driving rod makes with the tangent of the radius on the driving wheel.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The relationship is: Torque = Force&lt;sub&gt;piston&lt;/sub&gt; x ''R'' (the radial distance to the point of connection of the driving rod) x cos(''A''), where ''A'' is the angle the driving rod makes with the tangent to the radius from wheel centre to driving rod attachment&lt;/ref&gt; For a more useful value an average value over the rotation of the wheel is used. The driving force is the torque divided by the wheel radius.

As an approximation, the following formula can be used (for a two-cylinder locomotive):&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As with any physical formula, [[units of measurement]] must be consistent: pressure in psi and lengths in inches give tractive effort in lbf, while pressure in Pa and lengths in metres give tractive effort in N.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac {d^2sp} {w}\times0.85&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allan| first = Ian | title = British Railways Locomotives Combined Volume | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd | date = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where
* ''t'' is tractive effort
* ''d'' is the [[piston]] diameter in inches ([[bore (engine)|bore]])
* ''s'' is the piston stroke in inches
* ''p'' is the working pressure in [[Pounds per square inch]]
* ''w'' is the diameter of driving wheel in inches

The constant 0.85 was the [[Association of American Railroads]] (AAR) standard for such calculations, and overestimated the efficiency of some locomotives and underestimated that of others. Modern locomotives with roller bearings were probably underestimated.

European designers used a constant of 0.6 instead of 0.85, so the two cannot be compared without a conversion factor.  In Britain main-line railways generally used a constant of 0.85 but builders of industrial locomotives often used a lower figure, typically 0.75.

The constant ''c'' also depends on the cylinder dimensions and the time at which the steam inlet valves are open; if the steam inlet valves are closed immediately after obtaining full cylinder pressure the piston force can be expected to have dropped to less than half the initial force.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Gas laws]] for an explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; giving a low ''c'' value. If the cylinder valves are left open for longer the value of ''c'' will rise nearer to one.

;Three or four cylinders (simple)
The result should be multiplied by 1.5 for a three-cylinder locomotive and by two for a four-cylinder locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;''Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives'', winter 1960/61 edition, part 1, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

;Multiple cylinders (compound)
For other numbers and combinations of cylinders, including double and triple expansion engines the tractive effort can be estimated by adding the tractive efforts due to the individual cylinders at their respective pressures and cylinder strokes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The value of the constant ''c'' for a low-pressure cylinder is taken to be 0.80 when the value for a high-pressure cylinder is taken to be 0.85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Values and comparisons for steam locomotives====

Tractive effort is the figure often quoted when comparing the powers of steam locomotives, but is misleading because tractive effort shows the ability to start a train, not the ability to haul it. Possibly the highest tractive effort ever claimed was for the [[Virginian Railway]]'s 2-8-8-8-4 Triplex locomotive, which in [[Steam engine#Simple expansion|simple expansion]] mode had a calculated starting T.E. of 199,560&amp;nbsp;lbf (887.7&amp;nbsp;kN) &amp;mdash; but the boiler could not produce enough steam to haul at speeds over 5&amp;nbsp;mph (8&amp;nbsp;km/h).

Of more successful steam locomotives, those with the highest rated starting tractive effort were the Virginian Railway AE-class [[2-10-10-2]]s, at 176,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (783&amp;nbsp;kN) in simple-expansion mode (or 162,200&amp;nbsp;lb if calculated by the usual formula). The [[Union Pacific]] [[Union Pacific Big Boy|Big Boys]] had a starting T.E. of 135,375&amp;nbsp;lbf (602&amp;nbsp;kN); the [[Norfolk &amp; Western]]'s Y5, Y6, Y6a, and Y6b class  [[2-8-8-2]]s had a starting T.E. of 152,206&amp;nbsp;lbf (677&amp;nbsp;kN) in simple expansion mode (later modified to 170,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (756&amp;nbsp;kN), claim some enthusiasts); and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s freight [[Duplex (locomotive)|Duplex]] [[PRR Q2|Q2]] attained 114,860&amp;nbsp;lbf (510.9&amp;nbsp;kN, including booster) &amp;mdash; the highest for a rigid framed locomotive. Later two-cylinder passenger locomotives were generally 40,000 to 80,000&amp;nbsp;lbf (170 to 350&amp;nbsp;kN) of T.E.

===Diesel and electric locomotives===

For an [[electric locomotive]] or a [[diesel-electric locomotive]], starting tractive effort can be calculated from the amount of weight on the driving wheels (which may be less than the total locomotive weight in some cases), combined [[stall torque]] of the [[traction motor]]s, the [[gear#Spur|gear ratio]] between the traction motors and axles, and driving wheel [[diameter]].  For a [[diesel-hydraulic locomotive]], the starting tractive effort is affected by the stall torque of the [[torque converter]], as well as gearing, wheel diameter and locomotive weight.

Freight locomotives are designed to produce higher maximum tractive effort than passenger units of equivalent power, necessitated by the much higher weight that is typical of a freight train.  In modern locomotives, the gearing between the traction motors and axles is selected to suit the type of service in which the unit will be operated.  As traction motors have a maximum speed at which they can rotate without incurring damage, gearing for higher tractive effort is at the expense of top speed.  Conversely, the gearing used with passenger locomotives favors speed over maximum tractive effort.

Electric locomotives with [[monomotor]] [[bogie]]s are sometimes fitted with two-speed gearing.  This allows higher tractive effort for hauling freight trains but at reduced speed. Examples include the SNCF classes [[SNCF Class BB 8500|BB 8500]] and [[SNCF Class BB 25500|BB 25500]].

[[File:Flow separation in a river.JPG|thumbnail|Just beyond the Swartswood Lake Dam, the river is forced to narrow by a concrete bridge support. Flow separation is clearly evident at the sharp bend, just above the vena contracta]]

'''Vena contracta''' is the point in a fluid stream where the diameter of the stream is the least, and fluid velocity is at its maximum, such as in the case of a stream issuing out of a [[nozzle]], ([[:wikt:orifice|orifice]]). ([[Evangelista Torricelli]], 1643). It is a place where the cross section area is minimum. The maximum contraction takes place at a section slightly downstream of the orifice, where the jet is more or less horizontal.

The effect is also observed in flow from a tank into a pipe, or a sudden contraction in pipe diameter. Streamlines will converge just downstream of the diameter change, and a region of [[separated flow]] occurs from the sharp corner of the diameter change and extends past the vena contracta.

==Explanation==
The reason for this phenomenon is that fluid streamlines cannot abruptly change direction. In the case of both the free jet and the sudden pipe diameter change, the streamlines are unable to closely follow the sharp angle in the pipe/tank wall. The converging streamlines follow a smooth path, which results in the narrowing of the jet (or primary pipe flow) observed.

==Echocardiography==
Measurement of the vena contracta is useful in [[echocardiography]], where it describes the smallest area of the blood flow jet as it exits a heart valve. This corresponds to the Effective Orifice Area calculated for heart valves using the continuity equation.

==Shotguns==
'''Vena Contracta''' was also a term used by several English shotgun builders of the 19th and 20th Century. The gun barrels of sporting shotguns tapered very heavily from the breech to the muzzle. Thus a gun with a 12 bore breech would have a 20 bore muzzle. The idea was to retain the advantages a heavy-hitting large bore shotgun while retaining the lesser recoil and easy maneuverability of a small bore. Several leading firms built this type of gun but it proved unpopular and most were returned to the manufacturers for large bore barrels. To most shooters perhaps the idea of placing a 12 bore cartridge into a 20 bore barrel was too "explosive". Complete functioning examples are now rare, though they are still not highly sought after.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Coefficient of contraction==
It is the ratio between the area of the jet at the vena contracta to the area of the contracted flow section

C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = Area at vena contracta/ Area of orifice

The typical value may be taken as 0.64 for a sharp orifice (concentric with the flow channel). The smaller the value, the more effect the vena contracta has.

'''Vitino''' ({{lang-ru|Витино}}) is an oil port on the [[White Sea]] in [[Russia]]. It is located near [[Beloye More (rural locality)|Beloye More]] railway station, a few kilometers south of [[Kandalaksha]], [[Murmansk Oblast]], on the western shore of [[Kandalaksha Gulf]].

The port started operations in 1995, and since 2001 has been operating year-round. Its principal activity is transfer of oil and oil products arriving by rail from [[Russia]]'s [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] to seagoing [[petroleum tanker|oil tankers]] for export.
In 2004, 3.7 million tons of oil and oil products were handled by the port. Its full capacity at the time was 8 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barentswatch.com/oilandgas/rapp/Rep-Svanhovd_rus.pdf Microsoft Word - Rep-Svanhovd_rus.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The port can handle seagoing tankers with displacement up to 40,000 and with the dimensions up to:
* Length: 230 m,
* Beam – 32 m,
* Draft – 10.9 m.
There are also two piers for handling smaller sea-and-river going boats

The '''Western Climate Initiative''', or WCI, was started in February 2007 by the governors of five western U.S. states ([[Arizona]], [[California]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]],  and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]) with the goal of developing a multi-sector, market-based program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

==History==
The '''Western Climate Initiative''', or WCI, was started in February 2007 by the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington to evaluate and implement ways to reduce their states's emissions of greenhouse gases and achieve related co-benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/document-archives/general/WCI-Governors-Agreement|title=WCI Governors' Agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These states and future participants in the initiative (collectively known as WCI "partners") also committed to set an overall regional goal to reduce emissions (set in August 2007 as 15 percent below 2005 emission levels by 2020),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/document-archives/general/Emission-Reduction-Goal-Aug-2007|title=Emission Reduction Goal Aug 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; participate in a cross-border greenhouse gas registry to consistently measure and track emissions, and adopt clean tailpipe standards for passenger vehicles.  By July 2008, the initiative had expanded to include two more U.S. states (Montana and Utah) and four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).  Together, these partners comprised 20 percent of U.S. GDP and 76 percent of Canadian GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/document-archives/general/WCI-Brochure-(May-2010)|title=WCI Brochure (May 2010)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and design==
The most ambitious and controversial objective of the WCI was to develop a multi-sector, market-based program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Detailed design recommendations for a regional [[Emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were released by the WCI in September 2008 and July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/component/remository/general|title=General Documents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 2011, California and Quebec adopted regulations based on these recommendations.  (The WCI has no regulatory authority of its own.)  Key administrative aspects of the regional cap-and-trade program are being implemented in 2012.  Power plants, refineries, and other large emitters must comply with the cap in 2013.  Other greenhouse gas emission sources, such as suppliers of transportation fuels, must comply with the cap beginning in 2015. Among other things, the Western Climate Initiative lays the foundation for a North American cap-and-trade program, not only in its design and implementation, but in its potential acceptance of greenhouse gas [[Carbon offsets|emissions offsets]] from projects across North America.

==Criticisms of WCI==
Some observers described the entire project as [[greenwash]] designed to avoid committing to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and cited evidence that much more drastic cuts, up to 40%, could be achieved without affecting investment yield in equities, a good indicator that such cuts would not affect economic prospects in the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqLwy4is53AC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=greenwash%20Western%20Climate%20Initiative&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Ag9Phw1HC&amp;sig=co3c36bKxLaXP1Bf2zO-GwE0FEc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PX7zTqnWNarw0gHf08jHAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Myths and Realities of Business Environmentalism: Good Works, Good Business Or Greenwash?|first=Kurt A.|last=Strasser|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners vs. observers==
Several U.S. partners, although active participants in the design of the program, announced in 2010 that they would either delay or not implement the program in their jurisdictions.  The partnership was therefore streamlined to include only California and the four Canadian provinces actively working to implement the program.  As of January 2012, regulations have not been issued by British Columbia, Manitoba, or Ontario, although a carbon tax in British Columbia will be increasing to $30/tonne of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents]] in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin.gov.bc.ca/tbs/tp/climate/A4.htm|title=Province of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several WCI partners also remain active in the [[International Carbon Action Partnership]], an international coordinating body for several such regional carbon trading bodies.

[[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] object to cap-and-trade and in July 2008 called WCI's plan a "cash grab by some of Canada's resource-poor provinces."&lt;ref name="dose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dose.ca/news/story.html?id=9ff531b5-1a6e-4864-8256-466a637b128f|title=Ontario to sign cap-and-trade climate plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Alberta has legislated a small restricted carbon charge of its own.  The objections seem to be more related to the reporting and disclosure requirements that would be much higher for a North American project than for one based strictly in Alberta.   Some of the states that withdrew by late 2011 also intended to develop [[oil shale]], [[hydraulic fracturing]] of [[natural gas]] and [[coal]] resources that would have broad impacts beyond climate on water, including more ocean acidification.

Until late 2011, the initiative included two types of participants: partners and observers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/events/2007-08-30_wci/2007-08_WCU_UPDATE.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, the partners were the [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]], [[Montana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]].  All states except California withdrew in 2011.  ''See below re membership.''

The observers included at various times [[Alaska]], [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Kansas]], [[Nevada]], [[Wyoming]], the province of [[Saskatchewan]] (which objects to WCI plans for a [[cap and trade]] system&lt;ref name="dose"/&gt;), and the [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Baja California]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Sonora]] and [[Tamaulipas]].

'''William Dampier''' (baptised 5 September 1651;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58702944 |title=Out of the Library |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth, W.A. |date=3 September 1933 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |page=17, Sect. A |publisher=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; died March 1715) was an English explorer and navigator who became the first Englishman to explore parts of what is today [[Australia]], and the first person to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the world three times. He has also been described as Australia's first natural historian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George |first=Alexander S. |year=1999 |title=William Dampier in New Holland: Australia's First Natural Historian |location=Hawthorn, Vic. |publisher=Bloomings Books |isbn=978-187-64-7312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the most important British explorers of the period between [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[James Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preston |first1=Diana |last2=Preston |first2=Michael |lastauthoramp = y |year=2005 |title=A Pirate of Exquisite Mind: The Life of William Dampier |location=New York |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=978-038-56-0705-6 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After impressing the [[Admiralty]] with his book ''A New Voyage Round the World'', Dampier was given command of a [[Royal Navy]] ship and made important discoveries in western Australia, before being court-martialled for cruelty. On a later voyage he rescued [[Alexander Selkirk]], a former crewmate who may have inspired [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''. Others influenced by Dampier include [[James Cook]], [[Horatio Nelson]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

==Early Life==
William Dampier was born at [[Hymerford House]] in [[East Coker]], [[Somerset]], in 1651. He was baptised on 5 September, but his precise date of birth is not recorded. He was educated at [[King's School, Bruton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ Somerset Archives]. Records of King's School, Bruton.&lt;/ref&gt; Dampier sailed on two merchant voyages to [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] and [[Java]] before joining the [[Royal Navy]] in 1673. He took part in the two [[Battle of Schooneveld|Battles of Schooneveld]] in June of that year.

Dampier's service was cut short by a catastrophic illness, and he returned to England for several months of recuperation. For the next several years he tried his hand at various careers, including plantation management in [[Jamaica]] and logging in Mexico, before he eventually joined another sailing expedition.&lt;ref name=Cordingly&gt;{{cite book |last=Cordingly |first=David |title=Under the Black Flag |year=2006 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |page=83 |isbn=978-081-29-7722-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to England, he married Judith around 1679, only to leave for the sea a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Preston &amp; Preston, ch. III&lt;/ref&gt;

==First circumnavigation==
[[File:Dampier Mosquito.gif|thumb|left|alt=Engraved map of Central America|Map from Dampier's ''A New Voyage Round the World'' of 1697, with a star marking the [[Mosquito Coast|"Miskito" coast]]]]
In 1679, Dampier joined the crew of the [[buccaneer]] Captain [[Bartholomew Sharp]] on the [[Spanish Main]] of Central America, twice visiting the [[Bay of Campeche]], or "Campeachy" as it was then known, on the north coast of Mexico.&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/943/000096655/ |title=William Dampier |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his first circumnavigation, during which he accompanied a raid across the [[Darién Province|Isthmus of Darién]] in Panama and took part in the capture of Spanish ships on the Pacific coast of that isthmus. The pirates then raided Spanish settlements in [[Peru]] before returning to the Caribbean.
 
Dampier made his way to [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], where in 1683 he was engaged by the [[privateer]] John Cooke. Cooke entered the Pacific via [[Cape Horn]] and spent a year raiding Spanish possessions in Peru, the [[Galápagos Islands]], and Mexico.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; This expedition collected buccaneers and ships as it went along, at one time having a fleet of ten vessels. Cooke died in Mexico, and a new leader, [[Edward Davis (buccaneer)|Edward Davis]], was elected [[captain (nautical)|captain]] by the crew, taking the ship ''Batchelor's Delight'', with future Captain [[George Raynor (pirate)|George Raynor]] in the crew.&lt;ref name="Vallar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallar|first1=Cindy|title=Pirates &amp; Privateers: the History of Maritime Piracy - A Buccaneer More Interested in Nature than Gold|url=http://www.cindyvallar.com/Dampier.html|website=www.cindyvallar.com|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dampier transferred to the privateer [[Charles Swan (pirate)|Charles Swan]]'s ship, ''Cygnet'', and on 31 March 1686 they set out across the Pacific to raid the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], calling at [[Guam]] and [[Mindanao]]. Spanish witnesses saw the predominantly English crew as not only pirates and heretics but also cannibals. Leaving Swan and 36 others behind on Mindanao, the rest of the privateers sailed on to [[Manila]], [[Côn Sơn Island|Poulo Condor]], China, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], and [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Contrary to Dampier's later claim that he had not actively participated in actual piratical attacks during this voyage, he was in fact selected in 1687 to command one of the Spanish ships captured by ''Cygnet''{{'}}s crew off Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=López-Lázaro |first=Fabio |title=The Misfortunes of Alonso Ramírez: The True Adventures of a Spanish American with 17th-Century Pirates |year=2011 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, Texas |pages=29–30 |isbn=978-029-27-4389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 1688, ''Cygnet'' "anchored two miles from shore in 29 fathoms" on the northwest coast of Australia, near [[King Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, J. H.

They obtained a small canoe which they modified after first capsizing and then, after surviving a great storm at sea, called at "Acheen" ([[Aceh]]) in [[Sumatra]].

Dampier returned to England in 1691 via the [[Cape of Good Hope]], penniless but in possession of his journals. He also had as a source of income a slave known as Prince Jeoly (or Giolo), from [[Miangas]] (now Indonesia), who became famous for his tattoos (or "paintings" as they were known at the time). Dampier exhibited Jeoly in [[London]], thereby also generating publicity for a book based on his diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes |first=Geraldine |year=2006 |title=Curiosity, Wonder, and William Dampier's Painted Prince |journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=31–50 |doi=10.1353/jem.2006.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage, John (c. 1692).

==''Roebuck'' expedition==

The publication of the book, ''A New Voyage Round the World'', in 1697 was a popular sensation, creating interest at the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The New World Voyages of William Dampier |journal=Athena Review |volume=1 |issue=2 |url=http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/sunshine/235/dampier-ing.htm |accessdate=8 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000306142148/http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/sunshine/235/dampier-ing.htm |archivedate=6 March 2000 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699, Dampier was given command of the 26-gun warship {{HMS|Roebuck|1690|6}}, with a commission from King [[William III of England|William III]] (who had ruled jointly with Queen [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] until her death in 1694).&lt;ref name="adob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010265b.htm |title=Dampier, William (1651–1715) |author=Bach, J. |year=1966 |publisher=''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' |accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mission was to explore the east coast of New Holland, the name given by the Dutch to what is now Australia, and Dampier's intention was to travel there via [[Cape Horn]].

The expedition set out on 14 January 1699, too late in the season to attempt the Horn, so it headed to New Holland via the Cape of Good Hope instead. Following the Dutch route to the Indies, Dampier passed between [[Dirk Hartog Island]] and the Western Australian mainland into what he called [[Shark Bay]] on 6 August 1699. He landed and began producing the first known detailed record of Australian flora and fauna. The botanical drawings that were made are believed to be by his clerk, James Brand. Dampier then followed the coast north-east, reaching the [[Dampier Archipelago]] and [[Lagrange Bay]], just south of what is now called [[Broome, Western Australia|Roebuck Bay]], all the while recording and collecting specimens, including many shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marchant |first=Leslie R. |title=An Island Unto Itself: William Dampier and New Holland |year=1988 |publisher=Hesperian Press |location=Victoria Park, W.A. |isbn=978-085-90-5120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he bore northward for [[Timor]]. Then he sailed east and on 3 December 1699 rounded New Guinea, which he passed to the north. He traced the south-eastern coasts of [[New Hanover Island|New Hanover]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]], [[nautical chart|charting]] the [[Dampier Strait (Papua New Guinea)|Dampier Strait]] between these islands (now the [[Bismarck Archipelago]]) and New Guinea.

By this time, ''Roebuck'' was in such bad condition that Dampier was forced to abandon his plan to examine the east coast of New Holland while less than a hundred miles from it. In danger of sinking, he attempted to make the return voyage to England, but the ship foundered at [[Ascension Island]] on 21 February 1701.&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; While anchored offshore the ship began to take on more water and the carpenter could do nothing with the [[Shipworm|worm]]-eaten planking. As a result, the vessel had to be run aground. Dampier's crew was marooned there for five weeks before being picked up on 3&amp;nbsp;April by an [[East Indiaman]] and returned home in August 1701.

Although many papers were lost with ''Roebuck'', Dampier was able to save some new charts of coastlines, and his record of [[trade wind]]s and [[Current (ocean)|currents]] in the seas around Australia and New Guinea. He also preserved a few of his specimens. Many plant specimens were donated to the [[Fielding-Druce Herbarium]] (part of the [[University of Oxford]]), and in September 1999, they were then loaned to Western Australia for the 300 year celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Edwards {{google books|fQiwlGvANE8C|The Buccaneer's Bell|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the ''Roebuck'' wreck was located in [[Clarence Bay]], Ascension Island, by a team from the [[Western Australian Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Michael (2002).

Fremantle, W.A.: Western Australian Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his widespread influence, and also because so little exists that can now be linked to him, it has been argued that the remains of his ship and the objects still at the site on Ascension Island – while the property of Britain and subject to the island government's management – are actually the shared maritime heritage of those parts of the world first visited or described by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Michael |year=2004 |title=HM Ship Roebuck (1690–1701): Global Maritime Heritage? |journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=330–337 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2004.00005.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His account of the expedition was published as ''A Voyage to New Holland'' in 1703.

==Court martial==
On his return from the ''Roebuck'' expedition, Dampier was [[court-martial]]led for [[cruelty]].&lt;ref name="adob"/&gt; On the outward voyage, Dampier had his [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|lieutenant]], George Fisher, removed from the ship and jailed in Brazil. Fisher returned to England and complained about his treatment to the Admiralty. Dampier aggressively defended his conduct, but he was found guilty. His pay for the voyage was docked, and he was dismissed from the [[Royal Navy]].

According to records held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK's National Archives]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ The National Archives]. Records of the Navy Board and the Board of Admiralty. Item reference ADM 1/5262/287.&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal Navy court martial held on 8 June 1702 involved the following three charges:

#William Dampier, Captain, HMS ''Roebuck''.
#:Crime: Death of John Norwood, boatswain.
#:Verdict: Acquitted.
#William Dampier, Captain, HMS ''Roebuck''.
#:Crime: Hard and cruel usage of the lieutenant.
#:Verdict: Guilty.
#:Sentence: Forfeit all pay due and deemed unfit to command any of His Majesty's ships.
#George Fisher, Lieutenant, HMS ''Roebuck''
#:Crime: Dispute between the captain and the lieutenant.
#:Verdict: Acquitted.

==Second circumnavigation==
[[File:William Dampier Ecuador2006.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A one-dollar postage stamp portrays Dampier, a Jolly Roger and a sailing ship|An Ecuadorian stamp issued in 2006 commemorates Dampier's piracy in the South Pacific]]
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] had broken out in 1701, and English privateers were being readied to act against French and Spanish interests. Dampier was appointed commander of the 26-gun ship ''St George'', with a crew of 120 men. They were joined by the 16-gun ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'' with 63 men, and sailed on 11 September 1703 from [[Kinsale]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Voyage Round the World, Containing an Account of Captain Dampier's Expedition into the South Seas in the Ship St George in the Years 1703 and 1704 |first=William |last=Funnell |year=1707 |publisher=W. Botham |location=London |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships made a storm-tossed passage round Cape Horn, arriving at the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] off the coast of Chile in February 1704.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; While watering and provisioning there, they sighted a heavily armed French merchantman, which they engaged in a seven-hour battle but were driven off.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dampier succeeded in capturing a number of small Spanish ships along the coast of Peru, but released them after removing only a fraction of their cargoes because he believed they "would be a hindrance to his greater designs."&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp. 31–32, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The greater design he had in mind was a raid on Santa María, a town on the [[Gulf of Panama]] rumoured to hold stockpiles of gold from nearby mines. When the force of seamen he led against the town met with unexpectedly strong resistance, however, he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp. 39, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1704, ''Cinque Ports'' separated from ''St George'' and, after putting [[Alexander Selkirk]] ashore alone on an island for complaining about the vessel's seaworthiness, sank off the coast of what is today Colombia. Some of its crew survived being shipwrecked but were made prisoners of the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Cruising Voyage Round the World: First to the South-Sea, Thence to the East-Indies, and Homewards by the Cape of Good Hope |first=Woodes |last=Rogers |year=1712 |publisher=B. Lintot |location=London |pages=145, 333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was now left to ''St George'' to make an attempt on the [[Manila galleon]], the main object of the expedition. The ship was sighted on 6 December 1704, probably ''Nuestra Señora del Rosario''. It was caught unprepared and had not run out its guns. But while Dampier and his officers argued over the best way to mount an attack, the galleon got its guns loaded and the battle was joined. ''St George'' soon found itself out-sized by the galleon's [[18-pounder long gun|18-]] and [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]], and, suffering serious damage, they were forced to break off the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to capture the Spanish galleon completed the break-up of the expedition. Dampier, with about thirty men, stayed in ''St George'', while the rest of the crew took a captured [[barque]] across the Pacific to [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]] in the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch settlements]]. The undermanned and worm-damaged ''St George'' had to be abandoned on the coast of Peru. He and his remaining men embarked in a Spanish [[Prize ship|prize]] for the East Indies, where they were thrown into prison as pirates by their supposed allies the Dutch but later released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels |first=Robert |last=Kerr |publisher=William Blackwood |location=Edinburgh |volume=10 |year=1824 |page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now without a ship, Dampier made his way back to England at the end of 1707.

==Third circumnavigation and death==
In 1708, Dampier was engaged to serve on the privateer ''Duke'', not as captain but as [[sailing master]].&lt;ref name="adob"/&gt; ''Duke'' beat its way into the South Pacific Ocean round Cape Horn in consort with a second ship, ''Duchess''.&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (1707), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Commanded by [[Woodes Rogers]], this voyage was more successful: Selkirk was rescued on 2 February 1709,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1712), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; and the expedition amassed £147,975&lt;ref name="souls"&gt;{{cite book |title=Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors |first=Edward E. |last=Leslie |publisher=Mariner Books |location=New York |year=1988 |page=83 |isbn=978-039-54-7864-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|147975|1713|r=-5}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} worth of plundered goods. Most of that came from the capture of a Spanish galleon, ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño|Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño]]'', along the coast of Mexico in December 1709.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1712), pp. 293–294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1710, Dampier crossed the Pacific in ''Duke'', accompanied by ''Duchess'' and two prizes. They stopped at Guam before arriving in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. Following a refit at Horn Island (near Batavia) and the sale of one of their prize ships, they sailed for the Cape of Good Hope where they remained for more than three months awaiting a [[convoy]]. They left the Cape in company with 25 Dutch and English ships, with Dampier now serving as sailing master of ''Encarnación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Cooke |year=1712 |title=A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, Performed in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711 |volume=2 |publisher=B.

Dampier may not have lived to receive all of his share of the expedition's gains.&lt;ref name="souls"/&gt; He died in the [[St Stephen Coleman Street|Parish of St Stephen Coleman Street]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Biographical Sketch of Captain Dampier |journal=United Service Journal |date=July 1837 |first=William Henry |last=Smyth |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date and circumstances of his death, and his final resting place, are all unknown.

Future Museum of Southwest Scotland. Retrieved 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Daniel Defoe]], author of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', was likely inspired by accounts of real-life [[castaway]] [[Alexander Selkirk]], a crew member on Dampier's voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Severin |year=2002 |title=In Search of Robinson Crusoe |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages=17–19 |isbn=978-046-50-7698-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jonathan Swift]] explicitly mentions Dampier in his ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' as a mariner comparable to [[Lemuel Gulliver]].&lt;ref name="ocean"&gt;[http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/pirate-who-collected-plants/famous-people-dampier-influenced "The Pirate Who Collected Plants: Famous People Dampier Influenced"]. Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 29&amp;nbsp;September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* His notes on the fauna and flora of north-western Australia were studied by naturalist and scientist [[Joseph Banks]],&lt;ref name="wam" /&gt; who made further studies during the first voyage with James Cook. This helped lead to the naming of and colonisation of [[Botany Bay]] and the founding of modern Australia.
* His reports on [[breadfruit]] led to [[William Bligh]]'s ill-fated voyage in [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookandlearn.com/blog/21798/captain-bligh-introduced-breadfruit-to-the-west-indies/ "Captain Bligh Introduced Breadfruit to the West Indies"]. ''Look and Learn''. Retrieved 29&amp;nbsp;September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another storied crew mate of Dampier, [[Simon Hatley]], who is best remembered for shooting an albatross while his ship battled storms off Cape Horn, influenced the writing of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |year=1989 |title=Coleridge: Early Visions, 1772–1804 |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=978-067-08-0444-3 |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* His observations and analysis of [[natural history]] helped [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Charles Darwin]] develop their scientific theories.&lt;ref name="ocean"/&gt;
* His observations (and those of Mr William Funnell) during his expeditions are mentioned several times by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in his book ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', and compared to his own observations made on his 19th-century voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Alfred R. |year=1869 |title=The Malay Archipelago: The Land of the Orangutan, and the Bird of Paradise—A Narrative of Travel, with Sketches of Man and Nature |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |pages=196, 205, 300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He is cited over 80 times in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', notably on words such as "[[barbecue]]", "[[avocado]]", "[[chopsticks]]" and "[[sub-species]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Adrian |title=Dampier's Monkey: the South Seas Voyages of William Dampier |year=2010 |publisher=Wakefield Press |location=Kent Town, S.A. |isbn=978-186-25-4759-9 |pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   That is not to say he coined the words, but his use of them in his writings is the first known example in English.

==Negative depiction of Aborigines==
In his journal, 'A New Voyage Around The World', Dampier depicted the first inhabitants of Australia as virtually subhuman, likening them to monkeys and calling them the "miserabilist" people he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How explorer and pirate William Dampier's comments on Aboriginal people in 1697 set the tone for future sentiment |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-04/william-dampiers-terra-nullius-set-the-tone-for-australia/10420338 |website=ABC news |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been at the behest of the publisher who wanted to cater to public prejudice and increase sales. Dampier spent two months in the peninsular, now named after him, observing the people of that area, the Bardi people. They had been there for thousands of years and were actually a well organised society. In his private journals Dampier did seem to have more respect. Nevertheless, it has been claimed that Dampier set the tone for future explorers and colonisers of Australia, which led to the law of [[terra nullius]], the view that the land was unoccupied and there for the taking.
