      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4286">'''Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée''' (October 18, 1838{{snd}}January 16, 1912) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Fouillée was born at [[La Pouëze]], [[Maine-et-Loire]]. He held several minor philosophical lectureships, and from 1864 was professor of philosophy at the lycées of [[Douai]], [[Montpellier]] and [[Bordeaux]] successively. In 1867 and 1868 he was crowned by the Academy of Moral Science for his work on [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]]. In 1872 he was elected master of conferences at the Ecole Normale, and was made doctor of philosophy in recognition of his two treatises, ''Platonis Hippias Minor sine Socratica contra liberum arbitrium argumenta'' and ''La Liberté et le déterminisme''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Fouillée, Alfred Jules Emile|volume=10|page=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strain of the next three years' continuous work undermined his health and his eyesight, and he was compelled to retire from his professorship. During these years he had published works on Plato and Socrates and a history of philosophy (1875); but after his retirement he further developed his philosophical position, a speculative eclecticism through which he endeavoured to reconcile [[metaphysical idealism]] with the naturalistic and mechanical standpoint of science.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In ''L'Evolutionnisme des idées-forces'' (1890), ''La Psychologie des idées-forces'' (1893), and ''La Morale des idées-forces'' (1907), is elaborated his doctrine of idées forces, or of mind as efficient cause through the tendency of ideas to realize themselves in appropriate movement. Ethical and sociological developments of this theory succeed its physical and psychological treatment, the consideration of the [[antinomy]] of freedom being especially important.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Fouillée's wife, [[Augustine Fouillée]], who by a previous marriage was the mother of the poet and philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], is better known, under the pseudonym of "G Bruno," as the author of the books for children,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; including educational novel and school book ''[[Le Tour de la France par deux enfants]]'' (1877).

Fouillée occupied the [[Les Colombières]] estate in [[Menton]], which was later remodelled by [[Ferdinand Bac]].&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news|title=An Eden resurrected |work=Riviera Times |date=14 June 2011 |url=http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/lifestyle-article/items/an-eden-resurrected-6500-1406.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022818/http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/lifestyle-article/items/an-eden-resurrected-6500-1406.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on January 16, 1912 in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BNF|12031236v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alogi''' (ἄλογοι, also called "Alogians") were a group of heterodox Christians in [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Asia Minor]] that flourished c. 200 CE, and taught that [[Gospel of John|the Gospel of John]] and the Apocalypse ([[Book of Revelation]]) were not the work of the Apostle, but his adversary [[Cerinthus]]. What we know of them is derived from their doctrinal opponents, whose literature is extant, particularly [[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]]. It was Epiphanius who coined the name "Alogi" as a [[word play]] suggesting that they were both illogical (''anti''-''logikos'') and they were against the Christian [[doctrine]] of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]].&lt;ref&gt;“Alogi,” ''ODCC'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Epiphanius does not specifically indicate the name of its founder, [[Jacob Bar-Salibi|Dionysius Bar-Salibi]], citing a lost work of Hippolytus (''Capita Adversus Caium''), writes in his commentary on the Apocalypse,&lt;blockquote&gt;Hippolytus the Roman says: A man appeared, named Caius, saying that the Gospel is not by John, nor the Apocalypse but that it is by Cerinthus the heretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patristic Evidence for Jewish Christian Sects|last=Klijn|first=Albertus F.J.|last2=Reinink|first2=G.J.|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1973|isbn=90-04-03763-2|location=Leiden|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eusebius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Ecclesiastical History, 3.28.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to fourth century church historian [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Ceasarea]], Caius was a churchman of Rome who wrote during the time of [[Pope Zephyrinus]], and had published a disputation with [[Proclus (Montanist)|Proclus]], a Montanist leader in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm Ecclesiastical History, 2.25.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
“St. Epiphanius (''Haer''. LI) gives a long account of the party of heretics who arose after the [[Cataphrygians]], [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodecimans]], and others, and who received neither the [[Gospel of John|Gospel of St. John]] nor his [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]].”[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01331b.htm];&lt;ref&gt;In particular Epiphanius traces their origin to [[Theodotus of Byzantium]] ([[Panarion]] 54.100.1).&lt;/ref&gt; they instead attributed the two [[New Testament]] books to the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Cerinthus]], who was actually an enemy of [[John the Apostle|the Apostle]].

Regarding their beliefs, Epiphanius asserts that the Alogians denied the continuation of [[spiritual gifts]] in the church in opposition to the [[Montanists]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Schaff]], “Alogi” in ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies'', by Henry Wace (Grand Rapids: CCEL, 2000), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They explicitly deny the Logos doctrine in John chapter 1 and they deny [[Authorship of the Johannine works|Johannine authorship]] by comparing his Gospel with the [[synoptic Gospels]]. Their methodology can be seen in the surviving fragments of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus of Rome's]] refutation, ''Capita Adversus Caium'', preserved in Bar-Salibi's ''Commentary on the Apocalypse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=John|date=July 1888|title=Commentary on Revelation|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/dionysius_syrus_revelation_01.htm|journal=Hermantha|volume=6|pages=397-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their comparative method was considered very foolish in Epiphanius’ opinion who derided them as "without reason".&lt;ref name="Alogi_Cat_Enc"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01331b.htm Alogi] @ Catholic Encyclopedia; see also Philip Schaff, “Alogi” in ''Biographical Dictionary'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Syriacist [[John Gwynn (professor)|John Gwynn]], who published these fragments in English, likewise indicates that, "The objections of Caius are . . . those of a somewhat captious critic, and indicates little breadth of scriptural learning or of eschatological conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn (July 1888), p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

Epiphanius argues that Cerinthus could not have written the Gospel of John because whereas Cerinthus denied the [[deity of Christ]], the Gospel taught Christ’s [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]]. Epiphanius contemplates that they may not reject Christ’s deity outright, but instead just the “Logos form under which the doctrine was presented in the Gospel”.&lt;ref name="Alogi_Cat_Enc" /&gt; Epiphanius also asserts in regard to the Alogi, “they themselves seem to believe as we do.”&lt;ref name="Alogi_Cat_Enc" /&gt; He therefore is not so much concerned with their [[Christology]] as much as he is concerned with their [[biblical criticism]]. Nevertheless, Epiphanius is harsh in his condemnation of them and asserts that the bottom line for the Alogi is that they deny the Gospel of John and consequently the Word-Flesh Logos doctrine. Epiphanius clearly distinguishes them from the [[Ebionites]] and from the [[Docetism|Docetists]].

'''AlternC''' is a set of [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Web Hosting]] server management software for [[Linux]]/[[UNIX-like]] systems, whose aim is to promote self hosting by individuals or small structures, and provide its users with an easy web-based interface to manage a web and mail server (and other Internet-based services).

Its main specificity is to provide its users with a non-technical web interface so that anybody can, without specific knowledge, host some web services. It also has some advanced options so that technical-savvy users can still fine-tune it.

It also features documentation in French and English.

== History ==
In 2000, the French free hosting provider Altern.org stopped its service after a complaint and a trial against [[Estelle Lefébure|Estelle Hallyday]], effectively cutting down 47634 websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The small story of Altern.org|url=http://www.altern.org/alternb/defense/|accessdate=16 February 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Valentin Lacambre]] gave his hosting control panel as free software, hoping that people will take it and be more independent of big hosting structures as his, in favor of free speech and alternative hosting.

In May 2001, Valentin's source code was abandoned and a rewrite started by the technical team at [https://www.lautre.net/ l’Autre Net] (a non-profit hosting provider organized in as self-managed association), which gave birth to [http://www.alternc.org AlternC], which wanted to follow the same guidelines as Valentin's panel (mostly on usability and design).

As of today, some non-profit hosting providers are using and developing that software suite: Lautre Net, the founder of that project, but also [http://www.globenet.org Globenet], and other structures in Belgium, Québec and Africa.

Some professional web hosting companies are also using AlternC and participate actively to the code, such as [http://www.octopuce.fr Octopuce], [http://www.neuronnexion.fr Neuronnexion] and [http://www.webelys.fr Webelys].

A poll from 2010 estimated that at least 110 servers were running AlternC, having a total of 3500 accounts, hosting more than 9500 domain names, and 25000 [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]/[[IMAP]] email accounts, with 2200 domain names and around thousand users from [https://lautre.net/ l’Autre Net], ''(this poll was only counting people actively helping the project)''

This project is still actively developed.

== Version numbering ==
After a long series of 0.9.preXX and 0.9.x versions, version 1.0 was published in June 2011, with a new web interface design, more current and usable. A paperback book, in French, was also published at that time, effectively making 2011 a milestone in this software history.

The next version, released in February 2013, was version 3.0, mainly because some plugins where on different version numbers, and the development team wanted to make them coherent with the main software version (the Mailman plugin was version 2.1 already). Many new features and bugfixes where present in that version. The most notable one was the migration from ''[[Courier]]'' to ''[[Dovecot (software)|Dovecot]]'' for the email service, and the separation, for security reasons, of all web hosted services using distincts [[Unix]] user accounts, thanks to the ITK module of the ''[[Apache HTTP Server]]''.

The latest versions of AlternC are:

3.1.10 (for Squeeze) / 3.2.10 (for Wheezy) / 3.3.10 (for Jessie) released on January 18, 2016
3.1.9 (for Squeeze) / 3.2.9 (for Wheezy) released on November 17, 2015
3.1.8 (for Squeeze) / 3.2.8 (for Wheezy) released on August 3, 2015

== Features ==
* [[Domain name]] management
* [[Domain Name System|DNS]] management
* [[Subdomain]] creation
* User account management
* [[Website]] and [[Web application]] hosting
* [[Email]] hosting
* [[Electronic mailing list|Mailing list]] hosting
* Online file manager
* Security of the files and configuration
* Website statistics

AlternC is based on [[Debian]] [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], and is using the standard Debian packages, therefore it can be used with the same level of security as Debian, and its standard configuration tools. This allows a system administrator to manage a server with AlternC and other services in the same machine.

'''Amfphp''' is a  library for creating [[PHP]]-based application back ends. Key features are support for [[Action Message Format|AMF]] among other [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|Protocols]], and developer tools such as a service browser, a client code generator, and a performance profiler. Amfphp is used primarily for games and [[Apache Flex]] business applications.

==Functionalities==
* Support for parsing AMF&lt;ref name="Flash CMS overview"&gt;[http://flashspeaksactionscript.com/introduction-to-amfphp/ Introduction to Amfphp&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and other protocols &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/using-alternative-data-formatsjson-etc/ Using Alternative Data Formats(JSON, etc.)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anandamayi Ma'''  (born '''Nirmala Sundari'''; 30 April 1896 – 27 August 1982) was an Indian [[Hindu]] spiritual leader, described by [[Sivananda Saraswati]] (of the [[Divine Life Society]]) as "the most perfect flower the Indian soil has produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mother, as Seen by Her Devotees|publisher=Shree Shree Anandamayee Sangha|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Precognition]], [[faith healing]] and [[miracles]] were attributed to her by her followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhuri|first=Narayan|title=That Compassionate Touch of Ma Anandamayee|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=1986|isbn=978-81-208-0204-9}} pp. 16-18; pp. 24-26; pp. 129-133&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] translates the Sanskrit epithet ''Anandamayi'' as "Joy-permeated" in English.  This name was given to her by her devotees in the 1920s to describe her perpetual state of divine joy.&lt;ref name=LaT&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr. Lipski |first=Alexander |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=wkntyXrcW6EC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=Anandamayi+Ma+university&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNyPHk5aPVAhWLI8AKHSRbDJ84FBDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Life and Teaching of Sri Anandamayi Ma|editor2-last= |editor2-first= |work=|page=|publisher=Motillal Benarsidass Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Anandamayi was born ''Nirmala Sundari Devi'' (নির্মলা সুন্দরী; ''Nirmôla Shundori'', English: "Immaculate, Beautiful Goddess") on 30 April 1896 to the orthodox Vaishnava Brahmin couple Bipinbihari Bhattacharya and Mokshada Sundari Devi in the village of Kheora, [[Brahmanbaria District]], now in present day [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=LaT/&gt;&lt;ref name=UC&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawley |first=John Stratton|year=2006 |chapter= Anandamayi Ma: God came as a Women|chapter-url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UOYlDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=0520249135&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |editor2-last=|editor2-first= |title= The life of Hinduism|edition=|pages= 173–183|publisher=Univ. of California Press|isbn=0520249135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, originally from Vidyakut in [[Tripura]], was a [[Vaishnavite]] singer known for his intense devotion.  Both parents were from well regarded lineages, though the family lived in poverty. Nirmala attended a village school for approximately two years.&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro&gt;[http://www.anandamayi.org/books/Flower1.pdf Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104913/http://www.anandamayi.org/books/Flower1.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, ''As the Flower Sheds Its Fragrance'', Shree Shree Ma Anadamayee Sangha, Kankhal, Haridwar; ''Retrieved: 2007-12-08''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although her teachers were pleased with her ability, her mother worried about her daughter's mental development because of her constantly indifferent and happy demeanor.  When her mother once fell seriously ill, relatives too remarked with puzzlement about the child remaining apparently unaffected.

In 1908 at the age of thirteen, in keeping with the rural custom at the time, she was married to Ramani Mohan Chakrabarti of [[Vikramapura]], whom she would later rename ''Bholanath''.&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghosh |first=Monoranjan |year=2012 |chapter=Anandamayi, Ma |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Anandamayi,_Ma |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent five years after her marriage at her brother-in-law's home, attending to housework in a withdrawn meditative state much of the time.  It was here that a devout neighbor Harakumar, who was widely considered insane, recognised and announced her spiritual eminence, developed a habit of addressing her as "Ma", and prostrated before her morning and evening in reverence.&lt;ref name=Wisdom&gt;Richard Lannoy; [http://www.anandamayi.org/books/lannoy1.htm Ananadamayi: Her Life and Wisdom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130194818/http://www.anandamayi.org/books/lannoy1.htm |date=30 November 2016 }}; Element Books Ltd; 1996; {{ISBN|1-85230-914-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Nirmala was about seventeen, she went to live with her husband who was working in the town of [[Astagram Upazila|Ashtagram]]. In 1918, they moved to [[Bajitpur Upazila|Bajitpur]], where she stayed until 1924.  It was a celibate marriage—whenever thoughts of lust occurred to Ramani, Nirmala's body would take on the qualities of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McDaniel|first=June|title=The Madness of the Saints: Ecstatic Religion in Bengal|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-226-55723-6|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the full moon night of August 1922, at midnight, twenty-six-year-old Nirmala enacted her own spiritual [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;In Hindu [[diksha]], when the mind of the guru and the disciple become one, then we say that the disciple has been initiated by the guru.&lt;/ref&gt;  She explained that the ceremony and its rites were being revealed to her spontaneously as and when they were called for.&lt;ref name="Wisdom" /&gt; Although uneducated on the matter, the complex rites corresponded to those of traditional, ancient Hinduism, including the offerings of flowers, the mystical diagrams (yantras) and the fire ceremony (yagna). She later stated, "As the master (''guru'') I revealed the mantra; as the disciple (''shishya'') I accepted it and started to recite it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hallstrom|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dhaka===
[[File:Anandamayi Ma -- painting.jpg|thumb]]
Nirmala moved to [[Shahbag]] with her husband in 1924, where he had been appointed as the caretaker of the gardens of the [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Nawab of Dhaka]].&lt;ref name=banglapedia/&gt; During this period Nirmala went into ecstasies at public ''kirtans''.&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro/&gt; 

Jyotiscandra Ray, known as "Bhaiji," was an early and close disciple. He was the first to suggest that Nirmala be called Anandamayi Ma, meaning "Joy Permeated Mother", or "Bliss Permeated Mother". He was chiefly responsible for the first ashram built for Anandamayi Ma in 1929 at [[Ramna]], within the precinct of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipski, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, she reinstated a formerly abandoned ancient [[Kali]] temple in the Siddheshwari area.&lt;ref name="banglapedia" /&gt; 

During the time in Shahbag, more and more people began to be drawn to what they saw to be a living embodiment of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hallstrom|1999|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From this point onwards various scholars were drawn to Anandamayi Ma's spirituality and teaching, though she continue to describe herself as "a little unlettered child".&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro/&gt; [[Gopinath Kaviraj|Mahamahopadhyay Gopinath Kaviraj]], [[Sanskrit]] scholar, philosopher, and principal of [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi|Government Sanskrit College]] in [[Varanasi]] and [[Triguna Sen]] were among her early followers.&lt;ref name=banglapedia/&gt; [[Uday Shankar]], the famous dance artist, was impressed by Anandamayi Ma's analysis of dance, which she used as a metaphor for the relationship between people and God.&lt;ref name=banglapedia/&gt; She was a contemporary of the well known [[Hindu saints]] like [[Udiya Baba]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].&lt;ref name=LaT/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Anandamayi Ma Ashram - Haridwar ( Kankhal ).JPG|thumb|Anandamayi Ma Ashram, [[Haridwar]] ([[Kankhal]])]]

Ma died on 27 August 1982 in [[Dehradun]], and subsequently on 29 August 1982&lt;ref name=UC/&gt; a [[Samadhi (shrine)]] was built in the courtyard of her [[Kankhal]] ashram, situated in  [[Haridwar]] in [[North India]],&lt;ref name=banglapedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandamayi.org/ashram/cc.htm Life History: Chronology of Mothers life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421183157/http://www.anandamayi.org/ashram/cc.htm |date=21 April 2016 }} Anandamayi Ma Ashram Official website.

== Teachings ==
{{Rquote|left|As you love your own body, so regard everyone as equal to your own body. When the Supreme Experience supervenes, everyone's service is revealed as one's own service. Call it a bird, an insect, an animal or a man, call it by any name you please, one serves one's own Self in every one of them.|Anandamayi Ma|''Ananda Varta Quarterly''}}

Anandamayi Ma never prepared discourses, wrote down, or revised what she had said. People had difficulty transcribing her often informal talks because of their conversational speed.  Further the Bengali manner of alliterative wordplay was often lost in translation.  However a devotee, Brahmachari Kamal Bhattacharjee, made attempts to transcribe her speech before audio recording equipment became widely available in India.&lt;ref name=Wisdom/&gt;

A central theme of her teaching is "the supreme calling of every human being is to aspire to self realization. All other obligations are secondary" and "only actions that kindle man's divine nature are worthy of the name of actions". However she did not advise everyone to become a renunciate. She would dismiss spiritual arguments and controversies by stating that "Everyone is right from his own standpoint,".&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro/&gt; She did not give formal initiations and refused to be called a guru, as she maintained that "all paths are my paths" and "I have no particular path".&lt;ref name=FlowerMethod&gt;[http://www.anandamayi.org/books/Flower6.pdf Mataji's Methods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090443/http://www.anandamayi.org/books/Flower6.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, ''As the Flower Sheds Its Fragrance'', Shree Shree Ma Anadamayee Sangha, Kankhal, Haridwar; ''Retrieved: 2007-12-08''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 45|Autobiography of a Yogi—The Bengali "Joy-Permeated Mother" (Ananda Moyi Ma)}}
She did not advocate the same spiritual methods for all: "How can one impose limitations on the infinite by declaring ''this is the only path''—and, why should there be so many different religions and sects? Because through every one of them He gives Himself to Himself, so that each person may advance according to his inborn nature."  She herself has said (ref. Mother Reveals Herself), all forms of sadhana, known and unknown, just occurred to her in the form of a [[Lila (Hinduism)|lila]] (play) without any conscious effort on her part. Thus her Sadhana can not be slotted into a specific area, for to do so would mean that she was somehow limited to that area and her mastery was also limited. She welcomed and conversed with devotees of different religions from Shaivaite, Vaishnavs, Tantric, or from Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism. Everyone was welcome and she was equally at ease while giving guidance to all practitioners of different faiths.  Even now, the Muslim population of Kheora still refer to her as "our own Ma".&lt;ref name=Wisdom/&gt; 

She taught how to live a God-centered life in the world and provided the living inspiration to enable thousands to aspire to this most noble ideal.&lt;ref name=FlowerIntro/&gt; She also advocated spiritual equality for women; for example, she opened up the [[sacred thread]] ritual, which had been performed by men only for centuries, to women, but only those who met the moral and personal requirements. Her style of teaching included jokes, songs and instructions on everyday life along with long discourses, silent meditation and recommended reading of scriptures.

[[Paramhansa Yogananda]] wrote about her in his book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''.&lt;ref name=UC/&gt;&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Todays Woman in World Religions|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=0-7914-1687-9|editor1-first=|editor1-link=|edition=|pages=128–130|chapter=Women in Hinduism|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|chapter-url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UOYlDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=0520249135&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; His meeting with her is recounted in the chapter titled "The Bengali 'Joy-Permeated Mother'", where she explains her background:

{{blockquote|"Father, there is little to tell." She spread her graceful hands in a deprecatory gesture. "My consciousness has never associated itself with this temporary body.

In [[social science]], '''antipositivism''' (also '''interpretivism''' or '''negativism''') is a theoretical stance that proposes that the social realm cannot be studied with the [[scientific method]] of investigation applied to the [[Nature|natural world]] and that investigation of the social realm requires a different [[epistemology]]. Fundamental to this epistemology is the belief that the concepts and language researchers bring to their research shape their perception of the social world under investigation.&lt;ref name="7th Canadian"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda M. |title=Sociology |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |page=32 |edition=7th Canadian|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept ==

Interpretivism (anti-positivism) developed among researchers dissatisfied with [[post-positivism]], the theories of which they considered too general and ill-suited to reflect the nuance and variability found in human interaction. Because the values and theoretical beliefs of researchers cannot fully be removed from their inquiry, interpretivists believe research ''on'' human beings ''by'' human beings cannot yield objective results. Thus, rather than seeking an objective perspective, interpretivists look for meaning in the subjective experiences of individuals engaging in social interaction. Many interpretivist researchers immerse themselves in the social context they are studying, seeking to understand and formulate theories about a community or group of individuals by observing from the inside. Interpretivism is an inductive practice influenced by philosophical frameworks such as [[hermeneutics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. (2004). Interpretive Perspectives on Theory Development. In Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts (pp. 46–59). Boston, Massachusetts: McGraw-Hill.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning with [[Giambattista Vico]], in the early eighteenth century, and later with [[Montesquieu]], the study of natural history and human history were separate fields of intellectual enquiry. Natural history is not under human control, whereas human history is a human creation. As such, antipositivism is informed by an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the natural world and the social realm. The natural world can only be understood by its external characteristics, whereas the social realm can be understood externally and internally, and thus can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0710077462|location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, intellectuals, led by the [[Hegelian]]s, questioned the prospect of empirical social analysis.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Karl Marx]] died before the establishment of formal social science, but nonetheless rejected the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]]—despite his attempt to establish an [[historical materialist]] science of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zbigniew A. |last=Jordan |title=The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism: A Philosophical and Sociological Analysis |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1967 |pages=131, 321 |isbn=}} [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/jordan2.htm] [https://books.google.com/?id=l2MHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22science+of+society%22#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The enhanced positivism of [[Émile Durkheim]] served as foundation of modern academic [[sociology]] and [[social research]], yet retained many mechanical elements of its predecessor.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} [[Hermeneutic]]ians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] theorized in detail on the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'), whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers such as [[Heinrich Rickert]] maintained that the social realm, with its abstract meanings and symbolisms, is inconsistent with scientific methods of analysis. [[Edmund Husserl]], meanwhile, negated positivism through the rubric of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 20-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the twentieth century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced ''verstehende'' (interpretive) sociological antipositivism, proposing research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. As an antipositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2014}} as those pursued by natural scientists.

The interaction between theory (or constructed [[concept]]s) and data is always fundamental in [[social science]] and this subjection distinguishes it from physical science{{According to whom|date=June 2014}}. Durkheim himself noted the importance of constructing concepts in the abstract (e.g. "[[collective consciousness]]" and "[[social anomie]]") in order to form workable categories for experimentation{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the [[verstehen]] (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

{{Quote
|text = ''[Sociology is ]'' ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.
|sign = [[Max Weber]]
|source = The Nature of Social Action 1922&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; His sociology engaged in a [[neo-Kantian]] critique of the limits of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipositivism thus holds there is no methodological unity of the sciences: the three goals of positivism - ''description, control, and prediction'' - are incomplete, since they lack any ''understanding''.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Science aims at understanding causality so control can be exerted. If this succeeded in sociology, those with knowledge would be able to control the ignorant and this could lead to [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].{{According to whom|date=July 2014}}

This perspective has led to controversy over how one can draw the line between [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] research, much less draw an artificial line between environment and human organization (see [[environmental sociology]]), and influenced the study of [[hermeneutics]]. The base concepts of antipositivism have expanded beyond the scope of [[social science]], in fact, [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has the same basic principles at its core. Simply put, positivists see sociology as a science, while anti-positivists do not.

=== Frankfurt School ===
The antipositivist tradition continued in the establishment of [[critical theory]], particularly the work associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of '[[scientism]]'; or science ''as ideology''. [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone."&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]] argued that "our innate tendency to express moral concern and identify with the Other's wants is stifled in modernity by positivistic science and dogmatic bureaucracy. If the Other does not "fit in" to modernity's approved classifications, it is liable to be extinguished."&lt;ref&gt;John Scott. ''Fifty Key Sociologists: The Contemporary Theorists.'' Routledge. 2006. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7415">'''Bernard Groethuysen''' (September 9, 1880 &amp;ndash; September 17, 1946)&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dopp, Chronique, ''Revue philosophique de Louvain, 1946, vol. =44, n. 3, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; was a French writer and philosopher. His works, which transgressed the confines of history and sociology, concern the history of mentalities and representations and the interpretation of the experience of the world. In the [[interwar period]], he made the works of [[Hölderlin]] and [[Kafka]] and the sociology of Germany available in France.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Schmit, Critial review of ''Zwischen Berlin und Paris : Bernhard Groethuysen (1880-1946): Eine intellektuelle Biographie'' by K. Grosse-Kracht, ''Archives de Philosophie'', 2003, n. 2, v. 66, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bernard Groethuysen was the second child of five. His mother Olga Groloff was part of a family of Russian immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretesusman.com/Bernhard_Groethuysen.htm "In memoriam Bernhard Groethuysen." in: ''Zeitschrift für Religions- und Geistesgeschichte'', Marburg 1948, pp. 79-85]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Philipp Groethuysen, was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physician with a practice in [[Berlin]]. The elder Groethuysen suffered from psychiatric ailments, and after 1885 lived in the sanitorium in [[Baden-Baden]] where he died in 1900. It was here that the younger Groethuysen completed his primary and secondary studies. He went on to study philosophy and history at the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Dopp, ''Chronique'' in ''Rev. Phil. Louvain'', p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing work on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], Groethuysen went to [[Paris]] in the fall of 1904 where he met [[André Gide]] and [[Jean Paulhan]] and encountered [[Charles du Bos]], whom he had met in Berlin some time before. Returning each year to the French capital, he became a noteworthy "messenger" between German and French cultures. From 1912, he worked closely with Alix Guillain (1876-1951), a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Communist]] activist. Both settled in Paris in a small artist's studio on rue Campagne-Première. In February 1915, after [[World War I|war]] broke out in France, he was interned in [[Châteauroux]] at [[Deols|Bitray]], a camp reserved for foreign civilians and located in the premises of the insane asylum of the city. His friends [[Charles Du Bos]], [[Charles Andler]] and [[Henri Bergson]], petitioned to improve Groethuysen's conditions of detention, and finally persuaded the authorities to let him reside in private accommodations.

Beginning in 1924, Groethuysen participated each year in the [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny Decades]] held by [[Paul Desjardins]] at the [[Pontigny Abbey]] where Groethuysen had the opportunity to interact with French intellectuals such as [[Louis Aragon]], [[Julien Benda]], [[Léon Brunschvicg]], [[François Mauriac]], [[André Maurois]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Roger Martin du Gard]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]. In 1926 he collaborated with [[Jean Paulhan]] on the ''Library of Ideas'', a collection published by in [[Éditions Gallimard]] that would soon become famous. Appointed professor in Germany in 1931, he fled before the rise of [[Nazism]]. He finished his last class with the words: "Intellectuals of all countries, unite!". In 1937, he acquired French citizenship and in 1938 was dismissed ''in absentia'' from the German University.

Groethuysen's openness of spirit, his appetite for knowledge and his generosity make him one of the great European intellectuals of the first half of the twentieth century. His translations of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] novels were published by [[Gallimard]]. He contributed to the introduction of [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] in France, writing a preface to Alexander Vialatte's 1946 translation of ''[[The Trial]]''. [[Lucien Herr]] saw Groethuysen as a "[[sophist]]," in the positive sense of the term. [[Jean Wahl]] found in Groethuysen a "good European." [[Pierre Jean Jouve]] described him as an "extraordinary man." Groethuysen died in 1946 at the Sainte-Élisabeth clinic in [[Luxemburg]] of [[Lung cancer]]. [[Jean Paulhan]] wrote a very personal tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Freville, "Bernard Groethuysen est mort," ''L'Humanité'', September 29, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

Groethuysen's works focused on the philosophy and politics of the eighteenth century, particularly [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and the [[French Revolution]]. Groethuysen's 1913 treatise on [[Denis Diderot]] was particularly influential on the twentieth century reception of the encylopedist.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Groethuysen, ''La Pensée de Diderot'' included in French in the compilation edited by Jochen Schlobach, ''Denis Diderot'' ''Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft'', Darmstadt 1992, {{ISBN|3-534-09097-7}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">The concept of '''canon''' is very broad; in a general sense it refers to being a rule or a body of rules.

There are definitions that state it as: “the body of rules, principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding in a field of study or art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canon |title=Define Canon|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be related to such topics as literary canons or the canons of rhetoric, which is a topic within itself that describes the rules of giving a speech. There are five key principles, and when grouped together, are the principles set for giving speeches as seen with regard to [[Rhetoric]]. This is one such example of how the term canon is used in regard to rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;WordNet 3.1. retrieved 2011-12-03 from: [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=canon&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h= Canon Search Word.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.C Sayers (1915–1916) established a system of canons of classification Sayers, W.C.

[[File:bonnin1808.jpg|thumb|About the Importance and Need of an Administrative Code - 1808]]  
'''Bonnin, Charles-Jean Baptiste''' (4 October 1772 in [[France]] – October 1846) Progressive French thinker, theorist, and framer of the modern discipline of [[Public Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omarguerrero.org/archivos/BonninPAP1809.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727143231/http://www.omarguerrero.org/archivos/BonninPAP1809.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Bonnin's written work a great political and intellectual activity is clear. His academic works credit him as a forerunner of public, constitutional and administrative law. Actually, his 'Social Doctrine' situates him amongst the initiators of the science later known as Sociology. He also practiced parliamentary review and was interested in educational problems. [[Auguste Comte]] described Bonnin as a "mature and energetic man, a person with a spontaneous deep kinship for positivism and in whom we can find the true spirit of the Revolution".&lt;ref name="Barbot"&gt;Letter to monsieur Barbot, 29 October 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Cjbonnin.jpg|thumb|Charles-Jean Baptiste BONNIN]]
Bonnin was born in [[Paris]], in a family with roots in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. He studied at the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]], and afterwards served the French administration as an official in the Seine department. His parents had planned for him a career as medical doctor, a project frustrated by the events of the French Revolution, a fact that inspired in Charles-Jean Bonnin a deep interest for political issues. His true vocation was born early during his youth, thanks to the works of [[Montesquieu]], [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably|Mably]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]] and Cornelius, to whom he professed great admiration. He met [[Auguste Comte]] in 1829,&lt;ref name="Barbot"/&gt; becoming his friend until his death.

Amongst many references to him during his lifetime, the work of M. Lemonier stands out. It is entitled Notice Historique,&lt;ref&gt;M. Lemonier&lt;/ref&gt; 'Historical Record', and heads the work named Pensées, 'Thoughts', of C.J.B. Bonnin. This document was promoted by Bonnin and, maybe, was reviewed by him also. Inside of the French administration files some references to him can be found, like his possible membership to franc-masonry. Also, by these files we know that he spent thirteenth months in prison due to certain passages of his book Études Législatives, 'Legislative Studies', where he criticized Catholicism.

The Encyclopedic Magazine or reasoned analysis of the most remarkable productions of France, edition of 1829, highlights the publication of the third edition of the Principles of Public Administration, there is an overview of the most important contents of the work and say it is a book full of wisdom and useful ideas, the author shaped with elegance, accuracy and clarity.

== Legacy ==

Today, because his main work, 'Principles of Public Administration',&lt;ref&gt;See Omar Guerrero, http://www.omarguerrero.org&lt;/ref&gt; has been re-edited and published on-line - in the original French version and in a Spanish translation - is easier to access to it. However, this is mainly thanks to the edition produced by Mexico's Fondo de Cultura Económica in 2004. Nowadays, his countrymen are paying him the tribute he deserves. Georges Langrod rightly claimed that "the science of administration, in the modern sense of the expression, was born in France in the nineteenth century. Its pioneer was Charles-Jean Bonnin, author of 'Principles of Public Administration', whose first edition dates back to 1808. Likewise, Jacques Chevallier and Dániele Loschak have commented that "he can be considered the true founder of French administrative science." Nevertheless, Charles-Jean Bonnin is more than that, much more: he is the founder of the worldwide science of Public Administration. Most recently, Jacqueline Morand-Devillier suggested a reprint of his 'Principles', in its first edition precisely. Notwithstanding, this publication was made in the year 2004, not in France but in Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">The '''darwin''' (d) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[evolution]]ary change, defined by [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.B.S. Haldane]] (1949). "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2405451 Suggestions as to quantitative measurement of rates of evolution]." ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' 3:51–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  One darwin is defined to be an [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]-fold (about 2.718) change in a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] over one million years.  Haldane named the unit after [[Charles Darwin]].

==Equation==
The equation for calculating evolutionary change in darwins (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) is:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{{\rm ln} X_2 - {\rm ln} X_1}{\Delta  t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are the initial and final values of the trait and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is the change in time in millions of years.  An alternative form of this equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{{\rm ln} \frac{X_2}{X_1}}{\Delta  t}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the difference between two [[natural logarithm]]s is a [[dimension]]less [[ratio]], the trait may be measured in any [[Units of measurement|unit]].  Also for this reason the darwin is a specialist form of the inverse [[mega-annum]] (&lt;math&gt;Ma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Application==
The measure is most useful in [[palaeontology]], where [[macroevolutionary]] changes in the dimensions of [[fossil]]s can be compared.  Where this is used it is an indirect measure as it relies on [[phenotypic]] rather than [[genotypic]] data.  Several data points are required to overcome natural variation within a population.  The darwin only measures the evolution of a particular [[Trait (biology)|trait]] rather than a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]; different traits may evolve at different rates within a lineage.  The evolution of traits can however be used to infer as a [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] the evolution of lineages.

Genetic information cannot be obtained from fossils, but modern (post-Haldane) techniques on extant organisms now rely on genetic data (q.v. [[phylogenetics]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4851">{{Other uses|Dear John (disambiguation){{!}}Dear John}}

A '''Dear John letter''' is a letter written to a man by his wife or romantic partner to inform him their relationship is over because she has found another lover.  The man is often a soldier stationed overseas, although the letter may be used in other ways, including being left for him to discover when he returns from work to an emptied house. Usually sent after time away on holiday

== Origin and etymology ==

While the exact origins of the phrase are unknown, it is commonly believed to have been coined by Americans during [[World War II]].  "John" was the most popular and common baby name for boys in America every single year from 1880 through 1923,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; making it a reasonable 'placeholder' name when denoting those of age for military service.   Large numbers of [[American troops]] were stationed overseas for many months or years, and as time passed many of their wives or girlfriends decided to begin a relationship with a new man rather than to wait for the original one to return.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

As letters to servicemen from wives or girlfriends back home would typically contain affectionate language (such as "Dear Johnny", "My dearest John", or simply "Darling"), a serviceman receiving a note beginning with a curt "Dear John" would instantly be aware of the letter's purpose.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

A writer in the ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'' of [[Rochester, New York]], summed it up in August 1945:

{{quote|"Dear John," the letter began. "I have found someone else whom I think the world of. I think the only way out is for us to get a [[Divorce in the United States|divorce]]," it said. They usually began like that, those letters that told of infidelity on the part of the wives of servicemen... The men called them "Dear Johns".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|title=Dear John letter|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dea5.htm|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=13 Dec 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

An early reference to Dear John letters was made in a [[United Press]] article of March 21, 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j9M0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oE4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7082,6366557&amp;dq=dear-john-letter&amp;hl=en Hollywood Girls Gain Weight on Tour of Africa] [[St. Petersburg Times]], March 21, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been claimed that the [[Vietnam War]] inspired more Dear John letters than any other US conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Chuck|title=Rattler One-Seven: A Vietnam Helicopter Pilot's War Story|year=2006|publisher=University of North Texas Press|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFvbGYGdn_gC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Dear%20John%20letter&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=Dear%20John%20letter&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, this type of letter formed background to the British television show ''[[Dear John (UK TV series)|Dear John]]'', and the [[Dear John (U.S. TV series)|American sitcom of the same name]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}  A ''Dear Jane'' letter is a contemporary version of a ''Dear John'' letter addressed to a female lover.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

This term is also used to describe letters written in the context of employment, either to inform an applicant that they had not been selected for a job,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanresources.about.com/b/2011/10/26/say-no-thanks-with-care.htm|title=Communicating with Candidates for Your Job|author=Susan M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Ecosharing''' is an environmental ethic for people to live by: that their own impact on the Earth’s [[biosphere]] be limited to no more than their own fair ecoshare. The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his ''Living in the Environment'' text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jr., G. Tyler ''Living in the Environment'' CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 book ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' sought to quantify an "ecoshare" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectworldview.org/comingofage.htm Cook, Stephen P. and Meadows, Donella H. ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' AR: Parthenon Books, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's [[carbon footprint]]. However it is gauged, an ecoshare is determined by overall assessment of the human impact on the biosphere, computer models of its future condition, and necessary limits imposed by [[sustainability]] criteria.

'''Egbert Schuurman''' (born 23 July 1937) is a Dutch [[engineer]], [[philosopher]], [[politician]] for the [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|Christian Union]], and  Emeritus Professor of [[Philosophy]] in the [[Netherlands]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Borger, Netherlands|Borger]], Schuurman attended the Protestant primary school in Drenthe Nieuwbuinen, and the HBS-b in Stadskanaal, where he received his diploma on 18 June 1955. After studying [[civil engineering]] at the HTS in Groningen, Schuurman continued his studies at [[Delft University of Technology]]. After his graduation in 1964 Schuurman began to study philosophy at the [[Vrije Universiteit]] in Amsterdam, a study which he completed in 1968. In 1972 Schuurman received his PhD with a thesis entitled ''Techniek en Toekomst - Confrontatie met wijsgerige beschouwingen'' ("Technology and Future - Confrontation with philosophical considerations") under supervision of [[Hendrik Van Riessen]].

From 1964 Schuurman had started his academic career at the Technical University of Delft, and in 1966 moved to the Vrije Universiteit. In 1972 he was also appointed Professor in the Reformed Philosophy at the Technical University of Eindhoven, which he remained until 2004. From 1975 to 2004 and he also held that post at the Technical University in Delft, and from 1984 to September 2007 at the University of Wageningen. The latter was in large part devoted to agriculture. Among his students in Amsterdam was [[Sytse Strijbos]], and in Delft he was succeeded by [[Marc de Vries]].

From 1983 to 2011 he was also a member of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], serving among others as the chairman of the Christian Union party caucus and Senate group leader (succeeded by [[Roel Kuiper]]).

Schuurman was Visiting Professor on topics from the philosophy of technology in Canada, the United States, England, Korea, Japan, South Africa and Brazil. In 1994 was awarded an honorary doctorate in Technical Sciences at the University of North West (Potchefstroom), South Africa. In 1995 he was awarded the Templeton Award in Berkeley at the Center for Theology and Natural Sciences. In 2003 he was awarded officer in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].

== Work ==
Schuurman's research interest is most concerned with exploring and developing [[Reformational philosophy]] and its organised expression, the Association for Reformational Philosophy.

From 1983 to 1984 he was in the U.S. part of an international research team on Responsible Technology. He was from 1981 to 1983 member of the so-called DNA-Wide Committee, acting on behalf of the government studied the social and ethical aspects of work with genetic material. He was a member of the steering committee of The Royal Institute of Engineers on "Limits to technology".

Besides his thesis and future technology, he has published many other writings - see Bibliography. His latest book is: "Believe in Science and Technology '. Several books Schuurman are translated into English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish and Portuguese. He was also editor of two international journals in the field of philosophy of technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13940">[[File:Franjo Marković.gif|thumb|A portrait of Franjo Marković by [[Joso Bužan]], 1903.]]

'''Franjo Marković''' (or '''Franjo pl. Marković'''; [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]], July 26, 1845 – [[Zagreb]], September 15, 1914) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] philosopher and writer.

He was an academician, the first professor of philosophy at the renovated [[University of Zagreb]] in 1874.  The defender of the identity of philosophy as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discipline, as opposed to [[scholasticism]] on one side, and [[positivism]] and [[materialism]] on the other side.

His greatest philosophical work is the ''Razvoj i sustav obćenite estetike'' ("The development and the system of general aesthetics"), which heavily influenced the development of Croatian philosophical thought due to its extensive and all-encompassing overview of the history of [[aesthetics]] in [[Croatian language]], and the introduction of new philosophic terms. He is the founder of the research of Croatian philosophic heritage.

As a writer, he is noted for his lyric-reflexive poetry, epic compositions and dramas. He is a characteristic [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] ("national-romantic spirit"), and in the poetry he is noted as an ardent follower of [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

==Biography==
[[File:Franjo Marković.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of Franjo Marković by unknown artist at the council chambers of the [[University of Zagreb]].]]
Born in a noble family, by father Antun and mother Josipa (b. Šugh). He attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at the Nobility Boarding School in Zagreb. In 1862 he left for a study of [[classical philology]] and [[Slavic studies]] in [[Vienna]]. He graduated in 1865, and the next year he passed his gymnasium professorship exam. He worked as an assistant, and soon became a full professor at gymnasiums in Osijek and Zagreb. In 1870, after one political protest, he left his service and headed for Vienna to study philosophy, and soon to Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Paris, receiving his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1872.

In 1874 he was appointed as the first head of the independent department for philosophy in Zagreb and the dean of the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]]. That year the renovated [[University of Zagreb]] was founded, and within it the Faculty of philosophy (then called ''Mudroslovni fakultet''), and on it the Department for Philosophy (''Stolica za mudroslovje teoretično i praktično sa povjestnicom''). He served as a rector of the University in the academic year 1881/1882. He continued to teach until his retirement in 1909.

He served as the editor-in-chief of ''[[Vijenac]]'' in the period 1872-1873. He was also a member of [[Matica hrvatska]] from 1875, and a full member of [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|JAZU]] from 1876.

He served as a representative of the [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]] county in the Parliament of Croatia and Slavonia in the last two decades of the 19th century (at the period of ban [[Dragutin Károly Khuen-Héderváry]]). As a member of a mild opposition, he operated by his own principle, insisting on ethical principles in politics. As a "typical representative of Croatian minor nobility"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; he defends Croatian interests against Hungarian imperialistic pretensions, advocates constitutional protection, political freedom and "spiritual prospect and material development" of the common people.

==Teaching of philosophy==
Marković held lectures on all philosophic disciplines ([[logic]], [[psychology]], [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[epistemology]], [[pedagogy]] and the [[history of philosophy]]). At that period the concept of "philosophy" encompassed also history, geography, linguistics, anthropology, pedagogy, natural sciences and mathematics, which were taught by other professors.

In his teaching of philosophy he adhered to the system developed by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], which at the period (after the revolutionary 1848, which was much contributed to by young [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelianists]], so the authorities were intent to suppress Hegel's and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s influence) was generally accepted in Germany and [[Austria–Hungary]]. His system had pedagogic qualities for the development of consistence and strictness in conceptual thought and was hence fit to be "propedeutics of philosophical spirit at us".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Bazala]], which inherited in 1909 Marković's department, abandons Herbart's system). He monitored all current spiritual movements, read German, French, English and other authors, and made his students known with their works, even if they were not sanctioned by him.

As the first professor of philosophy with a systematic teaching record, translating and writing in vernacular language (and not Latin or German), Marković made a substantial impact on the development of Croatian philosophical terminology.

In 1880 he promoted [[Đuro Arnold]] as the first Ph.D. in philosophy, who finally joined him in 1894 as a full professor. Arnold has, along with the philosophical teachings, lead the department of pedagogy.  In 1904 he habilitated [[Albert Bazala]] as a private ''docent'' of philosophy.

==Philosophical orientation==
Marković, the first Croatian professor of philosophy that was not a priest, cherished self-consciousness of philosophy as opposed to the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition and [[neo-scholasticism]], which was promoted at that time in vernacular writings by the professors of the Faculty of Theology and other [[theology|theologians]]. On the other side, defending the metaphysics he was confronted with materialism and positivism, which reached Croatia at that period, and where he is followed by his disciple [[Albert Bazala]]. "Nothing valuable is produced by human labour without the vigorous, logical, aesthetic and ethic tendency, i.e. without philosophic tendency."&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvtxt|Despot|2000|pp=21}}, "išta vriedna ne nastaje ljudskim radom bez žive logične, estetične i etične težnje t.j. bez filosofijske težnje."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbart's school===
In his lectures and writings he continued the metaphysical tradition of European school of thought, following essentially [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]]'s formalism, which provides a compromise between the exactness of natural sciences and the metaphysical speculation, with an emphasis on the strictness of conceptual thought. He emphasized psychology as a starting point of philosophy ([[psychologism]]): "Her [of a philosophy] infinite, ultimately never reachable goal is a prudential system of cogitations and within it organised sentiments and aspirations."&lt;ref&gt;Cited after {{harvtxt|Despot|2000|pp=49}}, "Njezin nedogledni, potpuno nikad nedostižni cilj promišljen je sustav misli i u njemu onda sređenih čuvstava i težnjâ."&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbart's school, as hence the Marković himself, insist on maintaining diversity and irreducibility of psychic and material nature, especially contradicting materialist reducibility of former to the latter. He deems that "rational psychology and cosmology bear witness in favor of spiritism", i.e. against materialism: the matter is not sentient and free, and thus not subject to the law of causativity, so man's consciousness and freedom cannot possibly be a result of matter, but of higher and perfected being, i.e. the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Zdenko|1995|pp=62}}, {{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics===
[[File:Franjo Marković 1903, 1923.png|thumb|right|The cover pages of the ''Razvoj i sustav obćenite estetike'' ('The development and the system of general aesthetics'; Zagreb, 1903), and the ''Dom i svijet'' ('The home and the world'; Zagreb, 1923).]]
Aesthetically he's a formalist: aesthetic is only the form, not the content; this is where his scholarly personality suppressed his artistic predilections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=49, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art must provide aesthetic pleasure; it should aspire to panhuman ideal, rise above the reality to the value. Therefore, Marković is not particularly supportive of naturalism and realism: naturalism simply depicts abject and vicious sides of life. The object of art must be beauteous not only by its form, but also venerable by its content. Illustrious artists are "folk teachers, the creators of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=88–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
In [[ethics|ethical]] issues he mostly diverged from formalistic confines of Herbart's school, taking interest into positivist and sociological currents and expressing his own, intensive ethical sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[materialism]] and [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]], which lead to the "bankruptcy of ethics", giving prominence to either [[egotism|egoism]], or "benefit to society, as understood by the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Bazala criticizes narrow-minded ethical principles of his teacher quite voluminously, and so does [[Gjuro Arnold]].

===Critical spirit and rising of the people===
Marković applied Herbart's glorification of philosophy as a bellwether of culture to Croatian circumstances. He emphasizes the significance of industrious labor on the cognition and cultivation of critical spirit. Philosophy has a long-term educational task of rising people to the fulfillment of its potential. Philosophy is the "sentient cultural spirit", which metamorphosises and sets path towards prosperity of the nation and its "life style" in general. It creates "spiritual homeland", the "homeland of thoughts", which is the defender of material homeland. By learning from other nations, one has to develop distinctiveness and peculiarities at a path to the cognition of the ideal of truth, goodness and beauty. That is a duty not only to the people, but to the human kind itself: philosophy already brings individuals closer, and given enough time it shall unite even the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==
Marković published a series of literary works, most important of which are the epics and the dramas in national-romanticist tradition. As opposed to the formalistic and racionalist conception of philosophy, "Marković his personal aspect, his sentimentalism and desireful ponderings ensconces under the veil of poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bazala|1974|pp=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly dealing with the historical motifs, Marković engaged in the ongoing battle for the affirmation of Croatdom against Hungarian and German domination. Idyllic epic ''Dom i svijet'' ('The home and the world') elaborates on contemporary themes. Epic ''Kohan i Vlasta'' ('Kohan and Vlasta') portrays a battle of old Slavs and Germans on the Baltic. The tragedy ''Karlo Drački'' depicts man's suffering in the struggle for panhuman ideal of freedom against the Rome and Magyar feudal lords. The tragedies ''Benk bot'' and ''Zvonimir'' display vices and rapacity of Hungarian landlords and court. Marković also wrote poems, literary critics and studies. He composed lyrics for quire version of the song ''[[U boj, u boj|U boj!]]'' from the opera ''[[Nikola Šubić Zrinski]]''.

==Philosophic works==
Occupied by lecturing and literary work he published few pieces in philosophy. He published the book ''Razvoj i sustav obćenite estetike'' (1903).

His major books and general works published during his lifetime include:

*''Estetička ocjena Gundulićeva "Osmana"'', Zagreb, 1877.
*''O piscih filozofijske struke a hrvatskoga roda'', "Vienac", 44/1881. (inaugural speech as a rector)
*''Filosofijski rad Rugjera Josipa Boškovića'', Zagreb, 1887.–1888.
*''Etički sadržaj naših narodnih poslovica'', Zagreb, 1889.
*''Prilog estetičkoj nauci o baladi i romanci'', Zagreb, 1899.
*''Razvoj i sustav obćenite estetike'', Zagreb, 1903.

In 1970 his selected works (''Izabrana djela'') were published in the edition ''Pet stoljeća hrvatske književnosti'' ('Five centuries of Croatian literature'), vol. 44.

A bulk of lecturing MSS.{{clarify|date=November 2012}} has been preserved, some of which have been processed and published in the periodical ''Prilozi za istraživanje hrvatske filozofske baštine''.

The '''Franklin child prostitution ring allegations''' began in June 1988 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and attracted significant public and political interest until late 1990, when separate state and federal [[Grand juries in the United States|grand juries]] concluded that the allegations were unfounded and the ring was a "carefully crafted hoax."&lt;ref name="Robbins1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lurid Tales" /&gt;

==Allegations==
In 1988, authorities looked into allegations that prominent citizens of Nebraska, as well as high-level U.S. politicians, were involved in a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution ring]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Moral Panic: Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America|pages=174–5|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Jenkins|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-300-10963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alleged abuse victims were interviewed, who claimed that children in [[foster care]] were flown to the [[East Coast of the United States]] to be sexually abused at "bad parties".&lt;ref name="Robbins1988b"&gt;{{cite news |last=Robbins |first=William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/us/nebraska-inquiry-is-given-file-on-sex-abuse-of-foster-children.html |title=Nebraska Inquiry Is Given File on Sex Abuse of Foster Children |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 25, 1988 |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The claims primarily centered on Lawrence E. King Jr., who ran the now defunct Franklin Community Federal Credit Union in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and alleged that the ring was "[[Satanic ritual abuse|a cult of devil worshipers involved in the mutilation, sacrifice and cannibalism of numerous children]]".&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins1988a"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/us/a-lurid-mysterious-scandal-begins-taking-shape-in-omaha.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=A Lurid, Mysterious Scandal Begins Taking Shape in Omaha |last=Robbins |first=William |date=December 18, 1988 |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] evolved, claiming that the alleged abuse was part of a widespread series of crimes including devil worship, cannibalism, drug trafficking, and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] arms dealing.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

==State and federal investigations==
The Nebraska State Foster Care Review Board submitted the results of a two-year investigation into the alleged physical and sexual abuse of foster children to the Executive Board of the [[Nebraska Legislature]], who were investigating reports of child sexual abuse linked to the credit union.  After investigation, a [[grand jury]] in [[Douglas County, Nebraska|Douglas County]], where Omaha, Nebraska is situated, determined the abuse allegations were baseless, describing them as a "carefully crafted hoax" and indicting two of the original accusers on [[perjury]] charges.&lt;ref name="Robbins1990"&gt;{{cite news |last=Robbins |first=Williams |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D91630F93AA15754C0A966958260 |title=Omaha Grand Jury Sees Hoax in Lurid Tales |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 29, 1990 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury suspected that the false stories originated from a fired employee of [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], who might have "fueled the fire of rumor and innuendo" because of personal grudges.&lt;ref name="Robbins1990"/&gt;  A [[grand juries in the United States#Federal law|federal grand jury]] also concluded that the abuse allegations were unfounded and indicted 21-year-old Alisha Owen, an alleged victim, on eight counts of [[perjury]].  Owen served 4-1/2 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Convicted"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 9, 1991|title=Unknown|page=6A|quote=Alisha Owen, convicted of lying to grand jury probing charges of sex and drug abuse in failure of Omaha credit union, was sentenced to 9 to 15 years in prison.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Separately, the federal grand jury indicted multiple officers of the credit union for embezzlement of funds, including King.&lt;ref name="Robbins1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lurid Tales"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/27/us/omaha-tales-of-sexual-abuse-ruled-false.html?|title=Omaha Tales of Sexual Abuse Ruled False|agency=Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 27, 1990|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Commentary==
Historian [[Philip Jenkins]] explored how cases such as the Franklin allegations can acquire credibility, even if they lack any credibility inherently, when reported in various media in a credible voice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;  He also explored how such allegations can be seized by political opportunists for their own purposes.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

'''Genetic assimilation''' is a process by which a phenotype originally produced in response to an environmental condition, such as exposure to a [[teratogen]], later becomes genetically encoded via [[artificial selection]] or [[natural selection]]. Despite superficial appearances, this does not require the ([[Lamarckian]]) [[inheritance of acquired characters]], although [[epigenetic inheritance]] could potentially influence the result.&lt;ref name="Pocheville 2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Pocheville | first1=Arnaud | last2=Danchin | first2=Etienne | editor1-last=Huneman | editor1-first=Philippe | editor2-last=Walsh | editor2-first=Denis | title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=January 1, 2017 | pages= | chapter=Chapter 3: Genetic assimilation and the paradox of blind variation | chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/21713421/Genetic_assimilation_and_the_paradox_of_blind_variation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic assimilation overcomes the barrier to selection imposed by genetic [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalization]] of developmental pathways.

The classic example of genetic assimilation was a pair of experiments in 1942 and 1953 by [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad H. Waddington]], in which ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit fly embryos were exposed to ether, producing a [[bithorax]]-like phenotype (a [[homeotic]] change). Flies which developed [[haltere]]s (the modified hindwings of [[true flies]], used for balance) with wing-like characteristics were chosen for breeding for 20 generations, by which point the phenotype could be seen without ether treatment.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book | author=Gilbert, Scott F. | authorlink=Scott F. Gilbert | chapter=Induction and the Origins of Developmental Genetics | title=A Conceptual History of Modern Embryology | publisher=Plenum Press | date=1991 | isbn=978-0306438424 | pages=181–206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent evidence appears to confirm the existence of genetic assimilation in evolution.

==History==
===Waddington's experiments===
[[File:Drosophile normale et cross-veinless.jpg|thumb| Normal and cross-veinless ''[[Drosophila]]'' wings]]

[[C. H. Waddington|Conrad H. Waddington]]'s classic experiment (1942) induced an extreme environmental reaction in the developing embryos of ''[[Drosophila]]''. In response to [[ether]] vapor, a proportion of embryos developed a radical [[phenotype|phenotypic]] change, a second [[thorax]]. At this point in the experiment ''bithorax'' is not innate; it is induced by an unusual environment. Waddington then repeatedly selected ''Drosophila'' for the ''bithorax'' phenotype over some 20 generations. After this time, some ''Drosophila'' developed ''bithorax'' without the ether treatment.&lt;ref name=Waddington1942&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington, C. H. |authorlink=Conrad Hal Waddington |date=1942 |title=Canalization of development and the inheritance of acquired characters |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=150 |pages=563–565 |doi=10.1038/150563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington carried out a similar experiment in 1953, this time inducing the ''cross-veinless'' [[phenocopy]] in ''Drosophila'' with a heat shock, with 40% of the flies showing the phenotype prior to selection. Again he selected for the phenotype over several generations, applying heat shock each time, and eventually the phenotype appeared even without heat shock.&lt;ref name="Waddington1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waddington |first1=C. H. |authorlink=Conrad Hal Waddington |title=Genetic Assimilation of an Acquired Character |journal=Evolution |date=1953 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=118–126 |doi=10.2307/2405747 |jstor=2405747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Masel |first1=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Genetic assimilation can occur in the absence of selection for the assimilating phenotype, suggesting a role for the canalization heuristic |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology |date=2004 |volume=17 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00739.x |url=http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/badyaev/ecol596e/assimilation.pdf |pmid=15312082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waddington's explanation===

Waddington called the effect he had seen genetic assimilation. His explanation was that it was caused by a process he called [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalization]]. He compared [[embryonic development]] to a ball rolling down a slope in what he called an epigenetic landscape, where each point on the landscape is a possible state of the organism (involving many variables). As a particular pathway becomes entrenched or canalized, it becomes more stable, likely to occur even in the face of environmental changes. Major perturbations such as ether or heat shock eject the developmental pathway from the [[metaphor]]ical canal, exploring other parts of the epigenetic landscape. Selection in the presence of that perturbation leads to the evolution of a new canal; after the perturbation is discontinued, the new canal continues to attract developmental trajectories.&lt;ref name="Masel"/&gt;

===A Darwinian explanation===

Other biologists have agreed that assimilation occurs, but give a different, purely [[quantitative genetics]] explanation in terms of [[natural selection|natural]] or [[artificial selection]]. The [[phenotype]], say ''cross-veinless'', is presumed to be caused by a combination of multiple genes. The phenotype appears when the sum of [[Quantitative genetics#Gene effects|gene effects]] exceeds a [[threshold model|threshold]] that is lower with the perturbation than without. Continued selection under perturbation conditions increases the frequency of the alleles of genes that promote the phenotype until the higher threshold is breached, and the phenotype appears without requiring the heat shock.&lt;ref name="Masel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Falconer | first1=D. S. | last2=Mackay | first2=Trudy F. C. | title=Introduction to quantitative genetics | date=1998 | publisher=Longman | isbn=0-582-24302-5 | pages=309–310 | edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbations can be genetic or epigenetic rather than environmental. For example, ''Drosophila'' fruit flies have a heat shock protein, [[Hsp90]], which protects the development of many structures in the adult fly from heat shock. If the protein is damaged by a mutation, then just as if it were damaged by the environmental effects of drugs, many different phenotypic variants appear; if these are selected for, they quickly establish without further need for the mutant Hsp90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutherford, S. L.; Lindquist, S. |title=Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=1998 |volume=396 |pages=336–342 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6709/full/396336a0.html |doi=10.1038/24550 |pmid=9845070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Darwinism or Lamarckism?==

Waddington's theory of genetic assimilation was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1658254/Science_Politics_or_Lamarckism_C._H._Waddingtons_alternative_approach_to_Darwinism Science, Politics or Lamarckism?

They denied that the inheritance of acquired characteristics had taken place, and asserted that Waddington had simply observed the [[natural selection]] of genetic variants that already existed in the study population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=Scott F. |authorlink=Scott F.

Adam S. Wilkins wrote that "[Waddington] in his lifetime... was widely perceived primarily as a critic of Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. His criticisms ... were focused on what he saw as unrealistic, 'atomistic' models of both gene selection and trait evolution." In particular, according to Wilkins, Waddington felt that the Neo-Darwinians badly neglected the phenomenon of extensive gene interactions and that the 'randomness' of mutational effects, posited in the theory, was false.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2008"&gt;Wilkins, Adam S. (2008). ''Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now''. Biological Theory 3: 224-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Waddington became critical of the neo-Darwinian synthetic theory of evolution, he still described himself as a Darwinian, and called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] based on his research.&lt;ref name="Wilkins 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington's epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?'' BioEssays 34: 149-157.&lt;/ref&gt; Waddington did not deny the threshold-based conventional genetic interpretation of his experiments, but regarded it "as a "told to the children" version of what I wished to say" and considered the debate to be about "mode of expression, rather than of substance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Waddington | first1=C. H. | title=Comment on Professor Stern's Letter | journal=The American Naturalist | date=1 November 1958 | volume=92 | issue=867 | pages=375–376 | doi=10.1086/282049 | url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/282049 | issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to adaptation==
Mathematical modeling suggests that under certain circumstances, natural selection favours the evolution of canalization that is designed to fail under extreme conditions.&lt;ref name="Eshel98"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eshel, I.; Matessi, C. | title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation. A quantitative genetic model | journal=Genetics | volume=149 | issue=4 | pages=2119–2133 | date=August 1998 | pmid=9691063 | pmc=1460279 | doi= | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/149/4/2119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, M.]]; Murren, C. J. | title=Perspective: Genetic assimilation and a possible evolutionary paradox: can macroevolution sometimes be so fast as to pass us by? | journal=Evolution | volume=57 | issue=7 | pages=1455–64 | date=July 2003 | pmid=12940351 | doi=10.1554/02-381 | url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1554/02-381}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the result of such a failure is favoured by natural selection, genetic assimilation occurs. In the 1960s Waddington and J. M. Rendel argued for the importance of genetic assimilation in natural adaptation as a means of providing new and potentially beneficial variation to populations under stress, enabling them to evolve rapidly. Their contemporary [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] argued that genetic assimilation proceeds at the cost of a loss of previously adaptive [[developmental plasticity]], and therefore should be seen as resulting in a net loss rather than gain of complexity, making it uninteresting from the perspective of the constructive process of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=George Christopher |authorlink=George Christopher Williams |title=Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWZEq87CqO0C&amp;pg=PP71 |year=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-2010-3 |pages=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the preceding [[phenotypic plasticity]] need not be adaptive, but simply represent a breakdown of [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]].&lt;ref name="Eshel98" /&gt;

== In natural populations==
[[File:Chappell Island tiger snake.jpg|thumb|''[[Notechis scutatus]]'' tiger snakes from islands, like this one from Chappell Island, have larger heads than mainland populations, apparently genetically assimilated.&lt;ref name=AubretShine2009/&gt;]]

Several instances of genetic assimilation have been documented contributing to natural selection in the wild. For example, populations of the island tiger snakes (''[[Notechis scutatus]]'') have become isolated on islands and have larger heads to cope with large prey animals. Young populations have larger heads by phenotypic plasticity, whereas large heads have become genetically assimilated in older populations.&lt;ref name=AubretShine2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aubret, F.; Shine, R. |date=2009 |title=Genetic assimilation and the postcolonisation erosion of phenotypic plasticity in island Tiger snakes |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |pages=1932–1936 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.061 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(09)01775-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, patterns of left-right asymmetry or "handedness", when present, can be determined either genetically or plastically. During evolution, genetically determined directional asymmetry can arise either from a nonheritable (phenotypic) developmental process, or directly by [[mutation (biology)|mutation]] from a symmetric ancestor. An excess of transitions from plastically determined to genetically determined handedness points to the role of genetic assimilation in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmer |first1=A. Richard |title=Symmetry breaking and the evolution of development |journal=Science |date=2004 |volume=306|issue=5697 |pages=828–833 |doi=10.1126/science.1103707 |pmid=15514148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third example has been seen in [[yeast]]. Evolutionary events in which [[stop codon]]s are lost  preserve the [[reading frame]] much more often than would be expected from mutation bias. This finding is consistent with the role of the [[Fungal prion|yeast prion]] [PSI+] in epigenetically facilitating stop codon readthrough, followed by genetic assimilation via the permanent loss of the stop codon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giacomelli |first1=M.

'''Herbert Thomas Mandl''' (August 18, 1926 - February 22, 2007) was a [[Czechoslovak]]-[[Germans|German]]-[[Jewish]] author, concert [[violin]]ist, professor of [[music]], [[philosopher]], [[inventor]] and [[lecturer]]. He authored novels, stories and dramas that are inspired by the extraordinary events of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerverlag.de/MANDL-B1.HTM |title=Mandl Biography |publisher=Boerverlag.de |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meerbuscher-kulturkreis.de/kuenstlergalerie/literatur/mandl/mandl.htm |title=Mandl (Vita) |publisher=Meerbuscher-kulturkreis.de |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928194655/http://www.meerbuscher-kulturkreis.de/kuenstlergalerie/literatur/mandl/mandl.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerverlag.de/MANDL-B2.HTM |title=Mandl Theatre Work |publisher=Boerverlag.de |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mandl was born in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the son of [[Czech (people)|Czech]] Jewish parents, the engineer [[Daniel Mandl]] and Hajnalka Mandl. He was educated in Jewish and Czech schools in Bratislava and in [[Brno]]. He began to play the violin at the age of 6.

The Mandls were living in Brno when the remains of Czechoslovakia were annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] on March 15, 1939. Mandl was 13 at the time. In 1942, Mandl and his parents were deported to the Terezín ([[Theresienstadt]]) ghetto. In 1944, Mandl and his father were transported to the [[Auschwitz]] [[concentration camp]], thence to several [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]-[[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] satellite camps, where Mandl's father died. At the end of [[World War II]], Mandl was repatriated to Czechoslovakia where he was reunited with his mother.

Once free, Mandl returned to his studies. He was ultimately awarded a doctorate in the performing arts (violin) from the Academy of Performing Arts (Akademie Múzických Umění)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amu.cz/ |title=amu.cz |language=cs |publisher=amu.cz |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]], where he met his future wife, Jaroslava (“Slavi”), a concert pianist. While professors of music at the Janáček Conservatory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jko.cz |title=jko.cz |publisher=jko.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ostrava]], the Mandls developed several plans for escaping to the West from the oppressive conditions in Communist Czechoslovakia. Mandl himself finally succeeded in [[Cairo]], where he broke away from his tourist group and applied for asylum at the United States Embassy in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairo.usembassy.gov |title=cairo.usembassy.gov |publisher=cairo.usembassy.gov |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was suspected of being a spy, and the [[CIA]] interrogated him for months. When released, he was placed in a refugee camp in [[Zirndorf]], [[West Germany]]. (“There were as many spies as real refugees there,” he had said of Zirndorf.) Once granted the status of political refugee, Mandl moved to [[Cologne]], where he became the private secretary of [[Heinrich Böll]], the recipient of the 1972 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Since Mandl’s wife Slavi had remained behind in Ostrava (this was by the Mandls' prior agreement), [[Heinrich Böll|Böll]] had agreed to help smuggle her to the West. He engaged a professional illusionist to build a hideaway in his personal automobile, a Citroen DS-19, drove to Czechoslovakia with his entire family and smuggled Slavi out. This incident is documented in Mandl's autobiography, ''Durst, Musik, Geheime Dienste''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerverlag.de/MANDL1.HTM |title=Boer Verlag, Herbert Thomas Mandl, Durst, Musik, Geheime Dienste |publisher=Boerverlag.de |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in Germany in 1995 and in a Bavarian television film directed by Gloria de Siano.

In later years, Mandl produced and edited cultural broadcasts that were transmitted to Communist Eastern Europe by the West German radio station [[Deutsche Welle]] in Cologne. He and Slavi twice emigrated to the USA, where he studied psychology at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], Washington and was supervisor on the ward for the criminally insane at [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], Washington. In 1971, the Mandls permanently returned to West Germany, settling in [[Meerbusch]]-[[Büderich (Meerbusch)|Büderich]]. Mandl found a position as a professor of English at the Roman Catholic evening [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Nikolaus-Groß-Abendgymnasium|de}}) in [[Essen]], where he remained until his retirement.

In addition to his other talents, Mandl was an inventor. He developed and patented two very different devices. One was a transparent model of a human head (the phonetic head)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4096645.html |title=Phonetic teaching device - Mandl, Thomas Herbert |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=1978-06-27 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contained movable speech organs and was used to help teach pronunciation of foreign languages. The second was the [[Suggestometer]], a complex device that could be used to measure human suggestibility empirically – something that was considered impossible by research psychologists at the time. Mandl was also a very successful psychotherapist who continued to provide mental health treatment even after his retirement. During the last decades of his life, Mandl was a very active as a contemporary witness to the musical scene in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) ghetto; he had played the violin in the [[camp orchestra]] in 1943/44 under the batons of [[Karel Ančerl]] and [[Carlo Sigmund Taube]].

Mandl was a tireless contemporary witness to the horrors of life under totalitarian regimes and particularly to the Holocaust, traveling throughout Europe and North America to deliver his message. As one of the few survivors of the [[Terezín]] ghetto musical scene, he provided expert eyewitness accounts for this extraordinary phenomenon.

== Literary Themes ==
The central theme of Mandl’s literary work is the battle of the individual against the sophisticated instruments of totalitarian oppression: secret services, isolation, psychological torture, brainwashing, incarceration, starvation, the debilitating effects of the "daily grind" in the most difficult of circumstances. As in works by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[George Orwell]], Mandl's protagonists, armed only with their reason, stand alone against all the sophisticated torture arts of their seemingly omnipotent opponents. In his works, Mandl underscores the drama of this unequal combat by interspersing the narrative with philosophical reflections written in clear and meaningful language. His novel, [[The Philosopher’s Wager]] (published in Germany in 1996 as Die Wette des Philosophen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerverlag.de/MANDL2.HTM |title=Boer Verlag, Herbert Thomas Mandl, Die Wette des Philosophen |publisher=Boerverlag.de |date= |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is remarkable for its vivid portrayal of not just the most mundane aspects of life in the [[Terezín]] ([[Theresienstadt]]) [[ghetto]] but also of the extensive, if illegal, cultural and musical life of the ghetto. (For more on this subject, see also [http://makarovainit.com/first.htm University Over the Abyss] by Elena Makarova, Sergei Makarov and Viktor Kuperman).

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''intuitionism''', or '''neointuitionism''' (opposed to [[preintuitionism]]), is an approach where [[mathematics]] is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.

== Truth and proof ==

The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true. In [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer's]] original intuitionism, the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim: a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction, and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by [[logical intuition|intuition]]. The vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning. [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position, yet Brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless, given his rejection of the realist/Platonist position. Intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill-defined. However, because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics, the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything they prove is in fact intuitionistically true. This gives rise to [[intuitionistic logic]].

To an intuitionist, the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed. Any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a [[mind]], and therefore, the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction. This contrasts with the classical approach, which states that the existence of an entity can be proved by refuting its non-existence. For the intuitionist, this is not valid; the refutation of the non-existence does not mean that it is possible to find a construction for the putative object, as is required in order to assert its existence. As such, intuitionism is a variety of [[mathematical constructivism]]; but it is not the only kind.

The interpretation of [[negation]] is different in intuitionist logic than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is ''false''; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is ''refutable''&lt;ref&gt;

(e.g., that there is a [[counterexample]]). There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism. If a statement ''P'' is provable, then it is certainly impossible to prove that there is no proof of ''P''. But even if it can be shown that no disproof of ''P'' is possible, we cannot conclude from this absence that there ''is'' a proof of ''P''. Thus ''P'' is a stronger statement than ''not-not-P''.

Similarly, to assert that ''A'' [[logical disjunction|or]] ''B'' holds, to an intuitionist, is to claim that either ''A'' or ''B'' can be ''proved''. In particular, the [[law of excluded middle]], "''A'' or [[negation|not]] ''A''", is not accepted as a valid principle.  For example, if ''A'' is some mathematical statement that an intuitionist has not yet proved or disproved, then that intuitionist will not assert the truth of "''A'' or not ''A''". However, the intuitionist will accept that "''A'' and not ''A''" cannot be true. Thus the connectives "and" and "or" of intuitionistic logic do not satisfy [[de Morgan's laws]] as they do in classical logic.

[[Intuitionistic logic]] substitutes constructability for abstract [[truth]] and is associated with a transition from the proof of [[model theory]] to abstract [[truth#Truth in mathematics|truth in modern mathematics]]. The logical calculus preserves justification, rather than truth, across transformations yielding derived propositions. It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy, most notably the [[Anti-realism]] of [[Michael Dummett]]. Thus, contrary to the first impression its name might convey, and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines (e.g. Fuzzy Sets and Systems), intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics, where, ironically, the foundational elements which Intuitionism attempts to construct/refute/refound are taken as intuitively given.

== Intuitionism and infinity ==

Among the different formulations of intuitionism, there are several different positions on the meaning and reality of infinity.

The term [[potential infinity]] refers to a mathematical procedure in which there is an unending series of steps. After each step has been completed, there is always another step to be performed. For example, consider the process of counting: {{nowrap|1=1, 2, 3, ...}}

The term [[actual infinity]] refers to a completed mathematical object which contains an infinite number of elements. An example is the set of [[natural number]]s, {{nowrap|1={{math|'''N'''}} = {1, 2, ...}.}}

In Cantor's formulation of set theory, there are many different infinite sets, some of which are larger than others. For example, the set of all real numbers {{math|'''R'''}} is larger than {{math|'''N'''}}, because any procedure that you attempt to use to put the natural numbers into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers will always fail: there will always be an infinite number of real numbers "left over". Any infinite set that can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers is said to be "countable" or "denumerable". Infinite sets larger than this are said to be "uncountable".

Cantor's set theory led to the axiomatic system of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC), now the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of modern mathematics]]. Intuitionism was created, in part, as a reaction to Cantor's set theory.

Modern [[constructive set theory]] includes the axiom of infinity from ZFC (or a revised version of this axiom) and the set {{math|'''N'''}} of natural numbers. Most modern constructive mathematicians accept the reality of countably infinite sets (however, see [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]] for a counter-example).

Brouwer rejected the concept of actual infinity, but admitted the idea of potential infinity.
:"According to Weyl 1946, 'Brouwer made it clear, as I think beyond any doubt, that there is no evidence supporting the belief in the existential character of the totality of all natural numbers ... the sequence of numbers which grows beyond any stage already reached by passing to the next number, is a manifold of possibilities open towards infinity; it remains forever in the status of creation, but is not a closed realm of things existing in themselves. That we blindly converted one into the other is the true source of our difficulties, including the antinomies – a source of more fundamental nature than Russell's vicious circle principle indicated. Brouwer opened our eyes and made us see how far classical mathematics, nourished by a belief in the 'absolute' that transcends all human possibilities of realization, goes beyond such statements as can claim real meaning and truth founded on evidence." (Kleene (1952): ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', p. 48-49)

== History of intuitionism ==

Intuitionism's history can be traced to two controversies in nineteenth century mathematics.

The first of these was the invention of [[transfinite arithmetic]] by [[Georg Cantor]] and its subsequent rejection by a number of prominent mathematicians including most famously his teacher [[Leopold Kronecker]]—a confirmed [[finitism|finitist]].

The second of these was [[Gottlob Frege]]'s effort to reduce all of mathematics to a logical formulation via set theory and its derailing by a youthful [[Bertrand Russell]], the discoverer of [[Russell's paradox]]. Frege had planned a three volume definitive work, but just as the second volume was going to press, Russell sent Frege a letter outlining his paradox, which demonstrated that one of Frege's rules of self-reference was self-contradictory.  In an appendix to the second volume, Frege magnanimously acknowledged that one of the axioms of his system did in fact lead to Russell's paradox.&lt;ref&gt;See "Frege on Russell's Paradox" in ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', edited by Peter Geach and Max Black, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1960, pp.&amp;nbsp;234–44; translated from ''Grudgesetze der Arithmetik'', Vol. ii, Appendix, pp.&amp;nbsp;253–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege, the story goes, plunged into depression and did not publish the third volume of his work as he had planned. For more see Davis (2000) Chapters 3 and 4: Frege: ''From Breakthrough to Despair'' and Cantor: ''Detour through Infinity.'' See van Heijenoort for the original works and van Heijenoort's commentary.

These controversies are strongly linked as the logical methods used by Cantor in proving his results in transfinite arithmetic are essentially the same as those used by Russell in constructing his paradox. Hence how one chooses to resolve Russell's paradox has direct implications on the status accorded to Cantor's transfinite arithmetic.

In the early twentieth century [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L. E. J. Brouwer]] represented the ''intuitionist'' position and [[David Hilbert]] the [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] position—see van Heijenoort. [[Kurt Gödel]] offered opinions referred to as ''Platonist'' (see various sources re Gödel). [[Alan Turing]] considers:
"non-constructive [[systems of logic]] with which not all the steps in a proof are mechanical, some being intuitive". (Turing 1939, reprinted in Davis 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;210) Later, [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] brought forth a more rational consideration of intuitionism in his Introduction to Meta-mathematics (1952).

:: From van Heijenoort's commentary it is unclear whether or not Herbrand was a true "intuitionist"; Gödel (1963) asserted that indeed "...Herbrand was an intuitionist". But van Heijenoort says Herbrand's conception was "on the whole much closer to that of Hilbert's word 'finitary' ('finit') that to "intuitionistic" as applied to Brouwer's doctrine".

'''Ivan Vasilyevich Kireyevsky''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ива́н Васи́льевич Кире́евский}}; 3 April 1806 in [[Moscow]] – 23 June 1856 in [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Russians|Russian]] literary critic and philosopher who, together with [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], is credited as a co-founder of the [[Slavophile]] movement.

==Early life and career==
Ivan Kireyevsky and his brother [[Pyotr Kireevsky|Pyotr]] were born into a cultivated noble family of considerable means. Their father was known for hating French atheism so passionately that he would burn heaps of [[Voltaire]]'s books, acquired specifically for the purpose;&lt;ref&gt;''Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters'' (ed. by Russell Bova). M.E. Sharpe Publishers, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7656-0976-2}}. Page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; his fatal disease was contracted while healing the wounded soldiers during the [[French invasion of Russia]]. The boy was just six at the time of his death; he was brought up by a maternal uncle, [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], and the mother, M-me [[Avdotya Yelagina]], an influential lady who held a brilliant salon in Moscow. She professed her dislike of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] for his treatment of his [[Eudoxia Lopukhina|wife Eudoxia]] and the Lopukhin family, to which she was related. The father's distaste for French culture and the mother's distrust of post-Petrine officialdom may have shaped Kireyevsky's views on Russia and its history.

Starting in 1821, Kireyevsky attended the [[Moscow University]], where he became interested in contemporary German philosophy and joined the circle of "wisdom-lovers" ([[Lyubomudry]]), led by [[Dmitry Venevitinov]] and [[Vladimir Odoevsky]]. He was particularly impressed by the teachings of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], whose representation of the world as a living organism was in tune with Kireyevsky's own intense dislike of European rationalism and fragmentedness. Kireyevsky's original literary works do not give him a place in the history of [[Russian literature]], but he did gain a measure of fame by publishing the penetrating analyses of contemporary authors. His 1828 review of [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s poetry, written in [[purple prose]] and entitled "Some Observations about the Character of Pushkin's Poetry", contained the first in-depth assessment of ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. Later, Kireyevsky would exchange letters with Pushkin and publish his works in his short-lived periodical "Yevropeyets" (''The European'').

After having been refused by his cousin, Kireyevsky set out for Europe, where he attended the lectures of Schelling, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Hegel]], and [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]]. During his travels, he perceived the rotten foundations of Western society, based on [[individualism]], which he would later contrast with the integrality (''[[sobornost]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Kireyevsky's definition of ''sobornost'': "The sum total of all Christians of all ages, past and present, comprise one indivisible, eternal living assembly of the faithful, held together just as much by the unity of consciousness as through the communion of prayer". Quoted from: Ninian Smart, John Clayton, Patrick Sherry, Steven T. Katz. ''Nineteenth-Century Religious Thought in the West''. Cambridge University Press, 1988. Page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; of Russian society. Back in Moscow by 1832, he "united all the literary aristocracy" (as [[Mikhail Pogodin|Pogodin]] said) under the aegis of "Yevropeyets". The journal was banned after two issues, but not before Kireyevsky published his large article ''The Nineteenth Century'', his first extended critique of Western philosophy and values.

The failure of "Yevropeyets" exacerbated Kireyevsky's disappointment in Russian intellectuals and elite. He married and applied himself wholeheartedly to family life. Many critics, starting with [[Alexander Herzen|Herzen]], tended to attribute the twelve-year hiatus in Kireyevsky's literary career to his [[Oblomov]]ian inclination to indecision and inaction.&lt;ref&gt;Alexei S. Khomiakov, Ivan Kireevskii, Boris Jakim, Robert Bird. ''On Spiritual Unity''. SteinerBooks, 1998. {{ISBN|0-940262-91-6}}. Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, his whole literary output consists of a dozen full-length articles and may be collected within a single volume (The full 1911 collection of his works, including letters, is 600 pages in two volumes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://imwerden.de/cat/modules.php?name=books&amp;pa=showbook&amp;pid=1260 Иван Васильевич Киреевский «Полное собрание сочинений. Том 1» (1911)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imwerden.de/cat/modules.php?name=books&amp;pa=showbook&amp;pid=1261 Иван Васильевич Киреевский «Полное собрание сочинений. Том 2» (1911)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and ideas==
It was not until the early 1840s that Kireyevsky reappeared on the intellectual scene of Moscow to take the side of Khomyakov in his controversy with Herzen, [[Timofey Granovsky]] and other young "Westernizers". Since the reactionary reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] was not favourable for journalistic activities, Khomyakov and Kireyevsky criticized the "one-sided, superficial, analytical rationality" of the West in salons and soirées of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Imagination and Cultural Memory''. Duke University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8223-1307-3}}. Page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his few written works, Kireyevsky contrasted the philosophy of [[Plato]] and Greek [[Church Fathers]] (notably [[Maximus the Confessor]]) with the rationalism of [[Aristotle]] and medieval Catholic [[Doctors of the Church]]. He blamed Aristotle "for molding the mind of the West in the iron cast of reasonableness", which he defined as timid prudence (as opposed to true wisdom) or the "striving for the better within the circle of the commonplace".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Buruma]], Avishai Margalit. ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of Its Enemies''. Penguin, 2004. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]]'s doctrines were seen as the latest emanation of Aristotle's analytical approach, which divorced mind from soul, thoughts from (religious) feelings.

Kireyevsky aspired to retrieve the lost wholeness of Man in the teachings of Eastern Orthodoxy. His devout wife introduced him to the elders ([[starets|startsy]]) of the [[Optina Monastery]], which he frequented in the declining years of his life. Although he did not share [[Yuri Samarin]]'s radical enthusiasm for all things pre-Petrine, Kireyevsky extolled the spiritual treasures of medieval Russia. According to him, the monasteries of ancient Rus' "radiated a uniform and harmonious light of faith and learning" to disparate Slavonic tribes and principalities. The net of churches and monasteries covered Russia so thickly, that these 'bonds of spiritual community' unified the country into "a single living organism".&lt;ref&gt;Susanna Rabow-Edling. ''Slavophile Thought And the Politics of Cultural Nationalism''. SUNY Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7914-6693-0}}. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at the age of 50 during a cholera epidemic. His brother Pyotr outlived him by several months. They were buried side by side in the Optina Monastery, the first laymen to be honoured so.

'''Ivan Vyshenskyi''' ({{lang-uk |Іван Вишенський}}; born ca. 1550 in [[Sudova Vyshnia]] &amp;ndash; after 1620, [[Mount Athos]], [[Greece]]) was a Ukrainian orthodox [[monk]] and religious [[philosopher]]. He is considered to be an important [[polemicist]] of the time.

==Biography==
Not much is known about the life of Vyshenskyi. It is considered to be likely that he spent part of his youth in [[Lutsk]] and was connected with scholars from the [[Ostroh Academy]]. Within the years 1576–1580 he traveled to [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]], which was the center of orthodox monk culture. He stayed there until his death, with the exception of a short visit to Ukraine between 1604 and 1606 when he quarreled with members of the Lviv brotherhood.

==Work==
In his writings, Vyshenskyi opposed [[Catholicism]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|uniate church]]. He sent messages arguing his position from Mount Athos. Vyshenskyi was especially polemic in his communications with [[Piotr Skarga]], who supported church union. His arguments were based on opposition to the church hierarchy of Catholicism and to [[Byzantine]] asceticism. Vyshenskyi wrote not in the common [[Church Slavonic language]], but in the [[Ruthenian language]], an older form of [[Ukrainian (language)|Ukrainian]].

'''Joseph Rizzo''' (18th century) was a minor Maltese philosopher and [[theologian]] who probably specialised in [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Rizzo was a diocesan priest. He studied theology, and was a professor of philosophy. He taught philosophy in [[Malta]] at least between 1781 and 1782. No other information is known as yet about his personal life, and no portrait of him seems to have survived.

==Extant work==
Though Rizzo was no exceptional thinker, his interest and prowess in philosophy is not to be shunned. The only extant writing known to be his is called '''''De Essentia Philosophiæ''''' (Concerning the Essence of Philosophy),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;Archive of the Cathedral, Mdina, MS. Pan.113.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, which is in Latin and contains 171 folios, survived as part of the private collection of Fortunatus Panzavecchia. It is not written in Rizzo’s own handwriting, but that of Joseph Ciantar, one of Rizzo’s students. In fact, the document is a report of Rizzo’s lectures given in 1781 through 1782. It is unknown where the lectures were delivered. The division of the work is in the typical style of [[Scholasticism]]; in disputes and questions.

The extant manuscript is made up of a nine booklets. However, these probably formed only part of the whole document or documents, for at the beginning it states that it is the first volume (suggesting that other volumes would follow). Unfortunately, the other parts seem to have gone missing. In fact, since the subject-theme of the extant booklets solely concern logic, and the general title certainly suggests that the writing is about more than just logic, it might be concluded that other parts, dealing perhaps with metaphysics, physics, ''etc.'', are lost or misplaced.

One of the extant booklets has the title ''Controversiæ Logices'' (Controversies concerning Logic). Here Rizzo discusses various points which had been still unresolved during his time. Rizzo states that logic may be divided into ''institutiones'' (decided questions) and ''controversias'' (undecided questions). One of the latter, on which a discussing was on-going, asked whether [[Adam]] had a philosophy. As with others, Rizzo deals with this ‘controversy’ first generally and then particularly. In this particular section, Rizzo decides that [[Adam]] did indeed have a philosophy of his own, and gives his arguments to uphold such a doctrine.

The work starts off with an introduction on the nature of philosophy. The rest of the document, apart from the section mentioned above, successively deals with the term ‘logic’; the origins, recognition and growth of [[logic]]; and the different schools (‘sects’ he calls them) of logic. Rizzo also deals with the definition of logic, the nature of the work done by the human intellect, and also with the mental (or logical) operations involved in rational mistakes, the source of their processes, and their possible remedies.

'''Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈjuzɛf ˈxɛnɛ ˈvrɔɲskʲi|lang}}; {{lang-fr|Josef Hoëné-Wronski}}, {{IPA-fr|ɔɛne vʁonski|pron}}; 23 August 1776 – 9 August 1853) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[History of philosophy in Poland#Messianism|Messianist philosopher]], [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[inventor]], [[lawyer]], and [[economist]]. He was born Hoene to a municipal architect in 1776 but changed his name in 1815.

In 1803, Wroński joined the [[Marseille Observatory]] but was forced to leave the observatory after his theories were dismissed as grandiose rubbish. In mathematics, Wroński introduced a novel series expansion for a function in response to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]'s use of infinite series. The coefficients in Wroński's new series form the [[Wronskian]], a [[determinant]] [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Thomas Muir]] named in 1882.

==Life==
His father, Antoni, was the municipal architect of [[Poznań]] and came from a [[Czechs|Czech]] family settled in western Poland. Józef was educated in Poznań and [[Warsaw]]. In 1794 he served in Poland's [[Kościuszko Uprising]] as a second lieutenant of artillery, was taken prisoner, and remained until 1797 in the Russian Army.  After resigning in the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1798, he studied in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1800, when he enlisted in the [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legion]] at [[Marseille]].  There he began his scientific and scholarly work and conceived the idea of a great philosophical system.  Ten years later he moved to [[Paris]] where he would spend most of his life working unremittingly to the last in the most difficult material circumstances.

He wrote exclusively in [[French language|French]], in the desire that his ideas, of whose immortality he was convinced, should be accessible to all; he worked, he said, "through France for Poland."   He published over a hundred works, and left many more in manuscript; at 75 years of age and nearing death, he exclaimed:  "God Almighty, there's still so much more I wanted to say!"

In science, Hoene-Wroński set himself an extraordinary task:  the complete reform of philosophy as well as that of mathematics, astronomy and  technology.  He not only elaborated a system of philosophy, but also applications to politics, history, economics, law, psychology, music and [[pedagogy]].  It was his aspiration to reform human knowledge in an "absolute, that is, ultimate" manner.

In 1803, Wroński joined the Marseille Observatory, and began developing an enormously complex theory of the structure and origin of the [[universe]].  During this period, he took up a correspondence with nearly all of the major scientists and mathematicians of his day, and was well respected at the observatory. In 1803 Wronski "experienced a mystical illumination, which he regarded as the discovery of the Absolute."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|author-link=|year=2008|chapter=Ritual magic from 1850 to the present|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPwoK5XYXrAC&amp;pg=PA192|title=The Western esoteric traditions: a historical introduction|location=Oxford [u.a.]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195320992|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, he published the results of his scientific research in a massive tome, which he advocated as a new foundation for all of science and mathematics.  His theories were strongly [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], holding numbers and their properties to be the fundamental underpinning of essentially everything in the universe.  His claims were met with little acceptance, and his research and theories were generally dismissed as grandiose rubbish.  His earlier correspondence with major figures meant that his writings garnered more attention than a typical [[crackpot theory]], even earning a review from the great mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (which turned out to be categorically unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alphonse Rebière]], ''Mathématiques et Mathématiciens'', Paris, 1998, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ensuing controversy, he was forced to leave the observatory.

He immediately turned his focus towards applying philosophy to mathematics (his critics believed that this meant dispensing with mathematical rigor in favor of generalities).  In 1812, he published a paper purporting to show that every [[equation]] has an [[algebra]]ic solution, directly contradicting results which had been recently published by [[Paolo Ruffini]]; Ruffini turned out to be correct.

He later turned his attention to disparate and largely unsuccessful pursuits such as a fantastical design for [[caterpillar]]-like vehicles which he intended to replace [[railroad]] transportation, but did not manage to persuade anyone to give the design serious attention.  In 1819, he travelled to [[England]] in an attempt to obtain financial backing from the [[Board of Longitude]] to build a device to determine [[longitude]] at sea.  After initial difficulties, he was given an opportunity to address the Board, but his pretentious address, ''On the Longitude'', contained much philosophizing and generalities, but no concrete plans for a working device, and thus failed to gain any support from the Board&lt;ref name="Address to the British Board of Longitude"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoehne Wronsk|first=M|year=1820|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5HhbAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdid=book-5HhbAAAAQAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=Address ... to the British Board of longitude upon the actual state of the mathematics ... and upon the new celestial mechanics, giving the definitive solution of the problem of longitude|location=Oxford|publisher=T. Egerton|translator-last=Gardiner|translator-first=W}} &lt;/ref&gt;.  He remained for several years in England and, in 1821, published an introductory text on mathematics in [[London]], which moderately improved his financial situation.

In 1822, he returned to France, and again took up a combination of mathematics and far-fetched ideas, despite being in poverty and scorned by intellectual society. Along with his continuing Pythagorean obsession, he spent much time working on several notoriously futile endeavors, including attempts to build a [[perpetual motion machine]], to [[squaring the circle|square the circle]] and to build a machine to predict the future (which he dubbed the ''prognometre'').
In 1852, shortly before his death, he did find a willing audience for his ideas: the [[occultist]] [[Eliphas Levi]] who met Wroński and was greatly impressed and "attracted by his religious and scientific utopianism." Wroński was "a powerful catalyst" for Levi's occultism.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke2008"/&gt;

Wroński died in 1853 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France, on the outskirts of Paris.

[[File:Józef Hoene-Wroński by Vallotton.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Félix Vallotton]]]]
During his lifetime nearly all his work was dismissed as nonsense. However, some of it came to be regarded in a more favourable light in later years. Although most of his inflated claims were groundless, his mathematical work contains flashes of deep insight and many important intermediary results, the most significant of which was his work on [[series (mathematics)|series]]. He had strongly criticized [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] for his use of infinite series, introducing instead a novel series expansion for a function.  His criticisms of Lagrange were for the most part unfounded but the coefficients in Wroński's new series proved important after his death, forming a  [[determinant]] now known as the [[Wronskian]] (the name which [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Thomas Muir]] had given them in 1882).

The level of Wroński's scientific and scholarly accomplishments and the amplitude of his objectives placed Wroński in the first rank of European [[metaphysician]]s in the early 19th century.  But the abstract formalism and obscurity of his thought, the difficulty of his language, his boundless self-assurance and his uncompromising judgments of others alienated him from most of the scientific community.  He was perhaps the most original of the Polish [[metaphysician]]s, but others were more representative of the Polish outlook.

'''''Language, Truth, and Logic''''' is a 1936 work of [[philosophy]] by [[A. J. Ayer|Alfred Jules Ayer]]. It brought some of the ideas of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical empiricists]] to the attention of the English-speaking world.

In the book, Ayer defines, explains, and argues for the [[verification principle]] of [[logical positivism]], sometimes referred to as the ''criterion of significance'' or ''criterion of meaning''. Ayer explains how the [[Verification principle|principle of verifiability]] may be applied to the problems of philosophy.

==Historical background==
According to Ayer's autobiographical book, ''Part of My Life'', it was work he started in the summer and autumn of 1933 that eventually led to ''Language, Truth and Logic'', specifically ''Demonstration of the Impossibility of Metaphysics''—later published in ''Mind'' under the editorship of [[G.E. Moore]]. The title of the book was taken ("To some extent plagiarized" according to Ayer) from [[Friedrich Waismann]]'s ''Logik, Sprache, Philosophie''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Part of my Life'', p. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criterion of meaning==

According to Ayer, analytic statements are tautologies. A tautology is a statement that is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], true by definition, and true under any conditions. A tautology is a repetition of the meaning of a statement, using different words or symbols. According to Ayer, the statements of logic and mathematics are tautologies. Tautologies are true by definition, and thus their validity does not depend on [[empirical]] testing.

Synthetic statements, or empirical propositions, assert or deny something about the real world. The validity of synthetic statements is not established merely by the definition of the words or symbols they contain. According to Ayer, if a statement expresses an empirical proposition, then the validity of the proposition is established by its empirical verifiability.

Propositions are statements that have conditions under which they can be verified. By the verification principle, meaningful statements have conditions under which their validity can be affirmed or denied.

Statements that are not meaningful cannot be expressed as propositions. Every verifiable proposition is meaningful, although it may be either true or false. Every proposition asserts or denies something, and thus is either true or false.

==Types of verification==

Ayer distinguishes between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ verification, noting that there is a limit to how conclusively a proposition can be verified. ‘Strong’ (fully conclusive) verification is not possible for any empirical proposition, because the validity of any proposition always depends upon further experience. ‘Weak’ (probable) verification, on the other hand, is possible for any empirical proposition.

Ayer also distinguishes between practical and theoretical verifiability. Propositions for which we do not have a practical means of verification may still be meaningful if we can verify them in principle.

Literal meaning must also be distinguished from factual meaning. Literal meaning is an attribute of statements that are either analytic or empirically verifiable. Factual meaning is an attribute of statements that are meaningful without being analytic. Thus, statements that have factual meaning say something about the real world.

Ayer agrees with Hume that there are two main classes of propositions: those that concern 'relations of ideas,' and those that concern 'matters of fact.' Propositions about 'relations of ideas' include the a priori propositions of logic and mathematics. Propositions about 'matters of fact,' on the other hand, make assertions about the empirical world.

Ayer argues that philosophic propositions are analytic, and that they are concerned with 'relations of ideas.' The task of philosophy is to clarify the logical relationships of empirical propositions. If the meaning of propositions is defined by verifiability, then philosophy cannot provide speculative truths about metaphysical statements that cannot be empirically verified.

==Metaphysics attacked==

Ayer rejects the metaphysical thesis that philosophy can give us knowledge of a [[transcendent reality]]. He dismisses metaphysical arguments, calling them nonsense, and saying that they cannot be empirically verified. He argues that metaphysical statements have no literal meaning, and that they cannot be subjected to criteria of truth or falsehood.

A significant consequence of abandoning metaphysics as a concern of philosophy is a rejection of the view that the function of philosophy is to propose basic principles of meaning and to construct a [[deductive system]] by offering the consequences of these principles of meaning as a complete picture of reality.  But this is, some may argue, what Ayer does, in presenting the principle of verifiability as a criterion of meaningfulness for any empirical proposition.

According to Ayer, no proposition concerning "matters of fact" can ever be shown to be necessarily true, because there is always a possibility that it may be refuted by further empirical testing. Logical certainty is possible only for analytic observations, which are tautologies, and not for empirical observations concerning "matters of fact."

Ayer explains that his radical empiricism is opposed to rationalism. Rationalism asserts that there are truths about the world that can be known by ''a priori'' reasoning, or independently of experience. According to the principle of verifiability, propositions about 'matters of fact' can be meaningful only if they are capable of being empirically verified.

Ayer agrees with, and elaborates on, Kant’s explanation of the distinction between [[analytic reasoning|analytic]] and [[synthetic reasoning|synthetic judgments]]. According to Ayer, a proposition is analytic if its validity depends only on the definitions of the symbols it contains. A proposition is synthetic if its validity is determined by the facts of experience.

Analytic observations give us new knowledge, because they reveal unsuspected implications of our statements and beliefs. But analytic observations do not give us new knowledge of matters of fact, because they only tell us what is already known.

==Truth as validation==

Ayer defines truth as the criterion by which empirical propositions are validated. To say that a proposition is true is simply to assert it, and to say that a proposition is false is simply to assert a contradictory proposition. Thus, truth and falsehood are simply signs of assertion or denial of empirically verifiable propositions.

In the same manner, assertions of value have meaning only insofar as they are verifiable. If an ethical or aesthetic judgment cannot be subjected to empirical testing, then it is meaningless. An empirical test may be practical or theoretical.

==Value judgments==
{{Main|Emotivism}}
For Ayer, ethical or aesthetic judgments are subjective rather than objective, and cannot be demonstrated to be true or false. Ethical or aesthetic judgments express feelings, not propositions, and have no objective validity. Value-judgments are not analytic, and are not verifiable as 'matters of fact.'

According to Ayer when we argue about whether a value-judgment is right or wrong, we are really arguing about the empirical facts on which a value-judgment is based, or about the logical interpretation of empirical facts. We cannot argue about something that cannot be expressed as a proposition. We can only argue about something that can be analytically or empirically verified.

For Ayer, metaphysical statements, such as statements about transcendent reality, have no objective validity, and therefore are meaningless. Examples of this lack of meaning include statements about the existence or nonexistence of God. According to Ayer, such statements can be neither proven nor disproven, and cannot be validated or invalidated by empirical testing.

==New take on philosophy==

Ayer’s logical empiricism makes an important contribution to philosophy in that it provides a method of putting an end to otherwise irresolvable philosophical disputes. In Ayer's logical empiricism, philosophy is no longer seen as a metaphysical concern, nor as an attempt to provide speculative truths about the nature of ultimate reality. Instead, philosophy is seen as an activity of defining and clarifying the logical relationships of empirical propositions. In considering how to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine,&lt;ref&gt;p140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin 2001 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer also anticipates the development in 1950 of the [[Turing test]] to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence (consciousness).

The principle of verifiability, however, may become a means to arbitrarily reject any abstract or transcendent concept, such as “truth,” “justice,” or "virtue." Such concepts are seen as having no literal meaning. Thus, Ayer’s viewpoint may become a radical scepticism. Ethics, [[aesthetics]], and religion are all viewed as meaningless, as having no literal meaning. Ethical concepts are seen merely as expressions of feeling. Ethical or aesthetic concepts are seen as having no factual content, and therefore cannot be accepted as valid or invalid.

Ayer is careful to explain that the verification principle is a definition of meaning, and that it is not an empirical proposition. He admits that there are other possible definitions of meaning.

The most frequently expressed reservation about the principle is whether it is itself verifiable; this was addressed in the fictional dialogue "Logical Positivism: a discussion".  Ayer believed that it could be derived analytically from usual definitions of words like "understanding".  He admitted that one could then ask for verification of that definition and then carry on into an infinite regress.  Ayer considered the latter option to be simply not worth consideration, although philosophers like [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Richard Rorty]] have since used it to undermine the concrete view of language found in works like ''Language, Truth and Logic''.

==Ayer's later rejection of logical positivism==

Logical positivism was the philosophical flavour of the day in the 1920s and 1930s, and it was indeed popularized by Ayer in his book ''Language, Truth and Logic''. However, Ayer himself later rejected much of his own work. Fifty years after he wrote his book, he said: 'Logical positivism died a long time ago. I don’t think much of ''Language, Truth and Logic'' is true ... it is full of mistakes.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Flew]] and Roy Varghese, ''There is a God'' (Harper One,
2007), pp. xiv; xviii - xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11525">'''Numenius of Apamea''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Νουμήνιος ὁ ἐξ Ἀπαμείας}}) was a Greek philosopher, who lived in [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] in [[Syria]] and [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/numenius|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Numenius}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flourished during the latter half of the 2nd century AD. He was a [[Neopythagorean]] and forerunner of the [[Neoplatonist]]s.

== Philosophy ==
Statements and fragments of his apparently very numerous works have been preserved by [[Origen]], [[Theodoret]], and especially by [[Eusebius]], and from them we may learn the nature of his Platonist-Pythagorean philosophy, and its approximation to the doctrines of [[Plato]].

Numenius was a [[Neopythagorean]], but his object was to trace the doctrines of Plato up to [[Pythagoras]], and at the same time to show that they were not at variance with the dogmas and mysteries of the [[Brahmins]], [[Jews]], [[Magi]] and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;See the Fragments of the 1st book ''Peri Tagathou'', in Eusebius, ''[[Praep. Evang.]]'', ix. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was to restore the philosophy of [[Plato]], the genuine Pythagorean and mediator between [[Socrates]] and [[Pythagoras]] in its original purity, cleared from the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrines, and purified from the unsatisfactory and perverse explanations, which he said were found even in [[Speusippus]] and [[Xenocrates]], and which, through the influence of [[Arcesilaus]] and [[Carneades]] had led to a bottomless [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'' xiv. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the [[apostasy]] of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] from Plato, to judge from its rather numerous fragments,&lt;ref&gt;Euseb. ''Praep. Ev.'' xiv. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; contained a minute and wearisome account of the outward circumstances of those men, and was full of fabulous tales about their lives, without entering into the nature of their skepticism.

George Karamanolis from the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] noted, "The remains of Numenius' work leave no doubt that he relied primarily on texts of Plato in constructing his own system of principles. Ancient testimonies are, however, divided between those that classify him as a Platonist philosopher ([[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], Life of Plot. 14.12, [[Eusebius]], Prep. Ev. XI.21.7) and those that consider him a Pythagorean ([[Origen]], Against Celsus I.15, VI.51, V.38 frs. 1b–1c, 53, Porphyry, Ad Gaurum 34.20–35.2; fr. 36, [[Calcidius]], In Timaeum 297.8 Waszink; fr. 52.2). We should not see any contradiction or even tension in this double classification. Numenius is a Pythagorean Platonist like [[Moderatus of Gades|Moderatus]] half a century earlier or [[Eudorus]] around the turn of the millenium. That is, Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy—including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally (cf. fr. 24.57-60)."&lt;ref name="Karamanolis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/numenius|title=Numenius|author=George Karamanolis|year=2013|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His books ''On the Good'' (''Peri Tagathou - Περὶ Τἀγαθοῦ'') seem to have been of a better kind; in them he had minutely explained, mainly in opposition to the [[Stoics]], that existence could neither be found in the [[Classical elements|elements]] because they were in a perpetual state of change and transition, nor in [[matter]] because it is vague, inconstant, lifeless, and in itself not an object of our knowledge; and that, on the contrary, existence, in order to resist the annihilation and decay of matter, must itself rather be incorporeal and removed from all mutability,&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xv. 17&lt;/ref&gt; in eternal presence, without being subject to the variation of [[time]], simple and imperturbable in its nature by its own will as well as by influence from without.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; True [[existence]] is identical with the first [[god]] existing in and by itself, that is, with [[agathon|good]], and is defined as spirit (''[[nous]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 18, ix. 22&lt;/ref&gt; But as the first (absolute) god existing in itself and being undisturbed in its motion, could not be creative (''demiurgikos - δημιουργικός''), he thought that we must assume a second god, who keeps matter together, directs its energy to it and to intelligible essences, and imparts its spirit to all creatures; its mind is directed to the first god, in whom it beholds the ideas according to which it arranges the world harmoniously, being seized with a desire to create the world. The first god communicates its ideas to the second, without losing them itself, just as we communicate knowledge to one another, without depriving ourselves of it.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Praep. Ev.'', xi. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the relation existing between the third and second god, and to the manner in which they also are to be conceived as one (probably in opposition to the vague duration of matter), no information can be derived from the fragments which have come down to us.

== Numenius and Judaism and Christianity ==
Numenius is quoted by multiple ancient writers as having referred to Plato as the "Atticizing [[Moses]],"&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', i. 22; Eusebius, ''Praep. Evang.'', xi. 10; Suda, ''Numenius''&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel Bar-Kochva ''The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Treatise of the Good First book, Practical Questions 13 Plato as a Greek Moses&lt;/ref&gt; In On the Good (Book 3, fr 10a), Numenius even sets out a story about Jesus (though he doesn’t mention the name), and speaks of Moses and Egyptian sages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6410739/The_fragments_of_Numenius_of_Apamea|title=The fragments of Numenius of Apamea|author=George Boys-Stones|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Karamanolis further notes, "Such attention to the Jewish tradition is important for the early Christian theologians and [[Apologetics|apologists]] who want to establish the superiority of the Jewish-Christian tradition against that of the pagan culture. This attention however is not motivated by historical concerns on the part of Numenius but rather by philosophical ones. Numenius wanted to show that the Jewish nation must be counted among the ancient ones that have a share in logos and also that Moses had a conception of the first principle similar to that of Plato, since both identified God with being."&lt;ref name="Karamanolis" /&gt;

His chief divergence from Plato is the distinction between the "first god" and the "[[demiurge]]." This is probably due to the influence of Jewish-Alexandrian philosophers (especially [[Philo]] and his theory of the [[Logos]]). According to [[Proclus]],&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, ''Comment. in Timaeum'', 93&lt;/ref&gt; His works were highly esteemed by the Neoplatonists, and Plotinus' student [[Amelius]] (who was critical of [[Gnosticism]], see [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]])&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[John D Turner]] considers [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Amelius]] all to be Neoplatonic philosophers who were critical of Gnosticism. Professor [http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm Turner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm |date=2014-08-16 }} is quoted "In the late third century, [[Sethianism]] also became estranged from orthodox (Neo)Platonism under the impetus of attacks and refutations from the circle of Plotinus and other Neoplatonists which were just as effective as those of the Christian heresiologists. At this time, whatever Sethianism was left became increasingly fragmented into various derivative and other [[sectarian]] gnostic groups such as the [[Archontics]], [[Audians]], [[Borborites]], [[Phibionites]] and others, some of which survived into the Middle Ages."&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have composed nearly two books of commentaries upon them. Contrary to orthodox Judeo-Christian teaching (and more in line with the teachings of Gnosticism), like [[Orpheus]] and [[Plato]]&lt;ref&gt;http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/cratylus.html&lt;/ref&gt; Numenius wrote of the human body as a prison of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Book three the Initiate (or the Hoopoe, the bird of prognostication) pg 43 The soul is retained in the body as in a Prison , by the impulsive passion. The Neoplatonic Writings of Numenius Translated by [[Kenneth Guthrie]] Selene Books {{ISBN|0-933601-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numenius, according to Professor Michael Wagner showed gnostic tendencies in viewing matter as coeval with God.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the writing of Numenius by Michael Wagner  The Neoplatonic Writings of Numenius Translated by [[Kenneth Guthrie]] Selene Books ISDN 0-933601-03-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the Academicians and Plato, ''on the Good'' (in which according to [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', iv. 51, he makes allusion to [[Jesus Christ]]), and on the mystical sayings in Plato, are preserved in the ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' of [[Eusebius]].

The '''October Surprise conspiracy theory''' refers to an alleged plot to influence the outcome of the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 United States presidential election]], contested between incumbent president  [[Jimmy Carter]] (D–GA) and his opponent, former California governor [[Ronald Reagan]] (R–CA).

One of the leading national issues during that year was the [[Iranian hostage crisis|release of 52 Americans]] being held hostage in Iran since November 4, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=62685 Abstract of pre-election news broadcast]&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan won the election. On the day of his inauguration—in fact, 20 minutes after he concluded his inaugural address—the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] announced the release of the hostages. The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan's presidential [[political campaign|campaign]] had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election to thwart [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] from pulling off an "[[October surprise]]".

According to the allegation, the [[Reagan Administration]] rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons via Israel and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in US banks.

After twelve years of mixed media attention, both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation.&lt;ref name="October Surprise Task Force"&gt;{{cite book |author=Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 |author-link=House October Surprise Task Force |title=Joint report of the Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 ("October Surprise Task Force") |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015060776773 |date=January 3, 1993 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page= |id=H. Rept. No. 102-1102 |oclc=27492534 |ref={{harvid|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, several individuals—most notably former Iranian President [[Abulhassan Banisadr]],&lt;ref name="NYT20090731"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bani-Sadr, in U.S., Renews Charges of 1980 Deal | author=Neil A Lewis | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = 1991-05-07 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/07/world/bani-sadr-in-us-renews-charges-of-1980-deal.html | accessdate = 2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; former [[Office of Naval Intelligence|naval intelligence]] officer and [[U.S. National Security Council]] member [[Gary Sick]], and former Reagan/Bush campaign staffer and White House analyst Barbara Honegger—have stood by the allegation.

==Background==
{{main|Iran hostage crisis}}
In November 1979, a number of U.S. hostages were captured in [[Iran]] during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. The [[Iran hostage crisis]] continued into 1980, and as the November [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] approached, there were concerns in the Republican Party camp that a resolution of the crisis could constitute an "[[October surprise]]" which might give incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]] enough of an electoral boost to be re-elected.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=John McCain and the October Surprise |url=http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/john-mccain-and-october-surprise |quote=The term "October surprise" is most famously associated with the 1980 campaign, when Republicans spent the fall worrying that Jimmy Carter would engineer a last-minute deal to free the American hostages who had been held in Iran since the previous year.

The issue of an "October Surprise" was brought up during an investigation by a House of Representatives Subcommittee into how the 1980 Reagan Campaign obtained debate briefing materials of then-President Carter. During the investigation (a.k.a. [[Debategate]]), the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents and discovered numerous instances of documents and memorandum referencing a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise. The Subcommittee, chaired by former U.S. Rep. [[Donald Albosta]] (D–MI) issued a comprehensive report 17 May 1984, describing each type of information that was detected and its possible source. There is a section in the report dedicated to the October Surprise issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Unger |first=Craig |authorlink=Craig Unger| title=House of Bush, House of Saud

==Origins==
The first printed instance of the October Surprise conspiracy theory has been attributed to a story in the December 2, 1980 issue of ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'', a periodical published by followers of [[Lyndon LaRouche]].&lt;ref name="Newsweek; November 10, 1991"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=John |date=November 10, 1991 |title=Making Of A Myth |url=http://www.newsweek.com/making-myth-201934 |newspaper=Newsweek |location= |access-date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Robert Dreyfuss]],&lt;ref name="Dreyfuss"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dreyfuss |first=Robert |date=December 2, 1980 |title=Strange diplomacy in Ira |url=http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1980/eirv07n47-19801202/eirv07n47-19801202_043-strange_diplomacy_in_iran.pdf |journal=Executive Intelligence Review |location=New York |publisher=New Solidarity International Press Service |volume=7 |issue=47 |pages=43–44 |issn=0273-6314 |access-date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the article cited information gleaned from "Iranian sources" in Paris as well as "Top level intelligence sources in Reagan's inner circle" as stating that [[Henry Kissinger]] met with representatives of [[Mohammad Beheshti]] during the week of November 12, 1980.&lt;ref name="Newsweek; November 10, 1991"/&gt; The story claimed that "pro-Reagan British intelligence circles and the Kissinger faction" meeting with the Iranians six to eight weeks prior had interfered with "President Carter's efforts to secure an arms-for-hostage deal with Teheran."&lt;ref name="Newsweek; November 10, 1991"/&gt; The [[LaRouche movement]] returned the story in the September 2, 1983 issue of ''[[LaRouche movement#Defunct periodicals|New Solidarity]]'' stating "The deal...fell through when the hard-line mullahs boycotted the [[Majlis (Iran)|Majlis]] in late October."&lt;ref name="Newsweek; November 10, 1991"/&gt;

== Chronology ==
The [[House October Surprise Task Force]] outlined as "principal allegations" three supposed meetings between representatives of Reagan's campaign and Iranian government officials in the summer and fall of 1980 to delay the release of the hostages: 1) a meeting in Madrid during the summer, 2) a meeting at the [[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]] in Washington, D.C that autumn, and 3) a meeting in Paris in October.{{sfn|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993|p=71}} The Task Force characterized three other alleged meetings or contacts as "ancillary allegations": 1) a meeting at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. in early spring 1980, 2) a meeting at the [[Hyatt Regency London – The Churchill|Churchill Hotel]] in London in the summer of 1980, and 3) a meeting at the [[The Sherry-Netherland|Sherry Netherlands Hotel]] in New York in January 1981.{{sfn|"October Surprise Task Force"|1993|p=71}}

* March 1980: Jamshid Hashimi, international arms dealer, is visited by [[William Casey]] at Washington's Mayflower Hotel, who asks that a meeting be arranged with "someone in Iran who had authority to deal on the hostages".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Trento, ''Prelude to Terror: Edwin P. Wilson and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network'' (Carroll and Graf, 2005), 202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 21, 1980: Jamshid Hashimi and his brother Cyrus Hashimi meet at the latter's home.&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
* April 1980: [[Donald Gregg]], a [[U.S. National Security Council]] aide with connections to [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]], meets Cyrus Hashimi in New York's Shazam restaurant, near Hashimi's bank.&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Iranian President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] said in his 1991 book ''My Turn to Speak'' that he had "proof of contacts between Khomeini and the supporters of Ronald Reagan as early as the spring of 1980.... Rafsanjani, Beheshti, and Ahmed Khomeini [the Ayatollah's son] played key roles."&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Last week of July 1980: At a meeting in Madrid arranged by the Hashimi brothers that includes Robert Gray, a man identified as Donald Gregg, and [[Mahdi Karrubi]], William Casey says that if Iran could assure that American hostages were well treated until their release and were released as a "gift" to the new administration, "the Republicans would be most grateful and 'would give Iran its strength back.'"&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 205, quoting Gary Sick, ''October Surprise'' (1991), 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Karrubi says he has "no authority to make such a commitment."
* About August 12, 1980: Karrubi meets again with Casey, saying Khomeini has agreed to the proposal. Casey agrees the next day, naming Cyrus Hashimi as middleman to handle the arms transactions. More meetings are set for October. Cyrus Hashimi purchases a Greek ship and commences arms deliveries valued at $150 million from the Israeli port of [[Eilat, Israel|Eilat]] to [[Bandar Abbas]]. According to CIA sources, Hashimi receives a $7 million commission. Casey is said to use an aide named Tom Carter in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 205-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* September 22, 1980: Iraq invades Iran.
* Late September 1980: An expatriate Iranian arms dealer named Hushang Lavi claims he met with [[Richard V. Allen]], the Reagan campaign's national security expert, [[Robert McFarlane|Robert "Bud" McFarlane]], and Lawrence Silberman, and discussed the possible exchange of [[F-4]] parts for American hostages, but Lavi says they asserted they "were already in touch with the Iranians themselves". (Silberman, Allen, and McFarlane deny they met with Lavi, but reporter [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] obtained a copy of Lavi's 1980 calendar after Lavi's death, which corroborated the Iranian's account.)&lt;ref&gt;Trento, 207-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==

===Frontline===
The investigative journalism TV series [[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] produced a 1991 documentary which "investigate[d] startling new evidence about how both the Carter and Reagan camps may have tried to forge secret deals for [the Iranian] hostages during the 1980 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="Frontline-ElectionHeldHostage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages//frontline/programs/info/916.html|website=PBS|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gary Sick===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?23038-1/october-surprise ''Booknotes'' interview with Gary Sick on ''October Surprise'', December 1, 1991], [[C-SPAN]]}}
[[Gary Sick]] wrote an editorial&lt;ref name="Sick" /&gt; for ''The New York Times''  and a book (''October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan'')&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sick. 1991.  ''October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject. Sick's credibility was boosted by the fact that he was a retired Naval Captain, served on Ford's, Carter's, and Reagan's National Security Council, and held high positions with many prominent organizations; moreover, he had authored a book recently on US-Iran relations (''All Fall Down''). Sick wrote that in October 1980 officials in Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign including future CIA Director, William Casey, made a secret deal with Iran to delay the release of the American hostages until after the election; in return for this, the United States purportedly arranged for Israel to ship weapons to Iran.

Sick, who had been a PhD student at Columbia University at the height of the Vietnam War, was a Carter White House staffer and admitted that "The story is tangled and murky, and it may never be fully unraveled." He was unable to prove his claims, including that, in the days before the presidential election with daily press pools surrounding him and a public travel schedule, vice presidential candidate George H. W. Bush secretly left the country and met with Iranian officials in France to discuss the fate of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/world/new-reports-say-1980-reagan-campaign-tried-to-delay-hostage-release.html |title=New Reports Say 1980 Reagan Campaign Tried to Delay Hostage Release |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 15, 1991 |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senate investigation ===
The [[United States Senate|US Senate]]'s 1992 report concluded that "by any standard, the credible evidence now known falls far short of supporting the allegation of an agreement between the Reagan campaign and Iran to delay the release of the hostages."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate, Committee on Foreign Relations; "The October Surprise: Allegations and the Circumstances Surrounding the Release of the American Hostages Held in Iran", U.S. Government Printing Office; Washington, DC., 1992 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WFbDcsSLpDwC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=%22by+any+standard,+the+credible+evidence+now+known+falls+far+short+of+supporting+the+allegation+of+an+agreement+between+the+Reagan+campaign+and+Iran+to+delay+the+release+of+the+hostages.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l19CZuQWYy&amp;sig=t9DwGU7s2XpXzgh9HBSiS0K6li8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5MdsUavWNoSGjAK6pYCYBQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22by%20any%20standard%2C%20the%20credible%20evidence%20now%20known%20falls%20far%20short%20of%20supporting%20the%20allegation%20of%20an%20agreement%20between%20the%20Reagan%20campaign%20and%20Iran%20to%20delay%20the%20release%20of%20the%20hostages.%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Danny Casolaro ===
In 1991, freelance writer [[Danny Casolaro]] (among others)&lt;ref name=Linsalata&gt;Linsalata, Phil. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070824210500/http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/91/6/octopus.asp The Octopus File], ''The Columbia Journalism Review'', November/December 1991, accessed October 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to be almost ready to expose the alleged October surprise conspiracy, when he suddenly died a violent death in a hotel bathtub in Martinsburg, WVA, raising suspicions. He appeared to be traveling on leads for his investigation into the [[Inslaw Affair]]. His death was ruled a suicide.

===House of Representatives investigation===
The House of Representatives' 1993 report concluded "there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt by the Reagan presidential campaign—or persons associated with the campaign—to delay the release of the American hostages in Iran". The task force Chairman [[Lee H. Hamilton]] also added that the vast majority of the sources and material reviewed by the committee were "wholesale fabricators or were impeached by documentary evidence". The report also expressed the belief that several witnesses had committed perjury during their sworn statements to the committee, among them Richard Brenneke,&lt;ref&gt;search: [https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=Richard+Brenneke%2C&amp;srchst=cse i.e., Brenneke], (New York Times)&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed to be a CIA agent.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, Steve; "No October Surprise", ''American Journalism Review'', University of Maryland, vol. 15, issue n2, ppg. 16–24, 1 March 1993 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00091KLFO (fee)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Village Voice'' ===
Retired CIA analyst and counter-intelligence officer [[Frank Snepp]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' compiled several investigations of Sick's allegations in 1992. Snepp alleged that Sick had only interviewed half of the sources used in his book, and supposedly relied on hearsay from unreliable sources for large amounts of critical material. Snepp also discovered that in 1989, Sick had sold the rights to his book to [[Oliver Stone]]. After going through evidence presented by Richard Brenneke, Snepp asserted that Brenneke's credit card receipts showed him to be in Portland, Oregon, during the time he claimed to be in Paris observing the secret meeting.&lt;ref name="Snepp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Newsweek'' ===
''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine also ran an investigation, and they said that most, if not all, of the charges made were groundless. Specifically, ''Newsweek'' found little evidence that the United States had transferred arms to Iran prior to [[Iran Contra]], and was able to account for [[Bill Casey|Bill Casey's]] whereabouts when he was allegedly at the Madrid meeting, saying that he was at a conference in London. ''Newsweek'' also alleged that the story was being heavily pushed within the [[LaRouche Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Making of a Myth, ''[[Newsweek]]''; November 11, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The New Republic'' ===
[[Steven Emerson]] and Jesse Furman of ''[[The New Republic]]'' also looked into the allegations and found "the conspiracy as currently postulated is a total fabrication". They were unable to verify any of the evidence presented by Sick and supporters, finding them to be inconsistent and contradictory in nature. They also pointed out that nearly every witness of Sick's had either been indicted or was under investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. Like the ''Newsweek'' investigation, they had also debunked the claims of Reagan election campaign officials being in Paris during the timeframe that Sick specified, contradicting Sick's sources.&lt;ref&gt;The Conspiracy that Wasn't; Steven Emerson and Jesse Furman, ''[[The New Republic]]''; November 18, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] found that Emerson's evidence was incorrect, noting "Ironically, in media circles, it is Steve Emerson's dismissal of the October Surprise that turned out to be enduring – even though much of his evidence turned out to be wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canham-Clyne|first=John|title=October Reprisals|url=http://fair.org/extra/october-reprisals/|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|date=November 1, 1993|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Ames]] noted that the article "relied on invented evidence later exposed as fake and disowned even by Emerson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ames|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Ames|title=If Andrew Sullivan is "The Future of Journalism" then Journalism is F*cked|url=http://thedailybanter.com/2013/01/if-andrew-sullivan-is-the-future-of-journalism-then-journalism-is-fcked/|publisher=The Daily Banter|date=January 11, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing allegations==
Among the more mainstream and moderate figures to state that the October Surprise did in fact happen is former Iranian President Banisadr.

=== Former Iranian President Banisadr===
{{Quote
|It is now very clear that there were two separate agreements, one the official agreement with Carter in Algeria, the other, a secret agreement with another party, which, it is now apparent, was Reagan. They made a deal with Reagan that the hostages should not be released until after Reagan became president. So, then in return, Reagan would give them arms. We have published documents which show that US arms were shipped, via Israel, in March, about 2 months after Reagan became president.

Political historian [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] has been a proponent of the idea.

===Robert Kane Pappas===
In his 2004 [[documentary]] ''[[Orwell Rolls in his Grave]]'' [[Robert Kane Pappas]] presents evidence that representatives from the [[Ronald Reagan]] campaign met with representatives from [[Iran]] to ensure that the hostages would not be released until after the election. He concludes that after the congressional commission turned back any accusation of wrongdoing, the story and scandal were never reported further.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Rolls in his Grave''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6625">'''Radical probabilism''' is a doctrine in [[philosophy]], in particular [[epistemology]], and [[probability theory]] that holds that no facts are known for certain. That view holds profound implications for [[statistical inference]]. The philosophy is particularly associated with [[Richard Jeffrey]] who wittily characterised it with the ''dictum'' "It's probabilities all the way down."

==Background==
{{main|Bayesian probability}}
In [[frequentist statistics]], [[Bayes' theorem]] provides a useful rule for updating a [[probability]] when new frequency data becomes available. In Bayesian statistics, the theorem itself plays a more limited role. Bayes' theorem connects probabilities that are held simultaneously. It does not tell the learner how to update probabilities when new evidence becomes available over time. This subtlety was first pointed out in terms by [[Ian Hacking]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hacking|first=Ian|title=Slightly more realistic personal probability| journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=34|pages=311–325|year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, adopting Bayes' theorem is a temptation. Suppose that a learner forms probabilities ''P''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''.
If the learner subsequently learns that ''B'' is true, nothing in the [[axioms of probability]] or the results derived therefrom tells him how to behave. He might be tempted to adopt Bayes' theorem by analogy and set his ''P''&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''B'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''/''q''.

In fact, that step, Bayes' rule of updating, can be justified, as necessary and sufficient, through a ''dynamic'' [[Dutch book]] argument that is additional to the arguments used to justify the probability axioms. This argument was first put forward by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] in the 1970s though he never published it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987a|last= Skyrms|first=Brian|title=Dynamic coherence and probability kinematics| journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|pages=1–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic Dutch book argument for Bayesian updating has been criticised by Hacking,&lt;ref&gt;''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; H. Kyburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Kyburg, H. | year=1978 | title=Subjective probability: Criticisms, reflections and problems | journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic | volume=7 | pages=157–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; D. Christensen&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | year=1991 | last=Christensen, D | title=Clever bookies and coherent beliefs| journal=Philosophical Review | volume=100 | pages=229–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and P. Maher.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Maher, P | year=1992a | title=Betting on Theories | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=&amp;mdash; | year=1992b | title=Diachronic rationality | journal=Philosophy of Science | volume=59 | pages=120–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defended by [[Brian Skyrms]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certain and uncertain knowledge==
That works when the new data is certain. [[C. I. Lewis]] had argued that "If anything is to be probable then something must be certain".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. I. | year=1946 | title=An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court| page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There must, on Lewis' account, be some certain facts on which probabilities were [[conditional probability|conditioned]]. However, the principle known as [[Cromwell's rule]] declares that nothing, apart from a logical law, if that, can ever be known for certain. Jeffrey famously rejected Lewis' ''dictum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last=Jeffrey | first=Richard C. | year=2004 | title=Subjective Probability: The Real Thing | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | chapter=Chapter 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later quipped, "It's probabilities all the way down," a reference to the "[[turtles all the way down]]" metaphor for the [[infinite regress]] problem. He called this position ''radical probabilism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Skyrms, B | year=1996 | title=The structure of radical probabilism | journal=Erkenntnis | volume=35 | pages=439–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditioning on an uncertainty – probability kinematics==
In this case Bayes' rule isn't able to capture a mere subjective change in the probability of some critical fact. The new evidence may not have been anticipated or even be capable of being articulated after the event. It seems reasonable, as a starting position, to adopt the [[law of total probability]] and extend it to updating in much the same way as was Bayes' theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Jeffrey | first=Richard | year=1987 | title=Alias Smith and Jones: The testimony of the senses | journal=Erkenntnis| volume=26 | pages=391–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'' | ''B'')''P''&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'') + ''P''&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'' | not-''B'')''P''&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;(not-''B'')

Adopting such a rule is sufficient to avoid a Dutch book but not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Skyrms (1987a)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey advocated this as a rule of updating under radical probabilism and called it probability kinematics. Others have named it Jeffrey conditioning.

==Alternatives to probability kinematics==
Probability kinetics is not the only sufficient updating rule for radical probabilism. Others have been advocated including [[E. T. Jaynes]]' [[maximum entropy principle]], and Skyrms' [[principle of reflection]]. It turns out that probability kinematics is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Skyrms, B | year=1987b | title=Updating, supposing and MAXENT | journal=Theory and Decision | volume=22 | pages=225–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reversal test''' is a [[heuristic]] designed to spot and eliminate the [[status quo bias]].

==The reversal test==

The reversal test was introduced in the context of the [[bioethics]] of  [[human enhancement]] by [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Toby Ord]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bostrom, Toby Ord (2006). "The reversal test: eliminating status quo bias in applied ethics". ''Ethics'' (University of Chicago Press) 116 (4): 656–679. http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans might suffer from irrational status quo bias, how can one distinguish between valid criticisms of proposed increase in some human trait and criticisms merely motivated by resistance to change? The reversal test attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was ''decreased'': An example given is that if someone objects that an increase in intelligence would be a bad thing due to more dangerous weapons being made etc., the objector to that position would then ask "Shouldn't we decrease intelligence then?"

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Reversal Test'': When a proposal to change a certain parameter is thought to have bad overall consequences, consider a change to the same parameter in the opposite direction. If this is also thought to have bad overall consequences, then the onus is on those who reach these conclusions to explain why our position cannot be improved through changes to this parameter. If they are unable to do so, then we have reason to suspect that they suffer from status quo bias." (p. 664)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideally the test will help reveal whether status quo bias is an important causal factor in the initial judgement.

A similar thought experiment in regards to dampening traumatic memories was described by Adam J. Kolber, imagining whether aliens naturally resistant to traumatic memories should adopt traumatic "memory enhancement".&lt;ref&gt;Kolber, Adam J., Therapeutic Forgetting: The Legal and Ethical Implications of Memory Dampening. ''Vanderbilt Law Review'', Vol. 59, p. 1561, 2006; San Diego Legal Studies Paper No. 07-37 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=887061&lt;/ref&gt; The "trip to reality" rebuttal to Nozick's [[experience machine]] thought experiment (where one's entire current life is shown to be a simulation and one is offered to return to reality) can also be seen as a form of reversal test.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Weijers, Intuitive Biases in Judgments about Thought Experiments: the Experience Machine Revisited, ''Philosophical Writings'', No. 50 &amp; No. 51, Summer &amp; Autumn 2011 http://danweijers.com/pdf/Intuitive%20Biases%20in%20Judgments%20about%20Thought%20Experiments%20%28Dan%20Weijers%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double reversal test==

A further elaboration on the reversal test is suggested as the double reversal test:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Double Reversal Test'': Suppose it is thought that increasing a certain parameter and decreasing it would both have bad overall consequences. Consider a scenario in which a natural factor threatens to move the parameter in one direction and ask whether it would be good to counterbalance this change by an intervention to preserve the status quo. If so, consider a later time when the naturally occurring factor is about to vanish and ask whether it would be a good idea to intervene to reverse the first intervention. If not, then there is a strong [[prima facie]] case for thinking that it would be good to make the first intervention even in the absence of the natural countervailing factor." (p. 673)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case the status quo bias is turned against itself, hopefully reducing its impact on the reasoning. It also handles possible arguments from evolutionary adaptation, transition costs, risk, and person-affecting morality that might otherwise complicate the simple reversal test.

==Criticisms==

[[Alfred Nordmann]] argues that the simple reversal test merely erects a [[Straw man|straw-man]] argument in favour of enhancement. He also claims that both tests ignore approaches that are neither [[consequentialist]] nor [[deontological]], plus that one cannot view humans as collections of parameters that can be optimized separately or without regard to their history.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Nordmann, If and Then: A Critique of Speculative NanoEthics, ''Nanoethics'' (2007) 1:31–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Weidemann]] similarly argues that the double reversal test can muddy the water; weighing transition costs versus benefits might be the relevant practical ethical question in much future enhancement analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Weidemann, Towards a Heuristic for Nanoethics: The Onus of Proof in Applied Ethics. Uncovering Status Quo and Other Biases. In ''Size Matters: Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects of Nanbiotechnology and Nanomedicine'', Johann S. Ach, Christian Weidemann (eds.), LIT Verlag Münster 2009 (pp. 126–127)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneer of [[European integration]], he served as the founding president of the [[Paneuropean Union]] for 49 years, which would be the preliminary ideological foundation of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OW5FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=kalergi+european+integration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L9ciH4dL6H&amp;sig=Dlo96WF7HBDy05q9NTkAnYs5APQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYp5rtverPAhUGrD4KHQxjBxY4ChDoAQhKMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kalergi%20european%20integration&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rienner.com/uploads/53aae65db9769.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], an Austro-Hungarian [[diplomat]] and [[Mitsuko Aoyama]], the daughter of an oil merchant, antiques-dealer, and major landowner in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013a}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/mitsuko2-1.htm chpt. (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood name in Japan was '''Aoyama Eijiro'''. He became a [[Czechoslovak]] citizen in 1919 and then took French nationality from 1939 until his death.

His first book, ''[[Pan-Europa]]'', was published in 1923 and contained a membership form for the Pan-Europa movement, which held its first Congress in 1926 in [[Vienna]]. In 1927, [[Aristide Briand]] was elected honorary president of the Pan-Europa movement. Public figures who attended Pan-Europa congresses included [[Albert Einstein]], [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Ocaña |first= Juan Carlos |url= http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPRINGcoudenhove.htm |title= Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi |publisher= [[Spartacus Educational]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121024075148/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPRINGcoudenhove.htm |archivedate= 24 October 2012 |accessdate= 17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudenhove-Kalergi was the first recipient of the [[Charlemagne Prize]] in 1950. The 1972–1973 academic year at the [[College of Europe]] was named in his honour. Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Ode to Joy]]" as the music for the [[European Anthem]].

==Family roots==
[[File:Eŭropo-placo C-K.JPG|thumb|Europa-Platz – Coudenhove-Kalergi in [[Klosterneuburg]], Austria]]
Coudenhove-Kalergi was the second son of [[Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] (1859–1906), an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] count and diplomat of mixed European origin, and [[Mitsuko Aoyama]] (1874–1941). His father, who spoke sixteen languages and embraced travel as the only means of prolonging life, yet died in his forties, had prematurely abandoned a career in the Austrian diplomatic service that took him to [[Athens]], [[Constantinople]], Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, to devote himself to study and writing.

Coudenhove-Kalergi's parents met when his mother helped the Austro-Hungarian diplomat after he fell off a horse while riding in Japan. In commenting on their union, [[Whittaker Chambers]] described the future originator of Pan-Europe as "practically a Pan-European organization himself." He elaborated: "The [[Coudenhove]]s were a wealthy [[Flemish people|Flemish]] family that fled to Austria during the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Kallergis family|Kalergis]] were a wealthy [[Greek people|Greek]] family from [[Crete]]. The line has been further crossed with Poles, Norwegians, Balts, French and Germans, but since the families were selective as well as cosmopolitan, the hybridization has been consistently successful."&lt;ref name=Whittaker&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kallergis family|Kalergis family]] roots trace to [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] royalty via [[Venice|Venetian]] aristocracy, connecting with the [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] imperial dynasty. In 1300, Coudenhove-Kalergi's ancestor Alexios Phokas-Kalergis signed the treaty that made Crete a dominion of Venice.

During his childhood, Coudenhove-Kalergi's mother had read aloud to him ''[[Momotarō]]'' and other Japanese fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sucra.saitama-u.ac.jp/modules/xoonips/download.php/KYO-KJ00004106292.pdf?file_id=20505|title= 研究ノート : 欧州統合の提唱者、クーデンホーフ・カレルギーの思想と行動 An Advocate of the European Integration, Coudenhove-Kalergi's Original Idea and Activities|last1=NAITO|first1=Tetsuo|date= 2006-03-31|language=Japanese|publisher= [[Saitama University|Saitama United Cyber Repository of Academic Resources]] (SUCRA)|page=169|format= PDF|accessdate=22 October 2013|quote={{Lang|ja|幼き日に母親に日本の童話、例えば「桃太郎」を読んでもらったとの彼の回想がある}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and education==
[[File:Poběžovice zámek(3).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Ronsperg castle, his childhood home. Damaged during the Second World War, the repairs were overseen by a German from Japan [[Masumi Schmidt-Muraki]].]]
Coudenhove-Kalergi spent his adolescence on [[Bohemian]] family estates in [[Ronsperg]], known today as [[Poběžovice]]. His father personally taught his two sons Russian and Hungarian and toughened them both physically and morally. He took them on long walks in all weather, made them sleep on straw mattresses and take cold showers, and taught them to shoot and fence so well that no one would ever dare challenge them. He also took them to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] every Sunday. On every [[Good Friday]], as the [[Roman Rite|liturgy]] came to the exhortation "oremus et pro perfidis Judaeis" ("[[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews|Let us also pray for the faithless Jews]]"), the old count allegedly rose and walked out of the church in a protest against this supposed expression of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=Whittaker/&gt;

Coudenhove-Kalergi studied at the [[Augustiner-Gymnasium Brixen|Augustiner-Gymnasium]] in [[Brixen]] before attending the [[Theresianische Akademie]] in Vienna from 1908 until 1913. He obtained his doctorate in philosophy with a thesis on ''Die Objectivität als Grundprinzip der Moral'' (Objectivity as the Fundamental Principle of Morals) in 1917 from the [[University of Vienna]].

During his student years, Coudenhove-Kalergi married the famous Jewish Viennese actress [[Ida Roland]] in April 1915. His marriage to a [[divorcee|divorcée]] thirteen years his senior, and a [[commoner]], caused a temporary split with his family. His mother Mitsuko did not accept Ida, considering her a "[[Begging|beggar]] living on the [[Bank (geography)|riverbank]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013a}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/mitsuko2-3.htm chpt. (3)]: "{{Lang|ja|河原乞食}}"&lt;/ref&gt; a traditional Japanese point of view against actors and performers. His mother, as head of the family, banned him from the family temporarily, but retracted when Coudenhove-Kalergi became renowned for his pan-European concept.

==Personal philosophy==
Aristocratic in his origins and elitist in his ideas, Coudenhove-Kalergi identified and collaborated with such politicians as [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], [[Otto von Habsburg]], [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gehler||p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideal political constituent was a [[gentleman]] who must respect and protect ladies, a person adhering to [[honesty]], fair play, [[etiquette|courtesy]], and [[dialectics|rational discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wais.stanford.edu/ztopics/week110104/democracy_coudenhovekalergi_110104.htm|title= Democracy and the concept of gentleman: Coudenhove-Kalergi|last1=Hilton|first1=Ronald|authorlink1=Ronald Hilton|date= 2004-11-19|publisher= [[World Association of International Studies]] (WAIS) at [[Stanford University]]|accessdate=31 October 2014|quote=for Coudenhove-Kalergi it meant adherence to the ideals [ . . . ]: honesty, fair play, courtesy, rational discourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://yuaikyoukai.com/english.html|title= "Yuai" for Understanding|publisher= [[Ichirō Hatoyama|Yuai Association]]|accessdate= 4 February 2016|quote= ... the word Gentleman as he used referred to British type Gentleman in the chivalric medieval Europe, who may be characterized by such attributes as elegant, well-educated, polite, honest, humorous, cleanly, etc. ...

==Pan-European political activist==

Coudenhove-Kalergi is recognized as the founder of the first popular movement for a united Europe. His intellectual influences ranged from [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Rudolf Kjellén]] and [[Oswald Spengler]] to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In politics, he was an enthusiastic supporter of "[[fourteen points]]" made by [[Woodrow Wilson]] on 8 January 1918 and [[pacifism|pacifist]] initiatives of [[Kurt Hiller]]. In December 1921, he joined the [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodge]] "Humanitas" in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jajeśniak-Quast|2010|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he co-founded{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} the Pan-European Union (PEU) with Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]], as "the only way of guarding against an eventual world hegemony by Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dorril|2000|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he published a manifesto entitled ''Pan-Europa'', each copy containing a membership form which invited the reader to become a member of the [[International Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa movement]]. He favored social democracy as an improvement on "the feudal aristocracy of the sword" but his ambition was to create a conservative society that superseded democracy with "the social aristocracy of the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosamond|2000|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; European freemason lodges supported his movement, including the lodge Humanitas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegerhofer|2004}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHXg3QdGAtAC&amp;pg=PA50 chpt. Ⅴ – 3]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pan-Europa'' was translated into the languages of European countries (excluding Italian, which edition was not published at that time) and a multitude of other languages, except for Russian.&lt;ref name="Hewitson and D'Auria"&gt;{{harvnb|Hewitson|D'Auria|2012}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7GRYc9sOoWUC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his autobiography, at the beginning of 1924 his friend [[Baron Louis de Rothschild]] introduced him to [[Max Warburg]] who offered to finance his movement for the next three years by giving him 60,000 gold marks. Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker [[Paul Warburg]] and financier [[Bernard Baruch]]. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal ''Paneuropa'' (1924–1938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the ''Kampf um Paneuropa '' (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925–1928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the Pan-European Union was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972.

His original vision was for a world divided into only five states: a United States of Europe that would link continental countries with French and Italian possessions in Africa; a Pan-American Union encompassing North and South Americas; the British Commonwealth circling the globe; the USSR spanning Eurasia; and a Pan-Asian Union whereby Japan and China would control most of the Pacific. To him, the only hope for a Europe devastated by war was to federate along lines that the Hungarian-born Romanian [[Aurel Popovici]] and others had proposed for the dissolved multinational Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]]. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Pan-Europe would encompass and extend a more flexible and more competitive Austria-Hungary, with English serving as the world language, spoken by everyone in addition to their native tongue. He believed that individualism and socialism would learn to cooperate instead of compete, and urged that capitalism and communism cross-fertilise each other just as the Protestant Reformation had spurred the Catholic Church to regenerate itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipgens|1984|p=712}}; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudenhove-Kalergi attempted to enlist prominent European politicians in his pan-European cause. He offered the presidency of the Austrian branch of the Pan-European Union to [[Ignaz Seipel]], who accepted the offer unhesitatingly and rewarded his beneficiary with an office in the old Imperial palace in Vienna. Coudenhove-Kalergi had less success with [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Tomáš Masaryk]], who referred him to his uncooperative Prime Minister [[Edvard Beneš]]. However, the idea of pan-Europe elicited support from politicians as diverse as the Italian anti-Fascist politician [[Carlo Sforza]] and the German President of the [[Reichsbank]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Hjalmar Schacht]]. Although Coudenhove-Kalergi found himself unable to sway [[Benito Mussolini]], his ideas influenced [[Aristide Briand]] through his inspired speech in favour of a European Union in the [[League of Nations]] on 8 September 1929, as well as his famous 1930 "Memorandum on the Organisation of a Regime of European Federal Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weigall|Stirk|1992|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" as the [[Anthem of Europe]] in 1929,&lt;ref name="Paneurope Suisse" /&gt; which he later proposed in 1955 as Anthem for the [[European Union]]. In 1930, he proposed a Europe Day in May&lt;ref name="Paneurope Suisse" /&gt; and in 1932 he proposed to celebrate every 17th of May, the anniversary of Aristide Briand's "Memorandum" being published in 1930.&lt;ref name="Guieu and Le Dréau"&gt;{{harvnb|Guieu|Le Dréau|2009}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0JM1BquiVHIC&amp;pg=PA176 p. 176]: "{{Lang|fr| il a proposé dès 1932 une journée de l'Europe qui serait célébrée chaque 17 mai, jour de la publication du Mémorandum Briand.}}"&lt;/ref&gt; However, his Pan-Europeanism earned vivid loathing from [[Adolf Hitler]], who excoriated its pacifism and mechanical economism and belittled its founder as "a bastard."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burleigh|2001|p=426}}; {{harvnb|Lipgens|1984|p=37}}; Coudenhove-Kalergi once again approached Mussolini on 10 May 1933 in a futile attempt to form a union of Latin nations against the Third Reich. {{harv|Lipgens|1984|pp=180–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|Stråth|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P32dNnKCYLcC&amp;pg=PA114 p. 114]&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's view of Coudenhove-Kalergi was that the "rootless, cosmopolitan, and elitist half-breed" was going to repeat the historical mistakes of Coudenhove ancestors who had served the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazower|2013}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=opefF4rAL6YC&amp;pg=PR691 p. 691]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Hitler wrote about his political opponent in his ''[[Zweites Buch]]'', describing him as "{{Lang|de|[[wiktionary:aller-|Aller]] [[wiktionary:Welt|welts]] [[wiktionary:Bastard|bastarden]] (commonplace bastard) Coudenhove}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hitler|first= Adolf|title= Zweites Buch|url= https://archive.org/details/HitlerAdolf-DasGeheimeZweiteBuch|language= German|publisher= |date= 1928|quote= {{Lang|de|Dieses Paneuropa nach Auffassung des Allerweltsbastarden Coudenhove würde der amerikanischen Union oder einem national erwachten China gegenüber einst dieselbe Rolle spielen wie der altösterreichische Staat gegenüber Deutschland oder Rußland.}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegerhofer|2004}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHXg3QdGAtAC&amp;pg=PA425 p. 425]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler did not share the ideas of his Austrian compatriot. He argued in his 1928 ''[[Hitler's Secret Book|Secret Book]]'' that they are unfit for the future defense of Europe against America. As America fills its North American [[lebensraum]], “the natural activist urge that is peculiar to young nations will turn outward.” But then “a pacifist-democratic Pan-European hodgepodge state” would not be able to oppose the United States, as it is “according to the conception of that commonplace bastard, Coudenhove-Kalergi…”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hitler's Secret Book]]'', 1928, (tr. Attanasio, Salvator, New York: Grove Press, 1962), p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazis considered the Pan-European Union to be under the control of freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wNb4RXDxEt4C&amp;pg=PA394 p. 394]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, a [[Nazi propaganda]] book {{Lang|de|Die Freimaurerei: Weltanschauung, Organisation und Politik}} was released in German.&lt;ref&gt;The book had English edition as ''Freemasonry: Its World View, Organization and Policies''. (English full text: http://der-stuermer.org/freemasonryen.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed Coudenhove-Kalergi's membership of freemasonry, the organization [[Suppression of Freemasonry#Nazi Germany and occupied Europe|suppressed by Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|1938|p=22}}: "{{Lang|de|der freimaurer Coudenhove-Kalergi}}"&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his name was not to be found in masonic directories ''10,000 Famous Freemasons'' published in 1957–1960 by the United States' freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Denslow|1957}}–1960&lt;/ref&gt; He had already left the Viennese freemason's lodge in 1926 to avoid the criticism that had occurred at that time against the relationship between the Pan-European movement and freemasonry. He wrote about his masonic membership in ''Ein Leben für Europa'' (A Life for Europe) published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jajeśniak-Quast|2010|pp=131–132}}; {{harvnb|Ziegerhofer|2004}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EHXg3QdGAtAC&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, its Nazi propaganda book also described his action in 1924–1925 only. However, this propaganda also stated that "The Grand Lodge of Wien went enthusiastically to work for the Pan European Union in a call to all Masonic chief authorities. Even the Masonic newspaper The Beacon enthused about the thoughts of the higher degree Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi, and stated in March, 1925:
"Freemasonry, especially Austrian Freemasonry, may be eminently satisfied to have Coudenhove-Kalergi among its members. Austrian Freemasonry can rightly report that Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi fights for his Pan European beliefs: political honesty, social insight, the struggle against lies, striving for the recognition and cooperation of all those of good will. In this higher sense, Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi's program is a Masonic work of the highest order, and to be able to work on it together is a lofty task for all brother Masons.""&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090826133215/http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/masonry.htm Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Casablanca, Paul Henreid.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo in the cinematic trailer of ''Casablanca'']]
After [[Anschluss|the annexation of Austria]] by the [[Third Reich]] in 1938, Coudenhove-Kalergi fled to [[Czechoslovakia]], and thence to France. As France fell to Germany in 1940, he escaped to the United States by way of Switzerland and Portugal. When he passed a few days after the successful escape to the United States, he listened to the radio saying the possibility of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coudenhove-Kalergi|1953|p=234}} (Roy Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II]], he continued his call for the unification of Europe along the Paris-London axis. His wartime politics and adventures served as the real life basis for fictional Resistance hero Victor Laszlo, the [[Paul Henreid]] character in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. He published his work ''Crusade for Paneurope'' in 1944. His appeal for the unification of Europe enjoyed some support from [[Winston Churchill]], [[Allen Dulles]], and [[William Joseph Donovan|"Wild Bill" Donovan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dorril|2000|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of the [[Atlantic Charter]] on 14 August 1941, he composed a memorandum entitled "Austria's Independence in the light of the Atlantic Charter" and sent it to [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. In his position statement, Coudenhove-Kalergi took up the goals of the charter and recommended himself as head of government in exile. Both Churchill and Roosevelt distanced themselves from this document. From 1942 until his return to France in 1945, he taught at the [[New York University]], which appointed him professor of history in 1944. At the same university Professor [[Ludwig von Mises]] studied currency problems for Coudenhove-Kalergi's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coudenhove-Kalergi|1953|p=247}} (Hutchinson)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 1943, Nazis deprived him of his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Vienna, with the [[racist]] argument, that as a "Jew" was not considered dignified an academic degree of a German university ("''eines akademischen Grades einer deutschen Hochschule unwürdig''") - even though he was not Jewish nor was his family Jewish.&lt;ref name="univie.ac.at"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gedenkbuch.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=435&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=2&amp;no_cache=1&amp;person_single_id=40097&amp;person_name=&amp;person_geburtstag_tag=not_selected&amp;person_geburtstag_monat=not_selected&amp;person_geburtstag_jahr=not_selected&amp;person_fakultaet=not_selected&amp;person_kategorie=&amp;person_volltextsuche=&amp;search_person_x=1&amp;result_page=19 |title=Richard Nikolaus Coudenhove-Kalergi |date=2014 |publisher=University of Vienna|accessdate=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctorate degree was only regranted on 15 May 1955 - a very long time after the end of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="univie.ac.at" /&gt;

The end of the [[World War II]] inaugurated a revival of pan-European hopes. In the winter of 1945, [[Harry S. Truman]] read an article in the December issue of ''[[Collier's|Collier's magazine]]'' that Coudenhove-Kalergi posted about the integration of Europe. His article impressed Truman, and it was adopted to the United States' official policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013b}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKexp2-3.htm chpt. (3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Winston Churchill's celebrated speech of 19 September 1946 to the Academic Youth in [[Zurich]] commended "the exertions of the Pan-European Union which owes so much to Count Coudenhove-Kalergi and which commanded the services of the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipgens|Loth|1988}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJa0QAQiKNsC&amp;pg=PA664 p. 664]; {{harvnb|Churchill|2003|pp=427–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1946 and the spring of 1947, Coudenhove-Kalergi circulated an enquiry addressed to members of European parliaments. This enquiry resulted in the founding of the [[European Parliamentary Union]] (EPU), a nominally private organization that held its preliminary conference on 4–5 July at Gstaad, Switzerland, and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September. Speaking at the first EPU conference, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that the constitution of a wide market with a stable currency was the vehicle for Europe to reconstruct its potential and take the place it deserves within the concert of Nations. On less guarded occasions he was heard to advocate a revival of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lipgens|Loth|1988}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJa0QAQiKNsC&amp;pg=PA537 p. 537]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 he received the first annual ''[[Karlspreis]]'' (Charlemagne Award), given by the German city of [[Aachen]] to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace. In Japan, a politician [[Ichirō Hatoyama]] was influenced by Coudenhove-Kalergi's fraternity in his book ''The Totalitarian State Against Man''. It was translated into Japanese by Hatoyama and published in 1952. Coudenhove-Kalergi was appointed the honorary chairman of the fraternal youth association that Hatoyama, with the influence of his book, had established in 1953.

In 1955, he proposed the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Ode to Joy]]" as the music for the [[European Anthem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108214702/http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf |archivedate=November 8, 2008 |title=Union Paneuropéenne |date=August 3, 1955|language= French}} ([http://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/exchange_of_letters_between_richard_coudenhove_kalergi_and_paul_m_g_levy_3_august_1955_to_5_september_1955-en-34a3b196-9a23-4e9e-a977-94e31495b169.html digital document] by [[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]])&lt;/ref&gt; a suggestion that the [[Council of Europe]] took up 16 years later.

In the 1960s, Coudenhove-Kalergi urged Austria to pursue "an active policy of peace", as a "fight against the [[Cold War]] and its continuation, the atomic war". He advocated Austrian involvement in world politics in order to keep the peace, as "active neutrality". He continued his advocacy of European unification in memoranda circulated to the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. He recommended negotiations between the [[European Community]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] towards forming a "European customs union" that would be free of political and military connections, but would eventually adopt a monetary union.

==Views on race and religion==
In his attitudes towards race and religion, Coudenhove-Kalergi continued the work of his father. In his youth, the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi was an [[antisemitism|antisemite]]. He had expected to confirm his antipathy towards the Jews when he started working on his treatise ''Das Wesen des Antisemitismus'' (''The Essence of Antisemitism''); but, Coudenhove-Kalergi came to a different conclusion by the time he published his book in 1901. Following an [[irony|ironic]] critique of the new racial theories, he declared that the essence of antisemitism amounted to nothing more credible than fanatical religious hatred. He traced that fanaticism to religious bigotry that originated in the promulgation of [[Torah]] under [[Ezra]]. According to the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi, Jewish religious bigotry provoked opposition from the relatively tolerant Greco-Roman [[polytheism|polytheists]], eliciting their anti-Judaic reaction. Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi credited the Jews with originating religious intolerance, and condemned it as a violation of genuine religious principles. He branded every sort of anti-Judaism unchristian. He further urged liberal Christians and Jews to ally in protecting both of their religions, and religion as such, against the emerging menace of [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langmuir}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ySMxcXkjIC&amp;pg=PA22 pp. 22–24]; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his opposition to simplistic racial theory, Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi agreed that Jews are racially distinct. Although he pointed out that there is no Semitic race, because Semitic is an ethno-linguistic group, he equivocated by also remarking that the charges that Semites were uncreative were belied by civilizations formed by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]], who spoke [[Semitic languages]]. He further sought to defend the Jews against charges of parasitic greed and cowardice with anecdotal counterexamples of Jewish industriousness and martial courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robertson|1999|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in the first Pan-European Congress in 1926, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi expressed the support of Jews by the Pan-European movement and the benefits to Jews with the elimination of racial hatred and economic rivalry brought by the United States of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date= 5 October 1926|title= Jews Participate in Pan-europe Congress Sessions in Vienna|publisher= [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|url= http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|accessdate= 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi composed a preface for a new edition of his father's condemnation of antisemitism, reissued by his own publishing house. In 1933 he responded to the ascendance of [[National Socialism]] by collaborating with [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Arthur Holitscher]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], and [[Max Brod]] in writing and publishing the pamphlet ''Gegen die Phrase vom jüdischen Schädling'' (Against the Phrase 'Jewish Parasite').

In his book ''Praktischer Idealismus'' (''Practical Idealism''), written in 1925, he describes the future of Jews in Europe and of European racial composition with the following words:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coudenhove-Kalergi|1925|pp= 22-23, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]-[[Negroid]] [[race of the future]], similar in its appearance to the [[Ancient Egyptians]], will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals. [...]

Instead of destroying European Jewry, Europe, against its own will, refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process. No wonder that this people, that escaped Ghetto-Prison, developed into a spiritual nobility of Europe. Therefore a gracious Providence provided Europe with a new race of nobility by the Grace of Spirit. This happened at the moment when Europe's feudal aristocracy became dilapidated, and thanks to Jewish emancipation.}}

==Journeys to Japan==

===First return to Japan===
The Pan-European idea influenced a young Japanese diplomat – in the future, the president of [[Kajima Corporation]] – [[Morinosuke Kajima]] during his residence in Berlin in 1922.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa"&gt;{{harvnb|Hirakawa|2011|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coudenhove-Kalergi formed a friendship with Kajima and then asked him to translate the book ''Pan-Europa'' into Japanese.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa" /&gt; He proposed Pan-Asia to Kajima and promised to give [[Dutch East Indies]] as their friendship after the realization of the task to establish Pan-Asia.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa" /&gt; Kajima published ''Pan-Europa'' in Japanese in 1927. In 1930 Kajima retired from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to become [[Member of parliament|MP]]. His ambition to become an MP was due to Coudenhove-Kalergi's influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013c}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap1-3.htm chpt. (3)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970–1971 he published the complete works of Coudenhove-Kalergi from Kajima Institute Publishing that was established by Morinosuke Kajima. He respected Coudenhove-Kalergi over a lifetime, dreaming of the realization of Pan-Asia.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa" /&gt;

In Japan, the Pan-European idea also influenced a journalist [[Yoshinori Maeda]], the president of [[NHK]]. He became a pioneer of [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union]] with the image of ''Pan-Europa'' that he read in his student days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013c}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap1-2.htm chpt. (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 Ichirō Hatoyama established Yuai Youth Association (later Yuai Association), the fraternal association as the successor of fraternity that Coudenhove-Kalergi mentioned in ''The Totalitarian State Against Man''. The Japanese word {{nihongo|''yūai''|''[[wikt:友愛|友愛]]''}} has several meanings but especially the word used by Hatoyama means ''fraternity'' and in German ''[[wikt:Brüderlichkeit|brüderlichkeit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pempel|Lee|2012}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umb2lVHU81IC&amp;pg=PA137 p. 137]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered equivalent to "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]" (Brotherhood), the motto of the French Republic. An educator [[Kaoru Hatoyama]] became the second president of the association after her husband Ichirō, the first president, died in 1959.

In 1967 Coudenhove-Kalergi was awarded the Kajima Peace Award, and was invited to Japan by: Morinosuke Kajima as the president of Kajima Institute of International Peace, Yoshinori Maeda as the president of NHK, and Kaoru Hatoyama as the president of Yuai Youth Association. Together with his second wife Alexandra in a wheelchair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2013|url= http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap0.htm|script-title=ja:クーデンホーフ・カレルギーと日本の関係|last1=Tozawa|first1=Hidenori|publisher= Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi Forum (School of Law, Tohoku University)|accessdate=17 November 2014|language=Japanese | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coudenhove-Kalergi stayed in Japan from 26 October to 8 November. He was also accompanied by his young brother [[Gerolf Coudenhove-Kalergi|Gerolf]]'s daughter [[Barbara Coudenhove-Kalergi|Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013c}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap1-5.htm chpt. (5)]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi was also awarded ''First Order of the Sacred Treasure'' of Japan. He was granted an audience with the Emperor [[Hirohito]], [[Empress Kōjun]], their son Crown Prince [[Akihito]] to whom he had presented his book in 1953 in Switzerland, and Crown Princess [[Empress Michiko|Michiko]]. This time, he had returned to Japan for the first time since his childhood 71 years earlier. He gave several lectures and met various leaders. Coudenhove-Kalergi spent 2 weeks in Japan as a guest of Japanese TV, radio, newspaper, magazines and other media.&lt;ref name="kajima peace award"&gt;{{harvnb|Kajima MONTHLY REPORT DIGEST|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Japan, Coudenhove-Kalergi specifically asked for a meeting with the president of [[Soka Gakkai]], Dr. [[Daisaku Ikeda]], as Coudenhove-Kalergi had been interested in Ikeda's work for many years. After their first meeting in October 1967, Coudenhove-Kalergi described Ikeda as "very energetic, life-loving, honorable, friendly and intelligent."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013d}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap3.htm chpt.

Coudenhove-Kalergi visited Japan again at the invitation of the Soka Gakkai in October 1970.&lt;ref name="Tozawa2013d"&gt;{{harvnb|Tozawa|2013d}}, [http://www.law.tohoku.ac.jp/~tozawa/RCK%20HP/RCKjap3-2.htm chpt. (2)]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay, he and [[Daisaku Ikeda]] conducted a formal dialogue over the course of several days, a total of more than 12 hours of which was recorded for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 1978-11-19|url= http://www.seikyoonline.jp/ecorepo/teigen/kadai.html|script-title= ja:環境報告書2012: 環境問題は全人類的な課題|last1= Ikeda|first1= Daisaku|publisher= SEIKYO online ([[Seikyo Shimbun]])|accessdate= 17 November 2014|language= Japanese|ref= harv|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040853/http://www.seikyoonline.jp/ecorepo/teigen/kadai.html|archivedate= 29 November 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited the campus of [[Sōka University|Soka University]] in Tokyo, which was under construction at that time.&lt;ref name="Tozawa2013d" /&gt;

Two decades later, in 1990, Ikeda proposed that Coudenhove-Kalergi's favorite song, Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," be regularly performed at major Soka Gakkai meetings. It was reported in Japan that this was one cause of the split between the Soka Gakkai and [[Soka Gakkai International]] (SGI) from [[Nichiren Shōshū|Nichiren Shoshu]] in 1991, as the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood objected to the song's "Christian origins."

==Death==
[[File:Coudenhove-Park.Hofpavillon.U4hietzing.A.JPG|thumb|Coudenhove-Park at [[Hietzing]], Vienna]]
According to a masonic report, Coudenhove-Kalergi died of a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zuber|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His secretary, however, indicated that Coudenhove-Kalergi possibly committed suicide. In the memoir his secretary wrote, she said his death was kept secret so as not to disappoint those who considered him to be the great visionary of European integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dw.de/27112001-пан-европейское-движение-документы/a-444966|script-title=ru:Пан-европейское движение: документы|last1= Huseynov|first1= Hasan|date= 2001-11-27|language= Russian|publisher= [[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coudenhove-Kalergi was the head of the Pan-European Union until his death. The presidency was succeeded by Otto von Habsburg.

Coudenhove-Kalergi is buried at [[Gruben/Meiden|Gruben]] near [[Gstaad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jilek||p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave, covered with [[wild grape]]s, is located in a [[Japanese rock garden]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]. The grave is unpretentious and upon it is the French epitaph "{{Lang|fr|Pionnier des États-Unis d'Europe}}" (Pioneer of the United States of Europe), with none of the other great titles that many supporters believe he had earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessmir.ch/?p=153327&amp;language=en|title= COUNT COUDENHOVE-KALERGI: SWITZERLAND AS THE MODEL OF EUROPEAN UNITY|last1= Aizpurvit|first1= Katerina|date= June 2011|publisher= [[Business Mir]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudenhove-Kalergi was married three times: to [[Ida Roland]] (1881–1951), to Alexandra Gräfin von Tiele-Winkler (1896–1968), and to Melanie Benatzky-Hoffmann (1909–1983). His known children were Ida's daughter Erika and Alexandra's son Alexander, both of whom were his step-children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pernhorst|2008|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10878">'''Schahan R. Berberian''' ({{lang-hy|Շահան Ռ. Պէրպէրեան}}; January 1, 1891 – October 9, 1956) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] philosopher, composer, pedagogue, psychologist, aesthetician, public speaker and author.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Berberian was born in [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]). Shortly thereafter, along with his parents Retheos&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Retheos Berberian]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Zaruhi and his elder brother Onnig, Berberian moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland to escape the [[Hamidian massacre|atrocities]] against the Armenians perpetrated by the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] from 1894 to 1896.

Returning to Constantinople, Berberian enrolled at the Berberian School, which had been founded by his father [[Reteos Berberian]], in [[Kadikoy|Kadıköy]], a district on the Asian side of the city. At that time, he started taking private lessons on the violin, but soon quit playing the "insufferable instrument"&lt;ref&gt;Սահակ Վարդապետ։ ''Երաժիշտը''։ Հասկ։ Antelias, 1956, pp 458-9.&lt;/ref&gt; (allegedly throwing it into the fireplace to burn it). Instead he took up piano lessons although this venture was also rather unsuccessful.

Berberian graduated in 1906. The first job of the fifteen-year-old young man was to teach literature and natural sciences at his alma mater but in 1908, he left for Paris where he studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[Collège de France]], taking classes in philosophy and metaphysics with [[Henri Bergson]], psychology with [[Georges Dumas]] and sociology with [[Emile Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]], thus receiving a thorough education in the liberal arts and obtaining a diploma to teach philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Գ. Վ. [Գարեգին Վարդապետ]։ ''Շահան Պէրպէրեան  (1891-1956).'' Հասկ։ Antelias, 1956, pp 455-8.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was able to quench his deep love for music by attending concerts and teaching himself composition.

=== Professional career ===

==== Principal of Berberian School ====
In 1911, Berberian was obliged to return to Constantinople to become Principal of the Berberian School, and thus was unable to complete his doctoral thesis (entitled "The Pathological Method in Psychology"). In addition to his duties at the school, he became involved in the cultural life of the Armenian community in the city. During this period, he developed a close friendship with [[Komitas Vardapet|Komitas]], spending long hours discussing with him various issues in the field of the arts.

In 1918, Schahan Berberian was selected to become the director of the Central Committee of the Armenian Teachers’ Union and was appointed a member of the Central Educational Council in 1919. He was also instrumental in the foundation—and later became the chairman—of the Armenian Art Center (''Hayardun'') in Constantinople. He contributed essays to Armenian newspapers in Constantinople, mostly to ''Vosdan'' (Den) and in 1922, along with Kegham Kavafian, [[Vahan Tekeyan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Songs from Vahan Tekeyan - Music by Schahan Berberian.'' New York, St. Vartan Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-934728-05-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hagop Oshagan]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.littlearmenia.com/html/history/detail.asp?id=212&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gostan Zarian]], he founded the monthly, ''Partsravank'' (Monastery-on-a-Hill), which was devoted to art and literature.

In 1921, he married Telli Sirakian.  They had two sons, Ardavazt and Bared. Bared died as a young man at 20 years old in a motocycle accident.
Ardavazt Berberian after living in Jerusalem and Beyruth, moved to Paris with his wife (Paule), where he became a renowned painter and also extremely involved in Armenian culture. He had two sons named Vanik and Schahan, and a daughter named Gariné. 
Ardavazt died in Avignon at the age of 79, in August 2002.

==== 1920s ====
In the fall of 1922, the deteriorating political atmosphere in Turkey impelled him to leave for Europe once more and Berberian settled in [[Dresden]], Germany, where he studied [[Choreography]], in addition to pursuing his philosophical and aesthetic interests. In 1924, together with his older brother composer Onnig Berberian, he moved to [[Cairo]], Egypt to relaunch the Berberian School. Strongly supported by Archbishop [[Torkom Koushagian]]&lt;ref&gt;Արշակ Ալպօյաճեան։ ''Թորգոմ Պատրիարք Գուշակեան''։ Հրատ. Մտաւորական Սպասարկութեանց Գրասենեակի։ Cairo, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; of Egypt, the school became an intellectual center for the local Armenian community and remained open until 1934 when its shaky finances forced it to close its doors. In Cairo, Berberian and his long-time friend and colleague Hagop Oshagan establish two choral groups to further encourage involvement in the Armenian community: the Union of Armenian Art Lovers (1932–34) and the Berberian School Choir (1924–34).

==== 1930s ====
At the invitation of Abp. Koushagian – now the Patriarch of Jerusalem – he and his family along with Hagop Oshagan moved to the [http://www.armenian-patriarchate.org/ Patriarchate of St. James] to teach at the Armenian Seminary there. His presence at the Seminary created much excitement and a cultural renaissance in the theological college was soon underway, fostered in part by the Armenian Cultural Union (1940–47) which he and Oshagan founded there.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
After ten years of teaching in Jerusalem, in 1944 Berberian moved to the [http://www.armenianorthodoxchurch.org/ Catholicosate of Cilicia] in [[Antelias, Lebanon|Antelias]], Lebanon to continue his vocation in education. Once again, he managed to create an atmosphere of educative curiosity and a passion for learning that left an indelible mark on the history of the Seminary.

Most of Berberian's compositions are written for solo voice with piano or vocal ensembles. These have only recently came more widely known thanks in no small part to the efforts of [[Torkom Manoogian|Abp. Torkom Manoogian]], the present Patriarch of Jerusalem. According to Manoogian, the songs were "in my possession for some time. When Berberian visited the United States in 1949, he agreed to provide copies of his music, two songs at a time, clearly written and in final form. He did so for a while, but soon stopped.  He also sent me new variations of some of the songs.  I had in addition three different notebooks, copied from the composer's work by three of his students. It was from these that the rest of the songs were obtained."&lt;ref&gt;''50 Songs by Schahan R. Berberian''. New York: St. Vartan Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-934728-08-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, fifty of Berberian's songs were published in 1983 by St. Vartan Press in New York.

Most of Schahan Berberian's songs share a mystic lucidity and spaciousness, and a simple melodic line with minimal accompaniment – notes hanging in midair. They are fragile and laconic, the textual content always leading the recitative-like musical line.
 
Other Berberian manuscripts, including the incidental music to Oshagan's ''Sasuntsi Tavit'' (David of Sassoun) and four scenes from the opera ''Anush'', are at the Library of the Jerusalem Patriarchate.  In addition, his literary output comprises two unpublished volumes: ''Komitas vartabed—antsı yev kordzı'' (Komitas—His Life and Work," 1936) and ''Yergu zhamanagner'' (Two Lifetimes, 1943).

While on a summer vacation in Paris, visiting his son Ardavazt, Berberian fell ill and died there on October 9, 1956.

'''Semyon Lyudvigovich Frank''' ({{lang-ru|Семён Лю́двигович Франк}}; 1877&amp;ndash;1950) was a Russian philosopher. Born into a Jewish family, he became a Christian in 1912.
==Early life and studies==
Semyon Lyudvigovich Frank was born in Russia in 1877, in [[Moscow]], in a Jewish family. His father, a doctor, died when the boy was young, and he was brought up by his maternal grandfather, M. Rossiansky, an Orthodox Jew, who taught him Hebrew and took him to the synagogue. Through his stepfather, the populist V. I. Zak, he was introduced to the works of [[N. K. Mikhailovsky]] and other revolutionaries. 

At secondary school he became interested in [[Marxism]]. In 1894 he began to study law at Moscow University, but spent more time preaching socialism to the workers, but by 1896 he found Marxist economic theories unsatisfactory, though he remained a socialist. In 1899 he wrote a revolutionary pamphlet which got him expelled from Moscow; so he completed his studies of philosophy and political economy in Berlin. In 1900 he published in Russian a ''Critique of Marx's theory of value''. In 1901 he returned to Russia and received his bachelor's degree at the University of Kazan. Thereafter philosophy became his main preoccupation.

==Career as philosopher==
[[File:Философия (по С. Л. Франку).png|thumb]]
In 1901 [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]] invited Frank to contribute to his collection, ''The Problem of Idealism'' (published in 1902), which criticised materialism and positivism. He spent the next five years between Moscow and Germany, writing and translating philosophical works and assisting Struve. Between 1902 and 1905, he contributed to Struve's periodical, ''Osvobozhdenie'' ('Liberation'), published in Stuttgart (1902-1904) and Paris (1904–1905). In 1906 he moved to St Petersburg and contributed philosophical essays to Struve's periodical, ''Russkaya Mysl''. In 1908, he contributed to the influential symposium, ''Vekhi'' ('signposts').

In 1908, he married Tatyana Sergeevna Bartseva (1886-1984) with whom he would have four children: Alexei (1910-1969), Natalia (1912-1999), Vasiliy (1920-1996) and Victor.

In 1912, he converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity]], and began lecturing on philosophy at St Petersburg University. Later, he wrote, "I consider my Christianity as the completion of my Old Testament upbringing, as an organic evolution based on the religious foundations which I accepted in my childhood".&lt;ref&gt;''S.L. Frank A Miscellany'' (in Russian) (1954. Munich), p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank spent 1913-1914 in Germany, where he wrote ''Der Gegenstand des Wissens'' ('The Object of Knowledge') for which he received his master's degree (1916). It was followed by his ''Dusha Cheloveka'' ('Man's Soul') (1917).

In summer 1917, Frank was appointed dean of the arts faculty of the new University of Saratov. In 1921, he was appointed to the chair of philosophy in Moscow University. There he joined the philosopher [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], who was directing the Free Academy of Spiritual Culture.

However, in June 1922, he and other intellectuals were expelled from the Soviet Union, on the so-called "[[philosophers' ship]]".

Frank spent the rest of life supported by the [[World Council of Churches]] and his friend, the Swiss psychologist and existentialist, [[Ludwig Binswanger]]. From 1922 to 1937, he was in Germany, but from 1933, his Jewish ancestry rendered him unemployable in Germany. Fleeing the Nazi persecution of the Jews, he moved to Paris in 1937. During his exile, he published several books and articles in Russian and articles in German, French and Dutch.

He and his wife survived [[World War II]] by hiding near [[Grenoble]]; their four children escaped to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the early years of the war he wrote 'God With Us', the first of his works to be translated into English (published in 1946). In 1945, he and his wife moved to Britain.

Frank died of lung cancer in [[London]]. He and his wife are buried in Hendon Cemetery in London.

==Metaphysical libertarianism==
{{See also|metaphysical libertarianism}}
Semyon Frank's philosophy was based on the ontological theory knowledge. This meaning that knowledge was intuitive in whole but also abstraction in logic. Logic being limited to only part of being.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract logical is only possible because of the intuition of this all-embracing unity. A logically determined object is an object subordinated to the laws of identity, contradiction and excluded mibble: it is ''A'' in contradistinction to all else, i.e. to ''non-A''. Thus the determinateness of A is only thinkable as "forming part of a complex (A + nonA)." Such a correlation can have its ground only in a whole which transcends the determinitions ''A'' and ''non-A'', and consequently is a metalogical unity (237), i.e. a unity not subject to the law of contradiction. It belongs to the realm of the "coincidence of opposites" (coincidentia oppositorum) or, rather, ''there are no oppsosites in it all, so that "the law of contradiction is not violated, but simply inapplicable to it". History of Russian Philosophy by NO Lossky pg 267&lt;/ref&gt; Frank taught that existence was being but also becoming. As [[becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], one has dynamic potential. Thus one's future is indeterminate since reality is both rational and irrational. As reality includes the unity of rationality and irrationality i.e. of necessity and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;History of Russian Philosophy by NO Lossky pg 269&lt;/ref&gt; Frank's position being for the existence of [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;All that is new arises not out of a definite ground, which as [[determinists]] suppose, necessarily predetermines the future, not out of ''A'', but out of ''A-X'';i.e. out of the transfinite essence of reality in so far as it is partially determined by the presence of ''A''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shambhala Training''' is a [[secular]] approach to [[meditation]] developed by [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teacher [[Chogyam Trungpa]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Midal (2001) pp 233-247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gimian (2005) pp 337-345&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on what Trungpa calls [[Shambhala#The Shambhala of Chogyam Trungpa|Shambhala]] Vision, which sees enlightened society as not purely mythical, but as realizable by people of all faiths through practices of mindfulness/awareness, non-aggression, and sacred outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, pp 223&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
{{Cquote|I am honoured and grateful that in the past I have been able to present the wisdom and dignity of human life within the context of the religious teachings of Buddhism. Now it gives me tremendous joy to present the principles of Shambhala warriorship and to show how we can conduct our lives as warriors with fearlessness and rejoicing, without destroying one another... I have been presenting a series of "Shambhala teachings" that use the image of the Shambhala kingdom to represent the ideal of secular enlightenment, that is, the possibility of uplifting our personal existence and that of others without the help of any religious outlook. For although the Shambhala tradition is founded on the sanity and gentleness of the Buddhist tradition, at the same time it has its own independent basis, which is directly cultivating who and what we are as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1984), pp 25-34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Shambhala Training teachings cover art, society, and politics and the goal of creating an enlightened society. That goal is presented as not solely a social and political process, but one requiring individuals to develop an awareness of the basic goodness and inherent dignity of themselves, of others, and of the everyday details of the world around them. This is facilitated by cultivating gentleness and bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, pp 674&lt;/ref&gt;

Shambhala Training is currently administered worldwide by [[Shambhala International]]. The Satdharma community offers a comparable "Shambhala Education" course of training in Ojai, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satdharma.org/Shambhala.php Satdharma.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513111639/http://www.satdharma.org/Shambhala.php |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==
=== Curriculum ===
Though Shambhala Training is a personal, ongoing practice of meditation and engaged activities, the Shambhala Training curriculum is presented in a series of progressive weekend programs, and then a longer retreat. "The Heart of Warriorship" curriculum consist of five weekend programs with each weekend followed by a corresponding 'Everyday Life' class.  The latter seven weekends are called "The Sacred Path," as follows:

====The Heart of Warriorship====

* Level I: The Art of Being Human
* Meditation in Everyday Life
* Level II: Birth of the Warrior
* Contentment in Everyday Life
* Level III: Warrior in the World
* Joy in Everyday Life
* Level IV: Awakened Heart
* Fearlessness in Everyday Life
* Level V: Open Sky
* Wisdom in Everyday Life

====The Sacred Path====

* Great Eastern Sun
* Windhorse
* Drala
* Meek
* Perky
* Outrageous and Inscrutable
* Golden Key

====Warrior Assembly====
The Warrior Assembly is a residential program of slightly less than two weeks duration

These weekends are intended to be completed in order, though Windhorse and Drala are sometimes exchanged in the sequence. Students may then continue onto an intensive nine- to fourteen-day-long residential retreat called Warriors Assembly. Practices and root texts are made available as students complete the prerequisite study and practice stages. However, it is claimed by Shambhala adherents that much of their content is found in the book [[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Seager, pp 133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meditation technique ===
The basic [[meditation]] technique initially presented in Shambhala Training includes sitting with legs loosely crossed, taking good posture, leaving the eyes slightly open, and focusing attention on the out-breath. A feeling of dissolving accompanies the out-breath but no specific attention is prescribed during the in-breath. The hands are placed face down on the thighs. Thoughts may be labeled neutrally as "thinking" before attention is returned to the out breath.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1984) pg 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; Variations on the technique are taught during the first five "Heart of Warriorship" weekends. Meditation is described in Shambala as "''a natural state of the human mind—at rest, open, alert.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://shambhala.org/what-is-meditation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key practices and Concepts ===
Shambhala Training contains teachings relating to personal, household, and societal situations. One central teaching is on [[natural hierarchy]]. At first glance this appears to suggest that hierarchy is inherent to human societies and therefore oppression and subjugation are inevitable. But conventional social hierarchies or privilege based on class, gender, race, etc. would be considered unnatural hierarchies. Instead the Shambhala Training notion of natural hierarchy is akin to an arranged [[mandala]] where people are connected, interdependent, and communicate in natural ways. The Chinese triune notion of Heaven, Earth and Man is considered the prototypical pattern of natural hierarchy. Natural hierarchy recognizes that some people are better than others at things and communities benefit from a natural arrangement. However, these arrangements of people are fluid and ossification creates unnatural hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish and Tanaka, chapter 14, pg 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1999) pp 101-103&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key concepts presented include:
* [[basic goodness]] - our essential nature is good, workable, and worthwhile. This is sometimes contrasted with the idea of [[original sin]], although it is arguable that both notions include the concept of a primordial purity that is stained or covered over.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, pp 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.glossary.shambhala.org/#COCOON cocoon] - conceptualization can become armor that cuts us off from the vividness of the world around us, and we are better to discard that armor.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1984) pp 60-64&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wind Horse]] (Tib. lungta) - akin to [[Qi]]&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1999), pp 234&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]], practitioners cultivate windhorse through a variety of practices and disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1999), pp 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1984) pp 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.glossary.shambhala.org/#DRALA drala] - akin to [[kami]] or [[spirit]] conventionally, this also refers to the use of direct sense perceptions to overcome conceptual mental fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward (1997) pp 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1984) pp 103-115&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.glossary.shambhala.org/#FOURDIGNITIES the four dignities] - Meek Tiger, Perky Lion, Outrageous [[Garuda]] and Inscrutable Dragon
* [http://www.glossary.shambhala.org/#HE heaven, earth, and man] - the role of humanity (man) is to connect the ground of the situation (earth) with the vision of possibility (heaven), so to rule oneself or society is to join heaven, earth, and man.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1999), pp 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, (1984) pp 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Sacred Path weekends and Warriors Assembly, students study Shambhala texts composed by Chögyam Trungpa, as well as practices such as that of the stroke of [[Stroke (Chinese character)|ashé]]. The stroke of ashé was first produced on the night of October 25, 1976, while Trungpa was leading a three-month seminary in Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, pp 220-223&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by subsequent texts, some of which were considered to be [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]], which were received over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, (2001), pp 220-232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Root Texts==
Chogyam Trungpa wrote a number of Shambhala texts throughout his life, and also received a number of them as [[Terma (religion)|terma]]. Long-time students and members of his Nalanda Translation Committee elaborated on his reception of terma in a 2006 newsletter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the first Kalapa Assembly in the fall of 1978, during one of our translation sessions with the Vidyadhara, Larry Mermelstein engaged him in an interesting discussion about the nature of the Shambhala texts he was presenting to us. When asked whether they were terma (“treasure teachings” hidden long ago to be discovered at an appropriate time in the future), he replied, “Yes, sort of.” When we asked whether we should include the terma mark to indicate terma in our translations, his response was, “Not yet; maybe later.” In fact, this did not come to pass until after his death, when Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche instructed us to include this in our future publications of these texts, and he confirmed with no hesitation that they were indeed authentic terma.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we asked the Vidyadhara whether these texts originated with Padmakara, the source of the vast majority of treasure teachings, at that time we didn’t know that other teachers also hid dharma as termas. So when Rinpoche replied that these texts were more likely from Gesar, we were understandably puzzled. But after a long pause Rinpoche added, “And of course Gesar was an emanation of Padmakara, so that should take care of things for you!” When we asked about what meaning Gesar had in terms of the Shambhala teachings, Rinpoche exclaimed: “Gesar is the vanguard of Shambhala.” (It should be noted that in other contexts, the Vidyadhara indicated that the Shambhala terma had originated with the Rigden kings, [[Shiwa Ökar]], or [[Gesar]] of Ling.)&lt;ref name="shambhala.org"&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/NTC-newsletter-06.pdf Nalanda Translation Committee. Newsletter, 2006-7. pg 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820053742/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/NTC-newsletter-06.pdf |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Antecedents ==
=== Windhorse ===

[[File:2007 0806collectionBertsch0012.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan bronze statue of a windhorse, probably 19th century]]
In Tibet, a distinction was made between Buddhism (''Lha-cho'', wylie: ''lha chos,'' literally "religion of the gods") and folk religion (''Mi-cho'', wylie: ''mi chos'', literally "religion of humans").&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. Tibetan Renaissance: Tantric Buddhism in the Rebirth of Tibetan Culture'' Columbia University Press: 2005. {{ISBN|0-231-13470-3}}. pg 76&lt;/ref&gt; Windhorse (wylie: ''rlung ta'') was predominately a feature of the folk culture, a "mundane notion of the layman rather than a Buddhist religious ideal," as Tibetan scholar Samten G. Karmay explains.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 415"&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 415&lt;/ref&gt; However, while  "the original concept of ''rlung ta'' bears no relation to Buddhism," over the centuries it became more common for Buddhist elements to be incorporated.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 415"/&gt; Windhorse has several meanings in the Tibetan context. 

As Karmay notes, "the word &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;windhorse&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is still and often mistakenly taken to mean only the actual flag planted on the roof of a house or on a high place near a village. In fact, it is a symbol of the idea of well-being or good fortune. This idea is clear in such expressions as ''rlung rta dar ba,'' the 'increase of the windhorse,' when things go well with someone; ''rlung rta rgud pa'', the 'decline of windhorse,' when the opposite happens. The colloquial equivalent for this is ''lam ’gro,'' which also means luck."&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 415"/&gt; 

In his 1998 study ''The Arrow and the Spindle,'' Karmay traces several antecedents for the windhorse tradition in Tibet. First, he notes that there has long been confusion over the spelling because the sound produced by the word can be spelt either ''klung rta'' (river horse) or ''rlung rta'' (wind horse)--the first letter is silent in both cases. In the early twentieth century the great scholar [[Ju Mipham]] felt compelled to clarify that in his view ''rlung rta'' was preferable to ''klung rta'', indicating that some degree of ambiguity must have persisted at least up to his time.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 413-15"&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 413-15&lt;/ref&gt; Karmay suggests that "river horse" (''klung rta'') was actually the original concept, as found in the Tibetan ''nag rtsis'' system of astrology imported from China. The ''nag rtsis'' system has four basic elements: ''srog'' (vital force), ''lu'' (wylie: ''lus,'' body), ''wangtang'' (wylie: ''dbang thang'', "field of power"), and ''lungta'' (wylie: ''klung rta,'' river horse). Karmey suggests that ''klung rta'' in turn derives from the Chinese idea of the ''lung ma,'' "dragon horse," because in Chinese mythology dragons often arise out of rivers (although ''druk'' is the Tibetan for dragon, in some cases they would render the Chinese ''lung'' phonetically). Thus, in his proposed etymology the Chinese ''lung ma'' became ''klung rta'' which in turn became ''rlung rta.'' Samtay further reasons that the drift in understanding from "river horse" to "wind horse" would have been reinforced by associations in Tibet of the "ideal horse" (''rta chogs'') with swiftness and wind.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 413-15"/&gt;

===The Four Dignities, Drala and the Lhasang ritual===

On prayer flags and paper prints, windhorses usually appear in the company of the four animals of the cardinal directions, which are "an integral part of the ''rlung ta'' composition": [[garuda]] or ''kyung'', and [[Azure Dragon|dragon]] in the upper corners, and [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|tiger]] and [[snow lion]] in the lower corners.&lt;ref&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 416&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the wind horse is typically shown without wings, but carries the [[Three Jewels]], or the [[Cintamani|wish fulfilling jewel]]. Its appearance is supposed to bring peace, wealth, and harmony. The ritual invocation of the wind horse usually happens in the morning and during the growing moon. The flags themselves are commonly known as windhorse. They flutter in the wind, and carry the prayers to heaven like the horse flying in the wind.

The garuda and the dragon have their origin in [[Hindu mythology|Indian]] and [[Chinese mythology]], respectively. However, regarding the origin of the animals as a tetrad, "neither written nor oral explanations exist anywhere" with the exception of a thirteenth-century manuscript called "The Appearance of the Little Black-Headed Man" (''dBu nag mi'u dra chag''), and in that case a yak is substituted for the snow lion, which had not yet emerged as the national symbol of Tibet.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 420"&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 420&lt;/ref&gt; In the text, a ''nyen'' (wylie: ''gNyan,'' mountain spirit&lt;ref&gt;de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, René. ''Oracles and Demons of Tibet'', pg 287-289&lt;/ref&gt;) kills his son-in-law, Khri-to, who is the primeval human man, in a misguided attempt to avenge his daughter. The nyen then is made to see his mistake by a mediator and compensates Khri-to's six sons with the gift of the tiger, yak, garuda, dragon, goat, and dog. The first four brothers then launch an exhibition to kill robbers who were also involved with their mother's death, and each of their four animals then becomes a personal ''drala'' (wylie: ''dgra bla'', "protective warrior spirit") to one of the four brothers.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 420"/&gt; The brothers who received the goat and dog choose not to participate, and their animals therefore do not become drala.&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 420"/&gt; Each of the brothers represents one of the six primitive Tibetan clans (''bod mi'u gdung drug''), with which their respective animals also become associated.

The four animals (with the snow lion replacing the yak) also recur frequently in the [[Epic of Gesar|Gesar epic]], and sometimes Gesar and his horse are depicted with the dignities in place of the windhorse. In this context the snow lion, garuda and dragon represent the Ling (wylie: ''Gling'') community from which Gesar comes, while the tiger represents the family of the Tagrong (wylie: ''sTag rong''), Gesar's paternal uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

The windhorse ceremonies are usually conducted in conjunction with the ''lhasang'' (wylie: ''lha bsang'', literally "smoke offering to the gods") ritual,&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 417"&gt;Karmay, Samten G. ''The Arrow and the Spindle: Studies in History, Myths, Rituals and Beliefs in Tibet.'' Mandala Publishing: 1998 pg. 417&lt;/ref&gt; in which juniper branches are burned to create thick and fragrant smoke. This is believed to increase the strength in the supplicator of the four ''nag rtsis'' elements mentioned above. Often the ritual is called the ''risang lungta'', (wylie: ''ri bsang rlung ta''), the "fumigation offering and (the throwing into the wind or planting) of the ''rlung ta'' high in the mountains."&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 417"/&gt; The ritual is traditionally "primarily a secular ritual" and "requires no presence of any special officiant whether public or private."&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 417"/&gt; The layperson entreats a mountain deity to "increase his fortune like the galloping of a horse and expand his prosperity like the boiling over of milk (''rlung ta ta rgyug/ kha rje 'o ma 'phyur 'phyur/'').&lt;ref name="Karmay, Samten G. pg. 417"/&gt;

Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche elaborates on the traditional understanding and etymology of ''drala'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In many ancient Bön texts the name 'Drala' is spelt ''sgra bla'', which literally means '''la'' of sound', where ''la'' (soul or vitality) stands for a type of individual energy that is also endowed with a protective function. In more recent texts, notably those of the Buddhist tradition, we find the spelling ''dgra lha,'' 'deity of the enemy', a term which has been interpreted to mean a warrior deity whose task is to fight one's enemies. [...] Other authors, interpreting the term in the sense of 'deity that conquers the enemy's la' have instead spelt it ''dgra bla,'' 'enemy's la'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] The spelling ''sgra bla'' ('la of sound') found in the ancient texts as a matter of fact is based on a very deep principle characteristic of the most authentic Bön tradition. Sound, albeit not visible, can be perceived through the sense of hearing and used as a means of communication, and is in fact linked to the ''cha'' (the individual's positive force, the base of prosperity), ''wang tang'' (ascendancy-capacity), and all the other aspects of a person's energy, aspects that are directly related with the protective deities and entities that every person has from birth. Moreover, sound is considered the foremost connection between the individual himself and his ''la''. From all this we can easily understand the deep meaning of the word ''sgra bla''.&lt;ref&gt;Namkhai Norbu, Drung De'u and Bön, translated by Adriano Clemente, Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, 1995 pp.61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Syncretism of Rime and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso ===

The nineteenth century lamas of the [[Rime movement|Rime]] movement, particularly the great scholar [[Ju Mipham]], began to "create a systematic interweaving of native shamanism, oral epic, and Buddhist tantra, alchemical Taoism, Dzogchen, and the strange, vast ''Kalachakra tantra'',"&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pgs 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; and the folk traditions were increasingly given Buddhist connotations and used in Buddhist contexts.
Mipham's edition of the ''Epic of Gesar'', which Robin Kornman, a Tibetan Buddhist scholar and student of Chogyam Trungpa, saw as the cornerstone of Trungpa's Shambhala teachings, "was a hybrid of Buddhist and local idea. He made sure it would be read this manner by writing a parallel set of Gesar chants that mix religions in the same way."&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pgs 365&lt;/ref&gt; As Kornman writes, one such typical chant is "a careful combination of Buddhism according to the Nyingma sect with local religion."&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pgs 366&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kornman, "In the Na volume of Mipham's collected works one finds numerous very short supplications to Gesar ...Trungpa Rinpoche lifted the above supplications from Mipham's Gesar cycle and gave them to his advanced students to chant."&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pgs 367&lt;/ref&gt;

Kornman asserts that Trungpa "wrote his ''Epic of Lha'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;his first Shambhala tradition text&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; within this tradition, conscious of the synthesis his gurus had effected. He became in effect the chief spokesman in the West for this syncretic system."&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pgs 370&lt;/ref&gt; The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, a younger colleague of Trungpa Rinpoche, notes that Trungpa "introduced many Tibetan cultural practices through the Shambhala teachings, such as the lhasang (purification ceremony), along with practices associated with drala and werma (deities)."&lt;ref&gt;Genuine Water," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Kornman summaries Trungpa's use of antecedent traditions in the creation of his Shambhala teachings as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The philosopher king and the political leadership of his idealized society were people who ruled by virtue of private mystical realizations. The one who sees the phenomenal world as mere appearance and reality as a transcendent other, rules the country and introduces the citizens to his private mystical world. To use tantric terminology, the leader expands the boundaries of the mandala, the private society of his personal students who share the initiatory mysteries, to the entire nation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This was the theory of the relationship between religion and society that Trungpa Rinpoche elaborated in the West. Its metaphysics was based on the philosophical syncretism of the Eclectic &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Rime&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; movement, which evolved an almost Neoplatonic emanational version of Buddhist mysticism. The mythological machinery, the cosmology of his system, was based on the most complex of all of the Buddhist tantras, the Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) Tantra. But textually it was based on the Tibetan oral epic of King Gesar of Ling, which deployed a non-Buddhist divine machinery based on native Inner Asian shamanistic and animistic religion. The “back text” of Trungpa’s socioreligious system was the Gesar epic. This meant that his model for the relationship between religion and society was what he saw in his region of Tibet, the Sino-Tibetan marches of Kham (Eastern Tibet) and Amdo/Qinghai. In particular, he pointed to the Goloks, nomadic pastoralist warriors, who made the mystery religion of Dzogchen, the great perfection, their public religion through, among other things, the propagation of the oral epic.&lt;ref&gt;Kornman, Robin. "The Influence of the Epic of King Gesar on Chogyam Trungpa," in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'', edit. Fabrice Midal. pg 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Kalachakra tantra ===
As Kornman notes, the Shambhala tradition was not particularly textually based on the [[Kalachakra]] tantra. However, as he noted, it does rely on it for some of its "mythological machinery"--in particular, the name and concept of "Shambhala" itself, and the personage of the Rigden (Tib.; wylie: ''rigs ldan'', Sanskrit: ''Kalki''). The Shambhala tradition of Chogyam Trungpa also derives an ethos of syncretism and ecumenicism from the Kalachakra tradition. As John Newman, one of the world's leading Kalachakra scholars, explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kalacakra, or "Wheel of Time," was the last major product of Indian Vajrayana Buddhism. All late Vajrayana Buddhism is syncretic - it takes elements from non-Buddhist religious traditions and assimilates them to a Buddhist context. However, in the Kalacakra tantra syncretism is unusually obvious and is even self-conscious&amp;mdash;the tantra makes little effort to disguise its borrowings from the Śaiva, Vaisnava, and Jaina traditions. The basic structure of the Kalacakra system is itself non-Buddhist: the Kalacakra uses the ancient idea of the homology of the macrocosm and the microcosm as the foundation of its soteriology.&lt;ref&gt;"Islam in the Kalachakra Tantra" by John Newman. The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies. Vol 21:2 pg 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Changes to the Path ==
In May 2000, [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]], head of [[Shambhala International]], published a letter declaring the Shambhala teachings and Buddhism "work in tandem." He affirmed that practitioners of any faith tradition are welcome and encouraged to participate in Shambhala Training, while also noting "there may be a tendency to think that the purpose of Shambhala Training was to create an organization in which all these religious interests would have equal standing. All of us must understand that our view consists of the Shambhalian and Buddhist understanding of how to combine worldly and spiritual wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Mipham (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the introduction of a new, [[Shambhala Buddhism|Shambhala Buddhist]], lineage.

After the 2003 Kalapa Assembly program, it was announced that the study and practice of the [[Werma]] [[Sadhana]] was to be moved from the Shambhala Training to the Buddhist curriculum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">'''Situational analysis''' (or '''Situational logic''') is a concept advanced by [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in his [[The Poverty of Historicism]]. ''Situational analysis'' is a process by which a social scientist tries to reconstruct the problem situation confronting an agent in order to understand that agent's choice.

[[Noretta Koertge|Koertge]] (1975) provides a helpful clarificatory summary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This use of this summary is from Boumans and Davis (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

:First provide a description of the situation: 
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''Agent A was in a situation of type C''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
:This situation is then analysed
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''In a situation of type C, the appropriate thing to do is X.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:The rationality principle may then be called upon:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;''agents always act appropriately to their situation''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Song Siyeol''' ({{lang-ko|송시열}}, [[Hanja]]: 宋時烈, 30 December 1607 - 19 July 1689), also known by his [[penname]]s ''Uam'' (우암) and ''Ujae'' (우재) or by the honorific ''Songja'' ({{lang-ko|송자}}, [[Hanja]]: 宋子), was a [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] statesman and a [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar and philosopher. Born in [[Okcheon]], [[North Chungcheong]], he was known for his concern with the problems of the common people.  He served in governmental service for more than fifty years, and his name features over 3,000 times in the [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], the greatest frequency that any individual is mentioned. He was executed by the royal court for writing an inflammatory letter to the king.
There is a monument to him in his hometown.
He is also known as the calligrapher who inscribed an epitaph (Chungyeolmyobi Takboncheop) in dedication of Admiral [[Yi Sunsin]], which is preserved at the [[Chungryeolsa]] Shrine (historical site No. 236).

{{Bible-related |studies}}

'''Source criticism''', in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the authors and [[Redaction|redactor]]s of a biblical text.

It originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of [[classical antiquity]] (in particular, [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]]) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as "the [[higher criticism]]", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text and also the religious history of [[ancient Israel]].

== Principles ==
{{see also|redaction criticism|form criticism|tradition history}}

In general, the closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened. In the Bible where a variety of earlier sources have been quoted, the historian seeks to identify and date those sources used by biblical writers as the first step in evaluating their historical reliability.

In other cases, Bible scholars use the way a text is written (changes in style, vocabulary, repetitions, and the like) to determine what sources may have been used by a biblical author. With some reasonable guesswork it is possible to deduce sources not identified as such (e.g., genealogies).  Some inter-biblical sources can be determined by virtue of the fact that the source is still extant, for example, where the [[Books of Chronicles]] quotes or retells the accounts of the books of [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].

== Tanakh ==

Source criticism has been applied to several parts of the [[Tanakh]] (the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament).

=== Documentary Hypothesis ===
{{main|Documentary hypothesis}}
The documentary hypothesis considers the sources for the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Bible), claiming that it derives from four separate sources: the [[Yahwist]], [[Elohist]], [[Deuteronomist]], and [[Priestly source|Priestly]]:

* The Jahwist (J) source is characterized by the use of the name YHWH, has a human-like God, and is especially concerned with the kingdom of Judah. It is thought to have been written c. 950 BCE.
* The Elohist (E) source is characterized with God being called Elohim, and deals more with the kingdom of Israel. It is thought to have been written c. 850 BCE.
* The Deuteronomic (D) source is characterized by a sermon like style mostly concerned with law. It is thought to have been written c. 721-621 BCE.
* The Priestly (P) is characterized by a formal style that is mostly concerned with priestly matters. It is thought to have been written c. 550 BCE.

For example, of the two creation stories at the start of Genesis, the first is ascribed to P, while the second (the creation of Adam and Eve in chapter 2) is ascribed to J.

While the documentary hypothesis has widespread support among biblical scholars, other hypotheses such as the "fragmentary" and "supplementary" have also been proposed{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}.

=== Other cases ===

The writers of the Tanakh sometimes mention sources they use. These include [[Acts of Solomon]] (1 Kings 11:41), [[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]] (1 Kings 14:29 and in a number of other places), [[Chronicles of the Kings of Israel]] (1 Kings 14:19 and in a number of other places), the [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jashar]] (Josh 10:12-14, 2 Sam 1:18-27, and possibly to be restored via textual criticism to 1 Kings 8:12), and [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]] (Num 21:14).

A more complicated and speculative form of source criticism results from critical evaluation of style, vocabulary, reduplication, and discrepancies. An example of this kind of source criticism is found in the book of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] (typically treated by biblical scholars as one book) where scholars identify four types of source material: letters to and from Persian officials, lists of things, the Ezra memoir (where Ezra speaks in first person), and the Nehemiah memoir (where Nehemiah speaks in first person). It is thus deduced that the writer of Ezra-Nehemiah had access to these four kinds of source material in putting together his book.

Source criticism also leads many scholars towards redaction of the [[book of Isaiah]] from original multiple authorship.

==New Testament==
{{See also|Biblical criticism}}
Source criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th-century French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], and its most influential product is [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' (1878), whose "insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies".&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony F. Campbell]], SJ, "[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/9780631210719/perdue.pdf Preparatory Issues in Approaching Biblical Texts]," in ''The Hebrew Bible in Modern Study'', p.6. Campbell renames source criticism as "origin criticism".&lt;/ref&gt; An example of source criticism is the study of the [[Synoptic problem]]. Critics noticed that the three Synoptic Gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], were very similar, indeed, at times identical. The dominant theory to account for the duplication is called the [[two-source hypothesis]]. This suggests that Mark was the first gospel to be written, and that it was probably based on a combination of early oral and written material. Matthew and Luke were written at a later time, and relied primarily on two different sources: Mark and a written collection of Jesus's sayings, which has been given the name [[Q document|Q]] by scholars. This latter document has now been lost, but at least some of its material can be deduced indirectly, namely through the material that is common in Matthew and Luke but absent in Mark. In addition to Mark and Q, the writers of Matthew and Luke made some use of additional sources, which would account for the material that is unique to each of them.

There is general consensus among New Testament scholars that the [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] used a variety of sources, most of them written, and that the authors of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] were dependent on some version of Mark plus a lost collection of "sayings" called the [[Q Document]]. There is less of a consensus that the writers of the [[Gospel of John]] may have used a hypothetical [[Signs Gospel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31820">'''Spiritual evolution''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and/or [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of "'''higher evolution'''", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the "lower" or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a [[creative impulse]] in human beings, known as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;

Within this broad definition, theories of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing development of an individual), or both. They can be [[Holism|holistic]] (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), [[Idealism|idealist]] (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or [[nondual]] (holding that there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality). One can regard all of them as [[teleology|teleological]] to a greater or lesser degree.

Philosophers, scientists, and educators who have proposed theories of spiritual evolution include [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] (1775-1854), [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel | Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[Carl Jung]] (1875-1961), [[Max Théon]] (1848-1927), [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (1831-1891), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859-1941), [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861-1925), [[Sri Aurobindo]] (1872-1950), [[Jean Gebser]] (1905-1973), [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881-1955), [[Owen Barfield]] (1898-1997), [[Arthur M. Young]] (1905-1995), [[Edward Haskell]] (1906-1986), [[E. F. Schumacher]] (1911-1977), [[Erich Jantsch]] (1929-1980), [[Clare W. Graves]] (1914-1986), [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1861-1947), [[Terence McKenna]] (1946-2000), and [[P. R. Sarkar]] (1921-1990). {{As of | 2015}} [[William Irwin Thompson]] (born 1938), [[Victor Skumin]] (born 1948), [[Ken Wilber]] (born 1949), and [[Brian Swimme]] (born 1950) work in this field.

==Precursors to the idea==

===The cyclic cosmos===
[[Mircea Eliade]] has suggested that in many pre-modern cultures one finds the concept of the Fall and a "nostalgia for paradise". However, for those cultures that have a [[Cyclic pattern|cyclic]] cosmology, the concept of a progressive deterioration of the universe (as in the [[Hesiod]]ic, [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic]] cosmologies of a degradation from a [[Golden Age]] to an Iron Age or [[Kali Yuga]]) might be balanced by a corresponding ascent to more spiritual stages and a return to paradisical conditions. This is what one finds in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and especially [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmologies.

===Emanation===
Many premodern cosmologies and [[esoteric]] systems of thought are based on an [[emanation]]ist view of reality. If the Cyclic view is temporal, then emanation is a non-temporal precursor to the theory of spiritual evolution.

According to this paradigm, Creation proceeds as an outpouring or even a transformation in the original [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] or [[Deity|Godhead]]. The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends through a series of stages, gradations, worlds or [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]], becoming progressively more material and embodied, before finally turning around to return to the One, retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge, contemplation and ascent.

A supreme example of this form of thinking is the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]] and his successors. Other examples and interpretations might be found in the Hindu sect of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Tantra]] in general, [[Gnosticism]], [[Sufism]], and [[Kabbalah]]. The [[Hindu]] idea of the [[Chakra]]s might also considered here as the "microcosmic" counterpart of macrocosmic involution and evolution. The Yogi raises the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] or life force through and thus transcends each chakra in turn, until he reaches the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]] and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Avalon, ''The Serpent Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
An early example of the doctrine of spiritual evolution is found in [[Samkhya]], one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, that goes back more than two and a half thousand years (although its present form dates to around the 4th or 5th century c.e.). Unlike most types of classic Hinduism, the traditional Samkhyan philosophy is [[Atheism|atheistic]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]]. Pure spirit (called ''purusha'') comes into proximity with ''prakriti'' (psychophysical nature), disturbing its equilibrium. As a result, the original root-prakriti (''mulaprakriti'') undergoes a series of progressive transformations or unfoldings, in the form of successive essences called ''[[tattva]]s''. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. The goal of evolution however is, paradoxically, the release of purusha and the return to the unmanifest condition. Hence everything is tending towards a goal of spiritual quiescence.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard J. Larson, (1979) ''Classical Samkhya'' (Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 2nd. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The great chain of being===
The concept of the [[great chain of being]] developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] whose ideas were taken up and synthesised by Plotinus. Plotinus in turn heavily influenced [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s theology, and from there [[Aquinas]] and the Scholastics. The Great Chain of Being was an important theme in [[Renaissance]] and [[Elizabethan]] thought, had an under-acknowledged influence on the shaping of the ideas of [[the Enlightenment]] and played a large part in the worldview of 18th century Europe. And while essentially a static worldview, by the 18th and early 19th century it had been "temporalized" by the concept of the [[soul]] ascending or progressing spiritually through the successive rungs or stages, and thus growing or evolving closer to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936), ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1936, 1961, 1970). {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had at this time an impact on theories of biological evolution.

[[E. F. Schumacher]], author of ''Small is Beautiful'', has recently proposed a sort of simplified Great Chain of Being, based on the idea of four "[[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]" (mineral, vegetable, animal, human).&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Schumacher (1977), ''A Guide for the Perplexed'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row) {{ISBN|0-06-090611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher rejects modernist and scientific themes, his approach recalling the universalist orientation of writers like [[Huston Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Huston Smith (1976), ''Forgotten Truth: The Common Vision of the World's Religions'', (New York: Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-250787-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likely contributing to Ken Wilber's "holonomic" hierarchy or "Great Nest of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber (1996) ''A Brief History of Everything'', (Boston &amp; London: Shambhala Publications, 2nd edition, 2000), {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Buddhism and evolution}}

The concept of spiritual evolution has been taught in [[Buddhism]]. [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] - a [[physician]] and Buddhist - attempted to merge [[biology]] with [[spirituality]]. He accepted the existence of both material and spiritual realms, and many of his ideas were discussed in his book ''Buddhism and Immortality'' (1908). Bigelow used the concept of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]]. According to the author, spiritual evolution involves an individual emerging from "unconditioned consciousness" and moving "up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection". Then the individual moves to a level of celestial experience, and finally is able to "return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge". Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution and he also believed that Buddhism and [[science]] were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;American encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912: Victorian culture &amp; the limits of dissent, Thomas A. Tweed, 2000, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Low]] a [[Zen master]] and author of ''The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution'' (2008) opposes [[neo-Darwinism]] and the [[selfish gene theory]] as he claims they are [[materialistic]]. He also opposes [[creationism]] for being dogmatic and instead advocates spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Low, The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution, Sussex Academic Pr, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84519-260-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]], spiritual evolution is equivalent with the development of the three bodies of [[Trikaya]].

==Occult concepts==
Theories of spiritual evolution are important in many [[Occult]] and [[Esotericism|Esoteric]] teachings, which emphasise the progression and development of the individual either after death ([[spiritualism]]) or through successive [[reincarnation]]s ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Hermeticism]]).

===Spiritualism===
{{details|Spiritualism}}

Spiritualists reacted with uncertainty to the theories of [[evolution]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, a belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if man had not been created, it was scarcely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Anglo-American [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]] ideas emphasized the progression of the soul after death to higher states of existence, in contrast to [[Spiritism]] which admits to reincarnation.

Spiritualism taught that after death, spirits progressed to new spheres of existence. According to this idea, evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favorable to growth” than encountered on earth.&lt;ref name="Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270"&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biologist]] and spiritualist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913) believed that qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular, the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial]] origin for the higher mental faculties of humans. He believed that evolution suggested the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. In a 1909 magazine article entitled ''The World of Life'', which he later expanded into a book of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Broom]] in his book ''The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?'' (1933) claimed that "spiritual agencies" had guided [[evolution]] as [[animals]] and [[plants]] were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and [[psychics]] are capable of seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in the early-twentieth-century Britain, Peter J. Bowler, 2001, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of [[Homo sapiens]] is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom "Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;Bones of contention: controversies in the search for human origins, Roger Lewin, 1997, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-American position recalls (and is presumably inspired by) 18th century concepts regarding the temporalization of The Great Chain of Being. Spiritual evolution, rather than being a physical (or physico-spiritual) process is based on the idea of realms or stages through which the soul or spirit passes in a non-temporal, qualitative way. This is still an important part of some spiritualist ideas today, and is similar to some mainline (as opposed to [[fundamentalist]]) [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] beliefs, according to which after death the person goes to "summerland" (see [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit world]])

===Theosophical conceptions===
{{See also|Theosophy and science#Theosophical evolutionism}}
[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] presents a more sophisticated and complex cosmology than Spiritualism, although coming out of the same general milieu. [[H. P. Blavatsky]] developed a highly original cosmology, according to which the human race (both collectively and through the succession of individual reincarnation and spiritual evolution) passes through a number of [[Root Race]]s, beginning with the huge ethereal and mindless Polarian or First Root Race, through the Lemurian (3rd), Atlantean (4th) and our present "Aryan" 5th Race. This will give rise to a future, Post-Aryan 6th Root Race of highly spiritual and enlightened beings that will arise in [[Baja California]] in the 28th century, and an even more sublime 7th Root Race, before ascending to totally superhuman and cosmic states of existence.

Blavatsky's ideas were further developed by her successors, such as [[C.W. Leadbeater]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Alice Bailey]], [[Benjamin Creme]], and [[Victor Skumin]] each of whom went into huge detail in constructing baroque cycles of rounds, races, and sub-races. Skumin elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution, he proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), [[Root race#the sixth root race|the sixth root race]], consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V. A. |script-title=ru: Человек духовный: роль культуры духовного здоровья в утверждении новой человеческой расы на планете |trans-title=Spiritual man: The role of the Culture of spiritual health for approval of the new human race on the planet |year=1996 |publisher=theeuropeanlibrary.org |url= http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/3000010564370?query=%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80+%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD+ |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-012-4 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including elements of the science of her day as well as both eastern and western esoteric thought, Blavatsky rejected the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] idea that man evolved from apes, and most subsequent esotericists followed this lead. Darwinism, with its explanation of evolution through material factors like [[natural selection]] and random mutation, does not sit well with many spiritual evolutionists, for whom evolution is initiated or guided by metaphysical principles or is tending towards a [[Teleology|final spiritual or divine state]].  It is believed by Theosophists that humans are evolving ''spiritually'' through a series of esoteric [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]] and in the future humans will become esoteric [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]] themselves as their [[soul]]s gradually rise upward through the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|spiritual hierarchy]] over the course of eons as they reincarnate.

Despite this, recent Theosophists and [[Anthroposophy|Anthroposophists]] have tried to incorporate the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy [[Hermann Poppelbaum]] is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with [[Gondwana]]land, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential.  Theosophy-like teachings also continue today in a group of religions based on Theosophy called the [[Ascended Master Teachings]].

===Theurgy===
[[Theurgy]] has a clear relationship to [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Kabbalah]] and contains the concept of spiritual evolution{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and ultimately unification with [[God]] or the [[Deity|Godhead]] at its core. Theurgy is considered by many to be another term for high magic and is known to have influenced the members of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] many of whom considered the order to be Theurgic in nature. [[Aleister Crowley]] also considered his [[Thelemic]] system of magical philosophy to be a Theurgic tradition as it emphasized the [[Great Work]], which is essentially another form of spiritual evolution. The Great Work is believed to result in communication with one's personal [[angel]] or [[higher self]].

==Epigenesis==
Epigenesis is the [[philosophical]]/[[theology|theological]]/[[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] idea that since the [[mind]] was given to the human being, it is the original creative impulse, epigenesis, which has been the cause of all of [[Human|mankind]]'s development.

According to spiritual evolution, humans build upon that which has already been created, but add new elements because of the activity of the spirit.  Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligences&amp;mdash;[[Creativity|creators]]. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from [[imitation]]. When epigenesis becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and [[degeneration]] commences.

This concept is based on the [[Rosicrucian]] view of the world as a training school, which posits that while mistakes are made in life, humans often learn more from mistakes than successes.  Suffering is considered as merely the result of error, and the impact of suffering on the [[consciousness]] causes humans to be active along other lines which are found to be [[Goodness and value theory|good]], in [[harmony]] with [[nature]]. Humans are seen as spirits attending the school of life for the purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, developing themselves from ''impotence'' to [[omnipotence]] (related also to development from [[innocence]] into [[virtue]]), reaching the stage of creative gods at the end of mankind's present evolution: ''Great Day of Manifestation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]], ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]: Involution, Evolution and Epigenesis'', November 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}} [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng14.htm#par67 www]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution towards Godhead==

===A common vision===
[[Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] both describe a progression from inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin refers to this as the [[Omega Point]], and Sri Aurobindo as the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977) ''The Life Divine'', (Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust), {{ISBN|0-941524-62-0}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-941524-61-2}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1955), ''The Phenomenon of Man'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-090495-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teilhard de Chardin===
Teilhard, who was a [[Jesuit]] [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] who played an important role in the discovery of [[Peking Man]], presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development of the [[biosphere]] and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the [[noosphere]] as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with [[Christ]].

===Meher Baba's "involution"===
[[Meher Baba]] has used the term [[God Speaks#Involution|involution]] to describe the inner journey of consciousness after transcending the physical or gross state up to the attainment of Self-consciousness, or merging with God. According to Meher Baba, the consciousness of the soul in duality first goes through the long process of evolution of form, then, upon reaching the human form, consciousness enters the process of ''reincarnation'', and finally reaches the process of ''involution'', which culminates in ''[[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]]''.

==Surat Shabda Yoga==
[[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] [[esoteric cosmology]] depicts the whole of creation (the [[macrocosm]]) as being [[Emanationism|emanated]] and arranged in a spiritually differentiated hierarchy, often referred to as eggs, regions, or [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. Typically, eight spiritual levels are described above the physical plane, although names and subdivisions within these levels will vary to some extent by mission and Master. (One version of the creation from a Surat Shabda Yoga perspective is depicted at the Sant Ajaib Singh Ji Memorial Site in [http://www.santji.allegre.ca/planes-640.jpg “The Grand Scheme of All Creation”].)

The constitution of the individual (the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) is an exact replica of the macrocosm. Consequently, the microcosm consists of a number of [[Subtle body|bodies]], each one suited to interact with its corresponding plane or region in the macrocosm. These bodies developed over the [[yuga]]s through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]] ([[Emanationism|emanating]] from higher planes to lower planes) and evolution (returning from lower planes to higher planes), including by [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] in various [[altered state of consciousness|states]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Holtje (1995) ''[http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm From Light to Sound: The Spiritual Progression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105042502/http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm |date=2005-11-05 }}''. Temecula, CA: MasterPath, Inc. {{ISBN|1-885949-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic evolution through successive kingdoms==
[[Arthur M. Young]] and [[Edward Haskell]] have each independently incorporated the findings of science into a larger theory of spiritual evolution, and extended the traditional human, animal, vegetable, and mineral categories with kingdoms representing [[photon]]s, [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name=young76&gt;Arthur M. Young (1976), ''The Reflexive Universe&amp;nbsp;– Evolution of Consciousness'' (Delacorte Press), {{ISBN|0-440-05924-0}}; Anodos Foundation 1999 revised edition, {{ISBN|1-892160-11-0}} (paperback), {{ISBN|1-892160-10-2}} (hardcover) see diagram pp.86-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Haskell (1972) ''[http://www.synearth.net/Haskell/FC/ Full Circle; the Moral Force of Unified Science]'', ed. by Edward Haskell (Gordon and Breach, New York, London &amp; Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Young goes further in considering the human state as a subset of a larger kingdom of "Dominion", of which the sixth stage is represented for example by Christ and Buddha, and the seventh (final) stage an even higher level of Enlightenment or God-realisation.&lt;ref name=young76/&gt; Moreover, both Haskell and Young present profound accounts of evolution through these kingdoms in terms of [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] principles. A more "mainstream" scientific presentation of this same idea is provided by [[Erich Jantsch]] in his account of how self-organising systems evolve and develop as a series of "[[symmetry breaking|symmetry break]]s" through the sequence of matter, life, and mind.&lt;ref name="jantsch"&gt;Erich Jantsch (1980), The Self Organizing Universe&amp;nbsp;– Scientific and Human Implication of the Emerging Paradigm of Evolution (New York: Pergamon), {{ISBN|0-08-024312-6}}, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; Although abiding strictly by the understanding of science, Jantsch arranges the various elements of cosmic, planetary, biological, psychological, and human evolution in a single overall framework of [[emergent evolution]] that may or may not be considered teleological.&lt;ref name=jantsch/&gt;

==New Age ideas==
[[New Age]] thought is strongly syncretic. A common theme is the evolution or the transcendence of the human or collective planetary consciousness in a higher state or higher "vibratory" (a metaphor taken from [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]) level.

David Spangler's communications speak of a "New Heaven and a new Earth", while [[Christopher Hills]] refers (perhaps influenced by Sri Aurobindo) to
the divinization of man.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hills (1977) ''Nuclear Evolution&amp;nbsp;– Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (university of Trees Press, Boulder Creek, CA) 2nd ed. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' narrated the idea of evolution in a fascinating fashion. [[James Redfield]] in his novel ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'' suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware of the connection between our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book ''God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution'' (2002) co-written with [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], he claims that humanity is on the verge of undergoing a change in [[higher consciousness|consciousness]].

==Integral theory and spiral dynamics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
An interpretation of social and psychological development that could also be considered a theory of spiritual evolution is [[spiral dynamics]], based on the work of [[Clare W. Graves]].

More recently the concept of spiritual evolution has been given a sort of respectability it has not had since the early 19th century through the work of the [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theorist]] [[Ken Wilber]], in whose writings both the cosmological and the personal dimensions are described. In this [[Integral movement|integral philosophy]] (inspired in part by the works of Plotinus, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Eric Jantsch, and many others) reality is said to consist of several realms or stages, including more than one of the following: the physical, the vital, the psychic, (after the Greek ''psyche'', "soul"), the causal (referring to "that which causes, or gives rise to, the manifest world"), and the ultimate (or non-dual), through which the individual progressively evolves. Although this schema is derived in large part from [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Wilber argues (and uses many tables of diagrams to show) that these same levels of being are common to all wisdom teachings. Described simplistically, Wilber sees humans developing through several stages, including [[Magic and religion|magic]], [[mythology|mythic]], pluralistic, and [[holism|holistic]] mentalities. But he also sees cultures as developing through these stages. And, much like Hegel, he sees this development of individuals and cultures ''as'' the evolution of existence itself. Wilber has also teamed up with [[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]] to integrate Spiral Dynamics into his own Integral philosophy, and vice versa. Spiral Dynamics posits a series of stages through which human's cultural development progresses&amp;nbsp;– from a survival-based hunter-gatherer stage to a magical-tribal-agrarian stage to a city-building-invading stage to a mythic-religious-empire stage to a rational-scientific-capitalist stage to a green-holistic-inclusive stage and then ascending to a second tier where all the previous stages are contemplated and integrated and a third transpersonal tier where a spiritual unity or Omega point is eventually reached, which all the other stages are struggling to embody. He feels that individuals in each of the meme-plexes/stages can ascend to the peak of consciousness&amp;nbsp;– these being the prophets, visionaries and leaders of any region/age.

'''Susan Moller Okin''' (July 19, 1946 – March 3, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march10/obitokin-310.html "Okin, feminist political thinker, dies"]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[liberal feminist]] [[political philosopher]] and author.

== Life ==

Okin was born in 1946 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and attended Remuera Primary School, [[Remuera Intermediate]] and [[Epsom Girls' Grammar School]], where she was Dux in 1963.

She earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Auckland]] in 1966, a master of philosophy degree from Oxford in 1970 and a doctorate from Harvard in 1975.

She taught at the University of Auckland, Vassar, [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] and Harvard before joining Stanford's faculty.

Okin became the [[Marta Sutton Weeks]] Professor of Ethics in Society at [[Stanford University]] in 1990.

Okin held a visiting professorship at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at the time of her death in 2004.

Okin was found dead in her home in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]] on March 3, 2004. She was 57 years old. The cause of death is still unknown, but authorities do not believe there was any foul play.

== Works ==

In 1979 she published ''Women in Western Political Thought'', in which she details the history of the perceptions of women in western political philosophy.

Her 1989 book ''Justice, Gender, and the Family'' is a critique of modern theories of justice.  These theories include the [[liberalism]] of [[John Rawls]], the [[libertarianism]] of [[Robert Nozick]], and the [[communitarianism]] of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Michael Walzer]]. For each theorist's major work she argues that a foundational assumption is incorrect because of a faulty perception of gender or family relations.  More broadly, according to Okin, these theorists write from a male perspective that wrongly assumes that the institution of the family is just.  She believes that the family perpetuates gender inequalities throughout all of society, particularly because children acquire their values and ideas in the family's [[sexism|sexist]] setting, then grow up to enact these ideas as adults.  If a [[theory of justice]] is to be complete, Okin asserts that it must include women and it must address the gender inequalities she believes are prevalent in modern-day families.

In 1993, with [[Jane Mansbridge]], she summarized much of her own and others' work in the article on "Feminism," in Robert E. Goodin and Philip Petit, eds., A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, 269-290, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1993), and the next year, also with Mansbridge, published a two-volume collection of feminist writing, entitled  Feminism (schools of thought in politics).[Aldershot, England and Brookfield, Vermont, USA: E. Elgar. {{ISBN|9781852785659}}].

In her 1999 essay, later expanded into an anthology, "Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?" Okin argues that a concern for the preservation of cultural diversity should not overshadow the discriminatory nature of gender roles in many traditional minority cultures, that, at the very least, "culture" should not be used as an excuse for rolling back the women's rights movement.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exegesis ===
* Commandment 1
*: Simply put: Do not use the computer in ways that may harm other people.
*: Explanation: This commandment says that it is unethical to use a computer to harm another user. It is not limited to physical injury. It includes harming or corrupting other users' data or files. The commandment states that it is wrong to use a computer to steal someone's personal information. Manipulating or destroying files of other users is ethically wrong. It is unethical to write programs, which on execution lead to stealing, copying or gaining unauthorized access to other users' data. Being involved in practices like hacking, spamming, phishing or cyber bullying does not conform to computer ethics.
* Commandment 2
*: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to cause interference in other users' work.
*: Explanation: Computer software can be used in ways that disturb other users or disrupt their work. Viruses, for example, are programs meant to harm useful computer programs or interfere with the normal functioning of a computer. Malicious software can disrupt the functioning of computers in more ways than one. It may overload computer memory through excessive consumption of computer resources, thus slowing its functioning. It may cause a computer to function wrongly or even stop working. Using malicious software to attack a computer is unethical.
* Commandment 3
*: Simply put: Do not spy on another person's computer data.
*: Explanation: We know it is wrong to read someone's personal letters. On the same lines, it is wrong to read someone else's email messages or files. Obtaining data from another person's private files is nothing less than breaking into someone's room. Snooping around in another person's files or reading someone else's personal messages is the invasion of his privacy. There are exceptions to this. For example, spying is necessary and cannot be called unethical when it is done against illegitimate use of computers. For example, intelligence agencies working on cybercrime cases need to spy on the internet activity of suspects.
* Commandment 4
*: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to steal information.
*: Explanation: Stealing sensitive information or leaking confidential information is as good as robbery. It is wrong to acquire personal information of employees from an employee database or patient history from a hospital database or other such information that is meant to be confidential. Similarly, breaking into a bank account to collect information about the account or account holder is wrong. Illegal electronic transfer of funds is a type of fraud. With the use of technology, stealing of information is much easier. Computers can be used to store stolen information.
* Commandment 5
*: Simply put: Do not contribute to the spread of misinformation using computer technology.
*: Explanation: Spread of information has become viral today, because of the Internet. This also means that false news or rumors can spread speedily through social networking sites or emails. Being involved in the circulation of incorrect information is unethical. Mails and pop-ups are commonly used to spread the wrong information or give false alerts with the only intent of selling products. Mails from untrusted sources advertising certain products or spreading some hard-to-believe information, are not uncommon. Direct or indirect involvement in the circulation of false information is ethically wrong. Giving wrong information can hurt other parties or organizations that are affected by that particular theme.
* Commandment 6
*: Simply put: Refrain from copying software or buying pirated copies. Pay for software unless it is free.
*: Explanation: Like any other artistic or literary work, software is copyrighted. A piece of code is the original work of the individual who created it. It is copyrighted in his/her name. In case of a developer writing software for the organization she works for, the organization holds the copyright for it. Copyright holds true unless its creators announce it is not. Obtaining illegal copies of copyrighted software is unethical and also encourages others to make copies illegally.
* Commandment 7
*: Simply put: Do not use someone else's computer resources unless authorized to.
*: Explanation: Multi-user systems have user specific passwords. Breaking into some other user's password, thus intruding his/her private space is unethical. It is not ethical to hack passwords for gaining unauthorized access to a password-protected computer system. Accessing data that you are not authorized to access or gaining access to another user's computer without her permission is not ethical.
* Commandment 8
*: Simply put: It is wrong to claim ownership on a work which is the output of someone else's intellect.
*: Explanation: Programs developed by a software developer are her property. If he is working with an organization, they are the organization's property. Copying them and propagating them in one's own name is unethical. This applies to any creative work, program or design. Establishing ownership on a work which is not yours is ethically wrong. 
* Commandment 9
*: Simply put: Before developing a software, think about the social impact it can have.
*: Explanation: Looking at the social consequences that a program can have, describes a broader perspective of looking at technology. A computer software on release, reaches millions. Software like video games and animations or educational software can have a social impact on their users. When working on animation films or designing video games, for example, it is the programmer's responsibility to understand his target audience/users and the effect it may have on them. For example, a computer game for kids should not have content that can influence them negatively. Similarly, writing malicious software is ethically wrong. A software developer/development firm should consider the influence their code can have on the society at large.
* Commandment 10
*: Simply put: In using computers for communication, be respectful and courteous with the fellow members.
*: Explanation: The communication etiquette we follow in the real world applies to communication over computers as well. While communicating over the Internet, one should treat others with respect. One should not intrude others' private space, use abusive language, make false statements or pass irresponsible remarks about others. One should be courteous while communicating over the web and should respect others' time and resources. Also, one should be considerate with a novice computer user.

'''''The Abolition of Britain: From Lady Chatterley to Tony Blair''''' (reissued in 2018 with the subtitle '''''From Winston Churchill to Theresa May'''''; US subtitle: '''''From Winston Churchill to Princess Diana''''') is the first book by British [[Traditionalist conservatism|conservative]] journalist [[Peter Hitchens]], published in 1999. It examines a period of perceived moral and cultural reform between the 1960s and [[Labour Party (UK)#"New Labour"|New Labour]]'s [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election win]]. Hitchens asserts that the reforms facilitated vast and radical constitutional change under [[Tony Blair]]'s new government that amounted to a "slow motion coup d'état".&lt;ref name="Hitchens-343"&gt;{{harvnb |Hitchens|2000| p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was cited by Gillian Bowditch in ''[[The Times]]'' as being a major modern work to dissect "the decline in British morals and manners over the past 50 years",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6898037.ece Gillian Bowditch: Why we all miss the kind, strong male]&lt;/ref&gt; and identified by [[Andrew Marr]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' as "the most sustained, internally logical and powerful attack on Tony Blair and all his works".&lt;ref&gt;1999 Andrew Marr review of ''The Abolition of Britain''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's later book ''[[The Broken Compass]]'' explored the same themes, applied to socio-political events and culture in the 2000s decade.

==Synopsis==
''The Abolition of Britain'' is a conservative polemic against the changes in the United Kingdom since the mid-1960s. It contrasts the funerals of [[Winston Churchill]] (1965) and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] (1997), using these two related but dissimilar events, three decades apart, to illustrate the enormous cultural changes that took place in the intervening period. His argument is that Britain underwent a "[[cultural revolution]]", comparable to that of China in the 1960s. He describes and criticises the growing strength of such forces as [[multiculturalism]], which still had a liberal consensus behind it at the time the book was written. He argues that [[Education in England|English schools]] had largely ceased to teach the history of the country or the literature of Britain's past, criticising the preference for methodology in history teaching.

Other changes gain Hitchens's attention, from the passivity and [[conformity|conformism]] resulting from the watching of television to the [[Church of England]]'s rejection of its traditional [[liturgy]] and [[scripture]]. [[Sex education]], he argues, is a form of propaganda against [[Christian sexual morality]]. Again, the [[sexual revolution]] brought about by the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first contraceptive pills]] was the result "not of accidental discovery, but of research deliberately pursued by moral revolutionaries". He describes the efforts made to provide respectability for unmarried motherhood, not least the campaign to replace the expression "unmarried mother" with "single parent", thus lumping together those who had children out of wedlock with widowers, widows or deserted wives and husbands, and so deflecting disapproval. Hitchens sees the British establishment as being morally weak in their failure to resist the emerging [[drug culture]], when they could easily have done so in the mid-1960s. He cites as one example the prosecution of [[Mick Jagger]] and the subsequent intervention of ''[[The Times]]'' in Jagger's defence in 1967 ("[[Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?]]") after his (temporary) conviction.

One chapter analyses the use of TV and radio soap operas to spread liberal cultural and moral propaganda, and refers to several instances where this intention has been openly expressed by the editors and authors of such programmes. In another, he attacks the development of "anti-establishment" comedy since the staging of ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1960. For Hitchens, the development of television, citing with approval a critical letter by [[T. S. Eliot]] to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950, was something which should have led to a greater public debate than it did. In particular, Hitchens criticises the easy capture of the Conservative Party by lobbyists for [[ITV Network|commercial TV]], which removed the [[BBC]]'s monopoly power to defend cultural standards. He argues that the introduction of colour television, which made even the bad programmes look good, greatly increased the influence of TV over the public mind.

He identifies the then [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Roy Jenkins]] as a highly-effective campaigner for "cultural revolution". He describes the [[R v Penguin Books Ltd.|Lady Chatterley trial]], describing what he calls "myths" about it, and argues that the defence of literary merit, created by the Jenkins-backed [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|Obscene Publications Act]] of 1959, eventually came to be used to allow the publication of books and periodicals which had none at all. He examines Jenkins's use of cross-party alliances and, what he sees as supposed [[Private Members' Bills]], to achieve his programme. These legislative changes had not been mentioned in the 1964 or 1966 election Labour Party manifestos, and Hitchens develops his argument by drawing on proposals Jenkins had made in the last chapter of his short book ''The Labour Case'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Jenkins]], ''The Labour Case'' (Harmonsdworth: Penguin, 1959), pp. 135-140&lt;/ref&gt; He cites warnings made by those who opposed the abolition of capital punishment, and claims that those warnings have largely proved to be correct. For Hitchens this is an example of the political elite working against the desires of the public. Hitchens's view is sustained, in the case of capital punishment, by the historian [[Dominic Sandbrook]], in his history of what he calls the ''White Heat'' of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominic Sandbrook]], ''White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties'' (London: Little, Brown, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0316724524}}), p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; using contemporaneous opinion poll data. Hitchens went on to explore this issue in more detail in his book ''[[A Brief History of Crime]]''.

A chapter in ''The Abolition of Britain'' on the contrast between the public health policies on lung cancer and the public health policies on AIDS was left out of the first edition of the book, after Hitchens was advised that airing thoughts critical of [[Homosexuality|homosexual acts]] would bring such criticism on it that it would distract attention from the book's main message. It was reinstated in the paperback and American editions, with an explanatory preface. Hitchens elaborated that the [[morality of homosexuality]] itself was tangential to his main argument. He wrote that British society's unwillingness to criticize [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] among gay, bisexual, and straight men alike despite the ill after-effects stands in direct hypocritical contrast to government action against drug use.

Hitchens argues that damaging moral and cultural effects on Britain occurred from the presence of huge numbers of [[United States Army|U.S. troops]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He also laments the cultural impact of [[American English|American usage]] of the English language in Britain itself. For Hitchens, the major failing of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] governments was the absence of a decidedly conservative stance over cultural and moral matters.

==Critical reception==

The book received considerable attention in the British media upon its publication, and was also reviewed in a number of US newspapers.

The book's reception in Britain was mixed. In a scathing review in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Polly Toynbee]] mocked the book. She noted that the author "evokes the Britain of my own childhood, of the 50s and 60s, with a deadly accurate pen", but because of this factor, the book is "a joyful read for liberals. Most of it is given over to eulogies about the past that have precisely the opposite effect of the one intended".&lt;ref&gt;[[Polly Toynbee]], [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/aug/25/labour.labour1997to992 "How Hague loses the plot – and the battle over Europe"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' 25 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other British reviewers were more positive in their assessments. [[Mary Kenny]] in the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' considered it "a series of knowledgeable and perceptive linked essays in the tradition of George Orwell".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Kenny]], [http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/27th-august-1999/4/the-anti-conservative-culture "The anti-conservative culture"], ''[[Catholic Herald]]'', 27 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Horace Ragnar Colvin|John Colvin]], writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' thought the "barren times" in which we live "have found their ideal chronicler" who "in this clear and uninhibited work, reminds us of the tyranny of the new" and that "it is difficult to contradict his belief that a great nation seems almost to have vanished, its traditions mocked and enfeebled".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Horace Ragnar Colvin|John Colvin]], [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/135747 "Beast in view"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 27 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[John Redwood]] wrote that he was "exhilarated" by the book, and that Hitchens had written with "passion and flair". Redwood added that Hitchens was at his best when "exposing the way in which our educational system and cultural standards have been systematically undermined".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_199909/ai_n8864377 "Presenting the past as another place"] review in ''[[The Spectator]]'', 11 September 1999 by [[John Redwood]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also writing in ''The Spectator'', [[Peregrine Worsthorne]] was more circumspect: "after eloquently telling the tale of how successive British parliamentary governments, Tory as much as Labour, have 'abolished' old Britain, Hitchens reaches the wholly illogical conclusion that that same British democracy alone is quite capable of putting the clock back".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peregrine Worsthorne]], [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/4th-september-1999/27/as-i-was-saying "As I Was Saying: Only a federal Europe can stop the abolition of Britain"], ''The Spectator'', 3 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that Hitchens was wrong to hold [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] views.

[[Alan Cowell]], in a mostly critical review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', stated "in the 1950s and 60s, Britain was a gentler, more deferential place; the churches were better attended; children did give up their bus seats to adults; and a generation was nurtured on a history of wartime victory and imperial grandeur that had yet to be derided as myth or oppression". However, Cowell questioned the "[[Cnut the Great|Canute]]-like subtext" of the book that "the destructive forces of television, McDonald's and American popular culture could have been held back".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4D6103CF934A25751C1A9669C8B63 "Will There Always Be One?"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' review by [[Alan Cowell]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', another US publication, [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] wrote that "at its best this book combines superb reporting (especially about the hijacking of education by frustrated leftists) with a heartbreaking analysis of one of the strangest revolutions in history. And in many ways it is the most important of the torrent of books that have dealt with the crisis of British identity". However, Foreman added that the book suffered from "cranky fogeyism", and he was particularly critical of both the chapter analysing the Chatterley trial and the premise that satirical television and radio programmes of the late 1950s and early 1960s contributed towards destroying British national unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanforeman.com/britainbattle.html "The Battle of Britain – Is the sun setting on the United Kingdom?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108092237/http://www.jonathanforeman.com/britainbattle.html |date=8 January 2006 }} review in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' (US) 12 March 2001 by [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The book was first published in Britain by Quartet Books in 1999 ({{ISBN|0-7043-8117-6}}), and then in a revised edition the following year. The volume was published in North America by [[Encounter Books]] in 2000 ({{ISBN|1-893554-18-X}}). It was reissued in the UK by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] in 2008, with a new introduction by the author ({{ISBN|1847065228}}). The book is subtitled "From Lady Chatterley to Tony Blair" in its British editions and "From Winston Churchill to Princess Diana" in its US editions. Hitchens has commented that it proved extremely difficult to get ''The Abolition of Britain'' published and into bookshops.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens refers to this at the end of [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080604/PETER-HITCHENS-Not-Kim-Jong-II-live-visit-Mandy.html this article]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reissued with the altered subtitle "From Winston Churchill to Theresa May" in August 2018 by [[Bloomsbury Continuum]], with a new afterword by the author ({{ISBN|9781472959928}}).&lt;ref name="reissue-blog-2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peter |first1=Hitchens |title=How Can you Tell That a Country has Died? |url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2018/08/how-can-you-tell-that-a-country-has-died-.html |website=hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk |publisher=Mail on Sunday |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reissue-2018-bloomsbury"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Abolition of Britain |url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-abolition-of-britain-9781472959928/ |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishers |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Morals of Chess''''' is an essay on [[chess]] by the American intellectual [[Benjamin Franklin]], which was first published in ''The Columbian Magazine'' in December 1786. 

Franklin, who was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], played chess from at least 1733. Evidence suggests that he was an above-average player, who, however, did not reach the top level. He outlined the essay around 1732, but did not publish it until 1786. After a short prologue in which Franklin details the history of chess he gets to the main part of his essay. He compares chess to life and writes that foresight, circumspection and caution can be learnt from the game. After describing the effects chess can have on one's perception of life he describes a set of moral rules that a chess player should hold, including to not cheat and not disturb the opponent. Franklin suggests that the opponent be told about mistakes he makes, for example if he would lose a piece.

The essay is one of the first texts about chess that was published in the United States; it appeared in the first chess-related book that was published in Russia in 1791. It still is widely reproduced, especially on the Internet. In 1999 Franklin was inducted into the [[World Chess Hall of Fame|U.S. Chess Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;John McCrary: [http://www.benfranklin300.org/_etc_pdf/Chess_John_McCrary.pdf ''Chess and Benjamin Franklin—his pioneering contributions''], including the full text of ''The Morals of Chess''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Why Courage Matters: The Way to a Braver Life''''' is a 2004 book by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John McCain]] with his frequent collaborator and aide [[Mark Salter]].  Published by [[Random House]], it is mostly mini-biographies and mini-commentaries on others, but contains a small autobiographical element.

The book followed McCain's two memoirs, ''[[Faith of My Fathers]]'' (1999) and ''[[Worth the Fighting For]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name=pw&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4000-6030-6 Book review, Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; McCain starts by saying that in contemporary usage people talk too loosely in characterizing acts as being courageous - it should be not only "the capacity for action despite our fears" but also involve a physical self-sacrifice for the benefit of others.&lt;ref name=pw/&gt; He says that during his time as a POW in North Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]], he relied on his fellow POWs for moral support but "I was not always a match for my enemies."&lt;ref name=pw/&gt; In press interviews for the book, McCain said that courage materializes when "our fear is overcome by our conscience and our beliefs and forces us to act."&lt;ref name=npr&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1835325 John McCain: 'Why Courage Matters', NPR&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the book consists of his portraits of people, both leaders and ordinary people, he thinks have shown courage.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-courage-matters/ CBS News interview&lt;/ref&gt; The book starts with the story of U.S. Special Forces soldier [[Roy Benavidez]], who won the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=127899&amp;page=1 Excerpt: 'Why Courage Matters', ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; Others whose stories are in the book include American civil rights leader [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], American Indian chiefs [[Manuelito]] and [[Barboncito]], explorer [[John Wesley Powell]], Jewish resistance fighter [[Hannah Szenes]], Burmese dissident [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Baltimore anti-drugs-crime mass murder victim [[Dawson murder case|Angela Dawson]],  and U.S. Korean War soldier and Medal of Honor recipient [[Mitchell Red Cloud, Jr.]].&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; 
McCain then relates how courage is needed in the aftermath of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;

In a review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said that "These compelling life stories stand up against the best passages of McCain's previous works. Alas, his writing becomes more vague and less interesting when he shifts to a more abstract discussion of the need for courage in the post–September 11 era."&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;
''[[Booklist Review]]'' said "The authors draw thoughtful lessons about the sources and types of courage and the importance of facing down fear, particularly in a world defined by color-coded terrorism alerts."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1672431/Reviews Collection of library-focused review excerpts, Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Library Journal Review]]'' said that "Unfortunately, though [McCain's] message comes through loud and clear, the steps one must take to increase one's courage are not as clearly outlined as one would hope."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt;
A ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' review said that "McCain's blunt talk and raw honesty provide a dose of reality for the nation at this critical time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/03/21/news_pf/Columns/McCain_vs_the_merchan.shtml McCain vs. the merchants of fear]&lt;/ref&gt;

McCain appeared in media interviews to promote the book.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;
The book was not the major commercial success ''Faith of My Fathers'' had been, nor the lesser best seller that ''Worth the Fighting For'' had been. It did not appear on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawes.com/2004/2004.htm Adult ''New York Times'' Best Seller Lists for 2004 shows nothing for it looking at each entry April onward&lt;/ref&gt;

''Why Courage Matters'' was published in [[paperback]] by [[Ballantine Books]] on July 15, 2008, at the height of the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Courage-Matters-Braver-Life/dp/0345513347&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was mentioned during the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], when politically embattled parent [[Khizr and Ghazala Khan|Khizr Khan]] said he mailed a copy of it to his U.S. Army son [[Humayun Khan (soldier)|Humayun Khan]] shortly before he was killed during the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs5az.com/story/32766122/gold-star-father-asks-mccain-to-dump-trump?clienttype=mobile Gold Star father asks McCain to dump Trump, CBS 5 News&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7738">'''Wolfgang Drechsler''' (born June 6, 1963 in [[Marburg]], [[West Germany]]) is a Public Administration and Management, [[Innovation]] Policy and [[Political Philosophy]] scholar. He is Professor of [[Governance]], and one of the founders and directors of the [[Technology Governance]] program, at the [[Tallinn University of Technology]], [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], where between 2010 and 2016 he also served as Vice Dean for International Relations at its Faculty of Social Sciences. Since 2017, he is also affiliated with [[Harvard University]], as a [[Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies|Davis Center]] Associate and a member of the center’s Advisory Board, 

Drechsler holds degrees from [[Bridgewater College]], the [[University of Virginia]], the [[University of Marburg]], and the [http://www.hfv-speyer.de/ENGL/ German Post-Graduate School of Public Administration] [[Speyer]]. Between 1993 and 2006, he was [[Professor]] of [[Public Administration]] and [[Government]] at the [[University of Tartu]]. Before coming to Estonia, and during this time, he taught at Universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[University of Giessen|Giessen]], and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt am Main]], all Germany. He was Visiting Professor of [[Sociology]] in [[Lund University|Lund]], [[Sweden]], in 1997, of [[Governance]] at the [[University of Erfurt]], Germany, in 2007, of [[Public Management]] at the [[Collegium Civitas]], Warsaw, Poland, in 2011, and at the [[University of Malaya]], [[Malaysia]] in 2013, and during the same year, of [[Public Administration]] at the [[Central University of Finance and Economics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], as well as in 2015 at [[Zhejiang University]] in [[Hangzhou]], [[China]], and at [[Gadjah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], in 2016 at the [[National Institute of Development Administration]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], and in 2017 at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]], [[National University of Singapore]]. In 2012-2014, he served as the [[André Molitor]] Chair of Political, Administrative and International Reforms (as ''professeur invité'') at the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]], [[Belgium]]. He has served as Advisor to the [[President of Estonia]], as Executive Secretary with the German ''[[Wissenschaftsrat]]'' during [[German reunification]], and, as an [[American Political Science Association]] Congressional Fellow, a Senior Legislative Analyst in the [[United States Congress]]. He was the Vice Chairman of the executive board of Praxis, Estonia’s pre-eminent public policy think-tank, and a member of the Innovation Policy Council of the Estonian Ministry of Economics.

In Public Administration, Drechsler emphasizes the non-[[Technocrat (derogatory)|technocratic]], non-managerial, "state sciences" approach that focuses on [[effectiveness]] rather than efficiency. He is also especially interested in Non-Western Public Administration ([[Confucianism|Confucian]], Islamic, and Buddhist). In economics and public policy, he is a strong protagonist of the role of the state in economic growth and of innovation and industrial policy. Philosophically, Drechsler is a classical [[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutician]], as one of the last students of the late [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].

Drechsler serves or has served as an advisor, especially in the areas of public management reform and innovation policy as well as e-governance, for national governments and international organizations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Council of Europe]], SIGMA, [[World Bank]], [[European Union]] ([[Lisbon Strategy]]), [[Inter-American Development Bank]], and [[United Nations Development Program]]; he has worked, in different capacities, on the national development plans of, e.g., Estonia, [[Mongolia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], and [[Norway]].

In 2000, Drechsler co-founded [[The Other Canon]], a center and network for [[heterodox economics]] research, with - amongst others - main founder and executive chairman [[Erik Reinert]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/board/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Drechsler received the 1997 Estonian National Science Award, Social Science category, the 2001 Alena Brunovskà Award for Teaching Excellence in Public Administration, the 2002 Outstanding [[Alumnus]] Award from [[Bridgewater College]], where he also delivered the annual W. Harold Row Endowed Lecture, in 2004, the [[Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana]] (Maarjamaa Rist), Estonia's Order of Merit, and in 2005, the German one, the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]. In 2013, he was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] in [[Social Sciences]] by the [[Corvinus University]] [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and in 2017, the [http://secopa.org/awards/senator-peter-b-boorsma-award/ Senator Peter B. Boorsma Award] from SECoPA, the Southeastern regional association of the [[American Society for Public Administration]], for his merits in international public administration theory and practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6295">[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The Womb Realm [[mandala]]. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]]. He is surrounded by eight [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s (clockwise from top: [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Samantabhadra]], Saṅkusumitarāja, [[Manjushri]], [[Amitābha]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], [[Amoghasiddhi]] and [[Maitreya]])]]
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the '''Womb Realm''' ({{lang-sa|garbhakoṣadhātu}}, {{lang-ja|胎蔵界}} ''taizōkai'') is the metaphysical space inhabited by the [[Wisdom King]]s. The Womb Realm is based on the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''. The name of the mandala derives from chapter 2 of the sutra, where it is said that the buddha [[Vairocana|Mahāvairocana]] revealed the mandala's secret teachings to his disciple [[Vajrasattva]] from his "womb of compassion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other translations, the term ''matrix realm'' or Matrix Mandala are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Womb Realm is a very popular subject for [[mandala]]s, and along with the [[Diamond Realm]] (''vajradhātu'') Mandala forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].  This mandala, along with the Diamond Realm, form the core of Japanese [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] Buddhist rituals, including [[abhisheka]] "initiation". In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded and asked to toss a flower upon a mandala.  Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional Shingon halls, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mahāvairocana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;In this setting, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mahāvairocana.

Four vases containing a lotus and a three-pronged Vajra, are placed at the corners of the Center Hall.
