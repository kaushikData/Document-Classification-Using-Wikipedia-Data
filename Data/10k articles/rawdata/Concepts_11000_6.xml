      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12688">The '''Böckenförde Dilemma''' ({{lang-de|[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6ckenf%C3%B6rde-Diktum Böckenförde-Diktum]}}) is a problem ([[dilemma]]), which claims that in secular states there are obstacles to creation of [[social capital]].

The dilemma is named after German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|constitutional judge]] [[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]].

== Content ==

Böckenförde wrote that:

{{quote|''The liberal (German "freiheitlich"),&lt;ref&gt;Or "freedom-oriented." The likeliest English equivalents of ''freiheitlich'', "liberal" and "libertarian," carry connotations beyond the  German. While "libertarian" (in American usage) refers to a current political persuasion,  "liberal" in the sense of "political liberalism" has a longer history in political thought, so it is less bound to current political usage.&lt;/ref&gt; secularized state lives by prerequisites which it cannot guarantee itself.'' This is the great adventure it has undertaken for freedom's sake. As a liberal state it can only endure if the freedom it bestows on its citizens takes some regulation from the interior, both from a moral substance of the individuals and a certain homogeneity of society at large. On the other hand, it cannot by itself procure these interior forces of regulation, that is not with its own means such as legal compulsion and authoritative decree. Doing so, it would surrender its liberal character (freiheitlichkeit) and fall back, in a secular manner, into the claim of totality it once led the way out of, back then in the [[Thirty Years War|confessional civil wars]].|[[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]]|''Staat, Gesellschaft, Freiheit''. 1976, S. 60.}}

In a [[feudalism|feudal]] state the king represents the ultimate power based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] doctrine, the legitimacy of king's rule is transcendentally justified. In a [[republic]] there is no generally valid notion of [[sovereignty|sovereign]], although in theory the people have sovereignty ([[popular sovereignty]]). But according to constitution the people hand over to some extent their sovereignty or government authority to state leaders and parliaments. In election coverage formulations like "the sovereign has decided" are used. The Böckenförde Dilemma alludes to the fact that in a democracy the legitimacy of the government is justified "from below" in contrast to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. While the absolutist state demands loyalty from its citizens and through this loyalty can exercise its rule, the democratic state relies on democratic convictions of its citizens and can not enforce those convictions itself.

This leads to difficulties in answering the question of how a democratically constituted society can secure its survival and defend itself against threats. Böckenförde draws attention to the paradox that the state in the attempt to defend democracy with "the means of legal coercion and decrees from authority" would itself become a [[dictatorship]] because it would infringe upon the idea of people as sovereign.

Gerhard Czermak writes that Böckenförde is "fundamentally misunderstood when not instrumentalized" when it is concluded from his dilemma that "the state should promote churches and religious communities as sources of virtue in particular... He (Böckenförde) speaks of adventure and points to very different forces acting in society. He means that all groups with their own, also moral, worldview contribute to integration of a part of society."“&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Czermak: ''Religions- und Weltanschauungsrecht''. S. 36, Absatz 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two interviews in 2009 and 2010 Böckenförde answered the critique that he had exaggerated the ethical force of religion: "This criticism misses the context in which I made this statement in 1964. Back then I was trying to explain to Catholics the origin of the secular, that is worldly, no longer religious state and dissolve their scepticism of it. This had happened before 1965 when at the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the Roman Catholic Church for the first time completely recognized the concept of religious freedom. In the face of this scepticism I urged Catholics to accept this state and engage in it, among other things with the argument that the state has to rely on their ethical shaping force."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=sw&amp;dig=2009/09/23/a0090&amp;cHash=21e4e4c527 "Freiheit ist ansteckend" (Freedom is contagious)], [[die tageszeitung]], 23 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Böckenförde clarified it as follows: "To conceive of such a state the liberal order needs a unifying ethos, a "sense of community" among those who live in this state. The question then becomes: what is creating this ethos, which can neither be enforced by the state nor compelled by a sovereign? One can say: first the common culture. But what are the elements and factors of that culture? Then indeed we are dealing with its sources such as Christianity, Enlightenment and humanism. But not automatically any religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html „Freiheit ist ansteckend“] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053317/http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html# |date=2010-11-04 }}, [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 1. November 2010 online, 2. November 2010, S. 32f&lt;/ref&gt;

A secular version of this thought one can find already in Aristotle: that the virtue of a state is founded on the virtue of its citizens and that it rests on their disposition, habit and reason - which is also reflected in the famous quote of [[Joseph de Maistre]] that every nation gets the government it deserves. Therefore political education becomes a necessary condition for existence and an essential task (however hard it is to ensure institutionally) of the good political order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, ''Recht und Gerechtigkeit in der offenen Gesellschaft'', 2. Aufl., 1996, S. 149 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In this context the debate over changing values is worth noting. In the tradition of [[cultural pessimism]]  [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] believes that since the 60's an uninterrupted decline in values has taken place. The erosion of "civic virtues" such as sense of community and pride in work as well as declining attendance in churches and shrinking religious engagement have been noted as symptoms. According to [[Helmut Klages]] instead of a decay of values what is happening is a synthesis of old and new values. [[Ronald Inglehart]] postulates a change from material to non-material values that will ultimately strengthen democracy: he believes more cooperation and more freedom will result from this change.

[[Gerhard Himmelman]] points out that the sociologists countered the debate about a decline in values with the argument that "the modern social regulatory mechanisms and the democratic procedures serve as foundations of social integration". Instead of appealing, among other things, to the [[communitarianism]], the public discourse, the [[The Theory of Communicative Action|communication free from domination]] ([[Jürgen Habermas]]) creates out of itself ("Selbstschöpfungsprozess") the values and behaviors (democratic virtues), that the liberal state needs to exist and survive. Jürgen Habermas also sees a risk that runaway modernization of society undermines the democratic layer and destroys the kind of solidarity on which the democratic state relies, without being able to enforce it legally,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Fleischmann: [http://perspektive89.com/2006/05/14/wasserlos_waschen_auf_welkem_gras_zur_habermas_ratzinger_debatte ''Wasserlos waschen auf welkem Gras – zur Habermas-Ratzinger-Debatte''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109034426/http://www.perspektive89.com/2006/05/14/wasserlos_waschen_auf_welkem_gras_zur_habermas_ratzinger_debatte# |date=2008-01-09 }}(In German). In: ''perspektive89.com'', 14 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Haus also rejects the Böckenförde thesis as unfounded. From Böckenförde's premise that the modern democratic state was created under the influence of the Christian religion, it does not necessarily follow that the society of ''today'' is dependent on religion as a foundation. Instead a civic consensus could also rest on binding commonalities such as shared interests, interdependencies, dependencies, opportunities for cooperation, a common history or common historical lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haus: ''Ort und Funktion der Religion in der zeitgenössischen Demokratietheorie''. In: Michael Minkenberg (Hrsg.): ''Politik und Religion''. Wiesbaden 2003, S. 49f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axel Montenbruck follows Böckenförde's approach. But answering Böckenförde's call for "binding ethos" Montenbruck introduces the western secular ideas of [[civil religion]] that goes back to [[Rousseau]]: "The solution to this dilemma can only be found on an even higher level, such as that of the preambles. The people needs to create aside from the state also its own  "substitute religion of internalized values and principles", to which it must then submit. Indeed, the nations possess these "substitute religions" as evidenced by preambles to their constitutions etc. But they find an understandable difficulty speaking again of religion, even if only of civil religion."&lt;ref&gt;Axel Montenbruck: ''Zivilreligion. Eine Rechtsphilosophie I. Grundlegung: Westlicher "demokratischer Präambel-Humanismus" und universelle Trias "Natur, Seele und Vernunft"'', 3. erheblich erweiterte Auflage, 2011, 175, Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin ([http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001739/Zivilreligion_I_3_Auflage_2011.pdf?hosts= open access])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==
Since the 1990s, this idea has been taken up and modified by Paul Kirchhof and related to demographic developments.

The Böckenförde dilemma stands at the "center of liberal conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Bielefeld: [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2007-2-143 ''Rezension zu: Hacke, Jens A.: Philosophie der Bürgerlichkeit.

The '''Caux Palace Hotel''' is a former palace hotel located in [[Caux, Switzerland|Caux]], above [[Montreux]] in the [[Vaud]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]], in [[Switzerland]].

Built on the Caux Mount by the Swiss architect Eugène Jost, it was inaugurated on 7 July 1902. The building rests on a 400-meter long terrace and is decorated with an abundance of towers and turrets with coloured tiles, which make it a remarkable feature of the Montreux landscape, visible from the whole [[Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut District|Montreux Riviera region]]. It soon became an international venue first in the early 20th century as a luxury hotel, then from 1946 on as an international conference centre dedicated to the rebuilding of Europe under the leadership of the Swiss [[Initiatives of Change]] team. It is now also the seat of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) which uses the premises during the school semesters while Initiatives of Change keeps organising summer conferences there each year. The Caux-Palace Hotel is listed as a [[List of cultural property of national significance in Switzerland: Vaud|cultural property of national significance in Switzerland]].

==History==

===Caux before the palace hotel===
Until 1875, the area around Caux was only sparsely populated. The "Caux mountains" had always been used as a [[pasture]] for local farmers while the road to the Jaman pass was the shortest route towards the Sarine and Simmental valleys. In 1875 taking into account the rapid development of tourism on the lakeside where the first hotels had opened in 1837 in [[Montreux]] and in 1841 in [[Territet]], Emile Monnier decided to transform his chalet on the Caux Mountain into an inn with a view to welcome the ramblers who started to explore the mountainside. This development had first affected the village of [[Glion]], halfway between [[Montreux]] and Caux: a road to [[Glion]] was opened in 1850 and a cable-car service was opened between Territet and Glion in 1883.

About the same time local entrepreneurs became aware of the potential of Caux, almost 1000 meters above Glion. Philippe Faucherre, born in 1844 and his wife Louise Vauthier, both from hotel management background, were among them. In 1890 Faucherre bought a stone career in the area and built the Caux Grand Hotel in three years, all the needed material being brought to the construction site by [[mule]]s for lack of other means of transportation.

The railway from Glion to Caux and to the [[Rochers-de-Naye]] summit was built at the same time and inaugurated in 1892 after only 15 months of works, a technical tour-de-force realized under the famous railway engineer Laubi. The extension of this railway between Montreux and Glion would wait 27 more years. The road to Caux was also opened at the same time by public works contractor Pierre Botelli.

The immediate success of the Grand Hotel, which attracted many prominent people to Caux, led other entrepreneurs to conceive the Caux Palace Hotel.&lt;ref name = Mottu&gt;The informations in this section are drawn from Philippe Mottu’s historic book: Caux from Belle Epoque to Moral Rearmament, published by La Baconnière, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The  construction of the Caux palace hotel===
[[File:Caux Palace 1902.jpg|thumb|Newspaper announcing the inauguration of the Caux Place Hotel in 1902.|alt=Une reproduction de la une d'un journal professionnel suisse relatant l'ouverture du Caux-Palace en 1902.]]
Five years after the Grand Hotel opening, [[Ami Chessex]], who was the owner of the lakeside Territet Grand Hotel, decided to build a new hotel on a piece of land he owned at Caux, just under the Caux Grand Hotel – although the area was rather sloppy. Early in 1899 a joint venture company was founded by Chessex and Faucherre with a capital of 2.5 million Swiss Francs. At the start of 1900 this company issued 3 million worth of bonds (and issued 500,000 francs more in 1903).

The first round of works consisted of an additional floor on top of the Grand Hotel, which immediately increased its capacity by 80 beds. Then in 1900 the construction works of the Caux Palace started. The main requirement was to make it the most advanced, most luxurious and biggest hotel ever built in Switzerland. As imagined by chief architect [[Eugène Jost]], the construction started by a 400-meter long supporting wall along the hotel’s site, allowing for the creation of a nice garden at the foot of the future hotel and for a promenade along this belvedere from which future Caux Palace Hotel customers would enjoy a unique sight on the grand landscape of [[Lake Geneva]] and of the [[Alps]].

Alfred Daulte, one of Jost’s deputies, was to lead the works on site. It was difficult job given that there were up to 800 workers on site and that the progress of the construction was under close personal scrutiny from Ami Chessex, who used to walk up from Territet twice a week and did not hesitate to issue orders contradicting Daulte’s. Nevertheless, the building and decoration works were completed in a little over two years, and on 7 July 1902, the Caux Palace Hotel was officially inaugurated in presence of the president of the Canton’s executive, Mr Cossy, and of the whole [[Vaud]] government. The books of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' showed a total cost of construction of 2,555,949 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The Belle Epoque===
Like its predecessor, the Caux Grand Hotel, the Caux Palace Hotel was blessed with instant success. Visitors included celebrities such as [[Sacha Guitry]], [[Paul Morand]], [[Romain Rolland]], [[Edgar Wallace]], prince [[Ibn Saud]], future king of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[John D. Rockefeller]] and the [[maharajah of Baroda]]. The latter stayed frequently in Caux, using most of the fourth floor. His personal room at the south-west angle of the building enjoyed an outstanding view and was furbished in lemon-tree wood furniture, especially designed for the maharajah. This exceptional furniture and the initial decoration of this room have been preserved to this day.

Two to three weeks of waiting time were sometimes necessary before the privilege of staying at the Caux Palace Hotel could be granted to the customers. Several smaller hotels were therefore built in Caux in the wake of the opening of the Caux Palace Hotel, such as the “Pavillon des Fougères” (later “Hotel Alpina”) or the “Hotel Maria”. A school was opened in Caux in 1905, an Anglican chapel was built in 1906 and a Catholic one in 1907. Many private chalets were also built around the same years. Winter sport facilities included ski and sledge slopes, three ice rinks for skating and a bobsleigh track. The world [[bobsleigh]] federation and the world [[ice hockey]] federation were be created in Caux.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The dark years===
1 August 1914 spelt the end of the golden years of luxury tourism in Switzerland. In a matter of a few days most of the customers had left the hotels, which would remain empty for the next five years. On 10 August, the few remaining Grand Hotel customers were transferred to the Caux Place Hotel and the Grand Hotel was then closed down. In 1917, Ami Chessex passed away after having struggled for three years to keep the company afloat. The cumulated loss at the end of the war would be of 1 million.

In 1919, war had at last stopped and everything could have returned to normal, but exchange rates were high for the Swiss Francs and the Caux hotels did not completely correspond with the new expectations of the customers. Therefore, in spite of a financial restructuration of the company in 1919, business remained disappointing. In 1925, the Grand Hotel was renovated and renamed Hotel Regina, in memory of [[Empress Sissi]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] who had resided there in 1898 just before being assassinated in Geneva.

The years 1927 and 1928 brought at last sizeable improvement for the Caux hotels. A second financial restructuration took place in 1929 in order to raise 1 million francs to renovate the Caux Palace Hotel. The bobsleigh world cup was organised in Caux in 1930. Unfortunately, the years 1930 to 1935 were most difficult as a result of the worldwide financial crisis. The value of the individual share of the ''Société immobilière de Caux'' had sunk from around 200 francs in 1900 to 1 francs in 1936. A fourth financial restructuration was insufficient to mend the situation and the board put the hotels up for sale as the losses piled up.

In 1938 the railway was converted from steam to electricity and the ski fashion reignited interest for Caux. The Caux Palace Hotel was renamed Hotel Esplanade and now targeted a less exclusive audience. However, in 1939 it had to stop all activities for good.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===World War II===
After the Caux Palace Hotel, most other hotels also had to gradually close down. In 1941, Hotel Regina was declared bankrupt and sold twice in a row. The Caux Palace Hotel reopened in May 1944 as a detention centre for [[RAF|English]] and [[American Air Force]] pilots escaped from Italian prisoner's camps. Then from November 1944 to July 1945 they were replaced by Italian civilian refugees and from December 1944 by [[Jewish]] Hungarian refugees. This last group consisted of 1670 people coming from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] where they had been briefly detained by the SS administration in spite of the payment of a handsome ransom for their freedom. This episode is known as the [[Kasztner train]] story, by the name of the main Jewish negotiator for this evacuation. Last minute negotiations on the background of an impending German defeat allowed the train to be finally redirected to Switzerland as initially planned and to save its passengers from an almost certain death. Orthodox Jews were put up at the Regina Hotel and all other in the former Caux Palace Hotel. An oak tree was planted on the Caux terrace in memory of this convoy and a plaque was inaugurated there in 1999. It reads: “In memory of the Jewish refugees accommodated here during WWII, and in memory of those who were driven back by the Swiss borders. We shall not forget them.”&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journaldesidonie.blogspot.com/ the diary of a Hungarian refugee from the Kasztner train], [http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php the historic exhibition in the Caux bookshop] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830203056/http://www.musee-cauxexpo.ch/en/krise.php# |date=2011-08-30 }} and the [http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies document on refugees on the CAUX-Initiatives of Change website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045549/http://www.caux.iofc.org/fr/refugies |date=2014-04-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These various visitors of Caux degraded the buildings a lot. Everything that could have a market value like door knobs, locks, taps, etc. was dismantled and sold. This completed the ruin of the creators of the Caux Palace Hotel. Apart from the ground and of the building’s shell, nothing was left of the 9 to 10 million Swiss Francs which had been invested there since 1890. It later turned out, however, that the caretaker of the Caux Palace Hotel, Robert Auberson, had been able to hide and store a lot of valuable pieces of furniture, as well as crockery and cutlery.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;

===The salvage of the Caux Palace Hotel===
In 1946, the derelict Caux Palace Hotel as well as the former Grand Hotel and other smaller hotel buildings in Caux looked like near their end. The bankrupt ''Société Immobilière de Caux'' had fallen into the hands of its main banker, ''Banque populaire de Montreux'', who were looking for a quick way out and had put the whole lot on the market at a very low price. The most likely outcome was the demolition of the building in order to reuse its material.

But in an unexpected move, [[Geneva]]-born diplomat [[Philippe Mottu]] bid for the building with a small group of Swiss people. A graduate in theology and political science from Geneva university, Philippe Mottu had been associated with [[Frank Buchman]] and the [[Oxford Group]] since the mid-1930s and in 1943 he had had the recurring thought: "If Switzerland is spared by war, our task will be to put at the disposal of Frank Buchman a place where Europeans, torn apart by hatred, suffering and resentment, will be able to meet each other. Caux is the place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=588526 Story of the birth of the conference centre in Caux, by Philippe Mottu, 1997, in Cantonal Archives index, Lausanne, Vaud]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bankers as well as the [[Montreux|city of Montreux]] [[Mayor (Switzerland)|mayor]] understood full well the positives of having an international conference centre in the area of Montreux and offered a "discount" price of 1.050.000 Swiss francs, giving [[Moral Rearmament]] a priority over other bidders. The ''Caux Foundation'', which would administer the Caux Palace Hotel in the coming decades, being not yet in place, the sale contract was signed on 25 May 1946 by Philippe Mottu and Robert Hahnloser in their own name. It would take 95 individual Swiss donors to be able to reach the 450,000 Francs amount requested as first [[down payment]] on 1 July 1946. In-kind donations such as furniture, carpets also converged from all over Switzerland to help refurbish the former palace.

During six weeks, a team of international volunteers toiled day and night under the guidance of Swiss engineer Robert Hahnloser and his deputy, Dutch architect Jap de Boer, in order to repair the inside of the house. On 9 July 1946 the first meal cooked in the just enabled new kitchen was served to 150 guests. During that 1946 summer, 3000 people visited the new Caux conference centre. Dormitories were installed and some of the participants had to be allocated in nearby hotels. In 1946 and 1947 a series of needed transformations were performed in order to adapt the building to its new destiny: conversation of the ball room into a theater, new, larger entrance hall, etc. Lacking the adequate number of beds, the ''Caux Foundation'' bought the Grand Hotel and the Maria Hotel in 1947 and the Alpina Hotel in 1949, plus various smaller buildings.

===The Caux Conference Centre===
In the course of the next 50 years, the Caux Palace Hotel did not undergo any other significant modifications. Its history is marked by a long string of meetings organised by [[Moral Re-Armament|MRA]], which in certain cases had political repercussions.&lt;ref name = Mottu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the more recent years, see the presentation by the Caux Foundation’s president on 8 July 2012, inaugurating the 5th Caux Forum for Human Security with the participation of former Swiss President Mrs [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] {{cite web |url=http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108223944/http://www.caux.iofc.org/sites/all/files/Official%20Day%202012_Jaulmes.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1946–1950: numerous meetings associating [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] participants, among whom the future protagonists of the [[Coal and Steel Community]] agreements, who found a mutual trust relationship through Caux. French [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Irène Laure]] led groups from Caux through Germany to ask for forgiveness and engage in dialogue. 
*1950: visit by a 60-people strong delegation of Japanese political and union leaders among whom several future cabinet members. They brought as a gift a small wooden cross made from the wood of a tree trunk found in the midst of the devastated city of [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://protestinfo.ch/201508077540/7540-une-fondation-suisse-a-influence-la-reconstruction-pacifique-du-japon.html#.Ve2xvJf4YsY French article from News Agency Protestinfo, published on 7 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1950: visit by a group of [[Ruhr]] miners, all [[Communist Party of Germany]] members or leaders, who wanted to add respect for moral values and personal change to the body of thought of the Party, and were expelled from it, remaining strongly rooted in Moral Rearmament.
*1950–1956: launched from Caux, an action against [[corruption]] in [[Brazil]]ian harbours was led by an international MRA team. This action spread to [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[favela]]s.  
*1950–1953: numerous visits by workers, managers and employers delegations, particularly from France, who created in Caux the necessary conditions for successful [[collective bargaining]], resulting in the signing on 1 February 1951 of the first [[collective agreement]] in [[France]]. 
*1953–1960: Caux became a platform for contacts between leaders from African and other [[Colonies|colonised nations]] and the representatives of colonial powers. It achieved dialogue for peaceful [[decolonisation]] in [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]], and reconciliation in [[Kenya]] after the [[Mau Mau Rebellion]].
*1961: death of [[Frank Buchman]]. The transition years which followed impaired the progress of MRA activities, including in Caux, but the Caux Foundation succeeded in maintaining the Caux conferences. 
*1964: international agreement on jute rates’ stabilisation, reached thanks to the active, principles-based lobbying of French industrialist Robert Carmichael, a member of the Council of the Caux Foundation.
*1967: opening of the MRA centre in [[Panchgani]] (India), which widened the outreach of MRA towards Asia.
*1968–1969: visit of seven delegations from [[South Tyrol]] / Alto Adigio, which enabled a peaceful resolution of the hardened conflict there between the German-speaking and the Italian-speaking communities. 
*1977–1980: in close link with Caux, action for peaceful independence of former [[Rhodesia]] (currently [[Zimbabwe]]).
*1986: launching of the [[Caux Round Table]], a joint initiative of executives from presidents of European, Japanese and American companies, among whom Ryuzaburo Kaku ([[Canon Inc.|Canon]]) and [[Frits Philips]] ([[Philips]]).
*1986–1995: interpersonal meetings between representatives of opposing groups enhanced reconciliation efforts in [[Lebanon]], [[Cambodia]], [[Somaliland]], [[South Africa]] as well as among ethnic communities of large cities in [[OECD]] countries.  
*1993: launch of the "Foundations For Freedom" programme: thanks to their contacts in Eastern Europe, the West-European MRA teams launched a series of trainings to the ethical preconditions for a sound democracy. This programme evolved into a [[Ukraine]]-based organisation some years later.  
*1994: launching of an international ethical code of conduct for companies called "Caux principles for Business" by the [[Caux Round Table]], followed by the development of a self-evaluation method for company ethics.
*2000–2010: actions for peace and reconciliation in [[Burundi]] and in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, in partnership with the FDFA (Swiss foreign ministry). Meetings between government officials and rebellion leaders took place alternatively in Caux and on the ground.
*2002: a federation of about 30 national sister associations, the [[Initiatives of Change]] International Association was founded, with its seat set in Caux.
*2008–2012: at the initiative of [[Mohamed Sahnoun]], the Caux Forums for Human Security brought together diplomats, politicians and NGOs around the great human security issues: conflicts, natural resources management, unsustainable economic policies, etc.
*2013–2015: the Children as Actors of Transformation in Society (CATS) conferences gathered in Caux specialists of [[Children's rights]], educators and delegations of children and teenagers from around the world.

==Architecture and Style==
The Caux-Palace Hotel building surprises the observer both by its size and by its eclectic style.&lt;ref name = Lüthi&gt;Dave Lüthi, Eugène Jost, architecte du passé retrouvé, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes, Lausanne, 2001, pp. 52-54, {{ISBN|2880744563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General style===
The [[Architectural style|building’s style]] is often considered as [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medieval]] and has earned the Caux Palace Hotel the nickname of "[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]", whereas

:"in reality it is by no means an archeological reconstruction. Architect Eugène Jost used only some elements with a medieval resemblance – possibly inspired by nearby [[Château de Chillon|Chillon Castle]], a castle which Jost knew well, having restored it: [[bartizan]]s, [[machicolation]]s and the two towers supported by [[corbel]]s which punctuate the apartments building … Their style is barely medieval: granted, it includes a few [[hood mould]]s and a few [[ogee]] arches, but also Florentine neo-Renaissance semi-circular arches with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s, dual colours in French [[Louis XIII style]], adding to that pieces of carved wood and coloured glazed tiles which belong as much to [[seaside resort]] style as to Victorian 'Heimatstil' … Therefore, you could say that the Caux Palace Hotel is not neo-medieval but 'post-neomedieval'. Its architect quoted freely Middle Ages models (castles) which he couldn’t really imitate because they were too distant from his own typology. He reused a few details only, bringing to life a whole medieval or even neomedieval imagery."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Enlivenment of the façade===
Studying the façades of all hotels built by Eugène Jost, Professor Dave Lüthi from the [[University of Lausanne]] observed that, in order to avoid the hotel to look like barracks as could result from long rows of aligned hotel rooms windows, Jost contrived to counterbalance the horizontal deployment of the façades by an almost brutal articulation of vertical volumes and by the use of a few ornate bays which create a dynamic in the various sections of the façades (accentuation of [[dormer]]s and roofs, contrasting with angles left free of any decoration).

In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel, which can probably be regarded as Jost’s masterpiece,&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; the South façade, which contains 271 windows, is ingeniously split in five parts and patterned by numerous protruding elements such as [[balconies]], [[bow window]]s or a [[corbel]]ing gallery on the last floor. In contrast to this part of the building, the common areas rooms is equipped with very large [[bay window]]s which somewhat blur the visitor’s perception of the building from the gardens: these brutal scale changes are typical of [[eclectic architecture]]; they indicate the function of each part of the building and by bringing them together, oppose them, so as to warn the visitor about his own subjectivity: big or small are relative values.

Seen close by, the Caux Palace Hotel is an imposing sight because of its monumental size (which may be its main similarity with its so-called medieval models), yet it nevers "crushes" the observer; seen from afar only its [[cornice]], roof and [[turret]]s can be seen: the Caux Palace Hotel, like a [[diadem]] set on top of the Caux Mount, becomes the giant advertisement for the site.&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt; The Caux Palace Hotel is therefore quite representative of the new trend launched by Eugène Jost:

:"Playing with various loose elements such as balconies, loggias, carved decors, the architect assembles them in a composition which breaks with the academic approach of classic styles. Giving up gradually classic structures built around [[Fascia (architecture)|fascia]], [[cornice]]s and [[pilaster]]s which characterise most of the production at the time, Jost gave this hotel a façade which in 1900 belonged only to this type of architecture."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

===Functionality===
In the case of the Caux Palace Hotel as in his other hotel projects, Eugène Jost foremost concentrated on the general layout and on the façades. He unfolded his monumental buildings beyond the point where dimension became detrimental to usage.

:"The customer must then cope with a long walk between the hotel’s entrance and his room (in difference with traditional hotels) but he is led to many discoveries on the way. The dimensions of the spaces he walks across, the diversity of the light sources, the luxury of the decors are as many surprises. Although room distribution may not be 'rational' in the sense which a [[Viollet-le-Duc]] or a [[Julien Guadet|Guadet]] would have had it, it is thought through as an architectural stroll around which the parallel world of services and servants revolves."&lt;ref name = Lüthi/&gt;

==Renovations==
The Caux Foundation made several renovations in the course of the years, the most spectacular being in the course of the 1980s the complete renovation of the roofs; appropriate coloured glazed tiles could only be found in the region of [[Dijon]] ([[France]]) and they were bought with the financial assistance of the French [[Initiatives of Change]] association. The dining room had been redone in 1959 and a fresco by [[Finland|Finnish]] painter [[Lennart Segerstråle]] was then added.

The arrival of the [[Swiss Hotel Management School]] (SHMS) in 1995 as a tenant outside the conference season has allowed the Caux Foundation to do more to maintain and improve the ageing building and its surroundings. In some cases it was a matter of compliance with more demanding new regulations: there was a revamping of the kitchen in line with the most advanced professional norms, the installation of required fire detector systems and fireproof doors at strategic locations, the installation of separate collection and evacuation systems for wastewater and rainwater, etc. Another key work is the gradual renovation of over 200 bathrooms which had more or less remained early 20th century bathrooms. In other instances, there was a need to adapt to the requirements of the teaching activity of SHMS: creation of classrooms and of a new amphitheater, addition of an internet café. Some structures, such as the ground floor [[pergola]], also received needed renovations.

However, from the cultural heritage viewpoint, the most interesting piece of work was the renovation of the great hall and of some historic rooms in 2007 and 2008 with support from Foundation Pro Patria, Loterie Romande and JP Morgan Chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |title=Brief note in Pro Patria site (in French) |access-date=2015-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082411/http://www.propatria.ch/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=29&amp;sobi2Id=651&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=fr# |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Batir&gt;See detailed article in the Swiss professional periodical "Bâtir", journal romand de la construction suisse, novembre 2007, pages 17 to 22. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was to clean up and to restore the wall and ceiling frescoes of the great hall which had been created by [[Bern]]ese painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Haberer|fr}} in 1902. The ceiling was particularly important as one of the largest ever painted in Switzerland and as the only one still in its original state. It is also unique by its decoration in Swiss [[Art deco]] style and by its [[cupola]] shape. The restoration works of the [[frescoes]] allowed reducing the visual impact of the various alterations they endured in time, to keep in place as much as possible the initial decorations’ substance and to bring to light two additional frescoes adorning the great Hall’s decorative [[fireplace mantel]]s.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

These renovation works were led by specialists Olivier Guyot et Julian James and supervised by the “Monuments and Sites” section of the Vaud state, as well as by Swiss architect Eric Jaeger for the Caux Foundation.&lt;ref name = Batir/&gt;

At the end of 2015, the CAUX-Initiatives of Change Foundation had the heating system replaced, moving from oil to (local) wood heating. [[Fossil fuel]]'s [[CO2]] emissions were lowered by 590 tons per year as a result. The fuel oil boilers and tanks had been installed in the early 1960s to replace the original 1902 six coal firing boilers&lt;ref&gt;Le Caux-Palace change ses grandes chaudières, article in the [[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 heures]] daily newspaper [https://www.24heures.ch/vaud-regions/riviera-chablais/cauxpalace-change-grandes-chaudieres/story/18626281]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[evolutionary psychology]], the '''Cinderella effect''' is the phenomenon of higher incidence of different forms of child-abuse and mistreatment by [[Stepfamily|stepparents]] than by biological parents. It takes its name from the [[fairy tale]] character [[Cinderella]]. Evolutionary psychologists describe the effect as a byproduct of a bias towards kin, and a conflict between reproductive partners of investing in young that are unrelated to one partner. There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticism against it.

==Background==
In the early 1970s, a theory arose on the connection between stepparents and [[child maltreatment]].  "In 1973, forensic psychiatrist P. D. Scott summarized information on a sample of "fatal battered-baby cases" perpetrated in anger ... 15 of the 29 killers – 52% – were stepfathers."&lt;ref name=TAC33&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially there was no analysis of this raw data, empirical evidence has since been collected on what is now called the Cinderella effect through official records, reports, and census.

For over 30 years, data has been collected regarding the validity of the Cinderella effect, with a wealth of evidence indicating a direct relationship between step-relationships and abuse. This evidence of [[child abuse]] and [[homicide]] comes from a variety of sources including official reports of child abuse, clinical data, victim reports, and official homicide data.&lt;ref name=DalyWilson2007&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (2007) [http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf Is the "Cinderella Effect" controversial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516102016/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }} In Crawford &amp; Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have concluded that "stepchildren in [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], and the [[United States]] indeed incur greatly elevated risk of child maltreatment of various sorts, especially lethal beatings".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daly|first=M.|author2=M. Wilson|title=An assessment of some proposed exceptions to the phenomenon of nepotistic discrimination against stepchildren|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|year=2001|volume=38|pages=287–296|url=ftp://psyftp.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Papers/ZoologicaFennica/daly.pdf}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powerful evidence in support of the Cinderella effect comes from the finding that when abusive parents have both step and genetic children, they generally spare their genetic children. In such families, stepchildren were exclusively targeted 9 out of 10 times in one study and in 19 of 22 in another.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p387"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to displaying higher rates of negative behaviors (e.g., abuse) toward stepchildren, stepparents display fewer positive behaviors toward stepchildren than do the genetic parents. For example, on average, stepparents invest less in education, play with stepchildren less, take stepchildren to the doctor less, etc.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p388"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination against stepchildren is unusual compared with abuse statistics involving the overall population given "the following additional facts: (1) when child abuse is detected, it is often found that ''all'' the children in the home have been victimized; and (2) stepchildren are almost always the eldest children in the home, whereas the general ... tendency in families of uniform parentage is for the youngest to be most frequent victims."&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology theory==
{{See also|Infanticide (zoology)|Kin selection}}

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] propose that the Cinderella effect is a direct consequence of the [[Evolution|modern evolutionary]] theory of [[inclusive fitness]], especially [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. They argue that human child rearing is so prolonged and costly that "a parental psychology shaped by natural selection is unlikely to be indiscriminate".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/0162-3095(85)90012-3 | title = Child abuse and other risks of not living with both parents | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 197–210 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, "research concerning animal social behaviour provide a rationale for expecting parents to be discriminative in their care and affection, and more specifically, to discriminate in favour of their own young".&lt;ref name=TAC8&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusive fitness theory proposes a selective criterion for the evolution of social traits, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism can nevertheless emerge when there is a statistical likelihood that significant benefits of that social behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait (most straightforwardly, accrue to close genetic relatives). Under such conditions, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s) focused on making the mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution, but also speculated about possible mechanisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers. Two possibilities were considered: One that a social trait might reliably operate straightforwardly via social context in species where genetic relatives are usually concentrated in a local home area where they were born ('viscous populations'); The other, that genetic detection mechanisms ('supergenes') might emerge that go beyond statistical correlations, and reliably detect ''actual'' genetic relatedness between the social actors using direct 'kin recognition'. The relative place of these two broad types of social mechanisms has been debated (see [[Kin selection]] and [[Kin recognition]]), but many biologists consider 'kin recognition' to be an important possible mechanism. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson follow this second mechanism, and expect that parents "discriminate in favour of their own young", i.e. their ''actual'' genetic relatives.

===Daly and Wilson research===
The most abundant data on stepchild mistreatment has been collected and interpreted by psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson, who study with an emphasis in Neuroscience and Behavior at [[McMaster University]].  Their first measure of the validity of the Cinderella effect was based on data from the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA), an archive of child abuse reports in the United States holding over twenty thousand reports.&lt;ref name=TAC26&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; These records led Wilson and Daly to conclude that "a child under three years of age who lived with one genetic parent and one stepparent in the United States in 1976 was about seven times more likely to become a validated child-abuse case in the records than one who dwelt with two genetic parents".&lt;ref name="TAC27"&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Their overall findings demonstrate that children residing with stepparents have a higher risk of abuse even when other factors are considered.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

====Explanation====
All organisms face [[trade-off]]s as to how to invest their time, energy, risk, and other resources, so investment in one domain (e.g., [[parental investment]]) generally takes away from their ability to invest in other domains (e.g. [[mating|mating effort]], growth, or investment in other offspring).&lt;ref name="Trivers1971"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | doi = 10.1086/406755 | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | pages = 35–57 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment in non-genetic children therefore reduces an individual's ability to invest in itself or its genetic children, without directly bringing reproductive benefits. Thus, from an [[evolutionary biology]] perspective, one would not expect organisms to regularly and deliberately care for unrelated offspring.

Daly and Wilson point out that [[infanticide]] is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = Martin  | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Margo  | year = 1980  | title = Discriminative Parental Solicitude: A Biological Perspective  | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family  | volume = 42  | issue = 2  | pages = 277–288  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 351225  | doi = 10.2307/351225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when an immigrant male [[lion]] enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males.&lt;ref name="Bertram1975"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertram | first1 = B. C. R. | title = Social factors influencing reproduction in wild lions | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1975.tb02246.x | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 177 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–482 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in [[competition (biology)|competition]] with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity.&lt;ref name="Bertram1975" /&gt; In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|sexual receptivity]] in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a timelier manner.&lt;ref name="PackerPusey1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Packer | first1 = C. | last2 = Pusey | first2 = A. E. | doi = 10.1086/284097 | title = Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 716 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980" /&gt;

Unlike the lion, however, humans in a stepparenting situation face a more complicated tradeoff since they cannot completely disown their partner's offspring from a previous relationship, as they would risk losing sexual access to their partner and any chance of producing potential offspring. Thus, according to Daly and Wilson, stepparental investment can be viewed as mating effort to ensure the possibility of future reproduction with the parent of their stepchild.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. I. | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772793 | title = Violence Against Stepchildren | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–81 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mating effort hypothesis suggests that humans will tend to invest more in their genetic offspring and invest just enough in their stepchildren. It is from this theoretical framework that Daly and Wilson argue that instances of child abuse towards non-biological offspring should be more frequent than towards biological offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a" /&gt;

One would therefore expect greater parental responsiveness towards one's own offspring than towards unrelated children, and this will result in more positive outcomes and fewer negative outcomes towards one's own children than towards other children in which one is expected to invest (i.e., stepchildren). "If child abuse is a behavioral response influenced by natural selection, then it is more likely to occur when there are reduced [[inclusive fitness]] payoffs owing to uncertain or low relatedness".&lt;ref name="Burgess1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burgess | first1 = R.

Daly and Wilson's reports on the overrepresentation of stepparents in [[child murder|child homicide]] and abuse statistics support the evolutionary principle of maximizing one's inclusive fitness, formalized under [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's Rule]], which helps to explain why humans will preferentially invest in close kin.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1988a"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Methods====
In their 1985 Canadian sample, Daly and Wilson classify the frequencies of different living arrangements (two natural parents, one natural parent, one natural parent with one stepparent, or other) according to child age. This was accomplished by administering a randomized telephone survey.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Records of child abuse from children's aid organizations as well as police reports on runaways and juvenile offenders were then used to determine whether children from stepparental living situations were overrepresented as abuse victims when compared to the demographic data gathered from the telephone survey data. The results indicate that the only living situation that has a significant correlation to increased child abuse is one natural parent and one stepparent in the same household. While rates of running away and crime were comparable for children living with stepparents and children of single-parents, abuse rates for children living with stepparents were much higher.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Daly and Wilson examined several potentially [[confounding| confounding variables]] in their research, including [[socioeconomic status]], family size, and maternal age at childbirth, however only minor differences between natural-parent and stepparent families with respect to these factors were found, indicating that none of these are major contributing factors to the observed Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{further|Attachment theory}}

Evolutionary psychologists have also suggested that one of the causes of stepchild abuse may be the lack of a parental [[attachment theory|attachment bond]] that the mother would normally form with her own child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. An attachment bond will, in general, be more secure if formed before the age of two, and adoption can often disrupt the development of this bond. An infant who is fed by the primary parental figure, usually the mother, and has the mother present during severely physically painful events will have form a stronger parental attachment bond, and either a consistent omission of the mother from this process or an alteration between two people (the original mother and the adoptive mother) can cause either an insecure attachment or disorganized attachment from the parent to the child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. As a result, it is highly recommended by most psychologists that the adoptive mother be present very early in the infant's life, preferably immediately after its birth, in order to avoid attachment disruptions and attachment disorders.&lt;ref name=Cooper1998&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory cannot be a whole explanation for the Cinderella effect, as psychological research has shown that secure attachment bonds can be developed between a parent and adopted child, and the quality of the relationship between parent and child will more often depend on the child's pre-adoption experiences, such as length of time in social care and previous trauma, more than characteristics of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Londen |first1=W.

===Misunderstandings===
It is sometimes argued that this evolutionary psychological account does not explain why the majority of stepparents do not abuse their partners' children, or why a significant minority of genetic parents do abuse their own offspring. However, their argument is based on a misunderstanding: the evolutionary psychological account is that (all else equal) parents will love their own children more than other people's children – it does not argue that stepparents will "want" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is absolute proof against abuse. Under this account, stepparental care is seen as "mating effort" towards the genetic parent, such that most interactions between stepparent and stepchildren will be generally positive or at least neutral, just usually not as positive as interactions between the genetic parent and the child would be.&lt;ref name=TAC&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supportive evidence==
Strong support for the Cinderella effect as described by Daly and Wilson comes from a study of unintentional childhood fatal injuries in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Tooley2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tooley | first1 = G.| last2 = Karakis | first2 = M.| last3 = Stokes | first3 = M.| last4 = Ozannesmith | first4 = J.| title = Generalising the Cinderella Effect to unintentional childhood fatalities| journal = Evolution and Human Behavior| volume = 27| pages = 224–230| year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. follow the argument of Daly and Wilson to extend the Cinderella effect from cases of abuse to incidences of unintentional fatalities. Children are not only vulnerable to abuse by their parents, but they are also dependent on their parents for supervision and protection from a variety of other harms.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = J. | last2 = Burnell | first2 = I. | last3 = Taylor | first3 = B. | last4 = Butler | first4 = N. | title = Family type and accidents in preschool children | doi = 10.1136/jech.37.2.100 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–104 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = 1052270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that parental supervision is fundamentally correlated to incidences of unintentional childhood injury as shown by Wadsworth et al. and Peterson &amp; Stern, Tooley et al. posit that selective pressures would favor an inclination towards parental vigilance against threats to offspring well-being.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. further argue that parental vigilance is not as highly engaged in stepparents as genetic parents, therefore placing stepchildren at greater risk for unintentional injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Based on data gathered from the Australia National Coroners' Information System, stepchildren under five years of age are two to fifteen times more likely to experience an unintentional fatal injury, especially drowning, than genetic children.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Additionally, the study finds that the risks of unintentional fatal injury are not significantly higher for genetic children in single parent homes versus two-parent homes.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This difference suggests that removing one biological parent from the home does not significantly increase risk to the children, but that adding a nonbiological parent to the home results in a drastic increase in the risk of unintentional fatal injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Despite the fact that adding a stepparent to the home increases the available resources in terms of supervision in comparison to a single-parent home, risk of unintentional fatal injury still significantly rises.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This higher risk of injury for stepchildren can be attributed to the fact that stepparents occupy the same supervisory role as a genetic parent, yet they have a lower intrinsic commitment to protecting the child and therefore are less likely to be adequately vigilant.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; The authors conclude that the Cinderella effect applies not only to purposeful abuse by stepparents, but is also relevant to explaining increased rates of accidental fatalities among stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, a study of parental investment behaviors among American men living in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], reveals a trend of increasing financial expenditures on genetic offspring in comparison to step-offspring, which also suggests that parents are less inclined to preserve the well-being of stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Though the general trend of the data from this study supports the Cinderella effect, Anderson and colleagues note that the observed differences between investment in children and stepchildren might be slightly reduced by a few confounding factors.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; For example, the authors point out that stepparenting is a [[self-selection bias|self-selective]] process, and that when all else is equal, men who bond with unrelated children are more likely to become stepfathers, a factor that is likely to be a confounding variable in efforts to study the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; Anderson and colleagues also conducted a similar study of [[xhosa people|Xhosa]] students in [[South Africa]] that analyzes the same four classifications of adult-child relationships, and this study offers similar results to those observed among men in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Additionally, a study of [[Hadza people|Hadza]] foragers in [[Tanzania]] by Marlowe also finds evidence of decreased care provided by men to stepchildren when compared with genetic children.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marlowe | first1 = F. | doi = 10.1007/s002650050592 | title = Male care and mating effort among Hadza foragers | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 46 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author uses the [[Mann-Whitney U| Mann-Whitney U-tests]] to evaluate most of the observed differences in care exhibited towards children and stepchildren, and finds that Hadza men spend less time with (U=96), communicate less with (U=94.5), nurture less, and never play with their stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt; Marlowe further argues that any care that is provided towards stepchildren is likely attributable to the man's mating efforts and not parental interest in the well-being of the stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt;

In further support of the Cinderella effect as elaborated by Daly and Wilson, a study conducted in a rural village in [[Trinidad]] demonstrates that in households containing both genetic children and stepchildren, fathers devote approximately twice as much time to interaction with genetic offspring in comparison to stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flinn | first1 = M.

This includes, for example, spanking, screaming, crying, and arguing. The duration of the relationship between genetic fathers and children shows a positive correlation with both relative proportion of interaction time and antagonistic interaction.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; The author argues that these results show that in terms of time invested, men favor their children over stepchildren, and this preference is not attributable to the duration of the adult-child relationship, a factor which is sometimes believed to be a confounding variable in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; Though this study does claim a significant increase in antagonistic behavior between stepparents and stepchildren and therefore supports the Cinderella effect, it also notes that only six percent of all the observed parent-child interactions were considered antagonistic, and that the researchers never noticed any blatant physical child abuse.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt;

==Criticism==

=== David Buller ===
[[Philosopher of science]] David Buller, as a part of his general critique of evolutionary psychology &lt;ref name="Holcomb2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holcomb|first=H. R.|title=Book Review: Buller does to Evolutionary Psychology what Kitcher did to Sociobiology|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2005|volume=3|pages=392–401|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep03392401.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has reviewed Daly and Wilson's data. He argues that evolutionary psychology (EP) mistakenly attempts to discover human [[psychological adaptation]]s rather than "the evolutionary causes of psychological traits." Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's 1985 Canadian sample included cases of sexual abuse as well as cases of unintentional omission, such as not buckling a child's seatbelt in the car. Buller asserts that unintentional omission does not fall under the realm of dangerous acts, and rather should be designated "maltreatment". He argues that since sexual abuse is not often accompanied by physical abuse, it is unreasonable to assume that it is motivated by the same kind of psychological mechanism as child homicide. Buller also points out that the conclusion that non-biological parents are more likely to abuse children is contradicted by the fact that even if the rate of abuse among stepparents was disproportionate, most child abuse is in fact committed by biological parents, and that the lowest rate of child abuse is found among adoptive parents.&lt;ref name="Buller2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buller | first1 = D.

As Crume et al. and Daly and Wilson note, maltreatment was only likely to be reported on the death certificates 47 percent of the time in the case of "Other relatives (including step-parents)," which represents a marginal increase from the amount of parental maltreatment.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Temrin et al. Sweden study ===
The findings of Daly and Wilson have been called into question by one study of child homicides in [[Sweden]] between 1975 and 1995, which found that children living in households with a non-genetic parent were not at an increased risk of homicide when compared to children living with both genetic parents. The study, published in 2000 and conducted by Temrin and colleagues argued that when Daly and Wilson classified homicides according to family situation, they did not account for the genetic relatedness of the parent who actually committed the crime. In the Swedish sample, in two out of the seven homicides with a genetic and non-genetic parent, the offender was actually the genetic parent and thus these homicides do not support Daly and Wilson's definition of the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Temrin | first1 = H. | last2 = Buchmayer | first2 = S. | last3 = Enquist | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1094 | title = Step-parents and infanticide: New data contradict evolutionary predictions | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1446 | pages = 943–945 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10853739| pmc = 1690621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daly and Wilson attribute the contrasting findings of the Swedish study to an analytical oversight. Temrin and colleagues neglect to consider the fact that the proportion of children in living situations with a stepparent is not constant for all child age groups, but rather increases with age. After correcting for age differences, the Swedish data set produces results in accordance with the previous findings of Daly and Wilson. The Swedish sample does show, however, decreased risk to children living with a stepparent compared to the North American samples collected by Daly and Wilson, suggesting that there is some degree of cross-cultural variation in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

===Alternative hypotheses===
It has been noted by multiple researchers that child abuse is an intricate issue and is affected by other factors.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles-Sims | first1 = Jean  | last2 = Finkelhor | first2 = David  | year = 1984  | title = Child Abuse in Stepfamilies  | journal = Family Relations  | volume = 33  | issue = 3  | pages = 407–413  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 584711  | doi = 10.2307/584711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daly and Wilson state, however, that even if evolutionary psychology cannot account for every instance of stepparental abuse, this does not invalidate their empirical findings.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005" /&gt;

Burgess and Drais propose that child maltreatment is too complex to be explained fully by genetic relatedness alone and cite other reasons for child maltreatment, such as social factors, ecological factors and child traits such as disability and age.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; However, they also note that these traits are simply indicative, and do not inevitably lead to child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; Temrin and colleagues also suggest that there may be other factors involved with child homicide, such as prior convictions, drug abuse problems, lost custody battles and mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;

In 1984, Giles-Sims and [[David Finkelhor]] categorized and evaluated five possible hypotheses that could explain the Cinderella effect: "social-evolutionary theory", "normative theory", "stress theory", "selection factors", and "resource theory". The social-evolutionary theory is based on the proposal that non-genetically related parents will invest less in costly parental duties, due to the fact that their genes are not being passed on by that individual. The normative theory proposes that, due to genetic repercussions, incest among genetically related individuals is a widespread taboo and would thus be less common among biological relatives. They propose that incest among stepfamilies would be less taboo, since there is no risk of genetic degradation. The stress theory proposes that increased stressors, which are inherently more common among stepfamilies, cause an increased risk of abuse. The selection factors theory proposes that individuals who are likely to be stepparents (divorcees) are likely to be inherently more violent due to emotional disturbances, aggressive impulses, and self-esteem issues. Due to this, stepparents as a group would have a higher proportion of individuals with violent-prone characteristics, which would suggest that the abuse is happening due to personality factors, rather than the stepparental relationship directly. Finally, according to resource theory, individuals who contribute resources are granted authority, while individuals that lack resources are denied authority and more likely to resort to violence to obtain authority. It is therefore hypothesized that stepparents who are able to contribute resources to a family and have those resources be accepted by the family are less likely to be abusive. However, this hypothesis had yet to be tested directly on stepfamilies.&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984" /&gt; This paper of Giles-Sims and Finkelhor predates however practically all empirical studies on the Cinderella effect.

===Ethical issues===
Discussing the implications of this line of research, Australian psychologist Greg Tooley, author of a 2006 study confirming the existence of the effect,&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; confessed that "it is certainly difficult to talk about because it is such a hot issue".&lt;ref name=Trounson2008&gt;Andrew Trounson, [http://flwg.com.au/pg/news/view/general_2/children-safer-with Children 'safer with biological parent'], ''[[The Australian]]'', May 07, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37625">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''cognitive load''' refers to the effort being used in the [[working memory]].  Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

''Intrinsic'' cognitive load is the effort associated with a specific topic, ''extraneous'' cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner, and ''germane'' cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge, or a [[schema (psychology)|schema]].

Cognitive load theory was developed  in the late 1980s out of a study of [[problem solving]] by [[John Sweller]].&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=J|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=June 1988|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–285|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller argued that [[instructional design]] can be used to reduce cognitive load in learners.
Much later, other researchers developed a way to measure perceived mental effort which is indicative of cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Paas1993&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paas|first1=Fred G. W.

The elderly, students, and children experience different, and more often higher, amounts of cognitive load.

High cognitive load in the elderly has been shown to affect their center of balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Gerhard|last2=Hagman|first2=Jenni|last3=Talianzadeh|first3=Roya|last4=Svedberg|first4=Alf|last5=Larsen|first5=Hans Christian|title=Effect of cognitive load on postural control|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=May 2002|volume=58|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(02)00770-0|pmid=12121823}}&lt;/ref&gt; With increased distractions, particularly from cell phone use, students are more prone to experiencing high cognitive load which can reduce academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frein|first1=Scott T.|last2=Jones|first2=Samantha L.|last3=Gerow|first3=Jennifer E.|title=When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2013|volume=29|issue=6|pages=2179–2182|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
"Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance".&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Van Merriënboer, J. |author3=Paas, F.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998 |title=Cognitive architecture and instructional design |journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]] |volume= 10 |issue=3 |pages=251–296 |doi=10.1023/A:1022193728205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller's theory employs aspects of [[information processing]] theory to emphasize the inherent limitations of concurrent [[working memory]] load on learning during instruction. It makes use of the [[schema (psychology)|schema]] as primary unit of analysis for the design of [[instructional materials]].

===History===
The history of cognitive load theory can be traced to the beginning of Cognitive Science in the 1950s and the work of [[George Armitage Miller|G.A. Miller]]. In his classic paper,&lt;ref name="Miller, 1956"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller, G.A. |year=1956 |title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity to process information  |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |pages=81–97 |doi=10.1037/h0043158 |pmid=13310704 |issue=2|titlelink=The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller was perhaps the first to suggest our [[Working memory#Capacity|working memory capacity]] has inherent limits.  His experimental results suggested that humans are generally able to hold only [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|seven plus or minus two units]] of information in short-term memory. And in the early 1970s Simon and Chase&lt;ref name="Simon and Chase, 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chase, W.G.  |author2=Simon, H.A. |year=1973 |title=Perception in chess |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=55–81 |doi= 10.1016/0010-0285(73)90004-2|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to use the term "chunk" to describe how people might organize information in short-term memory. This chunking of memory components has also been described as [[schema (psychology)|schema]] construction.

In the late 1980s [[John Sweller]] developed cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving.&lt;ref name="Sweller, 1988"/&gt; Studying learners as they solved problems, he and his associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called [[means-ends analysis]]. He suggests problem solving by means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, which may not be devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.

In the 1990s, cognitive load theory was applied in several contexts. The empirical results from these studies led to the demonstration of several learning effects: the completion-problem effect;&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paas, F. |year=1992 |title=Training strategies for attaining transfer of problem-solving skill in statistics: A cognitive-load approach |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=429–434 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[modality effect]];&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moreno, R. |author2=Mayer, R.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1999 |title=Cognitive principles of multimedia learning: The role of modality and contiguity |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=358–368 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358|citeseerx=10.1.1.458.4719  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mousavi, S. |author2=Low, R. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319–334 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[split-attention effect]];&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1992 |title=The split-attention effect as a factor in the design of instruction |journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=62 |issue=2  |pages=233–246 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.1992.tb01017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[worked-example effect]];&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cooper, G. |author2=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=Effects of schema acquisition and rule automation on mathematical problem-solving transfer |journal= Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=347–362 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sweller, J. |author2=Cooper, G.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1985 |title=The use of worked examples as a substitute for problem solving in learning algebra |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59–89 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[expertise reversal effect]].&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kalyuga, S. |author2=Ayres, P.

==Types==
Cognitive load theory provides a general framework and has broad implications for [[instructional design]], by allowing instructional designers to control the conditions of learning within an environment or, more generally, within most instructional materials. Specifically, it provides empirically-based guidelines that help instructional designers decrease extraneous cognitive load during learning and thus refocus the learner's attention toward germane materials, thereby increasing germane (schema related) cognitive load. This theory differentiates between three types of cognitive load: intrinsic cognitive load, germane cognitive load, and extraneous cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998" /&gt;

===Intrinsic===
''Intrinsic cognitive load'' is the inherent level of difficulty associated with a specific instructional topic. The term was first used in the early 1990s by Chandler and Sweller.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandler, P.  |author2=Sweller, J. |year=1991 |title=Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=293–332 |doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/edupapers/128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, all instruction has an inherent difficulty associated with it (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a [[differential equation]]). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor. However, many schemas may be broken into individual "subschemas" and taught in isolation, to be later brought back together and described as a combined whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1|title=Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=41|issue=2|pages=75–86|year=2006|last1=Kirschner|first1=Paul A.|last2=Sweller|first2=John|last3=Clark|first3=Richard E.|url=http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329224506/http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraneous===
''Extraneous cognitive load'' is generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners and is under the control of instructional designers.&lt;ref name="Chandler &amp; Sweller, 1991" /&gt; This load can be attributed to the design of the instructional materials. Because there is a single limited cognitive resource using resources to process the extraneous load, the amount of resources available to process the intrinsic load and germane load (i.e., learning) is reduced. Thus, especially when intrinsic and/or germane load is high (i.e., when a problem is difficult), materials should be designed so as to reduce the extraneous load.&lt;ref name="Ginns, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ginns, P. |year= 2006 |title=Integrating information: A meta-analysis of the spatial contiguity and temporal contiguity effects |journal=Learning and Instruction |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=511–525 |doi= 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of extraneous cognitive load occurs when there are two possible ways to describe a square to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clark, R. |author2=Nguyen, F. |author3=Sweller, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006 |title=Efficiency in Learning: Evidence-Based Guidelines to Manage Cognitive Load |location=San Francisco |publisher=Pfeiffer |isbn=978-0-7879-7728-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A square is a figure and should be described using a figural medium. Certainly an instructor can describe a square in a verbal medium, but it takes just a second and far less effort to see what the instructor is talking about when a learner is shown a square, rather than having one described verbally. In this instance, the efficiency of the visual medium is preferred. This is because it does not unduly load the learner with unnecessary information. This unnecessary cognitive load is described as extraneous.

Chandler and Sweller introduced the concept of extraneous cognitive load. This article was written to report the results of six experiments that they conducted to investigate this working memory load. Many of these experiments involved materials demonstrating the [[split attention effect]]. They found that the format of instructional materials either promoted or limited learning. They proposed that differences in performance were due to higher levels of the cognitive load imposed by the format of instruction. "Extraneous cognitive load" is a term for this unnecessary (artificially induced) cognitive load.

===Germane===
''Germane cognitive load'' is the processing, construction and automation of [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]. It was first described by Sweller, Van Merriënboer and Paas in 1998. While [https://acmecollinsschool.com/blog/cognitive-load intrinsic cognitive load] is generally thought to be immutable (although techniques can be applied to manage complexity by segmenting and sequencing complex material), instructional designers can manipulate extraneous and germane load. It is suggested that they limit extraneous load and promote germane load.&lt;ref name="Sweller et al., 1998"/&gt;

Until the 1998 article by Sweller, Van Merriënboer &amp; Paas, cognitive load theory primarily concentrated on the reduction of extraneous cognitive load. With this article, cognitive load researchers began to seek ways of redesigning instruction to redirect what would be extraneous load, to now be focused toward schema construction (germane load). Thus it is very important for instructional designers to "reduce extraneous cognitive load and redirect learners' attention to cognitive processes that are directly relevant to the construction of schemas".&lt;ref&gt;(Sweller et al., 1998, p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Paas and Van Merriënboer&lt;ref name=Paas1993/&gt; developed a construct (known as relative condition efficiency) which helps researchers measure perceived mental effort, an index of cognitive load. This construct provides a relatively simple means of comparing instructional conditions. It combines mental effort ratings with performance scores. Group mean z-scores are graphed and may be compared with a one-way [[ANOVA|Analysis of variance (ANOVA)]].

Paas and Van Merriënboer used relative condition efficiency to compare three instructional conditions (worked examples, completion problems, and discovery practice). They found learners who studied worked examples were the most efficient, followed by those who used the problem completion strategy. Since this early study many other researchers have used this and other constructs to measure cognitive load as it relates to learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Paas et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paas, F. |author2=Tuovinen, J.E. |author3=Tabbers, H.K. |author4=Van Gerven, P.W.M.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2003 |title=Cognitive load measurement as a means to advance cognitive load theory |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1207/S15326985EP3801_8|citeseerx=10.1.1.670.1047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ergonomic approach seeks a quantitative neurophysiological expression of cognitive load which can be measured using common instruments, for example using the [[heart rate]]-[[blood pressure]] product (RPP) as a measure of both cognitive and physical occupational workload.&lt;ref name="Fredericks et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fredericks T.K. |author2=Choi S.D. |author3=Hart J. |author4=Butt S.E. |author5=Mital A. |year=2005 |title=An investigation of myocardial aerobic capacity as a measure of both physical and cognitive workloads |journal=International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1097–1107 |doi= 10.1016/j.ergon.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it may be possible to use RPP measures to set limits on workloads and for establishing work allowance.

[[Task-invoked pupillary response]] is a form of measurement that directly reflects the cognitive load on [[working memory]]. Greater pupil dilation is found to be associated with high cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; Pupil constriction occurs when there is low cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Granholm et al. 1996"/&gt; [[Task-invoked pupillary response]] shows a direct correlation with working memory, making it an effective measurement of cognitive load explicitly unrelated to learning.

Some researchers have compared different measures of cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey 2017" /&gt;  For example, Deleeuw and Mayer (2008)&lt;ref name="DeLeeuw and Mayer (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DeLeeuw, K.E. |author2=Mayer, R.E.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=A comparison of three measures of cognitive load: Evidence for separable measures of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=223–234 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.100.1.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared three commonly used measures of cognitive load and found that they responded in different ways to extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load.

M.|location=New York|chapter= Determination of memory load in information processing|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are individual differences in processing capacities between novices and experts.&lt;ref name="Murphy and Wright 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Gregory L.|last2=Wright|first2=Jack C.|title=Changes in conceptual structure with expertise: Differences between real-world experts and novices.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1984|volume=10|issue=1|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.1.144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have more knowledge or experience with regard to a specific task which reduces the cognitive load associated with the task. Novices do not have this experience or knowledge and thus have heavier cognitive load.

It has been theorized that an impoverished environment can contribute to cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Mani et al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mani|first1=A.|last2=Mullainathan|first2=S.|last3=Shafir|first3=E.|last4=Zhao|first4=J.|title=Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function|journal=Science|date=29 August 2013|volume=341|issue=6149|pages=976–980|doi=10.1126/science.1238041|pmid=23990553|bibcode=2013Sci...341..976M|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.6303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the task at hand, or the processes used in solving the task, people who experience poverty also experience higher cognitive load. A number of factors contribute to the cognitive load in people with lower [[socioeconomic status]] that are not present in middle and upper-class people.&lt;ref name="Hackman and Farah"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackman|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|title=Socioeconomic status and the developing brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=February 2009|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.003|pmid=19135405|pmc=3575682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying the processing capacity of individuals could be extremely useful in further adapting instruction (or predicting the behavior) of individuals. Accordingly, further research would clearly be desirable. First, it is essential to compute the memory load imposed by detailed analysis of the processes to be used. Second, it is essential to ensure that individual subjects are actually using those processes. The latter requires intensive pre-training.

==Effects of heavy cognitive load==
{{See also|Audience effect|Drive theory}}
A heavy cognitive load typically creates [[error]] or some kind of interference in the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Paas, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moreno &amp; Mayer, 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandler and Sweller, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Sweller, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweller &amp; Cooper, 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, and Sweller, 2003"/&gt; A heavy cognitive load can also increase [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="Biernat et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biernat|first1=Monica|last2=Kobrynowicz|first2=Diane|last3=Weber|first3=Dara L.|title=Stereotypes and Shifting Standards: Some Paradoxical Effects of Cognitive Load|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=October 2003|volume=33|issue=10|pages=2060–2079|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01875.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stereotype|Stereotyping]] is an extension of the [[Fundamental Attribution Error]] which also increases in frequency with heavier cognitive load.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989&gt;Gilbert, D. T. (1989). Thinking lightly about others: Automatic components of the social inference process. In J. S. Uleman &amp; J. A. Bargh (Eds.), ''Unintended thought'' (pp. 189–211). New York, Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The notions of cognitive load and [[arousal]] contribute to the "Overload Hypothesis" explanation of [[social facilitation]]: in the presence of an audience, subjects tend to perform worse in subjectively complex tasks (whereas they tend to excel in subjectively easy tasks).

==Sub-population studies==
===Elderly===
The danger of heavy cognitive load is seen in the elderly population. Aging can cause declines in the efficiency of [[working memory]] which can contribute to higher cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Wingfield et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wingfield|first1=Arthur|last2=Stine|first2=Elizabeth A.L.|last3=Lahar|first3=Cindy J.|last4=Aberdeen|first4=John S.|title=Does the capacity of working memory change with age?|journal=Experimental Aging Research|date=June 1988|volume=14|issue=2|pages=103–107|doi=10.1080/03610738808259731|pmid=3234452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between heavy cognitive load and control of [[center of mass]] are heavily correlated in the elderly population. As cognitive load increases, the sway in [[center of mass]] in elderly individuals increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = G. | last2 = Hagman | first2 = J. | last3 = Talianzadeh | first3 = R. | last4 = Svedberg | first4 = A. | last5 = Larsen | first5 = H.

Conversely, an increasing demand for balance can increase cognitive load.

===College students===
With the widespread acceptance of laptops in the classroom, an increasing cognitive load while in school is a major concern. With the use of [[Facebook]] and other social forms of communication, adding multiple tasks is hurting students performance in the classroom. When many cognitive resources are available, the probability of switching from one task to another is high and does not lead to optimal switching behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calderwood | first1 = C. | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = P. L. | last3 = Conklin | first3 = E. M. | year = 2014 | title = What else do college students "do" while studying? An investigation of multitasking | url = | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 19–29 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both students who were heavy Facebook users and students who sat nearby those who were heavy [[Facebook]] users performed poorly and resulted in lower [[GPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frein | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Jones | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Gerow | first3 = J. E. | year = 2013 | title = When it comes to Facebook there may be more to bad memory than just multitasking | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 2179–2182 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sana | first1 = F. | last2 = Weston | first2 = T. | last3 = Cepeda | first3 = N.

===Children===
The components of [[working memory]] as proposed by British psychologists, [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]], are in place at 6 years of age.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gathercole|first1=Susan E.|last2=Pickering|first2=Susan J.|last3=Ambridge|first3=Benjamin|last4=Wearing|first4=Hannah|title=The Structure of Working Memory From 4 to 15 Years of Age.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=177–190|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.177|pmid=14979759|date=March 2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.2727}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a clear difference between adult and child knowledge. These differences are due to developmental increases in processing efficiency.&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Children lack general knowledge, and this is what creates increased cognitive load in children. Children in impoverished families often experience even higher cognitive load in learning environments than those in middle-class families.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; These children do not hear, talk, or learn about schooling concepts because their parents often do not have formal education. When it comes to learning, their lack of experience with numbers, words, and concepts increases their cognitive load.

As children grow older they develop superior basic processes and capacities.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alibali|first1=Robert S. Siegler, Martha|title=Children's thinking|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Education/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0131113848|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also develop [[metacognition]], which helps them to understand their own cognitive activities.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; Lastly, they gain greater content knowledge through their experiences.&lt;ref name="Siegler and Alibali"/&gt; These elements help reduce cognitive load in children as they develop.

[[Gesture|Gesturing]] is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ping|first1=Raedy|last2=Goldin-Meadow|first2=Susan|title=Gesturing Saves Cognitive Resources When Talking About Nonpresent Objects|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=34|issue=4|pages=602–619|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01102.x|pmid=21564226|year=2010|pmc=3733275}}&lt;/ref&gt; By gesturing, they can free up [[working memory]] for other tasks.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"/&gt; Pointing allows a child to use the object they are pointing at as the best representation of it, which means they do not have to hold this representation in their [[working memory]], thereby reducing their cognitive load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballard|first1=Dana H.|last2=Hayhoe|first2=Mary M.|last3=Pook|first3=Polly K.|last4=Rao|first4=Rajesh P. N.|title=Deictic codes for the embodiment of cognition|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1 December 1997|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1017/s0140525x97001611|pmid=10097009|pages=723–42; discussion 743–67|citeseerx=10.1.1.49.3813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, gesturing about an object that is absent reduces the difficulty of having to picture it in their mind.&lt;ref name="Gathercole"/&gt;

==Embodiment and interactivity==
Bodily activity can both be advantageous and detrimental to learning depending on how this activity is implemented.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Embodied learning: introducing a taxonomy based on bodily engagement and task integration |journal=Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1186/s41235-018-0092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive load theorists have asked for updates that makes CLT more compatible with insights from [[embodied cognition]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10648-011-9179-2|title=An Evolutionary Upgrade of Cognitive Load Theory: Using the Human Motor System and Collaboration to Support the Learning of Complex Cognitive Tasks|journal=Educational Psychology Review|volume=24|issue=1|pages=27–45|year=2011|last1=Paas|first1=Fred|last2=Sweller|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Embodied Cognitive Load Theory has been suggested as a means to predict the usefulness of interactive features in learning environments.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski et al., 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skulmowski|first1=Alexander|last2=Pradel|first2=Simon|last3=Kühnert|first3=Tom|last4=Brunnett|first4=Guido|last5=Rey|first5=Günter Daniel|title=Embodied learning using a tangible user interface: The effects of haptic perception and selective pointing on a spatial learning task|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=92–93|pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.011|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, the benefits of an interactive feature (such as easier cognitive processing) need to exceed its cognitive costs (such as motor coordination) in order for an embodied mode of interaction to increase learning outcomes.

{{UML diagram types}}
{{see also|Models of communication}}
A '''communication diagram''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) 2.0, is a simplified version of the UML 1.x collaboration diagram.&lt;ref name=Fowler2004 &gt;{{citation | last=Fowler | first=Martin | author-link = Martin Fowler| year=2004 | title=UML distilled: a brief guide to the standard object modeling language | edition=3 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=978-0-321-19368-1  | page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UML has four types of interaction diagrams:
* [[Sequence diagram]]
* Communication diagram
* [[Interaction overview diagram]]
* [[UML Timing Diagram|Timing diagram]]

A Communication diagram models the interactions between objects or parts in terms of sequenced messages. Communication diagrams represent a combination of information taken from [[Class diagram|Class]], [[Sequence diagram|Sequence]], and [[Use case diagram|Use Case Diagrams]] describing both the static structure and dynamic behavior of a system.

However, communication diagrams use the free-form arrangement of objects and links as used in Object diagrams. In order to maintain the ordering of messages in such a free-form diagram, messages are labeled with a chronological number and placed near the link the message is sent over. Reading a communication diagram involves starting at message 1.0, and following the messages from object to object.

Communication diagrams show a lot of the same information as sequence diagrams, but because of how the information is presented, some of it is easier to find in one diagram than the other. Communication diagrams show which elements each one interacts with better, but sequence diagrams show the order in which the interactions take place more clearly.

In [[logic]], and especially in its applications to [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''counterexample''' is an exception to a proposed general rule or law. For example, consider the proposition "all students are lazy". 
Because this statement makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for ''all'' students, even a ''single'' example of a diligent student will prove it false.
Thus, any hard-working student is a counterexample to "all students are lazy".
More precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a [[universal quantification]] (a "for all" statement).

In mathematics, this term is (by a slight abuse) also sometimes used for examples illustrating the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem, by considering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not verified, and where one can show that the conclusion does not hold.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==In mathematics==
In mathematics, counterexamples are often used to prove the boundaries of possible theorems. By using counterexamples to show that certain conjectures are false, mathematical researchers avoid going down blind alleys and learn how to modify conjectures to produce provable theorems.

===Rectangle example===
Suppose that a mathematician is studying [[geometry]] and [[shape]]s, and she wishes to prove certain theorems about them. She [[conjecture]]s that "All [[rectangles]] are [[Square (geometry)|squares]]". She can either attempt to [[Mathematical proof|prove]] the truth of this statement using [[deductive reasoning]], or if she suspects that her conjecture is false, she might attempt to find a counterexample. In this case, a counterexample would be a rectangle that is not a square, like a rectangle with two sides of length 5 and two sides of length 7. However, despite having found rectangles that were not squares, all the rectangles she did find had four sides. She then makes the new conjecture "All rectangles have four sides". This is weaker than her original conjecture, since every square has four sides, even though not every four-sided shape is a square.

The previous paragraph explained how a mathematician might weaken her conjecture in the face of counterexamples, but counterexamples can also be used to show that the assumptions and [[hypothesis]] are needed. Suppose that after a while the mathematician in question settled on the new conjecture "All shapes that are rectangles and have four sides of equal length are squares". This conjecture has two parts to the hypothesis: the shape must be 'a rectangle' and 'have four sides of equal length' and the mathematician would like to know if she can remove either assumption and still maintain the truth of her conjecture. So she needs to check the truth of the statements: (1) "All shapes that are rectangles are squares" and (2) "All shapes that have four sides of equal length are squares". A counterexample to (1) was already given, and a counterexample to (2) is a non-square [[rhombus]]. Thus the mathematician sees that both assumptions were necessary.

===Other mathematical examples===
{{See also|Counterexamples in topology|Minimal counterexample}}

A counterexample to the statement "all [[prime number]]s are [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]]" is the number 2, as it is a prime number but is not an odd number. Neither of the numbers 7 or 10 is a counterexample, as neither contradicts the statement. In this example, 2 is the only possible counterexample to the statement, but only a single example is needed to contradict "''All'' prime numbers are odd numbers". Similarly the statement "All [[natural number]]s are either [[Prime number|prime]] or [[Composite number|composite]]" has the number 1 as a counterexample as 1 is neither prime nor composite.

[[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]] was disproved by counterexample. It asserted that at least ''n'' ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers were necessary to sum to another ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lander, Parkin|year=1966|title=Counterexample to Euler's conjecture on sums of like powers|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=Americal Mathematical Society|volume=72|page=1079|issn=0273-0979|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1966-72-06/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3/S0002-9904-1966-11654-3.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a counterexample involving ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5; other ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 counterexamples are now known, as are some ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 counterexamples.

[[Witsenhausen's counterexample]] shows that it is not always true for [[control theory|control problems]] that a quadratic [[loss function]] and a linear equation of evolution of the [[state variable]] imply optimal control laws that are linear.

Other examples include the disproofs of the [[Seifert conjecture]], the [[Pólya conjecture]], the conjecture of [[Hilbert's fourteenth problem]], [[Tait's conjecture]], and the [[Ganea conjecture]].

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], counterexamples are usually used to argue that a certain philosophical position is wrong by showing that it does not apply in certain cases. Unlike [[mathematician]]s, philosophers cannot prove their claims beyond any doubt, so other philosophers are free to disagree and try to find counterexamples in response. Of course, now the first philosopher can argue that the alleged counterexample does not really apply.

Alternatively, the first philosopher can modify their claim so that the counterexample no longer applies; this is analogous to when a mathematician modifies a conjecture because of a counterexample.

For example, in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', [[Callicles]], trying to define what it means to say that some people are "better" than others, claims that those who are stronger are better.

But [[Socrates]] replies that, because of their strength of numbers, the class of common rabble is stronger than the propertied class of nobles, even though the masses are [[prima facie]] of worse character. Thus Socrates has proposed a counterexample to Callicles' claim, by looking in an area that Callicles perhaps did not expect — groups of people rather than individual persons.

Callicles might challenge Socrates' counterexample, arguing perhaps that the common rabble really are better than the nobles, or that even in their large numbers, they still are not stronger. But if Callicles accepts the counterexample, then he must either withdraw his claim or modify it so that the counterexample no longer applies. For example, he might modify his claim to refer only to individual persons, requiring him to think of the common people as a collection of individuals rather than as a mob.

As it happens, he modifies his claim to say "wiser" instead of "stronger", arguing that no amount of numerical superiority can make people wiser.

The term '''directed evolution''' is used within the [[transhumanist]] community to refer to the idea of applying the principles of [[directed evolution]] and [[experimental evolution]] to the control of human evolution.&lt;ref name=mehlman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Mehlman|title=Will Directed Evolution Destroy Humanity, and If So, What Can We Do About It?|url=http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|publisher=3 St. Louis U.J. Health L. &amp; Pol'y 93, 96-97 (2009]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210230309/http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is distinct from the use of the term in [[biochemistry]], which refers only to the evolution of [[proteins]] and [[RNA]]. Maxwell J. Melhmanh has described directed evolution of humans as the Holy Grail of [[transhumanism]].&lt;ref name = mehlman/&gt;
Oxford philosopher [[Julian Savulescu]] wrote that:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity until this point has been a story of evolution for the survival genes - survival and reproduction ... we are entering a new phase of human evolution—evolution under reason—where human beings are masters of their destiny. Power has been transferred from nature to science.

According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] biophysicist [[Gregory Stock]]:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity is leaving its childhood and moving into its adolescence as its powers infuse into realms hitherto beyond our reach.
 |source = [[Gregory Stock]] &lt;ref name=gstock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stock|first1=Gregory|title=Germinal Choice Technology and the Human Future|journal=Ethics L. &amp; Moral Phil. Reprod. Biomedicine|date=2005|volume=10|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riccardo Campa]], from the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], wrote that "self-directed evolution" can be coupled with many different political, philosophical, and religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campa|first1=Riccardo|title=Toward a transhumanist politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/campa20090622/|website=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that referring to [[transhumanism]] as directed evolution is problematic because evolution is ateleological and transhumanism is [[teleological]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askland|first1=Andrew|title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution|journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–78|url=https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227044619/https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant evolution==
Participant evolution is an alternative term that refers to the process of deliberately redesigning the [[human body]] and [[Human brain|brain]] using [[Technology|technological]] means, rather than through the natural processes of [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], with the goal of removing "biological limitations" and human enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=28HEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|title=Human Nature in an Age of Biotechnology: The Case for Mediated Posthumanism|first=Tamar|last=Sharon|date=11 October 2013|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiOheK_2uZ8C&amp;pg=PA376|title=Biomedicalization: Technoscience, Health, and Illness in the U.S.|first1=Adele E.|last1=Clarke|first2=Laura|last2=Mamo|first3=Jennifer Ruth|last3=Fosket|first4=Jennifer R.|last4=Fishman|first5=Janet K.|last5=Shim|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WgPHCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|title=The Cybernetics Moment: Or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age|first=Ronald R.|last=Kline|date=25 June 2015|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mZLV5wLbQvAC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Iphigenias at Aulis: Textual Multiplicity, Radical Philology|first=Sean Alexander|last=Gurd|date=1 January 2005|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WK3Wj2bwHScC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Panic Diaries: A Genealogy of Panic Disorder|first=Jackie|last=Orr|date=8 February 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Ix1HCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Transcend the Flesh: Transhumanism debate|first=Tobiasz|last=Mazan|date=17 April 2015|publisher=Tobiasz Mazan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g7mZw8FSHpwC|title=Beyond Human: From Animality to Transhumanism|first1=Charlie|last1=Blake|first2=Claire|last2=Molloy|first3=Steven|last3=Shakespeare|date=15 March 2012|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7CIeXt8yIhkC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Frontiers of Cyberspace|first=Daniel|last=Riha|date=28 December 2016|publisher=Rodopi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=629wC2skzb0C&amp;pg=PA125|title=Rape of the Wild: Man's Violence Against Animals and the Earth|first1=Andrée|last1=Collard|first2=Joyce|last2=Contrucci|date=1 January 1989|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pDg3jDHDBSUC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Shaw and Science Fiction|first=Milton T.|last=Wolf|date=1 January 1997|publisher=[[Penn State Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |date=1961 |title=Drugs, Space, and Cybernetics: Evolution to Cyborgs |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208174752/http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Clynes and Kline saw participant evolution as the process of creating [[cyborg]]s, the idea has been adopted and propounded by [[Transhumanism|transhumanists]] who argue that individuals should have the choice of using [[human enhancement]] technologies on themselves and their children, to progressively become [[transhuman]] and ultimately [[posthuman]], as part of a voluntary regimen of participant evolution.

'''Discrete trial training''' ('''DTT'''; also called '''discrete trial instruction''' or '''DTI''') is a technique used by practitioners of [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) that was developed by [[Ole Ivar Lovaas|Ivar Lovaas]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). DTT is a practitioner-led, structured instructional procedure that breaks tasks down into simple subunits to [[shaping (psychology)|shape]] new skills. Often employed up to 6–7 hours per day for children with [[autism]], the technique relies on the use of [[Applied behavior analysis#Prompting|prompts]], [[observational learning|modeling]], and [[positive reinforcement]] strategies to facilitate the child's learning. It is also noted for its previous use of [[aversives]] to [[Punishment (psychology)|punish]] unwanted behaviors.

Lovaas spent most of his career conducting groundbreaking research on the use of this methodology to teach [[autism|autistic]] children. As of 2005,&lt;ref name=LOI /&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO /&gt; two studies have shown that most children with autism under the age of 5 who received structured '''early intensive behavioral intervention''' (EIBI), or 35–40 hours per week of DTT, had gained significant language, intellectual, and adaptive skills. The first, a seminal{{weasel inline|date=November 2017}} study by Lovaas (1987) reported that 47% of such children acquired typical language and academic skills, and were placed into mainstream classrooms at age 7. Follow-up measures in 1993 showed that nearly each "were indistinguishable from average children on tests of [social], intelligence, and adaptive behavior."&lt;ref name=Lovaas1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeCenter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.behavior.org/item.php?id=147|title=Behavioral Treatment of Autistic Children with O.

Luce|work=[[Pro-Ed]]|date=May 1, 1996||accessdate=January 6, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The study, later, received praise in a mental health report by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] in 1999.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Since 2009, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] identified EIBI and the early start denver model (ESDM)&amp;mdash;a comprehensive early intervention that consists of both developmental, play therapy and [[Pivotal response treatment|naturalistic ABA]]&amp;mdash;as the only evidence-based clinical interventions for the population. While EIBI is "well-established," the ESDM is "emerging."{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

==Implementation==
The Lovaas approach is a highly structured comprehensive program that relies heavily on discrete trial training (DTT) methods. Within Lovaas therapy, DTT is used to reduce stereotypical autistic behaviours through extinction and the provision of socially acceptable alternatives to self-stimulatory behaviors.  Intervention can start when a child is as young as three and can last from two to six years.  Progression through goals of the program are determined on an individual basis and are not determined by which year the client has been in the program.  The first year seeks to reduce self-stimulating ("[[stimming]]") behavior, teaches imitation, establishes playing with toys in their intended manner, and integration of the family into the treatment protocol.  The second year teaches early expressive and abstract linguistic skills, peer interaction, basic socializing skills, and strives to include the individual's community in the treatment to optimize mainstreaming while eliminating any possible sources of stigmatization.  The third year focuses on emotional expression and variation in addition to observational learning, and pre-academic skills such as reading writing, and arithmetic.  Rarely is the technique implemented for the first time with adults.&lt;ref name=LOI&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovaas OI |title=Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young children with autism |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |date=February 1987 |pmid=3571656 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.55.1.3|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/55/1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallows GO, Graupner TD |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for children with autism: four-year outcome and predictors |journal=Am J Ment Retard |volume=110 |issue=6 |pages=417–38 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16212446 |doi=10.1352/0895-8017(2005)110[417:IBTFCW]2.0.CO;2 |url= |issn=0895-8017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lovaas method is ideally performed five to seven days a week with each session lasting from five to seven hours, totaling an average of 35–40 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobson JW, Mulick JA, Green G | year = 1998 | title = Cost-benefit estimates for early intensive behavioral intervention for young children with autism: General model and single state case | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 201–226 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-078x(199811)13:4&lt;201::aid-bin17&gt;3.0.co;2-r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each session is divided into trials with intermittent breaks.  The trials do not have a specified time limit to allow for a natural conclusion when the communicator feels the child is losing focus. Each trial is composed of a series of [[prompt (psychology)|prompt]]s ([[Words|verbal]], [[gesture|gestural]], physical, etc.) that are issued by the "communicator" who is positioned directly across the table from the individual receiving treatment.
These prompts can range from "put in"," put on"," show me"," give to me" and so on, in reference to an object, color, simple imitative [[gesture]], etc.  The concept is centered on [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] the child to correctly respond to the prompts, increasing the attentive ability of the individual, and mainstreaming the child for academic success.  Should the child fail to respond to a prompt, a "prompter," seated behind the child, uses either a partial-, a simple nudge or touch on the hand or arm or a full-, hand over hand assistance until the prompt has been completed, physical guide to correct the individual's mistake or non-compliance.  Each correct response is [[reinforce]]d with verbal praise, an edible, time with a preferred toy, or any combination thereof.&lt;ref name=LOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=SGO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovaas1993&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McEachin JJ, Smith T, Lovaas OI |title=Long-term outcome for children with autism who received early intensive behavioral treatment |journal=Am J Ment Retard |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=359–72; discussion 373–91 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8427693 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DTT is often used in conjunction with the [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS) as it primes the child for an easy transition between treatment types.

Newark, DE: Pyramid Educational Products Inc&lt;/ref&gt;  PECS operates on a similar premise to DTT in that it uses systematic [[chaining]] to teach the individual to pair the concept of expressive speech with an object.  It is structured in a similar fashion to DTT, in that each session begins with a preferred reinforcer survey to ascertain what would most motivate the child and effectively facilitate learning.&lt;ref name=FLA/&gt;

More than 500 articles have been published showing the effectiveness of the Lovaas technique for children with autism.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lovaas O.I. |author2=Wright Scott | year = 2006 | title = A Reply to Recent Public Critiques… | url = | journal = JEIBI | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 221–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|reason=Not a review paper|date=November 2017}} Questions concerning the effectiveness of the method involve reports of recovery from autism, based on the intervention.

The Lovaas technique was developed based on research performed by Ivar Lovaas and his assistants.&lt;ref name=SGO /&gt; This research reported that 47% of those children who had received the Lovaas treatment protocol of an average of 40 hours of intensive therapy, were mainstreamed into regular classrooms, and were classified as "indistinguishable" from their peers in follow-up studies.  Although subsequent studies have shown that intensive behavioral therapy clearly benefited children with autism, it has been claimed that Lovaas's original claims of effectiveness were overstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2005 |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=493–99 |title= Autism interventions: a critical update |author= Francis K |pmid=15991872 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=313204 |format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0012162205000952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 California study found that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), the Lovaas technique used for very young children, was substantially more effective for preschool children with autism than the mixture of methods provided in many programs.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard JS, Sparkman CR, Cohen HG, Green G, Stanislaw H |title=A comparison of intensive behavior analytic and eclectic treatments for young children with autism |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=359–83 |year=2005 |pmid=15766629 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2004.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study did not use random assignment or a uniform assessment protocol, and provided limited information about the intervention, making it difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schoneberger T |year=2006 |title=EIBT research after Lovaas (1987): a tale of two studies |journal=J Speech-Lang Pathol Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=210–217 |url=http://www.baojournal.com/SLP-ABA%20WEBSITE/Volume-indexes.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320170056/http://baojournal.com/SLP-ABA%20WEBSITE/Volume-indexes.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith et al. (2002)&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith T, Lovaas NW, Lovaas OI | year = 2002 | title = Behaviors of children with high-functioning autism when paired with typically developing versus delayed peers: A preliminary study | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 129–143 | doi = 10.1002/bin.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a preliminary study of nine high-functioning children with autism, all of whom were previous recipients of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), of ages five to seven in free play settings.  The purpose was to assess the effects of EIBI on solitary activities, ritualistic behaviors, and social activity when exposed to the two experimental groups. Each child participated in four one-hour sessions consisting of 15 minute periods of play with either a typically developing peer or a lower functioning child with autism who had major deficits in pragmatic communication, social interaction and self-care.  The children had never met prior to these experimental sessions.  The period of play began with 15 minutes of play with either the typically developed (TD) peer or the developmentally disabled (DD) peer, and alternated accordingly in one of two variations: TD-DD-TD-DD or DD-TD-DD-TD.  Observers rated play on five criteria: i. interactive toy play, ii. interactive speech, iii. solitary toy play, iv. solitary speech, and v. self-stimulation.  Data showed the high-functioning children displayed significantly more instances of interactive play and interactive speech when paired with the typically developed peer.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}}

The Lovaas technique is best generalized when paired with natural settings, and the implementation is clearly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferraioli | first1 = Suzannah | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Carrie | last3 = Smith | first3 = Tristram | year = 2005 | title = A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism | url = | journal = JEIBI | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 224–229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A good sense of direction is needed when planning for intervention.  Although this is one approach, many children on the autism spectrum learn differently and this needs to be taken into account to ensure the Lovaas approach is effective for all. It has been shown that, for some children with autism, typical peer interaction can increase the chance of leading a normal life. Lovaas techniques are cost effective for administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Converting to a Behavior Analysis Format for Autism Services: Decision-Making for Educational Administrators, Principals, and Consultants | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 6–16 | doi=10.1037/h0099889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aversives==
While the therapy has always relied principally on [[positive reinforcement]] of preferred behavior, Lovaas's original technique also included more extensive use of [[aversives]] such as striking, shouting, or using electrical shocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |vauthors=Moser D, Grant A |title= Screams, slaps and love |date=1965-05-07 |work= Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures have been widely abandoned for over a decade.  A review of literature by autistic [[activist]] [[Michelle Dawson]] asserts that the method has become less effective since these stimuli were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html | title = The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists: Ethical Challenges to the Autism-ABA Industry | accessdate = 2007-06-10 | last = Dawson | first = Michelle | authorlink = Michelle Dawson | date = 2004-01-18}} Note that this is a self-published document, and has not been subject to a [[peer review]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  Only one institution, the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center|Judge Rotenberg Center]], still employs electric shocks as aversives—a practice that continues to cause them considerable legal and political controversy.&lt;ref name="MJ2007"&gt;{{cite news | url  =https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html | title = School of Shock|first =Jennifer | last = Gonnerman|publisher=[[Mother Jones Magazine]]|date=20 August 2007|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some to question whether the use of aversives by those in behavioral institutions should be limited to those who are licensed (see [[licensed behavior analyst]]). {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Cost of care==
A concern that parents have brought up regarding Lovaas is the cost, which in April 2002 amounted to about US$4,200 per month ($50,000 annually per child).&lt;ref name="examining"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elder | first = Jennifer Harrison | year = 2002 | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Nursing | url = http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1827603/Current-treatments-in-autism-examining.html | title = Current treatments in autisms: Examining scientific evidence and clinical implications | volume = 34 | issue =  2 | pages = 67–73 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | doi = 10.1097/01376517-200204000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the 20–40 hours per week intensity of the program, often conducted at home, may place additional stress on already challenged families.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

Another study estimated the expenses of a three-year period of DTT to total a conservative cost of $20,000 and the extreme cost of $60,000, with a yearly average of $40,000.  These costs were based on a sliding scale model that would be adjusted accordingly to socio-economic status and parental involvement.  Yearly expenditures were predicted to drop to an average of $22,500 a year when parents and family became involved in the process.  Additional family involvement would subsequently alleviate case manager and paraprofessional hours by assuming their roles in the process.  The upfront costs of DTT for the state of Texas would initially amount to $67,500 for three years compared to the currently state budgeted $33,000 for Special Education.  The difference is predicted to be recovered within five years of the initial implementation of the program.  Texas would experience a 72% reduction in expenses in the 15 year offset following the conclusion of DTT, amounting to a total savings of $84,300 per child.&lt;ref name=CGS&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chasson GS, Harris GE, Nealy WT | year = 2007 | title = Cost comparison of early intensive behavioral intervention and special education for children with autism | url = | journal = Journal of Family Studies | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 401–441 | doi = 10.1007/s10826-006-9094-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TKC/&gt;

However, in the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires school districts to provide a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to ''all'' children over the age of three.  Many administrative rulings{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} and court decisions{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} have found 35–40 hours per week of EIBI to be FAPE.  Parents may wish to consider hiring an attorney or advocate if their school district denies EIBT.

Thomas et al. (2007)&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt; conducted a survey study that involved 383 families with children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder from North Carolina.  Three quarters of these families reported using a major treatment plan.  Of these, college or graduate degree holding parents were two to four times more likely to use a neurologist and/or PECS.  Annual incomes of $50,000 or more had higher rates of using developmental pediatricians and speech/language therapists.  Racial and ethnic minorities were half as likely to see a case manager.  These families also had a quarter of the odds of seeing a psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or implementing sensory integration.&lt;ref name=TKC/&gt; This supports several other national studies that concluded racial and ethnic families, parents with a low degree of education, and those not residing in a metropolitan area were more likely to receive limited care, utilize a less diverse range of services and less likely to follow a major treatment plan.&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurth J, Shaw E, Izeman S, Whaley K, Rogers S | year = 1999 | title = Areas of agreement about effective practices among programs serving young children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Infants and Young Children | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 17–26 | doi=10.1097/00001163-199910000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Both the national studies and the North Carolinian study yielded a correlation between high stress levels and amount of services sought.&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rogers S | year = 1998 | title = Neuropsychology of autism in young children and its implications for early intervention | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 104–112 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2779(1998)4:2&lt;104::aid-mrdd7&gt;3.3.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families that did not identify with a major treatment approach had one fifth to one half the odds of using support of friends and family in providing care.  Therapeutic support services (PECS, parent support classes, sensory integration, casein- and gluten-free diets) were also one fifth to one half as likely to be used compared to families identifying with major treatment plans.&lt;ref name=TKC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = KC | last2 = Ellis | first2 = AR | last3 = McLaurin | first3 = C | last4 = Daniels | first4 = J | last5 = Morrissay | first5 = JP | year = 2007 | title = Access to care for autism related Services | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 1902–1912 | doi = 10.1007/j10803-006-0323-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance coverage is another major determinant in the amount of support services received.  Recipients of Medicaid or other forms of public health insurance have 2-11 times the odds of using services that are considered medically necessary.  Utilization of respite, PECS, case managers, speech or language therapists also increases markedly in this bracket compared to families with private insurance.&lt;ref name="TKC"/&gt;

Rising costs in education and the provision of adequate care for developmentally disabled individuals have been a continuing concern for state policy makers and tax payers alike.  A study was conducted on cost comparison of 18 years of traditional Special Education on [[Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention]] (EIBI) for children with autism.  The Texas state budget for the year 2002 allotted $11,000 per child for Special Education.  The study suggested the state would save an average of $208,500 per child over an 18-year period by implementing DTT in early childhood, effectively curbing or eliminating future special needs costs by preparing the child academically for mainstreaming.  This amounted to a potential total savings of $2.9 billion over an 18-year period for a cohort consisting of 10,000 children with autism.&lt;ref name=CGS /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Gresham and MacMillar (1998)&lt;ref name=GRE&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gresham FM, MacMillar DL | year = 1998 | title = Early intervention project: Can its claims be substantiated and its effects replicated? | doi = 10.1023/A:1026002717402 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | pmid = 9546297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically cite a lack of a true experimental design in Lovaas' (1987) experiment on early intervention.  They charge that he instead implemented a [[quasi-experiment]]al design of matched pairs regarding the distribution of subjects within the experimental and control groups.  Gresham and MacMillar (1998)&lt;ref name="GRE"/&gt; also state a lack of a true representation of autism in that the subjects were neither randomly sampled from the population of individuals with autism nor were they randomly assigned to treatment groups.  The [[internal validity]] of the study was also called into question due to the possibility of skewed data resulting from three influential threats.  Instrumentation, changes or variations in measurement of procedures over time, was argued to have been altered in both the pre-test and post-test conditions which were confounded by a differentiation in ascertaining cognitive abilities and intelligence of the subjects.  The pre-test utilized four measures of cognitive ability and mental development.  Five of the subjects' intelligence was determined through a parent-reported measure of adaptive behavior.  All of the subjects were post-tested three years later using five other measures of intelligence and cognitive ability.  Long-term follow-up was assessed with three measurements of (1) intelligence, (2) nonverbal reasoning, and (3) receptive language.  The original three measurements during the testing phase were determined by (1) IQ score, (2) class placement, and (3) promotion/retention.&lt;ref name="GRE" /&gt;  External validity was called into question concerning sample characteristics.  Lovaas' (1987) criteria for acceptance into the program required a psychological mental age greater than 11 months and a chronological age less than 46 months in the case of [[echolalia|echolalic]] children.  Schopler et al. (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schopler E, Short A, Meisbov G | year = 1989 | title = Relation of behavioral treatment to "normal functioning": Comment on lovaas | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 162–164 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.57.1.162}}&lt;/ref&gt; purport that if both the intellectual and echolalia criteria were rigidly adhered to at the North Carolina institute, approximately 57% of the referrals would have been excluded from the program.

Other criticisms include a failure to [[operationalize|operationally]] define the use of the term 'reinforcement' for compliance, the use of a [[Pro-rated Mental Age]], and the [[statistical regression]] of the child's IQ over time.&lt;ref name="GRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EIS&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eikeseth S | year = 2001 | title = Recent critiques of the ucla young autism project | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 249–264 | doi = 10.1002/bin.095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyd (1998)&lt;ref name=BYD&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boyd RD | year = 1998 | title = Sex as possible source of group inequivalence in Lovaas (1998) | doi = 10.1023/A:1026065321080 | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 211–215 | pmid = 9656132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed the potential impact of a disproportionate [[sex ratio]] of females to males on the control group's mean IQ score. One study showed females with autism displayed slightly lower levels of functioning in comparison to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lord C, Schopler E | year = 1982 | title = Sex differences in autism | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 317–330 | doi=10.1007/bf01538320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rejoinder to Boyd's (1998)&lt;ref name="BYD"/&gt; article that cited an unequal sex ratio as a source of error, Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name=LLL&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovaas OI | year = 1998 | title = Sex and bias: Reply to Boyd | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 343–344 | doi=10.1023/a:1026020905266}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed three reasons as to why the disproportionate ratio's influence on the data was negligible.  The autistic population at the time had a ratio of 4:1.  Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name="LLL"/&gt; argued that the ratios for the experimental group, control group 1, and control group 2 of 16:3, 11:8, and 16:5, respectively, were in fact near the expected ratio scale of the general population with the exception of control group 1.  The second argument lay in the studies Boyd (1998)&lt;ref name="BYD"/&gt; referenced in regards to low intellectual performance in females diagnosed with autism.  One of the studies admitted to having a female subject with [[Rett disorder]], a condition that showed little responsiveness to intensive early behavioral intervention.  Lovaas (1998)&lt;ref name="LLL"/&gt; concluded by proposing that males may more readily meet diagnostic criteria for autism because of certain salient characteristics inherent in the sex while the subtleties in their female counterparts may be overlooked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">{{for|ecological validity as a type of experimental validity|ecological validity}}
The '''ecological validity''' of a [[sensory cue]] in [[perception]] is the correlation between the cue (something an organism might be able to measure from the [[proximal stimulus]]) and a property of the world (some aspect of the [[distal stimulus]]).  For example, the [[color]] of a [[banana]] is a cue that indicates whether the banana is ripe.  This particular cue has an ecological validity close to 1, because a banana's ripeness is highly correlated with its color.  By contrast, the presence of a [[sticker]] on the banana is a cue with an ecological validity close to 0, if (as seems likely) ripe and unripe bananas (in a fruit bowl, say) are equally likely to have stickers on them.

The concept of ecological validity is closely related to [[likelihood]] in [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] [[statistical inference]] and to [[cue validity]] in [[statistics]].

== History of terminology ==
[[Egon Brunswik]] defined the term "ecological validity" in the 1940s to describe a cue's informativeness.  His students have written that the now-common use of "ecological validity" to describe a type of experimental validity was a corruption of his original terminology (see external link to paper by Hammond).  Brunswik used the words ''[[representative design]]'' to describe what is now usually called the [[external validity]] of an experiment; this in turn depends partly on what is now usually called the [[ecological validity]] of the experiment.  As originally defined by Brunswik, however, ecological validity was a property of a cue, not a property of an experiment.

'''Education in Japan''' is compulsory at the elementary and lower secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |title=Foreign Press Club of Japan Fact Book |publisher=Fpcj.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616132127/http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but [[private education]] is popular at the upper secondary and university levels.

Education prior to elementary school is provided at [[kindergarten]]s and [[Day care|day-care]] centers. Public and private day-care centers take children from under age 1 on up to 5 years old. The programmes for those children aged 3–5 resemble those at kindergartens. The educational approach at kindergartens varies greatly from unstructured environments that emphasize play to highly structured environments that are focused on having the child pass the entrance exam at a private elementary school. The academic year starts from April and ends in March, having summer vacation in August and winter vacation in the end of December to the beginning of January. Also, there are few days of holidays between academic years. The period of academic year is the same all through elementary level to higher educations nationwide.

Japanese students consistently rank highly among OECD students in terms of quality and performance in reading literacy, math, and sciences. The average student scored 540 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the country has one of the world's highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries.&lt;ref name="Education OECD Better Life"/&gt; Its populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan’s post-war [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic growth]]. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering, benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oecd.org/edu/Japan-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf | title=Japan | publisher=OECD | accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, Japan’s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the [[OECD]] average of 4.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/25/national/public-education-spending-japan-lowest-oecd-sixth-straight-year/#.WBQMCxM5p88 | title=Public education spending in Japan lowest in OECD for sixth straight year | publisher=The Japan Times | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Tomoko Otake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other [[Higher education in Japan|higher education]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |title=School Education |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]] |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102112620/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's education system played a central part in Japan's recovery and [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|rapid economic growth]] in the decades following the end of [[World War II]]. After World War II, the [[Fundamental Law of Education]] and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of [[Primary education|elementary school]], three years of [[Middle school|junior high school]], three years of high school, and two or four years of university.
Although Japan ranks highly on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] tests, its educational system has been criticized for its focus on standardized testing and conformity;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/the-limits-of-japanese-education-and-its-focus-on-cramming/?_r=0 |title=Bad Education |last=Harney |first=Alexandra |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; bullying problems;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/01/asia/japan-teen-suicides/ |title=Japan's worst day for teen suicides |last=Wright |first=Rebecca |publisher=CNN |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/japans-cutthroat-school-system-a-cautionary-tale-for-the-us/281612/ |title=Japan's Cutthroat School System: A Cautionary Tale for the U.S. |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |publisher=''The Atlantic |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/06/interview-bullying-lgbt-kids-japans-schools |title=Interview: The Bullying of LGBT Kids in Japan's Schools |last=Braunschweiger |first=Army |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}} "School bullying is notorious in Japan and has been for decades.

==History==
{{main|History of education in Japan}}
[[File:Terakoya for girls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Terakoya]] for girls in the [[Edo period]]]]

Formal education in Japan began with the adoption of [[Chinese culture]], in the 6th century. [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings as well as [[science]]s, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[divination]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] were taught at the courts of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto|Heian]]. Scholar officials were chosen through an [[Imperial examination]] system. But contrary to China, the system never fully took hold and titles and posts at the court remained hereditary family possessions. The rise of the ''[[Samurai|bushi]]'', the military class, during the [[Kamakura period]] ended the influence of scholar officials, but Buddhist monasteries remained influential centers of learning.

In the [[Edo period]], the  [[Yushima Seidō]] in Edo was the chief educational institution of the state; and at its head was the ''Daigaku-no-kami'', a title which identified the leader of the Tokugawa training school for shogunate bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Boyd. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBqWbDmFsfEC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq= ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing,'' Vol. 1, p. 522;] De Bary, William ''et al.'' (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=  ''Sources of Japanese Tradition,'' Vol. 2, p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the [[daimyō]] vied for power in the largely pacified country. Since their influence could not be raised through war, they competed on the economic field. Their warrior-turned-bureaucrat Samurai elite had to be educated not only in military strategy and the martial arts, but also agriculture and accounting. Likewise, the wealthy merchant class needed education for their daily business, and their wealth allowed them to be patrons of arts and science. But temple schools ([[terakoya]]) educated peasants too, and it is estimated that at the end of the Edo period 50% of the male and 20% of the female population possessed some degree of literacy. Even though contact with foreign countries was restricted, books from China and Europe were eagerly imported and [[Rangaku]] ("Dutch studies") became a popular area of scholarly interest.

There were facilities that were created to specifically educate samurai and their children to perpetuate morality and mindfulness of their class. These schools, hanko schools, were where scholars would bring together samurai to listen to lectures on Confucianism, military arts, and other subjects. Samurai would then attempt to teach villagers what they had learned, “proper guidance to the common people’s spirit and manners,” by posting flyers and creating handbooks &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyosawa|first=Noboru|date=1961|title=Adult Eduction in Japan in the Edo Period|doi=10.1177/074171366101200102|journal=Adult Education|volume=12|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some Shogun and Daimyo were also interested in spreading education throughout their protected land with the target audience as adult commoners and children. Elementary education was imparted as well as writing and morality lessons. The Shirakawa Village School’s town bulletin explains the point of education for the commoners, “If not only the important people of the village but also the lesser people have continuous teaching from the appointed village schools, they will gain understanding” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. ‘Commoners’ would also form many communal gatherings to attempt and Englishmen themselves with the help of a scholar. To name one, [[Baigan Ishida]], who was a great orator and writer that reached the outcropping of the merchant class. There were [[Wakashu-gumi|wakashu]]-gumi, or youth groups, that consisted of young men ages fourteen to seventeen, who at these groups learned about ceremonies, cooperative living, language, manners, marriage, straw weaving, and world information, not to mention talking and singing. Japan was thriving with the want for enlightenment. One may say the need for more education is one of the reasons why the Tokugawa Shogunate failed in 1868. 

===Meiji Restoration===
After the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, the methods and structures of Western learning were adopted as a means to make Japan a strong, modern nation. Students and even high-ranking government officials were sent abroad to study, such as the [[Iwakura mission]]. Foreign scholars, the so-called ''[[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'', were invited to teach at newly founded universities and military academies. Compulsory education was introduced, mainly after the [[Prussian education system|Prussian model]]. In order to aid in the modernization the country, the Meiji government built a public library in 1872 modeled after Western architecture. The Japan Library Association (or the JLA) was founded in 1892 to promote the library. However, public education became the main focus of the Meiji government before they could strengthen the library’s presence in 1899. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/div-comm/pdf/Library_in_Japan.pdf|title=Public Libraries in Japan|last=Nagata|first=Haruki|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 1890, only 20 years after the resumption of full international relations, Japan discontinued employment of the foreign consultants.

A modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji period leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state. The Western-style school was introduced as the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Platt, "Japanese Childhood, Modern Childhood: The Nation-State, the School, and 19th-Century Globalization," '' Journal of Social History,'' Summer 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp 965-985&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Uno, ''Passages to Modernity: Motherhood, Childhood, and Social Reform in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones, ''Children as Treasures: Childhood and the Middle Class in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-WWII===
After the defeat in World War II, the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] government set [[Educational reform in occupied Japan|education reform]] as one of its primary goals, to eradicate militarist teachings and convert Japan into a pacifist democracy. Nine years of education was made mandatory, with six years in elementary education and three in junior high as an emulation of the American educational system. A number of reforms were carried out in the post-war period that aimed at easing the burden of entrance examinations, promoting internationalization and information technologies, diversifying education and supporting lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lessons from PISA for the United States |chapter=Japan: A Story of Sustained Excellence |chapter-url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/lessons-from-pisa-for-the-united-states/japan-a-story-of-sustained-excellence_9789264096660-7-en  |date=2011-05-17|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)|pages=137–157|language=en|doi=10.1787/9789264096660-7-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimizutani|first=Satoshi|date=2011-11-01|title=Education Reform in Japan: A Course for Lifelong Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|journal=Asia-Pacific Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=105–114|doi=10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|issn=1343-9006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to ease Japanese postwar sentiments, any nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, or anti-American content was blackened from learning materials. This practice was known as ''suminuru'', and was used as the primary method of educational reform until newly fashioned texts, Kuni no ayumi (Footsteps of the Nation), Nihon rekishi (Japanese History), and Minshushugi (Democracy) were written by the Ministry of Education and Civil Information and Education Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/journal-of-history/stephen-buono.html|title=Binghamton University - History Department: Resources: Journal of History|website=www.binghamton.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education is now known as the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) and is responsible for educational administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/en/about/museumofmext/index.htm|title=MEXT : Museum of MEXT|website=www.mext.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In successive international assessment tests, Japan's fourth- and eighth-grade students have consistently ranked in the top five globally in both mathematics and science (see [[TIMSS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/TIMSS03Tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=5|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=6|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Math|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Science|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_2.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_4.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_5.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite concerns that academic skills for Japanese students may have declined since the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Matsutani, Minoru, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120110i1.html Student count, knowledge sliding]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's students showed a significant improvement in math and science scores in the 2011 TIMSS survey, compared to the 2007 scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese students improve test scores in math, science|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/12/12/national/japanese-students-improve-test-scores-in-math-science/|website=Japan Times|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School grades==
The school year in Japan begins in April and classes are held from Monday to either Friday or Saturday, depending on the school. The school year consists of two or three terms, which are separated by short holidays in spring and winter, and a six-week-long summer break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2150.html |title=Japanese education system |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date=2002-06-09 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower secondary school===
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{TIMSSScores2007}}
[[File:Classroom2.jpg|thumb|A typical classroom in a Japanese junior high school]]

Lower secondary school covers grades seven through nine, with children typically aged twelve through fifteen. There are 3.5 million primary school students in Japan as of 2012, down from over 5.3 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Statistics|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|website=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of junior high schools has remained relatively static, falling from 11,275 in 1990 to 10,699 in 2012. The number of junior high school teachers has also changed little, with 257,605 junior high school teachers in 1990, and 253,753 in 2012). Approximately 8% of junior high students attend a private junior high school (accounting for 7% of all junior high schools). Private schools are considerably more expensive: as of 2012, the average annual cost of private primary school attendance was ¥1,295,156 per student, roughly thrice the ¥450,340 cost for a public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/List.do?bid=000001051862&amp;cycode=0|title=統計表一覧　政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020103|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's compulsory education ends at grade nine, but less than 2% drop out; 60% of students advanced to senior education as of 1960, increasing rapidly to over 90% by 1980, rising further each year until reaching 98.3% as of 2012.&lt;ref name="Education Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|title=MEXT : Statistics|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|access-date=|ref=Statistics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers often major in their respective subjects, and more than 80% graduate from a four-year college. Classes are large, with an average of thirty-eight students per class, and each class is assigned a homeroom teacher, doubling as a counselor. Unlike kindergarten students, primary school students have different teachers for different subjects. However, the teacher changes rooms for each period, rather than the students.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Instruction in primary schools is often in the form of lectures. Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public primary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools.  Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. Others, such as foreign-language study, begin at this level, though from April 2011, English became a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The junior school curriculum covers Japanese language, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, health, and physical education. All students are also exposed to industrial arts and homemaking. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention. Most students also participate in one of a range of school clubs that occupy them until around 6 p.m. most weekdays (including weekends and often before school as well), as part of an effort to address juvenile delinquency.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A growing number of primary school students also attend ''[[juku]]'', private extracurricular study schools, in the evenings and on weekends. A focus by students upon these other studies and the increasingly structured demands upon students' time have been criticized by teachers and in the media for contributing to a decline in classroom standards and student performance in recent years.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The ministry recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its [[JET Programme|Japan Exchange and Teaching Program]] (JET). Beginning with 848 participants in 1987, the program grew to a high of 6,273 participants in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226053847/http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was in a decline in recent years due to several factors, including shrinking local school budgets funding the program, as well as an increasing number of school boards hiring their foreign native speakers directly or through lower-paying, private agencies.  Today, the program is again growing due to English becoming a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060328zg.html |title=Times get tough for teachers |work=[[The Japan Times|The Japan Times Online]] |date=2006-03-28 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper secondary school===
[[File:Japanese high school classroom.jpg|thumb|A typical Japanese high school classroom]]
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
Though [[upper secondary school|upper-secondary school]] is not compulsory in Japan, 94% of all junior high school graduates enrolled as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |title=STATISTICAL ABSTRACT 2006 edition |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617061845/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private upper-secondary schools account for about 55% of all upper-secondary schools, and neither public nor private schools are free. The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] estimated that annual family expenses for the education of a child in a public upper-secondary school were about ¥300,000 in the 1980s and that private upper-secondary schools were about twice as expensive.

The most common type of upper-secondary school has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for higher education as well as technical and vocational courses for students expecting to find employment after graduation. More than 70% of upper-secondary school students were enrolled in the general academic program in the late 1980s. A small number of schools offer part-time programs, evening courses, or correspondence education.

The first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as [[Japanese language]], [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], and [[science]]. In upper-secondary school, differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged, and course content and course selection are far more individualized in the second year. However, there is a core of academic material throughout all programs.

Vocational-technical programs includes several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, navigation, fish farming, business, English, and ceramics. Business and industrial courses are the most popular, accounting for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.

Most upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.

===Universities and colleges===
{{main|Higher education in Japan}}
Higher education in Japan is provided at universities (daigaku), junior colleges (tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (koto senmon gakko) and special training schools and community colleges (senshu gakko). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wenr.wes.org/2005/05/wenr-mayjune-2005-education-in-japan | title=Education in Japan | date=1 May 2005 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Clark, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in 778 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide a four-year training leading to a [[bachelor's degree]], and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year colleges: the 86 [[List of national universities in Japan|national universities]] (including the [[Open University of Japan]]) and the 95 local [[public university|public universities]], founded by [[prefecture]]s and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private. With a wealth of opportunities for students wishing to pursue tertiary education, the nation’s prestigious schools are the most appealing for students seeking to gain top employment prospects.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of college students attend full-time day programs. In 1990 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 40 percent of all undergraduate students, were in the [[social sciences]], including [[business]], [[law]], and [[accounting]]. Other popular subjects were [[engineering]] (19 percent), the [[humanities]] (15 percent), and [[education]] (7 percent).

The average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were ¥1.4 million. To help defray expenses, students frequently work part-time or borrow money through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association. Assistance is also offered by local governments, nonprofit corporations, and other institutions.

According to the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' and [[École des Mines de Paris]], the top-ranking universities in Japan are the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |title=The Times Higher Education Supplement World University Rankings |date=2005-10-28 |publisher=TSL Education Ltd. |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723181357/http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html  World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5qEQh0ndo?url=http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html |date=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[QS World University Rankings|QS Asia University Rankings]] Top 40 included the [[University of Tokyo]] at 13th position,[[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] at 14th, [[Osaka University]] at 15th, [[Kyoto University]] at 17th, [[Tohoku University]] at 20th, [[Nagoya University]] at 27th, [[Kyushu University]] at 29th, [[Keio University]] at 36th, [[Waseda University]] at 39th, and the [[University of Tsukuba]] at 40th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2018|title=Asian University Rankings 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Topuniversities.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 2011 [[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]], there are 33 Japanese universities in the top 100 Asian university rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japanese-universities-dominate-top-10-spots-in-asian-univ-rankings |title=China universities dominate top 10 spots in Asian univ rankings |publisher=Japantoday.com |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==
The Japanese educational system is supplemented by a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, also known as [[Tutor|shadow education]], which are any educational activities that don't take place during formal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Yoko|last2=Brinton|first2=Mary C.|date=2010-02-19|title=Cultural Capital in East Asian Educational Systems|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038040709356567|journal=Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.1177/0038040709356567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely motivated by the extreme weight that is placed upon [[Higher education in Japan#Entrance|formal examinations]] as a prerequisite to attend university, something that is seen as integral to their future career and social status. In order to gain a competitive edge, Japanese families are willing to expend money and have their child put in time and effort into a supplementary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENTRICH|first=Steve R.|date=2015-07-01|title=The Decision for Shadow Education in Japan: Students’ Choice or Parents’ Pressure?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ssjj/article/18/2/193/1623097|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=193–216|doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyv012|issn=1369-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of shadow education include ''mogi shiken'', which are practice exams given by private companies that determine the child's chances of getting into a university. ''[[Juku]]'' are private after school classes that aim to develop abilities for students to excel in formal school curriculum or to prepare for university examinations. ''Ronin'' are students that undergo full-time preparation for university exams following high school due to their inability to get into their school of choice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=David Lee|last2=Baker|first2=David P.|date=1992|title=Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan|jstor=2781551|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1639–1657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 86% of students with college plans participate in at least one form of shadow education, with 60% participating in two or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Japanese students are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers and society. This is largely a result of a society that has long placed a great amount of importance on education, and a system that places all of its weight upon a single examination that has significant life-long consequences. This pressure has led to behaviors such as school violence, cheating, suicide, and significant psychological harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects|last=Pike|first=Roberta|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9780895818690|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, students have experienced nervous breakdowns that have required hospitalization as young as twelve. In 1991, it was reported that 1,333 people in the age group of 15-24 had committed suicide, much of which was due to academic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossy|first=Steve|date=1996|title=Academic pressure and impact on Japanese students|url=http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=35314&amp;silo_library=GEN01|journal=McGill Journal of Education|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the Education Ministry showed that students at public schools were involved in a record number of [[school violence|violent incidents]] in 2007: 52,756 cases, an increase of some 8,000 on the previous year. In almost 7,000 of these incidents, teachers were the target of assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ed20081202a1.html Getting children to get along.] (2008, December 2). ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese educational system has also been criticized for failure to foster independent thinkers with cultural and artistic sensibility. Japanese students that attend schools overseas often face difficulty adapting and competing in that environment due to lack of international viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracey|first=Gerald|date=December 1997|title=The Japanese Education System is a Failure, Say Some Japanese|url=|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=79|pages=328–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International education==
As of 2016, Japan has 30-40 international schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcis.jp/member-schools/|title=» Member Schools Japan Council of International Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many Kindergarten type schools that use the word "international" in their names but this is not an indicator that they are Japanese schools in the traditional sense. These types of kindergartens are usually immersion programs for Japanese students and the schools hire mostly foreigners to act as the main class "teacher" or as an assistant to the Japanese teacher.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[United Nations University]] is located in Japan and [[Temple University]] has a branch campus in Japan. [[International University of Japan]] is an internationally top-ranked, fully English-taught University in Japan. [[Akita International University]] is also an English-taught University. [[Sophia University]]'s Faculty of Liberal Arts is fully taught in English. [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] is a highly selective, specialist institution for [[International Studies]] and offers some languages that are rarely taught elsewhere in the world.

'''Feminist ethics''' is an approach to [[ethics]] that builds on the belief that traditionally ethical theorizing has under-valued and/or under-appreciated [[women]]'s [[moral]] experience, which is largely male dominated, and it therefore chooses to re imagine ethics through a holistic [[feminist]] approach to transform it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/ Tong, R. and Williams N., Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Feminist Ethics, First published Tue May 12, 1998; substantive revision Mon May 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Feminist [[philosophers]] critique traditional ethics as pre-eminently focusing on men's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] with little regard for women's viewpoints. Caring and the [[moral]] issues of private life and family responsibilities were traditionally regarded as trivial matters. Generally, women are portrayed as ethically immature and shallow in comparison to men. Traditional ethics prizes masculine cultural traits like "independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,"&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"&gt;Jaggar, "Feminist Ethics," 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and gives less weight to culturally [[feminine]] traits like "interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life."&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt; Should women embody or use any traditionally masculine cultural traits they are seen as other or as an attempt to be more like men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, New York:Routledge. Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ethics has a "male" orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework of rules, rights, universality, and impartiality and becomes the standard of a society. The "female" approaches to moral reasoning emphasizes relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality.&lt;ref name="Jaggar, Feminist Ethics, 1992"/&gt;

==Historical background==
Feminist ethics developed from [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s '[[Vindication of the Rights of Women]]' published in 1792.&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Abruzzese|first1 =Jaclyn|last2 =Brayne|first2=Allison|last3 = Shastri|first3 = Julie |last4 = Sakofsky|first4 = Rachel|last5 = Hewitt|first5= Nancy|last6 = Sklar |first6 = Kathryn|date = Spring 2002|url = http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/intro.htm|title = From Wollstonecraft to Mill: What British and European Ideas and Social Movements Influenced the Emergence of Feminism in the Atlantic World, 1792-1869?|website = Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600-2000| publisher = Alexander Street Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new ideas from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], individual feminists being able to travel more than ever before, generating more opportunities for the exchange of ideas and advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Jennifer L.|title=The Mothers of a Movement: Remembering 19th-Century Feminists|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/highlights/feminists.html|website=Documenting the American South|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; With new [[social movements]] like [[Romanticism]] there developed unprecedented optimistic outlook on human capacity and destiny. This optimism was reflected in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s essay [[The Subjection of Women]] (1869).&lt;ref name="womhist.alexanderstreet.com"/&gt; Feminist approaches to ethics, were further developed around this period by other notable people like [[Catherine Beecher]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] with an emphasis on the gendered nature of [[morality]], specifically related to 'women's morality'.&lt;ref name="docsouth.unc.edu"/&gt;

===Charlotte Perkins Gilman===
The American writer and sociologist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] imagined a fictional "[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]". In this male-free society, women produce their daughters through [[parthenogenesis]] and live a superior morality. This women-centered society valued both industriousness and motherhood while discouraged individualistic competitive approaches to life. Gilman thought that in such a scenario women could relate cooperatively as there would be no requirement to dominate each other. Herland cultivates and combines the best "feminine" virtues and the best "masculine" virtues together as co-extensive with human [[virtue]]. If a society  wants to be virtuous, according to Gilman, it should exemplify the fictional utopia of Herland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gilman|first = Charlotte Perkins |title = Herland|url = https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gilman/charlotte_perkins/herland/|date =1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; However so long as women are [[Codependence|dependent]] on men for economic support, women will continue to be known for their servility and men for their arrogance. Women need to be men's economic equals before they can develop truly human moral virtue, this is a perfect blend of pride and humility that we call [[self-respect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Gilman| first = Charlotte Perkins| title = Women and Economics|location = Boston|publisher = Small, Maynard, &amp; Co.|date = 1898|url = http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/economics/economics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist care ethics==
{{main|Ethics of care}}
[[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]] are exponents of a feminist care ethics which criticize traditional ethics as deficient to the degree they lack, disregard, trivialize or attack women's cultural values and virtues.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"&gt;Noddings, N., Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century feminist ethicists developed a variety of care focused feminist approaches to ethics in comparison to non-feminist care-focused approaches to ethics, feminist ones tend to appreciate the impact of gender issues more fully.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, C., In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist care-focused ethicists note the tendencies of patriarchal societies not to appreciate the value and benefits of women's ways of loving, thinking, working and writing and tend to view females as subordinate.&lt;ref name="Noddings, N. 1984"/&gt; This is why some social studies make a conscious effort to adopt feminist ethics, rather than just the traditional ethics of studies. An example of this was Roffee and Waling's 2016 study into microaggressions against the LGBTIQ community. Even though it was focused on the LGBTIQ community the feminist ethics were better suited, as they are more considerate to the vulnerabilities and needs of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical fields also fail to recognize that ethics plays an often negative part in the LGBTIQ community in how they receive treatment and what treatments are given as options to them. As well a how women are also treated within medical fields.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohrmann|first=M|date=2015|title=Feminist Ethics and Religious|url=|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|volume=43(2)|pages=185-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist justice ethics==
{{Main|Feminist justice ethics}}
[[Feminist justice ethics]] is a feminist view on morality which seeks to engage with, and ultimately transform, traditional universal approaches to [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 68. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most types of feminist ethics, feminist justice ethics looks at how gender is left out of mainstream ethical considerations.  Mainstream ethics are argued to be male-oriented.  However, feminist justice ethics does differ considerably from other feminist ethics.  A universal set of ethics is a significant part of feminist justice ethics &lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 69"&gt;Hutchings, Kimberley. "Ethics." In ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'', edited by Laura J Shepherd, 69. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;but depending on the geographical location, such as the difference between the Global North and Global South, may differ in how justice is applied and may change what is considered justice. Feminist justice ethics is clear in dividing "thick" morality from "thin" morality.  Other ethical approaches that define themselves by differentiating groups from one another through culture or other phenomena are regarded as "thick" accounts of morality.  Feminist justice ethics claims that "thick" accounts of morality, as opposed to "thin" accounts of morality, are intrinsically prone to eroding valid feminist critique.&lt;ref name="Hutchings 2010 68"/&gt;

==Feminist ethics and the future==
Feminist ethicists believe there is an obligation for women's differing points of view to be heard and then to fashion an inclusive consensus view from them. To attempt to achieve this and to push towards gender equality with men together is the goal of feminist ethics. The fixing of these issues are important in modern times because of the shifting view points as well as what has considered to be 'ethical' in terms of treatment and how women, in particular, women's bodies should be treated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"The goal of feminist ethics is the transformation of societies and situations where women are harmed through violence, subordination and exclusion. When such injustices are evident now and in the future, radical feminist activists will continue their work of protest and action following careful appraisal and reflection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLellan|first1=Betty|title=Unspeakable: A feminist ethic of speech|date=February 2010|publisher=OtherWise Publications|isbn=978-0-646-51778-0|page=240|url=http://feministagenda.org.au/home/otherwise-publications/unspeakable/}}&lt;/ref&gt; With violence, it once again circles back to masculine behavior and traditional ethics that such behavior and treatment was encourages. In today's society, the twentieth century, it is becoming less socially acceptable to commit violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Feminist ethics and International Relations ==
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
{{Feminism sidebar |theory}}
Feminist theories and that of ethics broaden the scope of the predominantly masculine sphere of International Relations. This is especially important for issues of the private realm to take stage into the public which includes issues such as children's rights, gender violence and discrimination, gender relations in war torn societies, and other similar issues which remain difficult to appear relevant in the mainstream discussions of ethics in international relations. The feminist dialogues of ethics are almost inescapably present to the private realm and are known to only shadow dominant 'male' paradigms of ethics in the public realm. This is especially a reality in discussion of ethics in International Relations where it is predominantly built on a language of violence, technologies or economics and what are known to be the masculine topics of discussion.

See '''Kimberly Hutchings''' discussion in "Ethics" for further detail on the foundations of the theory in International Relations  &lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, Kimberly. "Ethics ." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . 2009 . 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alison Watson''' &lt;ref&gt;"Children Born of Wartime Rape: Rights and Representations ." International Feminist Journal of Politics (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson discusses the issue of children born of wartime rape and uses feminist theory of ethics in addressing these marginalized issues. The invisibility is emphasized in the traditional construction within much of the existing international discourse of motherhood as a 'private sphere activity'   where important focused issues such as children of wartime rape can be lost in translation of international dialogue and minimally touched upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Alison|title=Children Born of Wartime Rape: RIghts and Representations|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|year=2007|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist theory of ethics is provided in terms of broadening theoretical dialogues of international relations and addressing issues that remain marginalized.

'''Puechguirbal''' &lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that failure to broaden the current scope of ethics in peacekeeping operations and rebuilding strategies, surrounding arms and violence, results in failing to meet the needs of both men and women. Puechguirbal argues that conflict is a 'gendered experience' and discusses the importance of peacekeeping operations keeping in check the differential impacts of war on women, men, boys and girls in post conflict society so as to not further marginalize the most vulnerable groups of the population&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 171&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, peacekeeping operations are heavily masculine in the sense that security revolves around the cessation of hostilities and disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009: 163&lt;/ref&gt; Peacebuilding operations must shift the focus from solely disarming and cessation of hostilities against gang members to social constructions of violence against women, men, and children that is embedded in societies broken apart by conflict. Gender issues have not been part of mandates of peacekeeping missions&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:170&lt;/ref&gt; and  urges women to take a more active role in political processes in post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Puechguirbal, Nadine. "Peacekeeping, Peacebuilding, and Post-Conflict Reconstruction." Shepherd, Laura J. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations . Taylor and Francis, 2009:163&lt;/ref&gt; Applying Feminist ethics in peacekeeping and re-building strategies can reach a wider range of issues as well as deemed not of dire importance in dialogues of International Relations. Current strategies are not reaching target goals of generating peace and cessation of   gender violence and sexual abuses that continue to reach high levels in incidences. This remains a residue of post-conflict societies that must be addressed. Implementing feminist ethics generates greater peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies for gendered strategies to meet the needs of both genders so as to be implemented into not only the institutions but society.

== Feminist ethics and Being Transgender. ==
When applying feminist ethics and care, it is important to consider in what way does that apply to those who are transgender, either Female to Male or Male to Female. As there is a historical with ethics being deeply rooted in religious ethics. For those who are transgender and wish to be identified as their preferred gender have to apply either masculine or feminine ethics in both appearance and thinking to pass. One notable mention is when “Halberstam claims that surgical intervention in the case of “sex-change” serves to “fictionalize” gender (i.e., render or expose as artificial) … a masculine performing butch lesbian, for example…”&lt;ref&gt;•	Halberstam, Judith, 1994, “F2M: The making of female masculinity”, in ''The lesbian postmodern'', Laura Doan (ed.), New York: Columbia University Press, 210–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20753">In [[mathematics]], a '''finite set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that has a [[wikt:finite|finite]] number of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s.  Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\{2,4,6,8,10\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a [[natural number]] (a [[non-negative]] [[integer]]) and is called the [[cardinality]] of the set. A set that is not finite is called '''[[infinite set|infinite]]'''. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:
:&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,\ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Finite sets are particularly important in [[combinatorics]], the mathematical study of [[counting]]. Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the [[pigeonhole principle]], which states that there cannot exist an [[injective function]] from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.

== Definition and terminology ==

Formally, a set {{mvar|''S''}} is called '''finite''' if there exists a [[bijection]]
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon S\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
for some natural number {{mvar|''n''}}.  The number {{mvar|''n''}} is the set's cardinality, denoted as |{{mvar|''S''}}|.  The [[empty set]] {} or Ø is considered finite, with cardinality zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Apostol|1974|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cohn|1981|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Labarre|1968|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin|1976|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a set is finite, its elements may be written — in many ways — in a [[sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \quad (x_i \in S,  1 \le i \le n).&lt;/math&gt;
In [[combinatorics]], a finite set with {{mvar|''n''}} elements is sometimes called an ''{{mvar|n}}-set'' and a subset with {{mvar|''k''}} elements is called a ''{{mvar|k}}-subset''.  For example, the set {5,6,7} is a 3-set&amp;nbsp;– a finite set with three elements&amp;nbsp;– and {6,7} is a 2-subset of it.

(Those familiar with the definition of the natural numbers themselves as conventional in set theory, the so-called [[Natural number#Von Neumann construction|von Neumann construction]], may prefer to use the existence of the bijection &lt;math&gt;f\colon S\rightarrow n&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent.)

== Basic properties ==

Any proper [[subset]] of a finite set ''S'' is finite and has fewer elements than ''S'' itself.  As a consequence, there cannot exist a [[bijection]] between a finite set ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S''.  Any set with this property is called [[Dedekind-finite]].  Using the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for [[set theory]], every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF (Zermelo Fraenkel axioms with the [[axiom of choice]] removed) alone.  
The [[axiom of countable choice]], a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.

Any injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a [[surjective function]] (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.

The [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite sets is finite, with
:&lt;math&gt;|S\cup T| \le |S| + |T|.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact:
:&lt;math&gt;|S\cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S\cap T|.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of any finite number of finite sets is finite.  The [[Cartesian product]] of finite sets is also finite, with:
:&lt;math&gt;|S\times T| = |S|\times|T|.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with ''n'' elements has 2{{sup|''n''}} distinct subsets.  That is, the
[[power set]] of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2{{sup|''n''}}.

Any subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.

All finite sets are [[countable]], but not all countable sets are finite. (Some authors, however, use "countable" to mean "countably infinite", so do not consider finite sets to be countable.)

The [[free semilattice]] over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the [[Join and meet|join operation]] being given by set union.

== Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness ==

In [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF), the following conditions are all equivalent:{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

# ''S'' is a finite set. That is, ''S'' can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.
# ([[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]) ''S'' has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time. (See [[#Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness|below]] for the set-theoretical formulation of Kuratowski finiteness.)
# ([[Paul Stäckel]]) ''S'' can be given a total ordering which is [[well-order]]ed both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of ''S'' has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.
# Every one-to-one function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) into itself is [[onto]]. That is, the [[powerset]] of the powerset of ''S'' is Dedekind-finite (see below).&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by {{harvnb|Whitehead|Russell|2009|p=288}}. This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=73–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every surjective function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) onto itself is one-to-one.
# ([[Alfred Tarski]]) Every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[minimal element]] with respect to inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=48–58}}, demonstrated that his definition (which is also known as I-finite) is equivalent to Kuratowski's set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalently, every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[maximal element]] with respect to inclusion.)
# ''S'' can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are [[order isomorphic]]. In other words, the well-orderings on ''S'' have exactly one [[order type]].

If the [[axiom of choice]] is also assumed (the [[axiom of countable choice]] is sufficient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kkQAXtqb534C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=If+the+axiom+of+choice+is+also+assumed+(the+axiom+of+countable+choice+is+sufficient%5B&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ClBSj8_AMl&amp;sig=fkJDTRruKBg003olsDDh-Tf-nG0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNvJzjz8zYAhVL6Y8KHQosCjYQ6AEIYDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20the%20axiom%20of%20choice%20is%20also%20assumed%20(the%20axiom%20of%20countable%20choice%20is%20sufficient%5B&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Differential Equations: Ordinary Differential Equations|last=Canada|first=A.|last2=Drabek|first2=P.|last3=Fonda|first3=A.|date=2005-09-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080461083|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}), then the following conditions are all equivalent:

# ''S'' is a finite set.
# ([[Richard Dedekind]]) Every one-to-one function from ''S'' into itself is onto.
# Every surjective function from ''S'' onto itself is one-to-one.
# ''S'' is empty or every [[partial order]]ing of ''S'' contains a [[maximal element]].

== Foundational issues ==

[[Georg Cantor]] initiated his theory of sets in order to provide a mathematical treatment of infinite sets. Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the [[Finitism|strict finitists]], reject the existence of infinite sets and thus recommend a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of [[hereditarily finite set]]s constitutes a model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation.

Even for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter.   The difficulty stems from [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within [[Peano arithmetic]] (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called [[non-standard models]] of both theories. A seeming paradox, non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets contain infinite sets --- but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models.  So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to describe finiteness approximately.

More generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of [[formal system]]s varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG), [[Non-well-founded set theory]], [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Type theory]] and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and [[intuitionistic logic]].

A [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] might see the meaning{{fact|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--sure that formalists might attribute meanings to mathematical notions???--&gt; of ''set'' varying from system to system. Some kinds of [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonist]]s might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.

== Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness ==
&lt;!--Linked from [[#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness]] above--&gt;

In contexts where the notion of [[natural number]] sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set ''S'' as finite if ''S'' admits a [[bijection]] to some set of [[natural numbers]] of the form &lt;math&gt;\{x|x&lt;n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in [[set theory]], for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite [[well-ordered]] sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.

Various properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to [[Richard Dedekind]], the other to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)

A set ''S'' is called [[Dedekind infinite]] if there exists an injective, non-surjective function &lt;math&gt;f:S \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;. Such a function exhibits a bijection between ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S'', namely the image of ''f''.  Given a Dedekind infinite set ''S'', a function ''f'', and an element ''x'' that is not in the image of ''f'', we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of ''S'', namely &lt;math&gt;x,f(x),f(f(x)),...&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, given a sequence in ''S'' consisting of distinct elements &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, x_3, ...&lt;/math&gt;, we can define a function ''f'' such that on elements in the sequence &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and ''f'' behaves like the identity function otherwise.  Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.

{{anchor|Kuratowski finite}} Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set ''S'', the binary operation of union endows the [[powerset]] ''P''(''S'') with the structure of a [[semi-lattice]].  Writing ''K''(''S'') for the sub-semi-lattice generated by the [[empty set]] and the singletons, call set ''S'' Kuratowski finite if ''S'' itself belongs to ''K''(''S'').&lt;ref&gt;The original paper by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}} defined a set ''S'' to be finite when
: ''P''(''S'')∖{∅} = ⋂{''X'' ∈ ''P''(''P''(''S'')∖{∅}); (∀''x''∈''S'', {''x''}∈''X'') and (∀''A'',''B''∈''X'', ''A''∪''B''∈''X'')}.
In other words, ''S'' is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of ''S'' is equal to the intersection of all classes ''X'' which satisfy:
* all elements of ''X'' are non-empty subsets of ''S'',
* the set {''x''} is an element of ''X'' for all ''x'' in ''S'',
* ''X'' is closed under pairwise unions.
Kuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set.&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, ''K''(''S'') consists of the finite subsets of ''S''. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define ''generated by'' since one may obtain ''K''(''S'') simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semi-lattices containing the empty set and the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]].

Readers unfamiliar with semi-lattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means ''S'' lies in the set ''K''(''S''), constructed as follows. Write ''M'' for the set of all subsets ''X'' of ''P''(''S'') such that:
* ''X'' contains the empty set;
* For every set ''T'' in ''P''(''S''), if ''X'' contains ''T'' then ''X'' also contains the union of ''T'' with any singleton.
Then ''K''(''S'') may be defined as the intersection of ''M''.

In ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.

=== Other concepts of finiteness ===

In ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set ''S'' are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength. In other words, if a set ''S'' meets one of the criteria in this list, it meets all of the criteria which follow that one. In the absence of the axiom of choice, the reverse implications are all unprovable. If the axiom of choice is assumed, then all of these concepts are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|pp=278–280}}, and {{harvnb|Lévy|1958|pp=2–3}}, although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first. They are all pure "set-theoretic" definitions in terms of the equality and element-of relations, not involving ω.)

* '''I-finite'''. Every non-empty set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a ⊆-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)
* '''Ia-finite'''. For every partition of ''S'' into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.
* '''II-finite'''. Every non-empty ⊆-monotone set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element.
* '''III-finite'''. The power set ''P''(''S'') is Dedekind finite.
* '''IV-finite'''. ''S'' is Dedekind finite.
* '''V-finite'''.  ∣''S''∣ = 0 or 2⋅∣''S''∣ &gt; ∣''S''|.
* '''VI-finite'''. ∣''S''∣ = 0 or ∣''S''∣ = 1 or ∣''S''∣&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ∣''S''∣.
* '''VII-finite'''. ''S'' is I-finite or not well-orderable.

The forward implications (from strong to weak) are theorems within ZF. Counter-examples to the reverse implications (from weak to strong) are found using [[model theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lévy|1958}} found counter-examples to each of the reverse implications in Mostowski models. Lévy attributes most of the results to earlier papers by Mostowski and Lindenbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these finiteness definitions and their names are attributed to {{harvnb|Tarski|1954}} by {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|p=278}}. However, definitions I, II, III, IV and V were presented in {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=49, 93}}, together with proofs (or references to proofs) for the forward implications. At that time, model theory was not sufficiently advanced to find the counter-examples.

In [[physics]], specifically for [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]], a '''four-tensor''' is an abbreviation for a [[tensor]] in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]].&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010&gt;Lambourne, Robert J A. Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology. Cambridge University Press. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalities==

General four-tensors are usually written in [[tensor index notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\mu_1,\mu_2,...,\mu_n}_{\;\nu_1,\nu_2,...,\nu_m}&lt;/math&gt;

with the indices taking integer values from 0 to 3, with 0 for the timelike components and 1, 2, 3 for spacelike components. There are ''n'' [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices and ''m'' [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices.&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

In special and general relativity, many four-tensors of interest are first order ([[four-vector]]s) or second order, but higher order tensors occur. Examples are listed next.

In special relativity, the vector basis can be restricted to being orthonormal, in which case all four-tensors transform under [[Lorentz transformations]]. In general relativity, more general coordinate transformations are necessary since such a restriction is not in general possible.

==Examples==

===First order tensors===

{{main|Four-vector}}

In special relativity, one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a four-tensor is the four-displacement

:&lt;math&gt;x^\mu= (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3 ) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

a four-tensor with contravariant rank 1 and covariant rank 0. Four-tensors of this kind are usually known as [[four-vectors]]. Here the component ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ct'' gives the displacement of a body in time (coordinate time ''t'' is multiplied by the [[speed of light]] ''c'' so that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has dimensions of length). The remaining components of the four-displacement form the spatial displacement vector '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

The [[four-momentum]] for massive or [[massless particle]]s is

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = \left(E/c,p_x,p_y,p_z\right)&lt;/math&gt;

combines its energy (divided by ''c'') ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''E''/''c'' and 3-[[momentum]] '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Lambourne_2010/&gt;

For a particle with [[relativistic mass]] ''m'', four momentum is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p^\mu = m \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''τ'' the [[proper time]] of the particle.

===Second order tensors===

The [[Minkowski metric]] tensor with an orthonormal basis for the (−+++) convention is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu \nu}=\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;

used for calculating the [[line element]] and [[raising and lowering indices]]. The above applies to Cartesian coordinates. In general relativity, the metric tensor is given by much more general expressions for curvilinear coordinates.

The [[angular momentum]] {{nowrap|1='''L''' = '''x''' ∧ '''p'''}} of a particle with [[relativistic mass]] ''m'' and [[relativistic momentum]] '''p''' (as measured by an observer in a [[lab frame]]) combines with another vector quantity {{nowrap|1='''N''' = ''m'''''x''' − '''p'''''t''}} (without a standard name) in the [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= vintage books|pages=437–438, 566–569| year=2005 | isbn=978-0-09-944068-0}} '''Note:''' Some authors, including Penrose, use ''Latin'' letters in this definition, even though it is conventional to use Greek indices for vectors and tensors in spacetime.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Special Relativity and How it Works|author=M.

:&lt;math&gt; M^{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
    0     &amp; -N^1 c  &amp; -N^2 c  &amp; -N^3 c \\ 
    N^1 c &amp;  0      &amp;  L^{12} &amp; -L^{31} \\
    N^2 c &amp; -L^{12} &amp;  0      &amp;  L^{23} \\
    N^3 c &amp;  L^{31} &amp; -L^{23} &amp;  0 
  \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

with components

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta} = X^\alpha P^\beta - X^\beta P^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The [[stress–energy tensor]] of a continuum or field generally takes the form of a second order tensor, and usually denoted by ''T''. The timelike component corresponds to [[energy density]] (energy per unit volume), the mixed spacetime components to [[momentum density]] (momentum per unit volume), and the purely spacelike parts to 3d stress tensors.

The [[electromagnetic field tensor]] combines the [[electric field]] and '''E''' and magnetic field '''B'''&lt;ref name=Vanderlinde&gt;{{Citation

   D_zc &amp; - H_y   &amp; H_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[magnetization]]-[[polarization (waves)|polarization]] tensor combines the '''P''' and '''M''' fields&lt;ref name=Vanderlinde/&gt;

   -  P_zc &amp; - M_y   &amp; M_x    &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

The three field tensors are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} F^{\mu \nu} - \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the definitions of the '''D''' and '''H''' fields.

The [[electric dipole moment]] '''d''' and [[magnetic dipole moment]] '''μ''' of a particle are unified into a single tensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.O.|last=Barut|title=Electrodynamics and the Classical theory of particles and fields|page=73|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-64038-9}} No factor of ''c'' appears in the tensor in this book because different conventions for the EM field tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;

   -  d_z &amp; \mu_y / c  &amp; - \mu_x /c  &amp; 0       
  \end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Ricci curvature tensor]] is another second order tensor.

===Higher order tensors===

In general relativity, there are curvature tensors which tend to be higher order, such as the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] and [[Weyl curvature tensor]] which are both fourth order tensors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4323">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fréchet filter''', also called the '''cofinite filter''', on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a special subset of the set's [[power set]]. A member of this power set is in the Fréchet filter if and only if its [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] in the power set is finite. This is of interest in [[topology]], where filters originated, and relates to [[Order theory|order]] and  [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] because a set's power set is a [[partially ordered set]] (and more specifically, a lattice) under [[Subset|set inclusion]].

The Fréchet filter is named after the French mathematician [[Maurice Fréchet]] (1878-1973), who worked in topology. It is alternatively called a ''cofinite filter'' because its members are exactly the cofinite sets in a power set.

== Definition ==
The Fréchet filter ''F'' on ''X'' is the set of all subsets ''A'' of ''X'' such that the complement of ''A'' in ''X'' is finite. That is, 

::{{math|big=1|''F'' {{=}} {''A'' &amp;sube; ''X'' : ''X'' &amp;minus; ''A'' is finite}.}}

This makes ''F'' a [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]] on the lattice ('''P'''(''X''), &amp;sube;), the power set of ''X'' with set inclusion, since
# Intersection condition: if two sets are finitely complemented in ''X'', then so is their intersection (since {{math|(''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;cup; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the complement of a set ''S'', and 
# Upper-set condition: if a set is finitely complemented in ''X'', then so are its supersets in ''X''.

== Properties ==

If the base set ''X'' is finite, then ''F'' = '''P'''(''X'') since every subset of ''X'', and in particular every complement, is then finite. This case is sometimes excluded by definition or else called the '''improper filter''' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Wilfrid. ''Model Theory''. Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 265. {{ISBN|978-0-521-06636-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing ''X'' to be finite creates a single exception to the Fréchet filter's being [[Filter (mathematics)#Examples|free]] and [[Filter (mathematics)#General definition|non-principal]] since a filter on a finite set cannot be free and a non-principal filter cannot contain any singletons as members.

If ''X'' is infinite, then every member of ''F'' is infinite since it is simply ''X'' minus finitely many of its members. Additionally, ''F'' is infinite since one of its subsets is the set of all {''x''}&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is both free and non-principal, excepting the finite case mentioned above, and is included in every free filter. It is also the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] filter of the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal]] of all finite subsets of (infinite) ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is ''not'' necessarily an [[ultrafilter]] (or maximal proper filter). Consider '''P'''('''N'''). The set of even numbers is the complement of the set of odd numbers. Since neither of these sets is finite, neither set is in the Fréchet filter on '''N'''. However, an ultrafilter is free if and only if it includes the Fréchet filter. The existence of free ultrafilters was established by Tarski in 1930, relying on a theorem equivalent to the axiom of choice and is used in the construction of the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] in [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, J. Sousa and Hoskins, R. F. ''Infinitesimal methods for mathematical analysis''. Mathematics and Applications Series. Horwood Publishing, 2004, p. 53. {{ISBN|978-1-898563-99-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
On the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, the set ''B'' = { (''n'',∞) : ''n'' &amp;isin; '''N'''} is a Fréchet [[filter base]], i.e., the Fréchet filter on '''N''' consists of all supersets of elements of ''B''.

==Career==
McInnes co-founded [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] in 1994 with [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]] and [[Suroosh Alvi]].&lt;ref name="gakwertwo"/&gt;  During his tenure there he was described as the "godfather" of [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsterdom]] by [[WNBC]]&lt;ref name="god"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/niteside/Gavin-McInnes-on-Vice-I-Havent-Seen-It-In-A-While-91687159.html |title="Vice" Founder Gavin McInnes on Split From Glossy: "It's Like a Divorce" |publisher=NBC New York |author=Mawuse Ziegbe |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "one of hipsterdom’s primary architects" by ''[[AdBusters]]''.&lt;ref name="hadow"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adbusters.org/article/hipster-the-dead-end-of-western-civilization/ |title=Hipster: The Dead End of Western Civilization |author=Douglas Haddow |publisher=Adbusters |date=29 July 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally contributed articles to ''Vice'', including "The VICE Guide to Happiness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-vice-v10n1|title=The VICE Guide To Happiness |website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The VICE Guide to Picking Up Chicks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/poster-v12n1|title=The VICE Guide to Picking Up Chicks |website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authored two ''Vice'' books: ''The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/606.The_Vice_Guide_to_Sex_and_Drugs_and_Rock_and_Roll |title=The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll |publisher=Goodreads |access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Vice Dos and Don'ts: 10 Years of VICE Magazine's Street Fashion Critiques''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618.Vice_Dos_and_Don_ts|title=Vice Dos and Don'ts|publisher=Goodreads|access-date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in the ''[[New York Press]]'' in 2002, McInnes said that he was pleased that most [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] were white.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite web|date=8 October 2002|title=Vice Rising: Corporate Media Woos Magazine World's Punks|url=http://www.nypress.com/vice-rising-corporate-media-woos-magazine-worlds-punks/|publisher=New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; McInnes later wrote in a letter to [[Gawker]] that the interview was done as a prank intended to ridicule "baby boomer media like ''The Times''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin McInnes |url=http://gawker.com/013468/letter-to-gawker-from-gavin-mcinnes |title=Letter to Gawker from Gavin McInnes |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070627/http://gawker.com/013468/letter-to-gawker-from-gavin-mcinnes |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After he became the focus of a letter-writing campaign by a black reader, ''Vice'' apologized for McInnes's comments.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; McInnes was featured in a 2003 ''[[New York Times]]'' article about ''Vice'' magazine expressing his political views.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/28/style/the-edge-of-hip-vice-the-brand.html|title=The Edge of Hip: Vice, the Brand|date=28 September 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he was featured in ''[[The Vice Guide to Travel]]'' with actor and comedian [[David Cross]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin McInnes|title=DAVID CROSS IN CHINA (part 1)|date=2 August 2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOBJivqJ5Qo|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left ''Vice'' in 2008 due to what he described as "creative differences".&lt;ref name="Pareene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/348019/co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-finally-leaves-vice |title=Co-Founder Gavin McInnes Finally Leaves 'Vice' |author=Alex Pareene |publisher=Gawker |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010093200/http://gawker.com/348019/co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-finally-leaves-vice |archivedate=10 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', McInnes said his split with ''Vice'' was about the increasing influence of corporate advertising on ''Vice's'' content, stating that "Marketing and editorial being enemies had been the business plan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/08/the-bad-boy-brand|title=The Bad-Boy Brand |last=Widdicombe |first=Lizzie|date=8 April 2013|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|issn=0028-792X|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, McInnes created the website ''StreetCarnage.com''. He also co-founded an [[advertising agency]] called Rooster where he serves as creative director.&lt;ref name="adweek"&gt;{{cite news|last=Braiker|first=Brian|title=Creating Ads For People Who Hate Ads |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/creating-ads-people-who-hate-ads-132667|accessdate=24 August 2011 |newspaper=Adweek |date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, McInnes convinced a journalist at ''[[The Village Voice]]'' that he had been knocked out after losing a challenge to an [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Zach.

McInnes was featured in Season 3 of the Canadian reality TV show ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'', as a judge in the "Who is Cooler?" episode. In 2010, McInnes was approached by [[Adult Swim]] and asked to play the part of Mick, an anthropomorphic Scottish soccer ball, in the short-lived ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' spin-off ''[[Soul Quest Overdrive]]''.&lt;ref name="roosternewyork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roosternewyork.com/2011/05/adult-swim-soul-quest-overdrive/|title=ADULT SWIM – SOUL QUEST OVERDRIVE|publisher=Rooster|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After losing a 2010 pilot contest to ''[[Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge]]'', six episodes of ''Soul Quest Overdrive'' were ordered, with four airing in Adult Swim's 4 AM DVR Theater block on 25 May 2011 before quickly being cancelled. McInnes jokingly blamed the show's cancellation on the other cast members ([[Kristen Schaal]], [[David Cross]], and [[H. Jon Benjamin]]) not being "as funny" as him.&lt;ref name="streetcarnage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streetcarnage.com/blog/soul-quest-overdrive-watch-the-whole-series-here/|title=SOUL QUEST OVERDRIVE: WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES HERE|publisher=StreetCarnage.com|date=27 May 2011|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, McInnes wrote a book called ''How to Piss in Public''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/paul-barker/2012/04/gavin-mcinnes-how-to-piss-in-public-extensive-interview/|title=Gavin McInnes: An In-depth Interview With "The Godfather of Hipsterdom"|work=Thought Catalog|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he directed ''The Brotherhood of the Traveling Rants'', a documentary on his tour as an occasional standup comedian.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Drew.

Also that year, McInnes starred in the independent film ''[[How to Be a Man]]'', which premiered at [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Next Weekend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/article/day-3-gavin-mcinnes-gets-unruly-in-how-to-be-a-man/|title=Day 3: Gavin McInnes’ Errant Life Tips in How To Be A Man; James Ponsoldt’s Advice to Filmmakers|publisher=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|date=August 11, 2013|first=Nate|last=von Zurmwall|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815072739/http://www.sundance.org/festival/article/day-3-gavin-mcinnes-gets-unruly-in-how-to-be-a-man/|archive-date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also played supporting roles in other films including ''[[Soul Quest Overdrive]]'' (2010), ''[[Creative Control (film)|Creative Control]]'' (2015) and ''[[One More Time (2015 film)|One More Time]]'' (2015).

In August 2014, McInnes was asked to take an indefinite leave of absence as chief creative officer of Rooster, following online publication at Thought Catalog of an essay about [[transphobia]] titled "Transphobia is Perfectly Natural"&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/gavin-mcinnes/2014/08/transphobia-is-perfectly-natural/ |title=Transphobia is Perfectly Natural |last=McInnes |first=Gavin |date=12 August 2014 |work=Thought Catalog |publisher=The Thought &amp; Expression Company}} Click "Continue" link at the very bottom of the warning page to view original article.&lt;/ref&gt; that sparked a call to boycott the company. In response, Rooster issued a statement, saying in part: "We are extremely disappointed with his actions and have asked that he take a leave of absence while we determine the most appropriate course of action."&lt;ref name="Transphobia"&gt;{{cite news |last=Monllos |first=Kristina |title=Rooster CCO Gavin McInnes Asked to Take Leave of Absence Following transphobic Thought Catalog essay, boycott |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/rooster-cco-gavin-mcinnes-asked-take-leave-absence-159536 |accessdate=19 August 2014 |newspaper=Adweek |date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McInnes defended the article by saying "All I was saying was [[transsexual]]s have a huge suicide rate", and calling the reaction "fake hysteria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/02/fired-writer-gavin-mcinnes-politically-correct-outrage-is-like-the-mob/|title=Fired Writer Gavin McInnes: Politically Correct Outrage Is Like The Mob|website=The Daily Caller|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, broadcaster [[Anthony Cumia]] announced that McInnes would be hosting a show on his network, therefore retiring the Free Speech podcast that he had started in March. ''The Gavin McInnes Show'' premiered on [[Compound Media]] on 15 June.

On 12 October 2018, McInnes participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of [[Inejiro Asanuma]] by [[Otoya Yamaguchi]] at the Metropolitan Republican Club. After the event, a contingent of Proud Boys were caught on tape beating a protester outside the venue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gavin McInnes 'Personally I think the guy was looking to get beat up for optics' |url=https://spectator.us/2018/10/gavin-mcinnes/ |website=Spectator USA |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after members of [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]] threw a plastic bottle filled with urine at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Feuer |first1=Alan |title=Founder of Proud Boys Says He’s Arranging Surrender of Men in Brawl |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/nyregion/the-proud-boys-gavin-mcinnes-arrested.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 16, 2018 |language=en |quote=The police said the violence started after one of the leftist protesters threw a plastic bottle at the Proud Boys, who had with them members of far-right groups, like the 211 Bootboys and Batalion 49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21st, shortly after news broke that, according to an alleged, unconfirmed Police report, the FBI had classified the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalists, McInnes said that his lawyers had advised him that quitting might help the nine members being prosecuted for the incidents in October and he said "this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing", and said it was a "stepping down gesture, in quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes quits 'extremist' far-right group|author=Wilson, Jason|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes-quits-far-right-group |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 21, 2018|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prengel |first1=Kate |title=Gavin McInnes Says He Is Quitting the Proud Boys [VIDEO] |url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/11/gavin-mcinnes-quits-proud-boys-video/ |work=Heavy.com |date=November 21,  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later that month, McInnes was planning on traveling to Australia for a speaking tour with [[Milo Yiannopolous]] and [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), but was informed by Australian immigration authorities that "he was judged to be of bad character" and would be denied a visa to enter the country.  Issuing a visa to McInnes was opposed by an online campaign called "#BanGavin", which collected 81,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jason (November 30, 2018) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/gavin-mcinnes-proud-boys-australia-visa "Gavin McInnes: founder of far-right Proud Boys denied Australian visa – report"] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 McInnes said, "I love being white and I think it's something to be very proud of. I don't want our culture diluted.

===Judaism and anti-Semitism===
In March 2017, during a trip to Israel with The Rebel Media, McInnes made controversial comments defending [[Holocaust deniers]], accused the Jews of being responsible for the [[Holodomor]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and said he was "becoming anti-Semitic". He later said his comments were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Islam===
McInnes is [[Islamophobia|anti-Islam]].&lt;ref name="VillageVoice" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/controversial-proud-boys-embrace-western-values-reject-feminism-and-political-correctness |title=Controversial Proud Boys Embrace 'Western Values,' Reject Feminism And Political Correctness |date=26 November 2017 |publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that "Muslims are stupid ... the only thing they really respect is [[violence]] and being tough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/features/inside-ezra-levants-rebel-media |title=Inside Rebel Media |date=16 August 2018 |publisher=''[[National Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has equated Islam with fascism, stating "[[Nazis]] are not a thing.

They tend to marry their first cousins... and that is a major problem [in the U.S.] because when you have mentally damaged inbreds – which not all Muslims are, but a disproportionate number are – and you have a hate book called the [[Koran]]... you end up with a perfect recipe for [[mass murder]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys |title=Proud Boys |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

===Gender===
McInnes has described himself as "an [[Archie Bunker]] sexist."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As early as 2003, [[Vanessa Grigoriadis]] in ''The New York Times'' quoted McInnes saying, "'No means no' is puritanism. I think Steinem-era feminism did women a lot of injustices, but one of the worst ones was convincing all these indie norts that women don't want to be dominated."&lt;ref name="Grigoriadis" /&gt; McInnes has been accused of [[sexism]] by various [[media outlets]] including ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutton |first=Scott |author-link= |date=15 May 2015 |title=Gavin McInnes might be the most sexist man on the planet |url=http://national.suntimes.com/national-politics/7/72/1126269/gavin-mcinnes-most-sexist-man-on-the-planet/ |dead-url=yes |department=National |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518013148/http://national.suntimes.com/national-politics/7/72/1126269/gavin-mcinnes-most-sexist-man-on-the-planet|archive-date=2015-05-18|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Independent Journal Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ijr.com/2015/05/326424-gavin-mcinnes-explains-sexist-comments-that-ruffled-feathers-by-totally-doubling-down-on-them/ |title=Gavin McInnes Explains 'Sexist' Comments That Ruffled Feathers...By Totally Doubling Down on Them |last=Bonk |first=Lawrence |author-link= |date=20 May 2015 |website=[[Independent Journal Review]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/16/bad-boy-gone-worse-is-vice-co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-flirting-with-a-dangerous-fringe/ |title=Bad boy gone worse: Is Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes flirting with a dangerous fringe? |last=Marcotte |first=Amanda |author-link=  |date=16 March 2017 |website=[[Salon (website)]] |publisher=  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/vice-co-founder-throws-epic-tantrum-about-women-defying-1450163938|title=Vice Co-Founder Throws Epic Tantrum About Women Defying Gender Roles|first=Madeleine|last=Davies |date=22 October 2013 |website=[[Jezebel (website)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gavin-mcinnes-interview-im-not-796177|title=Vice Co-Founder Gavin McInnes on Trolling Feminists: I'm Not Andy Kaufman; This Isn't a Joke|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/10/31/gavin_mcinnes_says_women_work_because_they_are_forced_to_pretend_to_be_men.html |title=Most Women Work Because They Have To|first=Amanda|last=Marcotte|date=31 October 2013|website=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, McInnes said during a panel interview that "people would be happier if women would stop pretending to be men", and that [[feminism]] "has made women less happy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/vice-co-founder-gavin-mcinnes-feminism-has-made-women-less-happy/ |title=Gavin McInnes: 'Feminism has Made Women Less Happy' |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that "We've trivialized childbirth and being domestic so much that women are forced to pretend to be men.

'''Gestaltzerfall''' (German for "shape decomposition") refers to a type of [[visual agnosia]] and is a [[Gestalt psychology|psychological]] phenomenon where delays in recognition are observed when a complex shape is stared at for a while as the shape seems to decompose into its constituting parts. With regards to [[kanji]], a study has shown that delays are most significant when the characters are of the same size. When characters to recognize are of different sizes, delays are observed only when they are of different patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8981675 |year=1996 |last1=Ninose |first1=Y |last2=Gyoba |first2=J |title=Delays produced by prolonged viewing in the recognition of Kanji characters: Analysis of the 'Gestaltzerfall' phenomenon |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=227–31 |journal=Shinrigaku kenkyu |doi=10.4992/jjpsy.67.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon was first described and named by C. Faust in 1947 as a symptom of the bilateral region of the [[parieto-occipital sulcus]] after a through and through bullet wound of this region. Afterwards, when the subject stared at a truck for a while the truck seemed to decompose into its motor, chassis, driver cab and the person could only focus on one of these parts until he briefly closed his eyes or looked away which reset the shape to the complete truck again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faust|first1=C.|title=Über Gestaltzerfall als Symptom des parieto-occipitalen Übergangsgebiets bei doppelseitiger Verletzung nach Hirnschuß|journal=Nervenarzt|date=1947|issue=18|pages=103-115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic of orthographic satiation as opposed to semantic satiation is that meaning remains intact. It was suggested that this is different from semantic satiation and from the stimulus familiarization effect because orthographic satiation occurs after the perceivers have access to lexical meaning.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—are brought toward (or ''gravitate'' toward) one another.  On [[Earth]], gravity gives [[weight]] to [[physical body|physical objects]], and the [[Moon]]'s [[gravitation of the Moon|gravity]] causes the ocean [[tide]]s. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the [[Universe]] caused it to begin [[coalescence (physics)|coalescing]], [[star formation|forming stars]]{{snd}}and for the stars to group together into galaxies{{snd}}so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.

Gravity is most accurately described by the [[general theory of relativity]] (proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915) which describes gravity not as a [[force]], but as a consequence of the [[curvature of spacetime]] caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a [[black hole]], from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's event horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html|title=HubbleSite: Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull|website=hubblesite.org|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other, with the force [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the product of their masses and [[inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] between them.&lt;!---This is considered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to occur over an infinite range, such that all bodies (with mass) in the Universe are drawn to each other no matter how far they are apart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=infinite range claim is not supported in the body of this article}}---&gt;

Gravity is the weakest of the four [[fundamental force]]s of physics, approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[Strong interaction|strong force]], 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[electromagnetic force]] and 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; times weaker than the [[Weak interaction|weak force]]. As a consequence, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scientific Development and Misconceptions Through the Ages: A Reference Guide |edition=illustrated |first1=Robert E. |last1=Krebs |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30226-8 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iApVikcj9UC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iApVikcj9UC&amp;pg=PA133 Extract of page 133]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it is the dominant force at the [[macroscopic scale]], and is the cause of the formation, shape and [[trajectory]] ([[orbit]]) of [[astronomical bodies]].  For example, gravity causes the Earth and the other planets to orbit the Sun, it also causes the [[Moon]] to orbit the Earth, and causes the formation of [[tide]]s, the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]], [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies]].

===Scientific revolution===
{{main|Scientific revolution}}
Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though possibly [[apocrypha]]l&lt;ref name=Ball_Piza&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Phil |date=June 2005  |title=Tall Tales |journal=Nature News |doi=10.1038/news050613-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) experiment dropping balls from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|Tower of Pisa]], and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down [[Inclined plane|inclines]], Galileo showed that gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects. This was a major departure from [[Aristotle]]'s belief that heavier objects have a higher gravitational acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638), ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 First Day] Salviati speaks: "If this were what Aristotle meant you would burden him with another error which would amount to a falsehood; because, since there is no such sheer height available on earth, it is clear that Aristotle could not have made the experiment; yet he wishes to give us the impression of his having performed it when he speaks of such an effect as one which we see."&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo postulated [[air resistance]] as the reason that objects with less mass fall more slowly in an atmosphere. Galileo's work set the stage for the formulation of Newton's theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Theory: A Mathematical Approach |edition=illustrated |first1=Peter |last1=Bongaarts |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3-319-09561-5 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cc6lBQAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cc6lBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 Extract of page 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's theory of gravitation===
{{main|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|English physicist and mathematician, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (1642-1727)]]
In 1687, English mathematician Sir [[Isaac Newton]] published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which hypothesizes the [[inverse-square law]] of universal gravitation. In his own words, "I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly."&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

As early as 1645 [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] had argued that any force exerted by the Sun on distant objects would have to follow an inverse-square law.  However, he also dismissed the idea that any such force did exist. See, for example,
{{cite book | title= From Eudoxus to Einstein—A History of Mathematical Astronomy

 | ref= Linton-2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is the following:

&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''F'' is the force, ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the masses of the objects interacting, ''r'' is the distance between the centers of the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].

Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to the discovery of Neptune.

A discrepancy in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by [[Albert Einstein]]'s new theory of [[general relativity]], which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit. This discrepancy was the advance in the perihelion of Mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nobil|first=Anna M.|date=March 1986|title=The real value of Mercury's perihelion advance|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/320039a0|journal=Nature|volume=320|issue=6057|pages=39–41|via=|bibcode=1986Natur.320...39N|doi=10.1038/320039a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Newton's theory has been superseded by [[Einstein]]'s general relativity, most modern [[Theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.

===Equivalence principle===
The [[equivalence principle]], explored by a succession of researchers including Galileo, [[Loránd Eötvös]], and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration.  The simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible. More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by Eötvös. Satellite experiments, for example [[STEP (satellite)|STEP]], are planned for more accurate experiments in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M.C.W.Sandford |publisher=[[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] |title=STEP: Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle |url=http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/ |date=2008 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928041608/http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/ |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formulations of the equivalence principle include:

* The Einsteinian equivalence principle: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;

===General relativity===

Matter changes the geometry of spacetime, this (curved) geometry being interpreted as gravity. White lines do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the [[coordinate system]] imposed on the curved spacetime, which would be [[regular grid|rectilinear]] in a flat spacetime.]]
{{General relativity sidebar}}
In [[general relativity]], the effects of gravitation are ascribed to [[spacetime]] [[curvature]] instead of a force. The starting point for general relativity is the [[equivalence principle]], which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621005940/http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes—The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Newtonian physics]], however, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.

Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic.  For instance, we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.

Einstein discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The [[Einstein field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equations|simultaneous]], [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.

====Solutions====
Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:
* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[Circular symmetry|spherically symmetric]] non-[[rotation|rotating]] uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [[black hole]] with a central [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.
* The [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner-Nordström solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with double [[event horizon]]s.
* The [[Kerr metric|Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
* The [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr-Newman solution]] for charged, rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the Universe.

====Tests====
The [[tests of general relativity]] included the following:&lt;ref name=Pauli1958&gt;{{cite book|last=Pauli|first=Wolfgang Ernst|title=Theory of Relativity|date=1958|isbn=978-0-486-64152-2|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|chapter=Part IV. General Theory of Relativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and Earth.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials ([[gravitational time dilation]]) has been confirmed by the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] (1959), the [[Hafele–Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS#Predecessors|GPS]].
* The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] from his observations during the [[Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=F.W.|authorlink1=Frank Watson Dyson|last2= Eddington|first2=A.S.|authorlink2=Arthur Eddington|last3=Davidson|first3=C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Total Eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

Quote, p. 332: "Thus the results of the expeditions to Sobral and Principe can leave little doubt that a deflection of light takes place in the neighbourhood of the sun and that it is of the amount demanded by Einstein's generalised theory of relativity, as attributable to the sun's gravitational field."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Steven|last=Weinberg|authorlink=Steven Weinberg|title=Gravitation and cosmology|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|date=1972}}. Quote, p. 192: "About a dozen stars in all were studied, and yielded values 1.98 ± 0.11" and 1.61 ± 0.31", in substantial agreement with Einstein's prediction θ&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.75"."&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington measured starlight deflections twice those predicted by Newtonian corpuscular theory, in accordance with the predictions of general relativity. However, his interpretation of the results was later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Glymour |first2=Clark |title=Relativity and Eclipses: The British eclipse expeditions of 1919 and their predecessors |date=1980 |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=49–85| doi=10.2307/27757471|jstor=27757471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent tests using radio interferometric measurements of [[quasar]]s passing behind the Sun have more accurately and consistently confirmed the deflection of light to the degree predicted by general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Steven|last=Weinberg|authorlink=Steven Weinberg|title=Gravitation and cosmology|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|date=1972|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[gravitational lens]].
* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.
* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s. On 11 February 2016, the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations announced the first observation of a gravitational wave.
* [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922 found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the [[cosmological constant]]). In 1927 [[Georges Lemaître]] showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static Universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. Thus general relativity predicted that the Universe had to be non-static—it had to either expand or contract. The expansion of the Universe discovered by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 confirmed this prediction.&lt;ref name=Pauli1&gt;See W.Pauli, 1958, pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory's prediction of [[frame dragging]] was consistent with the recent [[Gravity Probe B]] results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/may/HQ_11-134_Gravity_Probe_B.html |title=NASA's Gravity Probe B Confirms Two Einstein Space-Time Theories |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* General relativity predicts that light should lose [[photon energy|its energy]] when traveling away from massive bodies through [[gravitational redshift]]. This was verified on earth and in the solar system around 1960.

===Gravity and quantum mechanics===
{{Main|Graviton|Quantum gravity}}
In the decades after the publication of the theory of general relativity, it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Randall, Lisa | title=Warped Passages: Unraveling the Universe's Hidden Dimensions | publisher=Ecco | date=2005 | isbn=978-0-06-053108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to describe gravity in the framework of [[quantum field theory]] like the other [[fundamental forces]], such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of [[virtual particle|virtual]] gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feynman |first= R.

However, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the [[Planck length]],&lt;ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005"/&gt; where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.

{{main|Earth's gravity}}
Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body's mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.
[[File:Gravity action-reaction.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|left|If an object with comparable mass to that of the Earth were to fall towards it, then the corresponding acceleration of the Earth would be observable.]]
The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |first1=G.N. |last1=Cantor |first2=J.R.R. |last2=Christie |first3=M.J.S. |last3=Hodge |first4=R.C. |last4=Olby |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=    978-1-134-97751-2 |page=448 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PA448 Extract of page 448]&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of acceleration of falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|date = 15 December 2014|title = The Potsdam Gravity Potato|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of weights and measures, a [[standard gravity]] value is defined by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], under the [[International System of Units]] (SI).

That value, denoted ''g'', is ''g'' = 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The standard value of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the one originally adopted by the International Committee on Weights and Measures in 1901 for 45° latitude, even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand.&lt;ref name=List&gt;List, R. J. editor, 1968, Acceleration of Gravity, ''Smithsonian Meteorological Tables'', Sixth Ed. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; This value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard atmospheres as the value for 45° latitude even though it applies more precisely to latitude of 45°32'33".&lt;ref name=USSA1976&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539_1977009539.pdf U.S. Standard Atmosphere], 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976. (Linked file is very large.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s or 22&amp;nbsp;mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62&amp;nbsp;m/s (64.4&amp;nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.1740&amp;nbsp;ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same time.

According to [[Newton's 3rd law|Newton's 3rd Law]], the Earth itself experiences a [[Newtons|force]] equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object.  This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide.  Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object's.  If the object doesn't bounce after it has collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive [[contact force]] on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.

The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.  The force of gravity is the weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth.  The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Equator to about 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the poles.

===Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth===
{{main|Equations for a falling body}}
Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] simplifies to ''F'' = ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the body and ''g'' is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Earth. This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this ''g''. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first {{frac|20}} of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12&amp;nbsp;mm); by {{frac|2|20}} it has dropped at total of 4 units; by {{frac|3|20}}, 9 units and so on.

Under the same constant gravity assumptions, the [[potential energy]], ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, of a body at height ''h'' is given by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mgh'' (or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Wh'', with ''W'' meaning weight). This expression is valid only over small distances ''h'' from the surface of the Earth. Similarly, the expression &lt;math&gt;h = \tfrac{v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt; for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity ''v'' is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.

===Gravity and astronomy===
[[File:Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal.jpg|thumb|right|Gravity acts on stars that form the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1517a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Obseevatory|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of [[quasar]]s; even the existence of [[dark matter]] is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its [[orbit]] because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic centers]], galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in [[supercluster]]s. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The earliest gravity (possibly in the form of quantum gravity, [[supergravity]] or a [[gravitational singularity]]), along with ordinary space and time, developed during the [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang|birth]] of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state (such as a [[false vacuum]], [[quantum vacuum]] or [[virtual particle]]), in a currently unknown manner.&lt;ref name="Planck-UOregon"/&gt;

===Gravitational radiation===
[[File:LIGO Hanford aerial 05.jpg|alt=LIGO Hanford Observatory|thumb|The [[LIGO]] Hanford Observatory located in Washington, US where gravitational waves were first observed in September 2015.]]
{{Main|Gravitational wave}}
According to general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in situations where the curvature of [[spacetime]] is oscillating, such as is the case with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the [[Solar System]] is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as [[PSR B1913+16]]. It is believed that [[neutron star]] mergers and [[black hole]] formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ([[LIGO]]) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On 14 September 2015, LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name='Clark 2016'&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gravitational waves: scientists announce 'we did it!'{{snd}}live|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2016/feb/11/gravitational-wave-announcement-latest-physics-einstein-ligo-black-holes-live|website = the Guardian|date=2016-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-11|first = Stuart|last = Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=11 February 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361  |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist. The event confirms that [[binary black hole]]s exist. It also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the Universe including the Big Bang and what happened after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT ARE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND WHY DO THEY MATTER?|url=http://www.popsci.com/whats-so-important-about-gravitational-waves|publisher=popsci.com|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed of gravity===
{{Main|Speed of gravity}}
In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of [[Earth tide]]s during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrowatch.net/2012/12/chinese-scientists-find-evidence-for.html Chinese scientists find evidence for speed of gravity], astrowatch.com, 12/28/12.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in the [[Chinese Science Bulletin]] in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=TANG|first=Ke Yun|author2=HUA ChangCai |author3=WEN Wu |author4=CHI ShunLiang |author5=YOU QingYu |author6=YU Dan |title=Observational evidences for the speed of the gravity based on the Earth tide|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|date=February 2013|volume=58|issue=4–5|pages=474–77|doi=10.1007/s11434-012-5603-3|bibcode=2013ChSBu..58..474T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[LIGO]] and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817|title=GW170817 Press Release|website=LIGO Lab - Caltech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anomalies and discrepancies==
There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways.
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|frame|right|Rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). The discrepancy between the curves is attributed to [[dark matter]].]]
* '''Extra-fast stars''': Stars in galaxies follow a [[Galaxy rotation curve|distribution of velocities]] where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] show a similar pattern. [[Dark matter]], which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the discrepancy. Various [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|modifications to Newtonian dynamics]] have also been proposed.
* '''[[Flyby anomaly]]''': Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during [[gravity assist]] maneuvers.
* '''Accelerating expansion''': The [[metric expansion of space]] seems to be speeding up. [[Dark energy]] has been proposed to explain this. A recent alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/astronomy/cosmology/mg19726461.600-dark-energy-may-just-be-a-cosmic-illusion.html Dark energy may just be a cosmic illusion], ''New Scientist'', issue 2646, 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however this conclusion is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026783.800-swisscheese-model-of-the-cosmos-is-full-of-holes.html Swiss-cheese model of the cosmos is full of holes], ''New Scientist'', issue 2678, 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Anomalous increase of the [[astronomical unit]]''': Recent measurements indicate that [[Astronomical unit#Developments|planetary orbits are widening]] faster than if this were solely through the Sun losing mass by radiating energy.
* '''Extra energetic photons''': Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] gain twice as much energy as expected. This may indicate that gravity falls off ''faster'' than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.&lt;ref name=newsci2699&gt;{{cite web|last=Chown|first=Marcus|title=Gravity may venture where matter fears to tread|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126990.400-gravity-may-venture-where-matter-fears-to-tread.html|website=New Scientist|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=16 March 2009|issue=2699}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Extra massive hydrogen clouds''': The spectral lines of the [[Lyman-alpha forest]] suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain scales than expected and, like [[dark flow]], may indicate that gravity falls off ''slower'' than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.&lt;ref name=newsci2699/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Integrated Chain Management''' (ICM), also known as '''Integral Chain Management''', is an approach for the reduction of environmental impact of product chains. Such a product chain exists out of an extraction phase, a production phase, a use phase and a waste phase. The ultimate goal of ICM is a reduction of environmental load over the whole chain. Integrated Chain Management is one of the approaches that can be used to come to [[sustainable development]]. Other approaches in this line are the [[Ecological Footprint]] and the [[DTO approach]]. 

Within the ICM approach all phases within the chain must be considered.  Therefore it can be seen as a "cradle to grave" approach. 
Several inputs and outputs can be taken into account when applying the ICM approach. Such as: Energy flows, mass flows, materials, waste flows and emissions.  Within ICM material cycles should be closed where possible and the remainder flows of [[air pollution|emissions]] and waste should be brought within acceptable boundaries. Also the use of resources should be kept to a minimum.  

Integrated chain management should not be mixed up with [[Supply Chain Management]] or [[Integrated Supply Chain Management]]. These concepts do not have the reduction of environmental load as their main goal. 

An important aspect of ICM is that shifting to other phases in the product chain is avoided. For instance, a producer of chairs can choose to leave off an environment unfriendly material in a new product. The producer can even see this as an extra selling point for the customer, but as a consequence the supplier of raw materials has to use much more energy to produce a material with the same qualities. The result of this is that there may no longer be a net environmental reduction across the whole chain. Within the integrated chain management approach this is avoided. 

The chain can be managed by developing new policies and economical or political incentives. Therefore one must have insight into the inputs and outputs of the production chain. Before these policies can be developed one must engage in several actions.  

*Analyse the processes into a preferred level of detail
*Determine the boundaries of the chain. Should links outside the companies be involved as well? 
*Determine whether there should be a focus on just one or on several environmental problems
*Determine on which material flows or energy flows there should be a focus. 

Effective supply chain management can impact virtually all business and production processes

==Example==
An example of applying the ICM approach would be to develop policies in a particular product area. The responsibility of problems caused by the waste stage can be assigned to the producers of these products. This leads to improved product design and new insight in how to put these products in the market. For instance the product can be sold with a disposal contribution. On the price tag of a radio nowadays can be printed:  "this radio costs 25 $ not including the 3 $ disposal contribution" 
The effects can be seen within the whole chain. The producer will try to choose non-polluting materials, as they increase the costs of the waste-stage. The producer of raw materials will try to improve its production process in order to meet the increased demand for 'clean' primary products. And the consumer will be aware that some products give more pressure on the environment than others when its economical lifespan has run out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6501">'''John Kent McNulty''' (born 1934) is an American legal scholar, who was a professor of law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] ([[Boalt Hall]]) for 38 years from 1964 to 2002 and who as a legal educator and scholar, was influential in shaping U.S. tax law policy debate during the later quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Colloquium on Corporate Integration: Commentary Preserving the Virtues of Sub Chapter S  in an Integrated World", 47 Tax L. Rev. 681 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Pages/integration-paper.aspx Integration Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402140834/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Pages/integration-paper.aspx |date=2013-04-02 }}, generally, [http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/14_bibliography.pdf Bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513023331/http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/14_bibliography.pdf |date=2013-05-13 }}, specifically&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
McNulty was Boalt Hall’s Robert J. Traynor professor of law for the last decade of his career from 1991 to 2002 and is a professor emeritus at the law school. He was for over 30 years and continued to be even after his academic retirement a noted researcher in the area of structural reform of U.S. tax law.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/mcnultyj/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501074350/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/mcnultyj/index.html |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is of particular importance in the area of proposals for U.S. federal "Integration" of corporate and individual taxation. "Integration" of corporate and individual income taxes is plans under which corporate income is only taxed once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2138324|title=Corporate Tax Integration: A View From the Treasury Department|first=R.

'''Juggling notation''' is the written depiction of concepts and practices in [[juggling]].&lt;ref name=newsci&gt;{{cite journal|issue=2479 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18424792.100 |title= New juggling tricks created by maths |date=December 25, 2004 |first=Erica |last=Klarreich |journal=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|accessdate=August 29, 2009|journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/jugweb/sciamjug.pdf |date=November 1995 |volume=273 |issue=5 |pages=92–97 |title=The Science of Juggling |first1=Peter J. |last1=Beek |first2=Arthur |last2=Lewbel|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1195-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toss juggling]] [[juggling pattern|patterns]] have a reputation for being "easier done than said" – while it might be easy to learn a given maneuver and demonstrate it for others, it is often much harder to communicate the idea accurately using speech or plain text. To circumvent this problem, various numeric or diagram-based notation systems have been developed to facilitate communication of patterns or tricks between jugglers, as well the investigation and discovery of new patterns.

A juggling notation system (based on [[percussion notation|music notation]]) was first proposed by Dave Storer in 1978 and while the first juggling diagram (a ladder diagram), by [[Claude Shannon]] around 1981, was not printed till 2010, the first printed diagram and second oldest notation system were proposed by Jeff Walker in 1982.&lt;ref name="Lewbel"&gt;Lewbel, Arthur (1996). "[http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/49-2/v49no2-page%2057.htm The Academic Juggler: The Invention Of Juggling Notations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182339/http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/49-2/v49no2-page%2057.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}", ''Juggle.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagram-based==
[[File:JugglingBoxDiagram.gif|78px|thumb|Ladder diagram:&lt;br/&gt;3-ball [[box (juggling)|box]]]]

While diagrams are the most visual and reader-friendly way to notate many juggling patterns, they rely on images, so are complicated to produce and unwieldy to share via text or speech.

* '''Ladder diagrams''' - Each rung on the "ladder" represents a point in time (or "beat"). The juggled objects are represented as lines, their paths through time and between a pair of hands.
[[File:Juggling 6 ball 4 count ladder diagram.png|thumb|center|&lt;3p333:3p333&gt; pattern ladder diagram with a rail per juggler&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Jochen (2012-02-18). "[https://www.seehuhn.de/pages/passing Ball Passing Patterns]", ''Seehuhn.de'' (accessed 10/28/2017).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''Causal diagrams''' - Similar to the ladder diagram but doesn't show the [[juggling prop|props]] held in a juggler's hands. Instead it only shows each "problem" &amp;mdash; an incoming prop &amp;mdash; and what the juggler should do to make space in his or her hands to catch that incoming prop. It is usually used for [[passing (juggling)|club passing]] and can be displayed or edited in some juggling software.
*'''Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams''' - [[Mills Mess]] is a popular pattern in which the arms cross and uncross. Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams can be used to track these basic arm movements.

==Numeric==
The following notation systems use only numbers and common characters. The patterns can easily be communicated by text. Most numeric systems are designed to be processed by software juggling simulators &amp;mdash; for example, to view juggling patterns as computer animations.

===Siteswap===
{{Main|Siteswap}}
Developed by mathematically inclined jugglers Bengt Magnusson and Bruce Boppo Tiemann in 1985,&lt;ref name=newsci/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Donahue |first=Bill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/science/jugglers-now-juggle-numbers-to-compute-new-tricks-for-ancient-art.html |title=Jugglers Now Juggle Numbers to Compute New Tricks for Ancient Art |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-04-16 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/mathjuggling.html |title=Read This: The Mathematics of Juggling |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=2003-12-03 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016045559/http://www.maa.org/reviews/mathjuggling.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[siteswap]] is by far the most common juggling notation.

A given juggling pattern is represented by a sequence of digits, like "333", "97531", or "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur by the time that same prop will be caught. For example, "333" represents a common three-ball [[cascade (juggling)|cascade]], where three props are thrown before the same prop will be caught and thrown again. Within the "531531" pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' throw, will not be caught until five throws have been made, including itself, where it will be thrown again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will be thrown again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop is thrown with a '1' throw, which is a direct pass to the other hand and will be thrown on the very next throw as a '5'. 

Because the number represents the number of throws that occur before that prop will be caught, it can be also be thought to describe how high one throws the prop, or how long it remains in the air relative to the other throws, where even numbers inevitably come back to the same hand and odd numbers cross over to the other hand.

The number of props in a given juggling pattern can be determined by the average of one repeating group. "633633633", therefore describes a four-prop pattern, while "414414414" describes a three-prop juggling pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thomwall.com/siteswap-fundamentals|title=Siteswap Fundamentals ⋆ Thom Wall|date=2017-09-05|work=Thom Wall|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Vanilla" siteswap is the most basic form of siteswap and uses only a simple string of digits to describe patterns that throw only one prop at a time, alternating between hands. For slightly more complicated patterns, extra rules and syntax are added to create the following two siteswap extensions:

*''Synchronous Siteswap'', or "Synch" Siteswap. This is used to notate patterns where both hands throw at the same time, rather than alternating left and right hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in parentheses and separated by a comma. For example, "(4,4)(4,4)(4,4)".
*''Multiplex Siteswap''. "Multiplex", in the world of juggling, means "more than one ball is in the hand at the time of the throw". Multiplex Siteswap allows you to notate such patterns, and also can be mixed with synchronous siteswap. A multiplex is described by a digit for each prop in the multiplex throw contained within square brackets. "23[43]23[43]" is a common four ball multiplex. 

Vanilla, synch, and multiplex siteswap are the "standard" forms of siteswap. Not only are they understood by jugglers, there are also many computer programs capable of animating juggling patterns entered in siteswap notation.

Other extensions to siteswap have been developed for specific purposes. These are far less common than the "standard" forms of siteswap, understood by far fewer jugglers and only specialized software.

*'''Passing siteswap''' - used for simple passing patterns.
*'''Multi-Hand Notation''' (MHN) - Developed by Ed Carstens for use with his juggling program JugglePro, MHN can describe patterns with any number of hands and at any rhythm, but use is limited due to its being as complex as a computer programming language.
*'''Generalized Siteswap''' (GS) - Developed by Ben Beever, GS places siteswap into a matrix that uses optional, additional rows to describe any desired attributes of the throws or catches within a pattern, such as timing issues (e.g. for synch patterns), number of spins (e.g. for clubs) and hand position/orientation (e.g. for backcrosses, claw catches etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf|title=SS Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns|last=Beever|first=Ben|date=20 January 2002|work=The Juggling Edge|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laplace, Pierre-Simon, marquis de.jpg|thumb| French scholar [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] (1749-1827)]]

In the [[history of science]], ''Laplace's demon'' was the first published articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]], by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1814.&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=Does God Play Dice? |work=Public Lectures}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to determinism, if someone (the Demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed; they can be calculated from the laws of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Simon Laplace, "[https://archive.org/details/philosophicaless00lapliala A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities]" (full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

A desire to confirm or refute Laplace's demon played a vital motivating role{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} in the subsequent development of statistical [[thermodynamics]], the first of several repudiations developed by later generations of [[physics|physicists]] to the assumption of causal determinacy upon which Laplace's demon is erected.

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated into English from the original French 6th ed. by Truscott, F.W. and Emory, F.L., Dover Publications (New York, 1951) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This intellect is often referred to as ''Laplace's demon'' (and sometimes ''Laplace's Superman'', after [[Hans Reichenbach]]). Laplace himself did not use the word "demon", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: ''"Une intelligence... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux."'' Apparently, Laplace was not the first to evoke one such demon and strikingly similar passages can be found decades before Laplace's ''Essai philosophique'' in the work of scholars such as [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Baron D'Holbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marij  | year = 2014 | title = On the origins and foundations of Laplacian determinism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001325 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 24–31 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that the first who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 ''Theoria philosophiae naturalis'' turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also—being founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions—to be more precise, complete and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kožnjak Boris | year = 2015 | title = Who let the demon out?

==Arguments against Laplace's demon==

===Thermodynamic irreversibility===
According to chemical engineer [[Robert Ulanowicz]], in his 1986 book ''Growth and Development'', Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of [[irreversibility]], [[entropy]], and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversibility]] and classical mechanics; however, Ulanowicz points out that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible, so that if thermodynamic quantities are taken to be purely physical then no such demon is possible as one could not reconstruct past positions and momenta from the current state. [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]] takes a very different view, considering thermodynamic variables to have a statistical basis which can be kept separate from the microscopic physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory has met criticism regarding its ability to make predictions about physics; a number of physicists and mathematicians, including Yvan Velenik of the Department of Mathematics for the [[University of Geneva]], have pointed out that maximum entropy thermodynamics essentially describes our knowledge about a system and not the system itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unige.ch/math/folks/velenik/publications.html|title=Section de Mathématiques Université de Genève|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2017|website=www.unige.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum mechanical irreversibility===
Due to its canonical assumption of [[determinism]], Laplace's demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation]], which stipulates [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]]. The interpretation of quantum mechanics is still very much open for debate and there are many who take opposing views (such as the [[Many Worlds Interpretation]] and the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm interpretation]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2719v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaos theory===
[[Chaos theory]] is sometimes pointed out as a contradiction to Laplace's demon: it describes how a deterministic system can nonetheless exhibit behavior that is impossible to predict: as in the [[butterfly effect]], minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Causal Determinism"]&lt;/ref&gt; While this explains unpredictability in practical cases, applying it to Laplace's case is questionable: under the strict demon hypothesis all details are known—to infinite precision—and therefore variations in starting conditions are non-existent. Put another way: Chaos theory is applicable when knowledge of the system is imperfect whereas Laplace's demon assumes perfect knowledge of the system, therefore chaos theory and Laplace's demon are actually compatible with each other.

===Cantor diagonalization ===
In 2008, [[David Wolpert]] used [[Cantor diagonalization]] to disprove Laplace's demon. He did this by assuming that the demon is a computational device and showed that no two such devices can completely predict each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=David H. Wolpert| title=Physical limits of inference| journal=Physica D| volume=237| issue=9| year=2008| pages=1257–1281| doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.03.040| arxiv=0708.1362| bibcode=2008PhyD..237.1257W}} [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1476h/1476%20%28Wolpert%29.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.-M. Binder |url=http://www.astro.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/Binder_nv-toae.pdf |title=Theories of almost everything |journal=Nature |volume=455 |year=2008 |pages=884–885 |doi=10.1038/455884a |issue=7215|bibcode=2008Natur.455..884B }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wolpert's paper was cited in 2014 in a paper of Josef Rukavicka, where a significantly simpler argument is presented that disproves Laplace's demon using Turing machines. &lt;ref&gt;Rukavicka Josef (2014), ''Rejection of Laplace's Demon, The American Mathematical Monthly [https://dx.doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.121.06.498]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, i.e. the ability of Laplace's demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the [[Planck length]], and the figure was shown to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=If the Universe Were a Computer |author=Physical Review Focus |publisher=[[American Physical Society|APS]] |date=24 May 2002 |url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has elapsed so far in the universe.

Another theory suggests that if Laplace's demon were to occupy a parallel universe or alternate dimension from which it could determine the implied data and do the necessary calculations on an alternate and greater time line, the aforementioned time limitation would not apply. This position is for instance explained in ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'' by [[David Deutsch]], who says that realizing a 300-[[qubit]] [[quantum computer]] would prove the existence of parallel universes carrying the computation.

Counter arguments to this can be made using [[string theory]]. Albeit, the gradients of finite theories are useful, speculative scenarios, such as space-time decompactification &lt;ref&gt;Yau, S.-T., &amp; Nadis, S. J. (2010, p. 264). The shape of inner space: String theory and the geometry of the universe's hidden dimensions. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; occurring on a faster frame, require infinities whose interpretation remains open.

===Depictions in popular culture===

In the anime series [[Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace]], Laplace's Demon is the basis of a high school student's computer program called Dark Star. Dark Star is a program which allows for a masked vigilante, Twenty Faces, to cause the deaths of people who have escaped justice.

[[Blast of Tempest]] Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect are incorporated in the main theme, where time travel and breaking out of parallel universes' becomes the main plot.

In the film [[Waking Life]] a discussion of Laplace's Demon takes place, as well as a handling of the retort from Quantum Mechanics.

In the webcomic [[Dresden Codak]] this concept is used in a page melding philosophical notions and a [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]] séance entitled "Advanced dungeons and discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dresden Codak » Archive » Advanced Dungeons &amp; Discourse|url = http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this page, Kimiko Ross has to burn the second law of thermodynamics in order to summon the Demon.

The UK sitcom [[Spaced]] featured an episode called Chaos, in which the artist Brian makes an implicit reference to Laplace's Demon in a conversation about Chaos Theory. He states that reality is a mathematically predictable preordained system, even though it would "utterly defy any possibility of comprehension by even the most brilliant human mind."

In the light novel and anime series [[Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai|Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai]], it is mentioned in order to try define the situation in which the main protagonist is repeating a specific day.

Rapurasu no Majo (Laplace's witch), a 2015 novel by Japanese author [[Keigo Higashino]]. It was adapted to [[Laplace's Witch (film)|film in 2018]], directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and starring [[Shō Sakurai]].

Jordan joined the [[Kansas City Police Department]] in 1938, became a detective, and in 1952, became the first African-American police lieutenant in that department's history. He took a leave of absence in 1947, and spent eight years training the police forces of [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=Library/&gt; A pilot, he flew his own plane around the country.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; In 1948, he helped coordinate the rescue of the French High Commissioner of West Africa and 16 other French officials after their plane made a forced landing. He was awarded the Chevalier of the Star of Africa by Liberian President [[William Tubman]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Vote/&gt;

In 1951, Jordan became a life member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref name=Vote/&gt; He returned to Kansas City in February, 1952, and was promoted to police lieutenant.

==Assassination==

At about 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 15, 1970, he was killed just outside his Green Duck Tavern by three shotgun blasts. Eyewitnesses reported that the three killers were African-American. The shotgun had been stolen, and was abandoned immediately. When it was recovered, it was traced to a burglary five years earlier in [[Independence, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=mob&gt;{{cite news | last = McGraw | first = Mike | author2 = Glenn E.

Three men were arrested for the murder, including at least one affiliated with a criminal group called the "Black Mafia".

This report was not discovered in the initial investigation of Jordan's murder, but was uncovered by investigative journalists working for the ''Kansas City Star'' in 2010. When the reporters asked the Kansas City Police Department about the gun, they were told that it had been lost in 1973. The gun may have been sold in a police surplus auction. Some time later, the police purchased the used shotgun from a gun store, and did not check the serial number. The gun was refurbished and placed into police service.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

On November 5, 1997, a police officer used the shotgun to shoot and wound an armed suspect in [[North Kansas City, Missouri]]. The gun was analyzed by the crime lab, who failed to identify it as the Jordan murder weapon, and it was returned to police service the following year. Only when the ''Kansas City Star'' asked questions about the missing shotgun in 2010 did a crime lab technician run a computer check that located the gun, which was recovered from the trunk of a police car and then returned to the evidence room.&lt;ref name=gun/&gt;

==2010 investigation==

In 2010, reporters with the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' began investigating the assassination while preparing for coverage of the 40th anniversary of Jordan's death. This led to discovery of the missing murder weapon and some old fingerprint cards, and that motivated the Kansas City Police Department to re-open the official investigation of the department's oldest cold case. Civil rights leader [[Alvin Sykes]] pressed the department for a complete investigation.&lt;ref name=gun/&gt; In trying to determine who was responsible for the assassination, the newspaper reported that Jordan and his Freedom, Inc. political movement had been opposed to the "North End" faction in Kansas City politics, a group under the influence of [[La Cosa Nostra]], and which had previously controlled black voting blocs. In 1965, Jordan had punched [[Frank Mazzuca (Missouri)|Frank Mazzuca]], a fellow state legislator who was alleged to have supported mob interests in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], and death threats against Jordan were reported in the aftermath.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;

The newspaper reported that police informants associated with the Black Mafia had described the killing as a favor to North End mob interests, and that it was organized by "Shotgun Joe" Centimano, owner of a local liquor store. The informants said that Centimano had supplied the murder weapon and recruited the killers. The newspaper reported that one informant said the assassination had elements of both a "[[contract killing]]" and a "revenge killing", and that another said it was "all about politics."&lt;ref name=killing/&gt; News coverage said that a 900-page police report finished in 2011 had concluded that mob boss [[Nicholas Civella|Nick Civella]] had given his "blessing" to Jordan's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police send report on 1970 slaying to prosecutor | newspaper = [[Columbia Missourian]] | location = [[Columbia, Missouri]] | date = February 9, 2011 | url = http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2011/02/09/police-send-report-1970-slaying-prosecutor/ | accessdate = February 19, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120729210125/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2011/02/09/police-send-report-1970-slaying-prosecutor/ | archivedate = July 29, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; No one was indicted because all of the main players were dead by then.

THE LEADER

LEON MERCER JORDAN

1905-1970

Leon Mercer Jordan was a leader, a true and gifted servant of his people. He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.A. during an era when he was, solely by reason of his race and color, generally excluded from the society of other so-called civilized folk because of policies and practices of racial segregation, discrimination and exclusion which were firmly embedded in the laws of this land and were clothed with every legal sanction.  Early in life he began to apply his vision, wisdom and iron will to a dissolution of the restraints which were imposed upon him and his people at the time of his birth.  At the time of his death, every legal sanction for racial segregation and discrimination had been eradicated, and he had founded and forged into an instrument of tremendous political force and power an organization called [[Freedom, Inc.]], and through Freedom Inc., Leon Mercer Jordan accomplished the political liberation of black folk in this town and state, he was a Lieutenant of police, Chief of the Constabulary of the Republic of [[Liberia]], a member of the House of Representatives of Missouri, but he is remembered here by this mass of stone and bronze because he was "the Leader" whose work and efforts contributed significantly toward the realization of justice, equality and freedom, for all.}}

His papers, including extensive documentation of his service in Liberia, are collected in the library of the University of Missouri-Kansas City.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

'''Marcel Broodthaers''' (28 January 1924 – 28 January 1976) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] poet, filmmaker and artist with a highly literate and often witty approach to creating [[art]] works.

==Life and career==
Broodthaers was born in [[Brussels]], Belgium, where he was associated with the [[Groupe Surréaliste-revolutionnaire]]  from 1945 and dabbled in [[journalism]], [[film]], and [[poetry]]. After spending 20 years in poverty as a struggling poet,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online; Essay on Broodthaers by Michael Compton&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1963 he decided to become an artist and began to make objects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/marcel-broodthaers-815/text-artist-biography Marcel Broodthaers] [[Tate]].&lt;/ref&gt; He performed the symbolic act of embedding fifty unsold copies of his book of poems ''Pense-Bête'' in plaster, creating his first art object. That same year, 1964, for his first exhibition, he wrote a famous preface for the exhibition catalogue;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed in life. For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty years old... Finally the idea of inventing something insincere crossed my mind and I set to work straightaway. At the end of three months I showed what I had produced to Philippe Edouard Toussaint, the owner of the Galerie St Laurent. 'But it is art' he said 'and I will willingly exhibit all of it.' 'Agreed' I replied. If I sell something, he takes 30%. It seems these are the usual conditions, some galleries take 75%.

What is it? In fact it is objects."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Marcel Broodthaers, Tate Gallery, 1980 p13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broodthaers made his first film in 1957, and from 1967 he produced over 50 short films in documentary, narrative, and experimental styles.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmstudiescenter.uchicago.edu/events/2010/films-marcel-broodthaers-between-art-history-and-film-studies The Films of Marcel Broodthaers: Between Art History and Film Studies, 15 May 2010] [[University of Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers later worked principally with assemblies of [[found object]]s and [[collage]], often containing written texts.

From 1968 to 1975 Broodthaers produced large-scale environmental pieces that reworked the very notion of the museum.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; His most noted work was an installation which began in his Brussels house which he called ''Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles'' (1968), containing different representations of eagles in glass cases that were accompanied by signs that asserted "This is not a work of art", implying that museums obscure the ideological functioning of images by imposing illegitimate classifications of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After Modern Art|last=Hopkins|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0192842343|location=London|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This installation was followed by a further eleven manifestations of the 'museum', including at the [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] for an exhibition in 1970 and at documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972. In 1970 Broodthaers conceived of the ''Financial Section'', which encompassed an attempt to sell the museum "on account of bankruptcy." The sale was announced on the cover of the [[Art Cologne]] fair catalogue in 1971, but no buyers were found. As part of the ''Financial Section'', the artist also produced an unlimited edition of gold ingots stamped with the museum's emblem, an eagle, a symbol associated with power and victory. The ingots were sold to raise money for the museum, at a price calculated by doubling the market value of gold, the surcharge representing the bar's value as art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/1999/muse/artist_pages/broodthaers_musee.html Marcel Broodthaers, ''Musée d'Art Moderne, Département des Aigles, Section Financière (Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles, Financial Section)'' (1970-1971)] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Broodthaers launched three separate exhibitions in the same week, each consisting of a new type of installation artwork he referred to as “décors.” The venues of these exhibitions were Wide White Space in Antwerp, Catalogue-Catalogus at Palais de Beaux-Arts Brussels, and Eloge du sujet at Kunstmuseum Basel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective|last=Chaffee|first=Cathleen|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|year=2016|isbn=978-0-87070-962-3|location=Belgium|pages=290–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Broodthaers presented the exhibition "L’Angelus de Daumier" at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Paris, at which each room had the name of a colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macba.es/antagonismos/english/09_18.html Marcel Broodthaers, ''La Salle blanche'' (1975)] [[MACBA]], Barcelona.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''La Salle Blanche (The White Room)'' (1975), a life-size copy of a room and a half in Broodthaers' home in Brussels, the wooden walls of the empty, unfurnished rooms are covered with printed words in French—such as museum, gallery, oil, subject, composition, images, and privilege—all intended to examine "the influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brenson (15 June 1984), [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/15/arts/art-for-jean-cocteau-word-was-multifarious.html For Jean Cocteau, Word Was Multifarious] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For such works he is associated with the late 20th century global spread of both [[installation art]] as well as [[Institutional Critique|"institutional critique,"]] in which interrelationships between artworks, the artist, and the museum are a focus. Indeed, Broodthaers' ''Musée d'Art Moderne'', his "first fictional museum," allowed him to simultaneously posture as artist, director, curator and trustee in a self-reflexive examination of the order and prescriptions implicit in the production of museum exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutional Critique: An Anthology of Artists' Writings|last=Alberro, Stimson|first=Alexander and Blake|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01316-1|location=Cambridge|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 1969, Broodthaers lived mainly in Düsseldorf, Berlin, and finally London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He died of a [[liver disease]]&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] on his 52nd birthday. He is buried at [[Ixelles Cemetery]] in Brussels under a tombstone of his own design.

==Exhibitions==
In 1980, the exhibition "Marcel Broodthaers" was mounted by the [[Tate Gallery]], London. Other important retrospectives of Broodthaers’ work have been held at the [[Walker Art Center]] (1989), [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (1989); [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], Pittsburgh (1989); [[Jeu de Paume]], Paris (1991); and [[Palais des Beaux Arts]], Brussels (2000). The most recent traveling survey was organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York and the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]], Madrid in 2016. The show also traveled to the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], Düsseldorf in 2017. An important solo exhibition of the film work, "Marcel Broodthaers: Cinéma", was shown at [[Fundacio Antoni Tàpies]], Barcelona; Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and [[Kunsthalle Düsseldorf]] (1997). The first Solo Show in Austria was presented 2003 at Kunsthalle Vienna. In 2015 the [[Fridericianum]] presented a comprehensive retrospective featuring works from all of the artist's creative periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fridericianum.org/exhibitions/marcel-broodthaers|title=Marcel Broodthaers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1542 "Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective"] at the Museum of Modern Art, New York was the first Broodthaers retrospective organized in New York. This solo exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art, New York February 14–May 15, 2016 and then traveled to Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía , Madrid, in October 2016, and to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf in the Spring of 2017.

There have been many notable international group exhibitions, including [[documenta]] 10, 7 and 5, Kassel (1997, 1982, and 1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2010-09-09_marcel-broodthaers/ Marcel Broodthaers: SECTION CINÉMA, 9 September – 16 October 2010] [[Marian Goodman Gallery]], New York/Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
As a poet and political activist, Broodthaers had a life-long interest in the circulatory power of printed matter: posters, graphics, editions, and artist books. In addition to the monetary potential of galleries selling limited editions, artist's books published with  nonprofit institutions like Kunstalle Düsseldorf, the Deutsche Academischer Austaudienst (DAAD), Berlin, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, merged the artist's commercial ambitions with conceptual and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/broodthaers-tractatus-logico-catalogicus-art-or-the-art-of-selling-p01810|title=‘Tractatus Logico Catalogicus - Art or the Art of Selling’, Marcel Broodthaers, 1972 - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Broodthaers' catalogue for ''Der Adler von Oligizän bis heute,'' the seminal culmination of his ''Musee d'Art Moderne, department des Aigles,'' at Kunstalle Düsseldorf in 1972, was published in two volumes. The first volume featured a scholarly index of the items on display and was for sale at the opening of the exhibition, replete with a coupon that could be redeemed for a copy of volume two, which came out at the close of the exhibition and featured views of the installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broodthaers.us/index.php?id=2,48,50|title=Broodthaers Society of America|website=www.broodthaers.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broodthaers returned to this motif for his artist's book ''Photographieren Verboten/No Photographs Allowed'' but aimed it at the convention of the exhibition catalogue, with version one published by the DAAD, Berlin, and version two by the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The Oxford book presents ostensibly the same content as the DAAD book but scrambles the internal logic of the book, changing the context of its standard component parts—title page, checklist, scholarly essay, curriculum vitae—and thus the implications of each. Content normally reserved for the rear of an exhibition catalogue (in this case the artist's cv) appears on the inside front cover as a decorative pattern, and scholarly content such as the catalogue essay appears on the outside back cover like an advertising blurb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broodthaers.us/index.php?id=2,48,115|title=Broodthaers Society of America|website=www.broodthaers.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which females (most notably in mammals) hold the primary power positions in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property at the specific exclusion of males — at least to a large degree.

While those definitions apply in general English, definitions specific to the disciplines of [[anthropology]] and [[feminism]] differ in some respects. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known anthropological societies ''that are unambiguously matriarchal'', but some authors believe exceptions may exist or may have.

Matriarchies may also be confused with [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], and [[matrifocal family|matrifocal]] societies. A few people consider any non-[[patriarchy|patriarchal]] system to be matriarchal, thus including genderally equalitarian systems ([[Peggy Reeves Sanday]] favors redefining and reintroducing the word matriarchy, especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Reeves Sanday, anthropologist, [http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100164210 Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy], [[Cornell University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;), but most academics exclude them from matriarchies strictly defined.

In 19th-century Western scholarship, the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early, mainly prehistoric, stage of human development gained popularity. Possibilities of so-called primitive societies were cited and the hypothesis survived into the 20th century, including in the context of [[second-wave feminism]]. This hypothesis was criticized by some authors such as Cynthia Eller in ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and remains as a largely unsolved question to this day. Some older myths describe matriarchies.

Several modern feminists have advocated for matriarchy now or in the future and it has appeared in [[List of feminist literature|feminist literature]]. In several theologies, matriarchy has been portrayed as negative.

== Definitions, connotations, and etymology ==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), matriarchy is a "form of social organization in which the mother or oldest female is the head of the family, and descent and relationship are reckoned through the female line; government or rule by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry ''matriarchy'', as accessed November 3, 2013{{Subscription or libraries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular definition, according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey, is "female dominance".&lt;ref name="HumanityIntroCulturAnthro-9ed-p259col1"&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic discipline of [[cultural anthropology]], according to the ''OED'', matriarchy is a "culture or community in which such a system prevails"&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; or a "family, society, organization, etc., dominated by a woman or women."&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; In general anthropology, according to William A. Haviland, matriarchy is "rule by women".&lt;ref name="Anthro-Haviland-8ed-p579col1"&gt;Haviland, William A., ''Anthropology'' (Ft. Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 8th ed. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-15-503578-9}})), p.&amp;nbsp;579.&lt;/ref&gt; A matriarchy is a [[society]] in which females, especially mothers, have the central roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], and control of property, but does not include a society that occasionally is led by a female for nonmatriarchal reasons or an occupation in which females generally predominate without reference to matriarchy, such as [[prostitution]] or [[auxiliary (fraternal orders)|women's auxiliaries]] of organizations run by men.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to Lawrence A. Kuzner in 1997, [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] argued in 1924 that the definitions of matriarchy and patriarchy had "logical and empirical failings&amp;nbsp;.... [and] were too vague to be scientifically useful".&lt;ref&gt;Kuznar, Lawrence A., ''Reclaiming a Scientific Anthropology'' (Walnut Creek, Calif.: AltaMira Press (div. of Sage Publications), pbk. 1997 ({{ISBN|0-7619-9114-X}})).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academics exclude egalitarian nonpatriarchal systems from matriarchies more strictly defined. According to [[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], a reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a specific culturally biased notion of how to define matriarchy: because in a [[patriarchy]] men rule over women, a matriarchy has frequently been conceptualized as women ruling over men,&lt;ref name="MatriarchalSocDefTheory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Göttner-Abendroth | first = Heide | author-link = Heide Göttner-Abendroth | title = Matriarchal Society: Definition and Theory | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055107/http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html | archive-date = 19 April 2013 | url = http://www.gift-economy.com/athanor/athanor_005.html }}&lt;br /&gt;

The word matriarchy, for a society politically led by females, especially mothers, who also control property, is often interpreted to mean the genderal opposite of patriarchy, but it is not an opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Compare, in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (online), entry patriarchy to entry ''matriarchy'', both as accessed November 3, 2013.{{Subscription or libraries|sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1995|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;161–162 &amp; 184 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;84}} (p.&amp;nbsp;184 n.&amp;nbsp;84 probably citing Spretnak, Charlene, ed., ''Politics of Women's Spirituality: Essays on the Rise of Spiritual Power Within the Feminist Movement'' (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1982), p.&amp;nbsp;xiii (Spretnak, Charlene, ''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Goettner-Abendroth|2009a|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peoples and Bailey, the view of anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday is that matriarchies are not a mirror form of patriarchies but rather that a matriarchy "emphasizes maternal meanings where 'maternal symbols are linked to social practices influencing the lives of both sexes and where women play a central role in these practices{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peoples|Bailey|2012|pp=258-259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Margot Adler]] wrote, "literally,&amp;nbsp;... ["''matriarchy''"] means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and power in the hands of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=193}} (italics so in original)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Love]] and Elizabeth Shanklin wrote, "by 'matriarchy,' we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood, and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cynthia Eller]], "'matriarchy' can be thought of&amp;nbsp;... as a shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life events described as 'feminine.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eller wrote that the idea of matriarchy mainly rests on two pillars, romanticism and modern social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2011}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of matriarchy was meant to describe something like a utopia placed in the past in order to legitimate contemporary social criticism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} With respect to a [[#Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages|prehistoric matriarchal Golden Age]], according to Barbara Epstein, "matriarchy&amp;nbsp;... means a social system organized around matriliny and goddess worship in which women have positions of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;173 and see p.&amp;nbsp;172}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adler, in the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to a pre-class society "where women and men share equally in production and power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194"&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Adler, "a number of feminists note that few definitions of the word [matriarchy], despite its literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with such power."&lt;ref name="DrawDnMoon-2006-p194" /&gt;

Matriarchy has often been presented as negative, in contrast to patriarchy as natural and inevitable for society, thus that matriarchy is hopeless. Love and Shanklin wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hear the word "matriarchy", we are conditioned to a number of responses: that matriarchy refers to the past and that matriarchies have never existed; that matriarchy is a hopeless fantasy of female domination, of mothers dominating children, of women being cruel to men. Conditioning us negatively to matriarchy is, of course, in the interests of patriarchs. We are made to feel that patriarchy is natural; we are less likely to question it, and less likely to direct our energies to ending it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Love|Shanklin|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Matriarchal Studies school led by Göttner-Abendroth calls for an even more inclusive redefinition of the term: Göttner-Abendroth defines ''Modern Matriarchal Studies'' as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal societies", effectively defining matriarchy as non-patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.second-congress-matriarchal-studies.com/goettnerabendroth.html ''Introduction'', in ''Second World Congress on Matriarchal Studies''].&lt;/ref&gt; She has also defined matriarchy as characterized by the sharing of power equally between the two genders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://matriarchy.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=83 DeMott, Tom, ''The Investigator'' (review of Bennholdt-Thomsen, Veronika, Cornelia Giebeler, Brigitte Holzer, &amp; Marina Meneses, ''Juchitán, City of Women'' (Mexico: Consejo Editorial, 1994))], as accessed Feb. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diane LeBow, "matriarchal societies are often described as&amp;nbsp;... egalitarian&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|LeBow|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Feminist anthropology]], an approach to anthropology that tries to reduces male bias in the field}}

Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling position in a family.&lt;ref name="OED-matriarchy" /&gt; For this usage, some scholars now prefer the term matrifocal to matriarchal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some, including [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Daniel Moynihan]], claimed that there is a matriarchy among Black families in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/webid-meynihan.htm Office of Policy Planning and Review (Daniel Patrick Moynihan, principal author), ''The Negro Family: The Case For National Action'' (U.S. Department of Labor, 1965)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428151006/http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/webid-meynihan.htm |date=April 28, 2014 }}, esp.

Some question whether a queen ruling without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the amount of participation of other men in most such governments.

=== Intergenerational relationships ===
Some people who sought evidence for the existence of a matriarchy often mixed matriarchy with anthropological terms and concepts describing specific arrangements in the field of family relationships and the organization of family life, such as matrilineality and matrilocality. These terms refer to intergenerational relationships (as matriarchy may), but do not distinguish between males and females insofar as they apply to specific arrangements for sons as well as daughters from the perspective of their relatives on their mother's side. Accordingly, these concepts do not represent matriarchy as 'power of women over men'.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary, Wenda Trevathan, &amp; Janet Levy, ''Anthropology: An Applied Perspective'' (Minneapolis: West Publishing Co., 1992), p.&amp;nbsp;360.{{Verify source|type=title or year|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our society, women are the center of all things. Nature, we believe, has given women the ability to create; therefore it is only natural that women be in positions of power to protect this function....We traced our clans through women; a child born into the world assumed the clan membership of its mother. Our young women were expected to be physically strong....The young women received formal instruction in traditional planting....Since the Iroquois were absolutely dependent upon the crops they grew, whoever controlled this vital activity wielded great power within our communities. It was our belief that since women were the givers of life they naturally regulated the feeding of our people....In all countries, real wealth stems from the control of land and its resources. Our Iroquois philosophers knew this as well as we knew natural law. To us it made sense for women to control the land since they were far more sensitive to the rhythms of the Mother Earth. We did not own the land but were custodians of it. Our women decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used....In our political system, we mandated full equality. Our leaders were selected by a caucus of women before the appointments were subject to popular review....Our traditional governments are composed of an equal number of men and women. The men are chiefs and the women clan-mothers....As leaders, the women closely monitor the actions of the men and retain the right to veto any law they deem inappropriate....Our women not only hold the reigns of political and economic power, they also have the right to determine all issues involving the taking of human life. Declarations of war had to be approved by the women, while treaties of peace were subject to their deliberations.&lt;ref name="IroquoisCultureCommentary-p53-p55" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== By chronology ===

==== Earliest prehistory and undated ====
The controversy surrounding prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Bachofen, ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'', in 1861. Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Wesel, Uwe, ''Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. Über Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in frühen Gesellschaften'' (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980).{{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ancient-society.zip Morgan, L., ''Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization''].&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a "woman-centered" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right'' (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, [[Arthur Evans]], [[Walter Burkert]], and [[James Mellaart]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=reU63yfgrWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Ruether, Rosemary Radford, ''Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History''], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the evidence of [[matriarchal religion]] in pre-Hellenic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3qhQuWPNUckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bachofen&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=NEFQTMugHsT68AbzvImIAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Myth, Religion, and Mother Right''].{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Susan Mann]], as of 2000, "few scholars these days find&amp;nbsp;...

The following excerpts from Lewis Morgan's ''Ancient Society'' will explain the use of the terms: "In a work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}} "Common lands and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line. Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition."{{Page needed|date=November 2013}}

==== Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages ====
[[Friedrich Engels]], in 1884, claimed that, in the earliest stages of human social development, there was group marriage and that therefore paternity was disputable, whereas maternity was not, so that a family could be traced only through the female line, and claimed that this was connected with the dominance of women over men or a ''Mutterrecht'', which notion Engels took from Bachofen, who claimed, based on his interpretations of myths, that myths reflected a memory of a time when women dominated over men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Engels|1984}} {{Page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachofen, Johann Jakob, ''Das Mutterrecht.

Als Beitrag zur Emanzipation unserer Gesellschaft, bearbeitet und kommentiert von Monika Seifert'' (Stuttgart: Dietz, 1974 (1st published 1879)), p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history. Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/helen_diner.php ''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Helen Diner'' (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Brooklyn Museum, last updated March 27, 2007)], as accessed March, 2008, &amp; November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is that in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further by the publication of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' by Robert Graves (1948) and his later analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the 1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an ''[[Old European culture]]'' in Neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal system of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] with the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. According to Epstein, anthropologists in the 20th century said that "the goddess worship or matrilocality that evidently existed in many paleolithic societies was not necessarily associated with matriarchy in the sense of women's power over men. Many societies can be found that exhibit those qualities along with female subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of [[Margaret Murray]] on [[witchcraft]], by the [[Goddess movement]], and in [[feminist Wicca]], as well as in works by Eisler, [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]], and [[Merlin Stone]].

"A Golden Age of matriarchy" was, according to Epstein, prominently presented by [[Charlene Spretnak]] and "encouraged" by Stone and Eisler,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Epstein|1991|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, at least for the [[Neolithic]] Age, has been denounced as feminist wishful thinking in ''[[The Inevitability of Patriarchy]]'', ''[[Why Men Rule]]'', ''Goddess Unmasked'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Philip G., ''Goddess Unmasked'' (N.Y.: Spence Publishing, 1998 ({{ISBN|0-9653208-9-8}})); [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54600098.html Sheaffer, R., ''Skeptical Inquirer'' (1999) (review)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' and is not emphasized in [[third-wave feminism]]. According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining [[Eastern Europe]]an cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves. She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent (historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of [[antifeminism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

According to Rohrlich, "many scholars are convinced that Crete was a matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=36}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;37 ("Minoan matriarchate" (subquoting, at p.&amp;nbsp;37 n.&amp;nbsp;7, Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;450)), Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, ''Introduction'', in Pt. Four (''Visions of Utopia''), in {{harvp|Rohrlich|Baruch|1984|p=207}} ("matriarchal societies, particularly Minoan Crete"), and {{harvp|Rohrlich|1984|p=6}} ("the Minoan matriarchy" &amp; "Minoan Crete").&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cretan civilization" was "matriarchal" before "1500 B.C.," when it was overrun and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Three quotations: {{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Rohrlich, "in the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to have left something more than a trace.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rohrlich|1977|p=39}}, quoting Thomson, George, ''The Prehistoric Aegean'' (N.Y.: Citadel Press, 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

One common misconception among historians of the Bronze Age such as Stone and Eisler is the notion that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] were matriarchal while the Indo-Europeans practiced a patriarchal system. An example of this view is found in Stone's ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'',{{Page needed|date=July 2013}} wherein she makes the case that the worship of [[Yahweh]] was an Indo-European invention superimposed on an ancient matriarchal Semitic nation. Evidence from the [[Amorites]] and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]], however, indicates that the primitive Semitic family was in fact patriarchal and patrilineal.

However, not all scholars agree. Anthropologist and Biblical scholar Raphael Patai writes in  The Hebrew Goddess that the Jewish religion, far from being pure monotheism, contained from earliest times strong polytheistic elements, chief of which was the cult of Asherah, the mother goddess. A story in the Biblical Book of Judges places the worship of Asherah in the 12th century B.C.E.  Originally a Canaanite goddess, her worship was adopted by Hebrews who intermarried with Canaanites. She was worshipped in public and was represented by carved wooden poles. Numerous small nude female figurines of clay were found all over ancient Palestine and a 7th C. Hebrew text invokes her aid for a woman giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shekinah is the name of the feminine holy spirit who embodies both divine radiance and compassion. She comforts the sick and dejected, accompanies the Jews whenever they are exiled, and intercedes with God to exercise mercy rather than to inflict retribution on sinners. While not a creation of the Hebrew Bible, Shekinah appears in a slightly later Aramaic translation of the Bible in the first or second century C.E., according to Patai. Initially portrayed as the presence of God, she later becomes distinct from God, taking on more physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Patai|1990|pp=96–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Indo-Europeans were known to have practiced multiple succession systems, and there is much better evidence of matrilineal customs among the Indo-European [[Celts]] and [[Germans]] than among any ancient Semitic peoples.

Women were running [[Sparta]] while the men were often away fighting. [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta]], was asked by a woman in [[Attica]] something along the lines of, "why are Spartan women the only women in the world who could rule men?" Gorgo replied, "Because we are the only women who are mothers of men."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==== Iron Age to Middle Ages ====
Arising in the period ranging from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]], several early [[northwestern Europe]]an mythologies from the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] (''e.g.'', [[Macha]] and [[Scáthach]]), the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] (''e.g.'', [[Rhiannon]]), and the Germanic (''e.g.'', [[Grendel's mother]] and [[Nerthus]]) contain ambiguous episodes of primal female power which have been interpreted as folk evidence of a real potential for matriarchal attitudes in [[Iron Age|pre-Christian]] European Iron Age societies. Often transcribed from a retrospective, patriarchal, Romanised, and [[Catholic]] perspective, they hint at an earlier, culturally disturbing, era when female power could have predominated. The first-century–attested historic British figure of [[Boudicca]] indicates that Brittonnic society permitted explicit female autocracy or a form of gender equality in a form which contrasted strongly with the patriarchal structure of Mediterranean civilisation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A legendary matriarchy related by several writers was [[Amazons|Amazon]] society. According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], "in Amazon societies, women were&amp;nbsp;... mothers and their society's only political and religious leaders",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}} (italics omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only warriors and hunters;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|pp=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; "queens were elected"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently "any woman could aspire to and achieve full human expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chesler|2005|p=336}} (italics omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Moreover, said Herodotus, "no girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. [[Julius Caesar]] spoke of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although Strabo was sceptical about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout [[late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], 5.504.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Church Fathers]] spoke of the Amazons as a real people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert|Ukert, F. A.]], ''Die Amazonen'' (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1849), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
[[Robert Graves]] suggested that a myth displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought patriarchy to replace a matriarchy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} According to this myth, in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] is said to have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who was carrying their daughter, [[Athena]]. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either [[Hermes]] or [[Hephaestus]] split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor, to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born" from Zeus. The outcome pleased Zeus as it didn't fulfill the prophecy of Themis which (according to Aeschylus) predicted that Zeus will one day bear a son that would overthrow him. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Celtic myth and society ===
{{main|Ancient Celtic women#Matriarchy}}

According to Adler, "there ''is'' plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power than in many societies today. For example, [[Jean Markale]]'s studies of Celtic societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership, and the right to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=196}} (italics so in original; p.&amp;nbsp;196 n.&amp;nbsp;20 citing Markale, Jean, ''Women of the Celts'' (London: Gordon Cremonesi, 1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===
Bamberger (1974) examines several matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying the women from this matriarchal period as immoral often serves to restrain contemporary women in these societies.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;ref&gt;Bamberger, Joan, The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society, in M. Rosaldo &amp; L. Lamphere, Women, Culture, and Society (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1974), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar|theory}}
{{For|groups and communities without men|separatist feminism}}
While ''matriarchy'' has mostly fallen out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it remains current as a concept in [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9"&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly, ed., ''Applications of Feminist Legal Theory to Women's Lives: Sex, Violence, Work, and Reproduction'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996 ({{ISBN|1-56639-423-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;9 ("women must organize against patriarchy as a class") but see p.&amp;nbsp;11 ("some radical feminists&amp;nbsp;... opt&amp;nbsp;... for anarchistic, violent methods").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52"&gt;Dale, Jennifer, &amp; Peggy Foster, ''Feminists and State Welfare'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986 ({{ISBN|0-7102-0278-4}})), p.&amp;nbsp;52 ("radical feminist theory&amp;nbsp;.... could, indeed, be said to point in the direction of 'matriarchy{{'"}}) and see pp.&amp;nbsp;52–53 (political separatism).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Stanton]]
In [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] discourse, either [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] or [[Margaret Fuller]] (it is unclear who was first) introduced the concept of matriarchy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;55 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;15}}, citing Stanton, Elizabeth Cady, ''Address'' (Washington Woman's Rights Convention, 1869), in ''History of Woman Suffrage'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;351–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and the discourse was joined in by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=57}}, citing Gage, Matilda Joslyn, ''Woman, Church and State: A Historical Account of the Status of Women through the Christian Ages; with Reminiscences of the Matriarchate'' (Watertown, Mass.: Persephone Press, 1980 (1893)), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria Woodhull]], in 1871, called for men to open the U.S. government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a year;&lt;ref&gt;''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in {{harvp|Gabriel|1998|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gabriel|1998|loc=''passim'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Lois Beachy, ''The Woman Who Ran for President: The Many Lives of Victoria Woodhull'' (Bridgehampton, N.Y.: Bridge Works, 1st ed. 1995 ({{ISBN|1-882593-10-3}}), ''passim'', esp. ch.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], in 1911 and 1914,&lt;ref&gt;The dates are those of two original editions of the same work, both cited herein.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for "a woman-centered, or better mother-centered, world"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=61}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described {{"'}}government by women{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=62}}, citing {{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=177}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; both genders being "useful&amp;nbsp;... and should in our governments be alike used",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; because men and women have different qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gilman|2001|pp=153, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural feminism]] includes "matriarchal worship", according to Prof. James Penner.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, James, ''Pinks, Pansies, and Punks: The Rhetoric of Masculinity in American Literary Culture'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-253-22251-0}})), p.&amp;nbsp;235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[list of feminist literature|feminist literature]], matriarchy and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''matriarchy'' sometimes means "the political rule of women",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that meaning is often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=12}} (quoting also Mary Daly ("matriarchy 'was not patriarchy spelled with an "m.{{"'"}}, probably – per {{harvp|Eller|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;12 n.&amp;nbsp;3}} – in Daly, Mary, ''Beyond God the Father'', p.&amp;nbsp;94)).&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be about power from within,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt; [[Starhawk]] having written on that distinction&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p287" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk, ''[[Dreaming the Dark: Magic, Sex, and Politics]]'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 15th Anniversary ed. 1997 (original 1982) ({{ISBN|0-8070-1037-5}})), ch.&amp;nbsp;1 (original 1982 ed. cited in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not controlling, but is harmonious with nature.{{efn|Adler wrote a matriarchy is "a realm where female things are valued and where power is exerted in non-possessive, non-controlling, and organic ways that are harmonious with nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|1979|p=187}}, as quoted in {{harvp|Eller|1991|p=287}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For radical feminists, the importance of matriarchy is that "veneration for the female principle&amp;nbsp;... somewhat lightens an oppressive system."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Castro|1990|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist utopia]]s are a form of advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, "a feminist utopia would&amp;nbsp;... be the description of a place where at least women would like to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willemsen continues, among "type[s] of feminist utopias[,]&amp;nbsp;... [one] stem[s] from feminists who emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles the Greek myth of the Amazons.... [V]ery few modern utopias have been developed in which women are absolute autocrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Willemsen|1997|p=6}}. See also {{harvp|Poldervaart|1997|p=182}} ("Tineke Willemsen distinghuishes {{Sic}} in her article three large classes of utopias:&amp;nbsp;... 2) feminists who emphasize the difference [between "women and men&amp;nbsp;... in rights and possibilities"]; in these utopias women have a better position than men or feminine qualities are more valued than masculine ones").&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of feminists, generally [[radical feminism|radical]],&lt;ref name="AppsFLegalTheoryWLSVWR-p9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FStateWelfare-p52" /&gt; have argued that women should govern societies of women and men. In all of these advocacies, the governing women are not limited to mothers:
* In her book ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women’s Liberation'', [[Andrea Dworkin]] stated that she wanted women to have their own country, "Womenland,"&lt;ref name="Guardian-TakeNoPrisoners"&gt;Quotation: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/13/politics1 ''Take No Prisoners'', in ''The Guardian'', May 13, 2000], as accessed Sep. 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which, comparable to Israel, would serve as a "place of potential refuge".&lt;ref name="Guardian-TakeNoPrisoners" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other than quotation: Dworkin, Andrea, ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel, and Women's Liberation'' (N.Y.: Free Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-684-83612-2}})), p.&amp;nbsp;246 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;248 &amp; 336.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Palestine Solidarity Review'', Veronica A. Ouma reviewed the book and argued her view that while Dworkin "pays lip service to the egalitarian nature of&amp;nbsp;... [stateless] societies [without hierarchies], she envisions a state whereby women either impose gender equality or a state where females rule supreme above males."&lt;ref&gt;[http://psreview.org/content/view/38/99/ Ouma, Veronica A., ''Dworkin's Scapegoating'', in ''Palestine Solidarity Review'' (''PSR''), Fall 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208074544/http://psreview.org/content/view/38/99/ |date=December 8, 2010 }}, as accessed Oct. 21, 2010 (''PSR'' was challenged on its reliability, in [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=145131 Frantzman, Seth J., ''Do Arabs and Jews Realize How Much They Look Alike?'', in ''The Jerusalem Post'', Jun. 10, 2009, 11:43 p.m. (op-ed opinion)], as accessed May 15, 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[was "in early second-wave feminism"] the lost object of women's freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zerilli|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Cynthia Eller found widespread acceptance of matriarchal myth during [[second-wave feminism|feminism's second wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kathryn Rountree, the belief in a prepatriarchal "Golden Age" of matriarchy may have been more specifically about a matrifocal society,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rountree|2001|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was believed more in the 1970s than in the 1990s–2000s and was criticized within feminism and within archaeology, anthropology, and theological study as lacking a scholarly basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rountree|2001|pp=5–9 &amp; ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prof. [[Harvey Mansfield|Harvey C.

* Adler reported, "if feminists have diverse views on the matriarchies of the past, they also are of several minds on the goals for the future. A woman in the coven of Ursa Maior told me, 'right now I am pushing for women's power in any way I can, but I don't know whether my ultimate aim is a society where all human beings are equal, regardless of the bodies they were born into, or whether I would rather see a society where women had institutional authority.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Adler|2006|p=198}} ("Maior" so in original)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fiction caricatured the current gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for it. According to Karin Schönpflug, "Gerd Brantenberg's ''Egalia's Daughters'' is a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed, with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=108}}, citing [[Gerd Brantenberg]], ''Egalia's Daughters'' (Norwegian original published in 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; "gender inequality is expressed through power inversion"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "all gender roles are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men".&lt;ref name="Karin-p20"&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Egalia'' is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; ''Egalia'' is more a caricature of male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a 'better world.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Karin-p20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Egalia's Daughters'' as fiction: [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_bks&amp;q=Egalia%27s+Daughters&amp;fq=dt%3Abks ''WorldCat'' entry], as accessed August 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism by Mansfield of choosing who governs according to gender or sex is that the best qualified people should be chosen, regardless of gender or sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|pp=241–242}}, citing Plato, ''Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mansfield considered merit insufficient for office, because a legal right granted by a sovereign (''e.g.'', a king), was more important than merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174 &amp; nn.&amp;nbsp;14, 16–17, &amp; 19}}, citing Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', ch.&amp;nbsp;10, 14–15, &amp; 21, [[Tuck, Richard]], ''Natural Rights Theories'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), ch.&amp;nbsp;6, &amp; Tarcov, Nathan, ''Locke's Education for Liberty'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984), p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity within a proposed community can, according to Becki L. Ross, make it especially challenging to complete forming the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ross|1995|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some advocacy includes diversity, in the views of Dworkin&lt;ref name="Guardian-TakeNoPrisoners"/&gt; and Farley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Farley|1984|p=238}} (respecting Wittig, Monique, ''Les Guérillères'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate with men. "Women must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a struggle for the world's fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or daring sisters, is not an option.... [T]he well-being and liberty of women cannot be separated from democracy's survival."&lt;ref&gt;Stansell, Christine, ''The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present'' (N.Y.: Modern Library (Random House), 1st ed. 2010 ({{ISBN|978-0-679-64314-2}})), p.&amp;nbsp;394.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Herland (novel)|''Herland'']] was feminist utopian fiction by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1911, featuring a community entirely of women except for three men who seek it out,&lt;ref&gt;Bartkowski, Frances, ''Feminist Utopias'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989 ({{ISBN|0-8032-1205-4}})), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; strong women in a matriarchal utopia&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Donovan|2000|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; expected to last for generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schönpflug|2008|p=21}} and see p.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; although Charlotte Perkins Gilman was herself a feminist advocate of society being gender-integrated and of women's freedom.)&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Charlotte Perkins, ''What is "Feminism"?'', in ''The Sunday Herald'', vol.

Other criticisms of superiority are that it is reverse sexism or discriminatory against men, it is opposed by most people including most feminists, women do not want such a position,{{efn|"Women do not run for office as readily as men do, nor do most women, it seems, call on them to run.

* In [[Judaism]], among [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] leaders, a position, beginning before [[Israel]] became a modern state, has been that for women to hold public office in Israel would threaten the state's existence, according to educator [[Tova Hartman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hartman|2007|p=105}}, attributing the argument to [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rav Kook]], or Rabbi Abraham Isaac Hacohen Kook; "a significant spiritual leader of the ["early twentieth century"]", {{harvp|Hartman|2007|p=101}}, citing, at {{harvp|Hartman|2007|pp=101–102}}, Kook, Rav, ''Open Letter to the Honorable Committee of the "Mizrahi" Association'' (1919) ("In the Torah, in the Prophets and in the Writings, in the Halacha and in the Aggadah, we hear&amp;nbsp;... that the duty of fixed public service falls upon men.").&lt;/ref&gt; who reports the view has "wide consensus".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hartman|2007|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Israel ratified the international women's equality agreement known as [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], according to Marsha Freeman, it reserved nonenforcement for any religious communities that forbid women from sitting on religious courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freeman|2003|pp=59 &amp; 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freeman, "the tribunals that adjudicate marital issues are by religious law and by custom entirely male."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freeman|2003|p=65}} (the tribunals are discussed in the context of "the marital law regime in each religion", including Judaism)&lt;/ref&gt; {{"'}}Men's superiority' is a fundamental tenet in Judaism", according to Irit Umanit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Umanit|2003|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freeman, [[Likud|Likud party]]-led "governments have been less than hospitable to women's high-level participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freeman|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Knox statue, Haddington.jpg|thumb|John Knox]]
* In [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]], considered only historically, in 1558, [[John Knox]] ([[Maria Stuart]]'s subject) wrote ''[[The first blast of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of women|The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scalingi, the work is "perhaps the best known analysis of gynecocracy"&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; and Knox was "the most notorious"&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; writer on the subject.&lt;ref name="ScepterDistaff-Historian-p60" /&gt; According to an 1878 edition, Knox's objection to any women reigning and having "empire"{{efn|"I am assured that God hath reueled to some in this our age, that it is more then a monstre in nature, that a woman shall reigne and haue empire aboue man."&lt;ref name="1stBlast-Gutenberg-ebk"&gt;{{harvp|Knox|1878}} (italicization and boldface, if any, removed).&lt;/ref&gt;}} over men was theological&lt;ref name="Knox_1878"&gt;{{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was against nature for women to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or empire above any realm, nation, or city.{{efn|"To promote a woman to beare rule, superioritie, dominion or empire aboue any realme, nation, or citie, is repugnant to nature, contumelie to God, a thing most contrarious to his reueled will and approued ordinance, and finallie it is the subuersion of good order, of all equitie and iustice[.]"&lt;ref name="Knox_1878"/&gt;}} Susan M.

[Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, David, ''Preface'' (from extract), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in agreement with Knox was [[Christopher Goodman]], who, according to Lee, "considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used&amp;nbsp;... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred&amp;nbsp;... from any political power",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee|1990|pp=250, 249}}, citing Goodman, Christopher, ''How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyd'' (N.Y.: reprint, 1931, originally 1558) (chap. on gynecocracy).&lt;/ref&gt; even if, according to Richards, the woman was "virtuous".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some views included conditionality; while [[John Calvin]] said, according to Healey, "that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Original sin]], in Christianity, a state of sin, or violation of God's will, due to Adam's rebellion in the Garden of Eden}} nonetheless Calvin would not always question a woman's right to inherit rule of a realm or principality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Bullinger]], according to Healey, "held that rule by a woman was contrary to God's law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Healey|1994|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Richards|1997|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"There were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shone forth in them made it evident that they were raised up by Divine authority". Calvin, letter to William Cecil (on or after January 29, 1559 (probably 1560)), in {{harvp|Knox|1878}} (citing, at ''Preface'', n.&amp;nbsp;1, for letter, ''Zurich Letters'' (2d ser.), p.&amp;nbsp;35) (Calvin reviser, ''Commentaries on Isaiah'' (sometime in 1551–1559) (approximate title)).&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view was much debated in Europe at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|pp=168, 170–171}}, ''e.g.'', citing Aylmer (AElmer&lt;!-- "A" &amp; "E" separate letters --&gt;), John, ''An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiects agaynst the late blowne Blast, concerninge the Gouernment of Wemen wherin be confuted all such reasons as a straunger of late made in that behalfe, with a briefe exhortation to obedience'' (1559).&lt;/ref&gt; the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance&lt;ref name="PromoteWBeareRule-16CJ-p116-n45n46" /&gt; and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Abreu|2003|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity.

{{Main|thealogy|Goddess movement}}
Feminist [[thealogy]], according to Eller, conceptualized humanity as beginning with "female-ruled or equalitarian societies",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;281 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;282 &amp; 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; until displaced by patriarchies,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281"&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the millennial future {{"'}}gynocentric,' life-loving values"&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; will return to prominence.&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p281" /&gt; This, according to Eller, produces "a virtually infinite number of years of female equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eller|1991|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, according to Eller, as a reflection of spirituality, is conceived as ahistorical,&lt;ref name="RelativizingPatriarchy-p291n27"/&gt; and thus may be unrealistic, unreachable, or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists.

=== Ancient theatre ===
* Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years ago, in 390 BC, [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[Assemblywomen|Ecclesiazusae]]'', about women gaining legislative power and governing [[Athens]], Greece, on a limited principle of equality. In the play, according to Mansfield, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n"&gt;{{harvp|Mansfield|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74 &amp; n.&amp;nbsp;37}}, citing Strauss, Leo, ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' (N.Y.: Basic Books, 1966), ch.&amp;nbsp;9, and Saxonhouse, Arlene W., ''Fear of Diversity'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), ch.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; The play, Mansfield wrote, also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; In the play, as Mansfield described it, written when Athens was a male-only democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern.&lt;ref name="Manliness-p73-74-n" /&gt; The play, according to Sarah Ruden, was a fable on the theme that women should stay home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ruden|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
* [[Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett]]'s ''[[New Amazonia|New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future]]'' is an early feminist utopian novel (published 1889), which is matriarchal in that all political leadership roles in New Amazonia are required to be held by women, according to Duangrudi Suksang.&lt;ref&gt;Suksang, Duangrudi, ''Overtaking Patriarchy: Corbett's and Dixie's Visions of Women'', in ''Utopian Studies'', vol. 4, no. 2 (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;74–93 (available via ''JStor'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Women gain all kind of control, primarily political, and consecutively build two types of matriarchy. At first, they establish a [[segregationist]] [[heterophobic]] society. By the end of the novel, heterosexual women conduct a revolution and establish a more balanced but still highly matriarchal society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43608">The '''model of hierarchical complexity''' is a framework for scoring how complex a [[behavior]] is, such as [[verbal reasoning]] or other [[cognitive]] tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robinson2013|Robinson, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of [[hierarchical]] complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized, in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"&gt;[[#Reference-Commons2007|Commons, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been developed by [[Michael Commons]] and others since the 1980s.

==Overview==
The model of hierarchical complexity (MHC) is a [[Formal system|formal theory]] and a [[mathematical psychology]] framework for scoring how complex a behavior is.&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsPekker2008|Commons &amp; Pekker, 2008]]; [[#Reference-Commonsetal2014|Commons et al., 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]] and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"&gt;[[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al., 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; it quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coombsetal1970|Coombs, Dawes, &amp; Tversky, 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984a|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984a]], [[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984b|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984b]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-LindsayNorman1977|Lindsay &amp; Norman, 1977]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1990|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1990]], [[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1993|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its forerunner was the general stage model.&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"/&gt;

Behaviors that may be scored include those of individual humans or their social groupings (e.g., organizations, governments, societies), animals, or machines. It enables scoring the hierarchical complexity of task accomplishment in any domain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-GiriCommonsHarrigan2014|Giri, Commons, &amp; Harrigan, 2014]]; but for a different view see: [[#Reference-Mascolo2008|Mascolo, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the very simple notions that higher order task actions:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
#are defined in terms of the next lower ones (creating hierarchy);
#organize the next lower actions;
#organize lower actions in a non-arbitrary way (differentiating them from simple chains of behavior).

It is [[cross-cultural]]ly and cross-species valid. The reason it applies cross-culturally is that the scoring is based on the mathematical complexity of the hierarchical organization of information. Scoring does not depend upon the content of the information (e.g., what is done, said, written, or analyzed) but upon how the information is organized.

The MHC is a non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] model of [[developmental stage theories|developmental stages]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; It specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding [[developmental stage theories|stages]]. It is different from previous proposals about developmental stage applied to humans;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[#Reference-InhelderPiaget1958|Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1958]]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of attributing behavioral changes across a person's age to the development of mental structures or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], this model posits that task sequences of task behaviors form hierarchies that become increasingly complex. Because less complex tasks must be completed and practiced before more complex tasks can be acquired, this accounts for the developmental changes seen, for example, in individual persons' performance of complex tasks. (For example, a person cannot perform [[arithmetic]] until the numeral representations of numbers are learned. A person cannot operationally multiply the sums of numbers until addition is learned).

The creators of the MHC claim that previous theories of stage have confounded the stimulus and response in assessing stage by simply scoring responses and ignoring the task or stimulus.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; The MHC separates the task or stimulus from the performance. The participant's performance on a task of a given complexity represents the stage of developmental complexity.

==Vertical complexity of tasks performed==
One major basis for this developmental theory is [[task analysis]]. The study of ideal tasks, including their instantiation in the real world, has been the basis of the branch of stimulus control called [[psychophysics]]. Tasks are defined as sequences of contingencies, each presenting stimuli and each requiring a behavior or a sequence of behaviors that must occur in some non-arbitrary fashion. The complexity of behaviors necessary to complete a task can be specified using the horizontal complexity and vertical complexity definitions described below. Behavior is examined with respect to the analytically-known complexity of the task.

Tasks are [[wikt:quantal|quantal]] in nature. They are either completed correctly or not completed at all. There is no intermediate state (''[[tertium non datur]]''). For this reason, the model characterizes all stages as [[P-hard]] and functionally distinct. The orders of hierarchical complexity are [[quantum|quantized]] like the [[electron]] [[atomic orbitals]] around the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]: each task difficulty has an order of hierarchical complexity required to complete it correctly, analogous to the atomic [[Slater determinant]]. Since tasks of a given quantified order of hierarchical complexity require actions of a given order of hierarchical complexity to perform them, the stage of the participant's task performance is equivalent to the order of complexity of the successfully completed task. The quantal feature of tasks is thus particularly instrumental in stage assessment because the scores obtained for stages are likewise discrete.

Every task contains a multitude of subtasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Overton1990|Overton, 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt; When the subtasks are carried out by the participant in a required order, the task in question is successfully completed. Therefore, the model asserts that all tasks fit in some configured sequence of tasks, making it possible to precisely determine the hierarchical order of task complexity. Tasks vary in complexity in two ways: either as ''horizontal'' (involving classical information); or as ''vertical'' (involving hierarchical information).&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

===Horizontal complexity===
Classical information describes the number of "yes–no" questions it takes to do a task. For example, if one asked a person across the room whether a penny came up heads when they flipped it, their saying "heads" would transmit 1 bit of "horizontal" information. If there were 2 pennies, one would have to ask at least two questions, one about each penny. Hence, each additional 1-bit question would add another bit. Let us say they had a four-faced top with the faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Instead of spinning it, they tossed it against a backboard as one does with dice in a game of [[craps]]. Again, there would be 2 bits. One could ask them whether the face had an even number. If it did, one would then ask if it were a 2. Horizontal complexity, then, is the sum of bits required by just such tasks as these.

===Vertical complexity===
Hierarchical complexity refers to the number of [[recursion]]s that the coordinating actions must perform on a set of primary elements. Actions at a higher order of hierarchical complexity: (a) are defined in terms of actions at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity; (b) organize and transform the lower-order actions (see Figure 2); (c) produce organizations of lower-order actions that are qualitatively new and not arbitrary, and cannot be accomplished by those lower-order actions alone. Once these conditions have been met, we say the higher-order action coordinates the actions of the next lower order.

To illustrate how lower actions get organized into more hierarchically complex actions, let us turn to a simple example. Completing the entire operation 3 × (4 + 1) constitutes a task requiring the [[distributive property|distributive]] act. That act non-[[arbitrarily]] orders adding and multiplying to coordinate them. The distributive act is therefore one order more hierarchically complex than the acts of adding and multiplying alone; it indicates the singular proper sequence of the simpler actions. Although simply adding results in the same answer, people who can do both display a greater freedom of mental functioning. Additional layers of abstraction can be applied. Thus, the order of complexity of the task is determined through analyzing the demands of each task by breaking it down into its constituent parts.

The hierarchical complexity of a task refers to the number of [[Abstract algebra|concatenation]] operations it contains, that is, the number of recursions that the coordinating actions must perform. An order-three task has three concatenation operations. A task of order three operates on one or more tasks of vertical order two and a task of order two operates on one or more tasks of vertical order one (the simplest tasks).

==Stages of development==
[[Stage theory|Stage theories]] describe [[Human evolution|human]] [[organism]]ic and/or [[Technological evolution|technological]] [[Evolution (term)|evolution]] as systems that move through a pattern of distinct stages over time. Here development is described formally in terms of the model of hierarchical complexity (MHC).

===Formal definition of stage===
Since actions are defined inductively, so is the function ''h'', known as the order of the hierarchical complexity. To each action ''A'', we wish to associate a notion of that action's hierarchical complexity, ''h(A)''. Given a collection of actions '''A''' and a participant ''S'' performing '''A''', the ''stage of performance'' of ''S'' on '''A''' is the highest order of the actions in '''A''' completed successfully at least once, i.e., it is: stage (''S'', '''A''') = max{''h(A)'' | ''A'' ∈ '''A''' and ''A'' completed successfully by ''S''}. Thus, the notion of stage is [[Classification of discontinuities|discontinuous]], having the same transitional gaps as the orders of hierarchical complexity. This is in accordance with previous definitions.&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsMiller2001|Commons &amp; Miller, 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"/&gt;

Because MHC stages are conceptualized in terms of the hierarchical complexity of tasks rather than in terms of mental representations (as in Piaget's stages), the highest stage represents successful performances on the most hierarchically complex tasks rather than intellectual maturity.

===Stages of hierarchical complexity===
The following table gives descriptions of each stage in the MHC.

==Relationship with Piaget's theory==
There are some commonalities between the [[Theory of cognitive development|Piagetian]] and Commons' notions of stage and many more things that are different. In both, one finds:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher-order actions defined in terms of lower-order actions. This forces the hierarchical nature of the relations and makes the higher-order tasks include the lower ones and requires that lower-order actions are hierarchically contained within the relative definitions of the higher-order tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher-order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions. This makes them more powerful. Lower-order actions are organized by the actions with a higher order of complexity, i.e., the more complex tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

What [[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al. (1998)]] have added includes:
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions in a non-arbitrary way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

This makes it possible for the model's application to meet real world requirements, including the empirical and analytic. Arbitrary organization of lower order of complexity actions, possible in the Piagetian theory, despite the hierarchical definition structure, leaves the functional correlates of the interrelationships of tasks of differential complexity formulations ill-defined.

Moreover, the model is consistent with the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. According to these theories, progression to higher stages or levels of cognitive development is caused by increases in processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. That is, higher-order stages place increasingly higher demands on these functions of information processing, so that their order of appearance reflects the information processing possibilities at successive ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Demetriou1998|Demetriou, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following dimensions are inherent in the application:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
# Task and performance are separated.
# All tasks have an order of hierarchical complexity.
# There is only one sequence of orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Hence, there is structure of the whole for [[ideal tasks]] and actions.
# There are transitional gaps between the orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Stage is defined as the most hierarchically complex task solved.
# There are discrete gaps in [[Rasch model|Rasch scaled]] stage of performance.
# Performance stage is different task area to task area.
# There is no structure of the whole—[[Horizontal and vertical décalage|horizontal décalage]]—for performance. It is not inconsistency in thinking within a developmental stage. Décalage is the normal modal state of affairs.

==Orders and corresponding stages==
The MHC specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding stages, positing that each of Piaget's substages, in fact, are robustly hard stages.&lt;ref name="CommonsCroneToddChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsCroneToddChen2014|Commons, Crone-Todd, &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; The MHC adds five postformal stages to Piaget's developmental trajectory: systematic stage 12, metasystematic stage 13, paradigmatic stage 14, cross-paradigmatic stage 15, and meta-cross-paradigmatic stage 16. It may be the Piaget's ''consolidate'' formal stage is the same as the ''systematic'' stage. The sequence is as follows: (0) calculatory, (1) automatic, (2) sensory &amp; motor, (3) circular sensory-motor, (4) sensory-motor, (5) nominal, (6) sentential, (7) preoperational, (8) primary, (9) concrete, (10) abstract, (11) formal, and the five postformal: (12) systematic, (13) metasystematic, (14) paradigmatic, (15) cross-paradigmatic, and (16) meta-cross-paradigmatic. The first four stages (0–3) correspond to Piaget's sensorimotor stage at which infants and very young children perform. Adolescents and adults can perform at any of the subsequent stages. MHC stages 4 through 5 correspond to Piaget's pre-operational stage; 6 through 8 correspond to his concrete operational stage; and 9 through 11 correspond to his formal operational stage.

More complex behaviors characterize multiple system models.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio1995|Kallio, 1995]]; [[#Reference-KallioHelkama1991|Kallio &amp; Helkama, 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt; The four highest stages in the MHC are not represented in Piaget's model. The higher stages of the MHC have extensively influenced the field of [[positive adult development]]. Some adults are said to develop alternatives to, and perspectives on, formal operations; they use formal operations within a "higher" system of operations. Some theorists call the more complex orders of cognitive tasks "[[postformal thought]]", but other theorists argue that these higher orders cannot exactly be labelled as postformal thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio2011|Kallio, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Reference-Jordan2018|Jordan (2018)]] argued that unidimensional models such as the MHC, which measure level of complexity of some behavior, refer to only one of many aspects of adult development, and that other variables are needed (in addition to unidimensional measures of complexity) for a fuller description of adult development.

==Empirical research using the model==
The MHC has a broad range of applicability.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; Its mathematical foundation permits it to be used by anyone examining task performance that is organized into stages. It is designed to assess development based on the order of complexity which the actor utilizes to organize information. The model thus allows for a standard [[Numerical data|quantitative]] analysis of developmental complexity in any cultural setting. Other advantages of this model include its avoidance of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] explanations, as well as its use of quantitative principles which are universally applicable in any context.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

The following practitioners can use the MHC to quantitatively assess developmental stages:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

Correlations of similar magnitude have been found in a number of the studies. The following are examples of tasks studied using the model of hierarchical complexity or [[Kurt W.

As of 2014, people and institutes from all the major continents of the world, except Africa, have used the model of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsChen2014|Commons &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the model is very simple and is based on analysis of tasks and not just performances, it is dynamic.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"/&gt; With the help of the model, it is possible to quantify the occurrence and progression of transition processes in task performances at any order of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ross2014|Ross, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The descriptions of stages 13–15 have been described as insufficiently precise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Young2011|Young, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rossetal2014|Ross et al., 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Multilingual Education''' typically refers to "first-language-first" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages.  Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed  world.

== Components of Multilingual Education (MLE) ==

* '''"Strong Foundation"''' - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education ([https://archive.is/20040627111339/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/resource/effectiveness/ Thomas and Collier, 1997]).  For more information about the effect of "Language of Instruction", see [[Bilingual education]].
* '''"Strong Bridge"''' - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural "mother tongue education" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue.

Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered "non-standard" and making active use of them in the classroom.  Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.

== Stages of an MLE Program  ==

A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages:

# '''Stage I''' - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language
# '''Stage II''' - building fluency in the mother tongue.  Introduction of oral L2.
# '''Stage III''' - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2.
# '''Stage IV''' - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning.

MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a "two-way" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education.

Based  on the  theories of  Multilingual Education  that are spelled out  here, Andhra Pradesh  and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach  to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has  provided a space to the tribal children of  Orissa  and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual  Education  in this approach  emphasizes  first  language first  in the  child  taking  the  socio- cultural curriculum  in to classroom  culture  and   then  bridge  to  second  language.
In addition to the  basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian  theory on education,  Lev  Vigostky's scaffolding  and Piaget's  theory  of cognition is applied in the  Multilingual Education. The unique  thing in  this  approach is to  involve the community   in creating their  own  curriculum  and  minimise the  theoretical hegemony, thereby  creating  a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating  and  sharing knowledge for the society than to  limit  it to the  theoreticians.
 
===Multilingual Education in Odisha===
  
Odisha  is a multilingual state having  more than  40  ethnic language  among the 62  scheduled tribes, along with the   Modern  Indian  Languages like  Hindi, Bengali and  Telugu. To   address  the  language-  education of  ethnic minorities  children in  schools, Odisha government  started  Multilingual Education programme,ten tribal languages. Led by  Dr MAhendra Kumar Mishra, as the  Director of Multilingual Education  and   guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and  Prof Khageswar  Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual  Experts, the state   government  started  MLE  programme in te tribal languages in 547  schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora,  Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda  and   Ho.  Culturally responsive curriculum  and text books were prepared for class i to   Class  V  to maintain  mother tongue based multilingual education to   educate the  tribal children.  State government appointed  teachers from the same language community in  the schools  to  teach the tribal children.A language policy was also formulated. The programme  was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson  and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie.  The curriculum and text books were prepared by the   tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups.  It was initiated in  2005  and  isnow  running in   2250 schools  with majority tribal children.  This  is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries.About  7  Asian countries have  visited the  MLE schools. 
 Dr Mahendra  Kumar Mishra, started  MLE programme in Chhatishgarh adopting  Durua  language  in  MLE programme.

This was the first of several cases across the [[United States]] that were reported to the police as supposed acts of retaliation for the attacks. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who wore a beard and a [[turban]] in accordance with his [[Sikh]] faith, was mistaken for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] and murdered by 42-year-old [[Frank Silva Roque]], a [[Boeing]] aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility who held a criminal record for an [[robbery|attempted robbery]] in [[California]]. Roque had reportedly told friends that he was "going to go out and shoot some towel-heads" the day of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Valarie|last=Karr|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-23/his-brother-was-murdered-wearing-turban-after-911-last-week-he-spoke-killer|title=His brother was murdered for wearing a turban after 9/11. 15 years later, he spoke to the killer|work=pri.org|date=September 23, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roque was sentenced to death ([[clemency|commuted]] later to [[life imprisonment]]) for [[first degree murder]].

== Background ==
Born in [[Punjab, India]], Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the [[Sikh]] religion. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 and initially resided in [[Los Angeles]], where he worked as a computer engineer and analyst at [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]. He saved enough money to buy a gas station and several affiliated franchises in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and moved there.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tamar | last=Lewin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html? | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Sikh Owner Of Gas Station Is Fatally Shot In Rampage | date=September 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2001, members of [[al-Qaeda]], a militant [[Islamist]] group, hijacked four airplanes and perpetrated [[September 11 attacks|the 9/11 attacks]], killing 2,977 victims. According to family members, Sodhi had become distraught by the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Naomi|last=Gingold|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-20/brother-one-first-hate-crime-victims-post-911-keeps-teaching-tolerance|title=The brother of one of the first hate-crime victims post 9/11 keeps on teaching tolerance|work=pri.org|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roque shootings==
On September 15, 2001, Roque took his [[Chevrolet S-10]] from the Wild Hare sports bar in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], where he had reportedly been ranting about immigrants, and drove to the [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron gas station]] owned by Sodhi. Roque shot Sodhi five times from his truck with a .380 handgun, killing him. At the time of the shooting, Sodhi was helping landscaper Luis Ledesma plant flowers around the edge of his gas station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Grado|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/roque-could-get-death-penalty-for-sikh-murder/article_83b74c56-3b8f-5e72-85af-ce8d4a4d944d.html|title=Roque could get death penalty for Sikh murder|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|publisher=[[Times Media Group]]|location=Tempe, Arizona|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks, mistook him for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] because of the clothes he wore, his [[turban]], and his beard. Roque then drove to a [[Mobil|Mobil gas station]] 10 miles away. Twenty minutes after the first shooting, he shot at a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-American clerk from his truck, but missed.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001" /&gt; Roque then drove to his former residence, which had been purchased by a local Afghan family, and fired multiple rounds at the outside of the house. After fleeing the scene of the final shooting, Roque was reported to have gone to a local bar and boasted, "They're investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sunny | last=Hundal| title = Wisconsin temple shooting: Sikhs have been silent scapegoats since 9/11 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-temple-shooting-sikh-scapegoats | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date = August 6, 2012|accessdate = August 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="splc"/&gt;

==Arrest, trial, conviction==
Police arrested Roque the next day, initially unaware of the later shooting incidents. He reportedly shouted slogans including "I am a patriot!" and "I stand for America all the way!" during his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/sac/dc0603/ch6.htm|title=Chapter 6: Fears and Concerns of Affected, At-Risk Communities|website=Usccr.gov|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[bail]] was set at $1 million.

Roque's [[trial by jury]] began on August 18, 2003. Defense attorneys argued he was not guilty [[plea of insanity|due to insanity]], claiming that he had a diminished [[IQ]] and heard relentless voices telling him that Arabs were Satanic and must be killed. Two coworkers testified that Roque was "narrow-minded" and that he hated both immigrants and Arabs. Roque's defense attorney characterized him as mentally ill, and noted that his mother had twice been hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]], a condition which has been shown to appear in those genetically predisposed to it.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julian|last=Borger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/11/usa.julianborger|title=September 11 revenge killer to die for shooting Sikh|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=10 October 2003|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2003, he was found guilty of [[first degree murder]], and was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] nine days later.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

On July 19, 2005, Roque was found guilty of an unspecified conspiracy charge while in prison, specified only as a violent crime. On February 27, 2006, he was found guilty of having manufactured a primitive weapon in prison three days earlier. In August 2006, the Arizona Supreme Court changed Roque's death sentence to a sentence of life in prison without parole, citing his low IQ and [[mental illness]] as [[mitigating factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Michael|last1=Kiefer|first2=Jim|last2=Walsh|title=9/11-tied slayer won't be executed|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |work=[[Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 15, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720154640/http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korematsu.blogspot.com/2006/08/arizona-supreme-court-overturns-death.html |title=DNSI Blog: Arizona Supreme Court Overturns Death Sentence for Frank Roque - Killer of Balbir Singh Sodhi |publisher=Korematsu.blogspot.com |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was aired by [[Court TV]] in a five-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Walsh|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2003/09/03/149112-killer-of-sikh-after-9-11-called-ill/|title=Killer of Sikh after 9-11 called ill|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=September 3, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sukhpal Sodhi==
On August 4, 2002, less than a year after Sodhi's death, his younger brother Sukhpal was shot to death while driving his taxicab in San Francisco, apparently killed by a stray bullet from a nearby [[gang]] fight. In response to this second tragedy, Balbir's son Sukhwinder said, "What are you going to do with anger? We like peace and we are a peaceful people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Judi|last1=Villa|first2=Adam|last2=Klawonn|url=http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid%3D50 |title=Brother of slain Valley Sikh killed in San Francicso (sic)|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 6, 2002|accessdate=June 8, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030122220844/http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid=50 |archivedate=January 22, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Nayef Al-Rodhan began his career as a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] and [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]]. As a medical student at [[Newcastle University]], he was mentored and influenced by the renowned [[neurologist]], [[John Walton, Baron Walton of Detchant|Lord John Walton of Detchant]]. He trained in [[neurosurgery]] and conducted [[neuroscience]] research at the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Rochester, Minnesota]] in the United States. He became Chief Resident in [[neurosurgery]] and was influenced by Thoralf M. Sundt, David Piepgrass, and Patrick J Kelly at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1988 for his work on the ''Characterization of Opioid and Neurotensin Receptor Subtypes in the Brain with Respect to Antinociception''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/characterization-of-opioid-and-neurotensin-receptor-subtypes-in-the-brain-with-respect-to-antinociception/oclc/170883051&amp;referer=brief_results Characterization of opioid and neurotensin receptor subtypes in the brain with respect to antinociception, Thesis (Ph.D.) - Pharmacology - Mayo Graduate School of Medicine, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, on a fellowship from the [[Congress of Neurological Surgeons]], he joined the department of [[neurosurgery]] at the [[Yale University School of Medicine]] as a fellow in [[epilepsy]] surgery and molecular neuroscience under the direction of Dennis Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epilepsy.yale.edu/education/fellowships/neurosurgery/alumni.aspx Yale Epilepsy Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nonviolent Communication''' (abbreviated '''NVC''', also called '''Compassionate Communication''' or '''Collaborative Communication'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Center for Collaborative Communication|url=http://www.collaborative-communication.org/|accessdate=Nov 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Branscomb"/&gt;) is an approach to nonviolent living developed by [[Marshall Rosenberg]] beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Gear"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gates | first1=Bob | last2=Gear | first2=Jane | last3=Wray |first3=Jane | title = Behavioural Distress: Concepts &amp; Strategies | publisher = Bailliere Tindall |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the idea that all human beings have the capacity for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms themselves and others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs.&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"&gt;Inbal Kashtan, Miki Kashtan, [http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/ Key Assumptions and Intentions of NVC], BayNVC.org&lt;/ref&gt; Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (social, psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet [[Fundamental human needs|universal human needs]] and that these [[need]]s are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that people identify shared needs, revealed by the thoughts and feelings that surround these needs, and collaborate to develop strategies that meet them. This creates both harmony and learning for future cooperation.&lt;ref name=Fullerton&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.gtcs.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=230&amp;sID=6450 |title=The development of "Nonviolent Communication" in an early years setting to support conflict resolution and develop an emotional intelligence related to both self and others. |last=Fullerton |first=Elaine |journal=Behaviour4Learning |publisher=GTC Scotland |date=February 2009 |accessdate=Sep 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NVC supports change on three interconnected levels: with self, with others, and with groups and social systems. As such it is particularly present in the areas of personal development, relationships, and social change. NVC is ostensibly taught as a process of interpersonal communication designed to improve compassionate connection to others. However, due to its far-reaching impact it has also been interpreted as a spiritual practice, a set of values, a parenting technique, a method of social change, a mediation tool, an educational orientation, and a worldview.

among other contexts.

Rosenberg related ways he used Nonviolent Communication in peace programs in conflict zones including [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Colombia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Middle East]] including the [[Palestinian Territories]].&lt;ref name=Rosenberg2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Marshall|title=Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion|year=2001|publisher=Puddledancer Press|location=Encinitas, CA| page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
According to a biography of Rosenberg on the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) website, Nonviolent Communication training evolved from his search for a way to rapidly disseminate peacemaking skills. CNVC says that NVC emerged from work he was doing with civil rights activists in the early 1960s, and that during this period he also mediated between rioting students and college administrators, and worked to peacefully desegregate public schools in long-segregated regions.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/about/marshall-rosenberg.html Our founder's bio], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A master's thesis by Marion Little (2008) says that the roots of the NVC model developed in the late 1960s, when Rosenberg was working on [[racial integration]] in schools and organizations in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little, Marion (2008) [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/MLittle_Thesis0408.pdf Total Honesty/Total Heart: Fostering empathy development and conflict resolution skills. A violence prevention strategy]. MA Thesis, Dispute Resolution, Victoria, B.C., Canada: University of Victoria, 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version of the model (observations, feelings, and action-oriented wants) was part of a training manual Rosenberg prepared in 1972. The model had evolved to its present form (observations, feelings, needs and requests) by 1992. The dialog between Rosenberg and NVC colleagues and trainers continued to influence the model, which by the late 2000s put more emphasis on ''self-empathy'' as a key to the model's effectiveness. Another shift in emphasis, since 2000, has been the reference to the model as a ''process''. The focus is thus less on the "steps" themselves and more on the practitioner's ''[[intention]]s'' in speaking ("Is the intent to get others to do what one wants, or to foster more meaningful relationships and mutual satisfaction?") in listening ("Is the intent to prepare for what one has to say, or to extend heartfelt, respectful attentiveness to another?") and the quality of connection experienced with others.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Also according to Little's thesis, Rosenberg's work with [[Carl Rogers]] on research to investigate the [[Person-centered therapy#The necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient conditions]] of a [[therapeutic relationship]] was central to the development of NVC. Rogers emphasized: 1) experiential learning, 2) "frankness about one's emotional state," 3) the satisfaction of hearing others "in a way that resonates for them," 4) the enriching and encouraging experience of "creative, active, sensitive, accurate, empathic listening," 5) the "deep value of congruence between one's own inner experience, one's conscious awareness, and one's communication," and, subsequently, 6) the enlivening experience of unconditionally receiving love or appreciation and extending the same.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Little says Rosenberg was influenced by [[Erich Fromm]], [[George Albee]], and [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

According to Little, Rosenberg's early work with children with [[learning disabilities]] shows his interest in [[psycholinguistics]] and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on [[collaboration]]. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their own learning. The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a [[Restorative practices|restorative]], "[[partnership]]" paradigm and mutual [[respect]], rather than a [[Retributive justice|retributive]], fear-based, "[[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]" paradigm.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

Little also says Rosenberg identified [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an inspiration for the NVC model, and that Rosenberg's goal was to develop a practical process for interaction rooted in the philosophy of [[Ahimsa]], which Little translates as "the overflowing love that arises when all ill-will, anger, and hate have subsided from the heart."&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;

In order to show the differences between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal as a symbol of aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being aware of his fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals in order to make the differences in communication clearer to the audience.

===Overview===
[[File:Gewaltfreie Kommunikation nach Marshall Rosenberg.jpg|thumbnail|Cards with basic human needs in the hands of exercise group participants.]]
Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their [[Need|human need]]s, due to [[Coercion#Psychological|coercive]] or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] language that aims to induce [[fear]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

Marshall Rosenberg, the founder of Nonviolent Communication, published numerous training materials to help in efforts to bring about radical social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=The Nonviolent Communication Training Course|date=2006|publisher=Sounds True, Inc.|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=1-59179-443-9|pages=Disc Eight, "How Nonviolent Communication Supports Social Change"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned with transforming the "gangs and domination structures" through the method he called "ask, ask, ask". He suggested social change activists could focus on gaining access to those in power in order to "ask, ask, ask" for changes that will make life better for all including the powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=The Heart of Social Change: How You Can Make a Difference in Your World|date=2005|publisher=PuddleDancer Press|location=Encinitas, California|isbn=978-1-892005-46-5|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about the need for the protective use of force, distinguishing it from the punitive use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Marshall|title=Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion|date=August 2002|publisher=PuddleDancer Press|location=Encinitas, California|isbn=1-892005-02-6|pages=155–163|edition=8th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions===
Two NVC trainers characterize the assumptions underlying NVC as follows:&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"/&gt;
#All human beings share the same needs
#Our world offers sufficient resources for meeting everyone's basic needs
#All actions are attempts to meet needs
#Feelings point to needs being met or unmet
#All human beings have the capacity for compassion
#Human beings enjoy giving
#Human beings meet needs through interdependent relationships
#Human beings change
#Choice is internal
#The most direct path to peace is through self-connection

===Intentions===
The trainers also say that practicing NVC involves having the following intentions:&lt;ref name="KashtanAssump"/&gt;
*Open-hearted living
#[[Self-compassion]]
#Expressing from the heart
#Receiving with compassion
#Prioritizing connection
#Moving beyond "right" and "wrong" to using needs-based assessments
*Choice, responsibility, peace
#Taking responsibility for our feelings
#Taking responsibility for our actions
#Living in peace with unmet needs
#Increasing capacity for meeting needs
#Increasing capacity for meeting the present moment
*Sharing power (partnership)
#Caring equally for everyone's needs
#Using force minimally and to protect rather than to educate, punish, or get what we want without agreement

===Communication that blocks compassion===
Rosenberg says that certain ways of communicating tend to alienate people from the experience of compassion:&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rosenberg | first=Marshall | authorlink = Marshall Rosenberg | title = Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life | publisher = Puddledancer Press |year=2003 | isbn = 1-892005-03-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.2}}
*''Moralistic judgments'' implying wrongness or badness on the part of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (''Moralistic judgments'' are not to be confused with ''[[value judgment]]s'' as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that "Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting."
*''Demands'' that implicitly or explicitly threaten listeners with blame or punishment if they fail to comply.
*''Denial of responsibility'' via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It is said that we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.
*''Making comparisons'' between people.
*A premise of ''deserving'', that certain actions merit reward while others merit punishment.

===Four components===
[[File:The Inner World of OFNR (NVC).png|thumb|upright=1.3|How Observation, Feelings, Needs and Requests are connected in the NVC system]]
Rosenberg invites NVC practitioners to focus attention on four components:
*'''Observation''': the facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static [[generalization]]s. It is said that "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying." Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.3}}
*'''Feelings''': emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.4}}
*'''Needs''': universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs. It is posited that "Everything we do is in service of our needs."&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Marshall B.|title=Speak Peace in a World of Conflict: What You Say Next Will Change Your World|year=2005|publisher=Puddledancer Press|isbn=978-1-892005-17-5|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Request''': request for a specific action, free of demand. Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of "no" without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a "no" it is recommended not that one give up, but that one empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying "yes," before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.6}}

===Modes===
There are three primary modes of application of NVC:
*'''Self-empathy''' involves compassionately connecting with what is going on inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the thoughts and judgments we are having, noticing our feelings, and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"/&gt;{{rp|ch.4}}
*'''Receiving empathically''', in NVC, involves "connection with what's alive in the other person and what would make life wonderful for them... It's not an understanding of the head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's alive in them... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them."&lt;ref name="SpeakPeace"/&gt;{{rp|ch.5}} Empathy involves "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;{{rp|ch.7}}
*'''Expressing honestly''', in NVC, is likely to involve expressing an observation, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if the context of the conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roles of the Four Components of NVC |last=Wentworth |first=Bob|work=capitalnvc.net |url=http://capitalnvc.net/bobrolesofcomponents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
As of 2008, NVC was said to lack significant "longitudinal analytical research,"&lt;ref name="Fullerton" /&gt; and few studies had evaluated the effectiveness of NVC training programs.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; There had been little discussion of NVC in academic contexts, and most evidence for the effectiveness of NVC was said to be anecdotal or based on theoretical support. Since that time, the number of publications reporting research on NVC has more than doubled.&lt;ref name="NVCresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnvc.org/about-us/projects/nvc-research/nvc-research|title=NVC Research|publisher=Center for Nonviolent Communication|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carme Juncadella produced a systematic review of research as of 2013 related to the impact of NVC on the development of empathy.&lt;ref name=Juncadella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juncadella|first=Carme Mampel|title=What is the impact of the application of the Nonviolent Communication model on the development of empathy? Overvie|journal=MSc in Psychotherapy Studies|date=October 2013|url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/NVC_Research_Files/Carme_Mampel_Juncadella.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, "lacks precision," but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.

As of 2017, fifteen master's theses and doctoral dissertations are known to have tested the model on sample sizes of 108 or smaller and generally have found the model to be effective.&lt;ref name="Branscomb"&gt;Jane Branscomb (2011), [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20Research/branscomb_dissertation.pdf Summation Evaluation of a Workshop in Collaborative Communication], M.A. Thesis, Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NVCresearch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, A.L. (2007) [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20Research/Nash_Tekoa_Institute_NVC_Conflict_Resolution.pdf Case Study of Tekoa Institute: Illustration of Nonviolent Communication Training's Effect on Conflict Resolution]. MS Sociology. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia: pp.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Allan Rohlfs, who first met Rosenberg in 1972 and was a founder of the Center for Nonviolent Communication, in 2011 explained a paucity of academic literature as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually all conflict resolution programs have an academic setting as their foundation and therefore have empirical studies by graduate students assessing their efficacy. NVC is remarkable for its roots. Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D. ([[clinical psychology]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|U of Wisconsin]]) comes from a full time private practice in clinical psychology and consultation, never an academic post. NVC, his creation, is entirely a grassroots organization and never had until recently any foundation nor grant monies, on the contrary funded 100% from trainings which were offered in public workshops around the world. ... Empirical data is now coming slowly as independent researchers find their own funding to conduct and publish empirical studies with peer review.&lt;ref name="Allan Rohlfs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwcompass.org/about-nvc/note-origins-nvc/|title=Note on the Origins of NVC|publisher=Northwest Compassionate Communication|accessdate=22 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Richard D. (2012). ''Toward an Integrated Model: Using Nonviolent Communication in Mediation''. MA Thesis, Conflict Analysis and Engagement, Yellow Springs, OH: Antioch University Midwest.&lt;/ref&gt; updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Empathy in Conflict Intervention: The Key to Successful NVC Mediation|last = Bowers|first = Richard|publisher = Harmony World Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1-4776-1460-0|location = |pages = |last2 = Moffett|first2 = Nelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that NVC has been absent from academic programs due to a lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.

A variety of benefits were reported, including "conversations and meetings were notably more efficient, with issues being resolved in 50-80 percent less time."

NVC has reportedly been an element of a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in [[Psychiatric and mental health nursing#Organization of mental health care|forensic psychiatric nursing]] settings in which a high level of violence is the norm. NVC was adopted, in combination with other interventions, in an effort to reduce violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 percent over a three-year period in a medium security unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riemer |first1=D. |last2=Corwith |first2=C. |year=2007 |title= Application of core strategies: reducing seclusion &amp; restraint use|journal=On the Edge |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=7–10 |url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/research/OTEFall2007.pdf |accessdate=Mar 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riemer |first1=D. |year=2009 |title=Creating Sanctuary: Reducing Violence in a Maximum Security Forensic Psychiatric Hospital Unit |journal=On the Edge |volume=15 |issue=1 |url=http://www.iafn.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=302 |accessdate=Sep 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study examined the effects of combined NVC and [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training on 885 male inmates of the [[Monroe Correctional Complex]] in [[Monroe, Washington]]. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.&lt;ref name=FreedomProjectStudy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Alejandra|author2=Dug Y.

NVC has also been reported as effective in reducing domestic violence. Male participants who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years as reported by the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the [[Duluth Model]], said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence recidivism rate.&lt;ref name=Battering&gt;{{cite news|title=Batterers' intervention recidivism rates lowest known to date|url=http://www.mtdemocrat.com/news/batterers-intervention-recidivism-rates-lowest-known-to-date/|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Mountain Democrat (Placerville, CA)|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers and Moffett&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; provide a thoughtful study of the important role of empathy and human needs in mediation through the development of a theoretical model to explain the effectiveness of NVC mediation. The authors present theories of human needs and the basis for a common core of needs. They discuss theories that explain the importance of understanding human needs in the context of conflict resolution. They clearly distinguish core human needs from interests (strategies) and how focusing on needs is a paradigm shift in the field of conflict resolution. Further, Bowers and Moffett present theories of empathy
from the pioneering work of Carl Rogers, [[Heinz Kohut]], and others. Empathy is distinguished from sympathy and active listening, pointing out how the word empathy is often confused in the literature by using it interchangeably with these other two terms. They also examine stage theories of the development of empathy as well as constructive-developmental theories related to empathy.

Some recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs.&lt;ref&gt;The Atlantic, [https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/08/maslow-20-a-new-and-improved-recipe-for-happiness/243486/ Maslow 2.0: A New and Improved Recipe for Happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tay |first1=Louis|last2=Diener|first2=Ed

==Relationship to spirituality==
As Theresa Latini notes, "Rosenberg understands NVC to be a fundamentally [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practice."&lt;ref name=Latini&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Rosenberg describes the influence of his spiritual life on the development and practice of NVC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it is important that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.&lt;ref name="Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication: A Question and Answer Session with Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D|url=http://www.cnvc.org/learn-online/spiritual-basis/spiritual-basis-nonviolent-communication|publisher=Center for Nonviolent Communication|accessdate=Dec 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rosenberg further states that he developed NVC as a way to "get conscious of" what he calls the "Beloved Divine Energy".&lt;ref name="Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication"/&gt;

Some Christians have found NVC to be complementary to their [[Christianity|Christian faith]].&lt;ref name="Latini"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Many people have found Nonviolent Communication to be very complementary to [[Buddhism]], both in theory and in manifesting Buddhist ideals in practice.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fwbo-news.org/features/2008/05/nvc-in-fwbo-heart-to-heart.html NVC in the FWBO: Heart-to-Heart Communication]", Shantigarbha, ''FWBO &amp; TBMSG News'', May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://shambhalatimes.org/2009/01/31/buddhism-and-nonviolent-communication/ Buddhism and Nonviolent Communication]", Jason Little, ''Shambhala Times'', January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LasaterSay"&gt;{{cite book| title=What We Say Matters: Practicing Nonviolent Communication |last1=Lasater|last2=Lasater|first1=Judith Hanson|first2=Ike K.|publisher=Rodmell Press|year=2009|pages=192|isbn=978-1-930485-24-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other models==
Marion Little examines theoretical frameworks related to NVC. The influential [[Getting to Yes|interest-based model]] for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Fisher]], [[William Ury|Ury]], and Patton at the [[Harvard Negotiation Project]] and at the [[Program on Negotiation]] in the 1980s appears to have some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|31–35}} Little suggests [[Parent Effectiveness Training|The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships]] (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|35–41}} Like Rosenberg, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Gordon]] had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.&lt;ref name="Little"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Suzanne Jones sees a substantive difference between [[active listening]] as originated by Gordon and empathic listening as recommended by Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said to let them know you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.&lt;ref name="SJones"&gt;Jones, Suzanne (2009) [http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20in%20Schools/TRADITIONAL_EDUCATION_OR_PARTNERSHIP_EDUCATION_S_Jones.pdf Traditional Education or Partnership Education: Which Educational Approach Might Best Prepare Students for the Future?] MA Thesis, Communication, San Diego, California. USA. San Diego University: 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gert Danielsen and Havva Kök both note an overlap between the premises of NVC and those of Human Needs Theory (HNT), an academic model for understanding the sources of conflict and designing conflict resolution processes, with the idea that "Violence occurs when certain individuals or groups do not see any other way to meet their need, or when they need understanding, respect and consideration for their needs."&lt;ref name=Danielsen&gt;{{cite web|last=Danielsen|first=Gert|title=Meeting Human Needs, Preventing Violence: Applying Human Needs Theory to the Conflict in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cnvc.org/sites/cnvc.org/files/NVC_Research_Files/NVC%20and%20Violence%20Prevention/Danielsen2005.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Havva Kök, [http://turin.sgir.eu/uploads/Kok-paper_for_section_6_reducing_violence_by_meeting_human_needs.pdf "Nonviolent Communication in Political Conflicts"], USAK Yearbook of International Politics and Law, Volume 2, (2009). pp. 349–362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, John 1990b. Conflict: Basic Human Needs. New York: St. Martins Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman Flack sees an overlap between what Rosenberg advocates and [[critical thinking]], especially [[Bertrand Russell]]'s formulation uniting kindness and clear thinking.&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

Martha Lasley sees similarities with the Focused Conversation Method developed by the [[The Institute of Cultural Affairs International|Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA)]], with NVC's ''observations'', ''feelings'', ''needs'', and ''requests'' components relating to FCM's ''objective'', ''reflective'', ''interpretive'', and ''decisional'' stages.&lt;ref&gt;Lasley, Martha (2005) ''Difficult Conversations: Authentic Communication Leads to Greater Understanding and Teamwork''.

==Responses==
As of 2008, some researchers noted that NVC lacked an evidence base beyond the copious anecdotal claims of effectiveness and similarly lacked discussion in the literature of the theoretical basis of the model.&lt;ref name="Gear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fullerton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

Several researchers have attempted a thorough evaluation of criticisms and weaknesses of NVC and assessed significant challenges in its application.&lt;ref name="Juncadella" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Altmann&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Altmann|first=Tobias |title=Evaluation der Gewaltfreien Kommunikation in Quer- und Längsschnittdaten |type=Unpublished dissertation |publisher=University of Leipzig, Institut für Psychologie II |date=2010|url=http://www.gewaltfrei-dach.eu/sites/default/files/medium-wissenschaftliche-arbeit-altmann-tobias-diplomarbeit.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bitschnau&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitschnau|first=Karoline|title=Die Sprache der Giraffen. Wie die Gewaltfreie Kommunikation Ihr Leben verändern kann |date=2008|publisher=Paderborn (Junfermann)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oboth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oboth|first=Monika|title=Inspiration und Herausforderung.|journal=Spektrum der Mediation.|date=2007|volume=28|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These span a range of potential problems, from the practical to the theoretical, and include concerns gathered from study participants and researchers.

The difficulty of using NVC as well as the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau&lt;ref name="Bitschnau" /&gt; and Flack&lt;ref name="Flack" /&gt; find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.

Oboth suggests that people might hide their feelings in the process of empathy, subverting the nonviolence of communication.&lt;ref name="Oboth" /&gt;

The massive investment of time and effort in learning to use NVC has been noted by a number of researchers.&lt;ref name="Juncadella" /&gt;

Chapman Flack, in reviewing a training video by Rosenberg, finds the presentation of key ideas "spell-binding" and the anecdotes "humbling and inspiring", notes the "beauty of his work", and his "adroitly doing fine attentive thinking" when interacting with his audience. Yet Flack wonders what to make of aspects of Rosenberg's presentation, such as his apparent "dim view of the place for thinking" and his building on [[Walter Wink]]'s account of the origins of our way of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature history, literature and art offer.&lt;ref name="Flack"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+subtle+violence+of+nonviolent+language.-a0152267677 |title=The subtle violence of nonviolent language. |last=Flack|first=Chapman |journal=[[CrossCurrents]] |volume=56|number=3|issn=0011-1953|date=September 2006|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flack notes a distinction between the "strong sense" of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the "weak sense," a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that some of what Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates "the real thing." Yet Flack warns that "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." As an antidote, Flack advises, "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others," (also known as the [[robustness principle]]) and guard against the "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name."&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

Ellen Gorsevski, assessing Rosenberg's book, ''Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Compassion'' (1999) in the context of geopolitical rhetoric, states that "the relative strength of the individual is vastly overestimated while the key issue of [[structural violence]] is almost completely ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gorsevski | first1=Ellen | title = Peaceful Persuasion: The Geopolitics of Nonviolent Rhetoric | pages=166, 227–228 |publisher = State University of New York Press |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PuddleDancer Press reports that NVC has been [[Testimonial|endorsed]] by a variety of public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endorsements of Nonviolent Communication|url=http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pressroom/endorsements.htm|publisher=PuddleDancer Press|accessdate=Nov 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, one of the first acts of [[Satya Nadella]] when he became CEO of [[Microsoft]] in 2014 was to ask top company executives to read Rosenberg's book, ''Nonviolent Communication.''&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacCracken|first1=Harry|title=Satya Nadella Rewrites Microsoft’s Code|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40457458/satya-nadella-rewrites-microsofts-code|website=Fast Company|accessdate=25 Sep 2017|date=18 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC), founded by Marshall Rosenberg, has trademarked the terms ''NVC'', ''Nonviolent Communication'' and ''Compassionate Communication'', among other terms, for clarity and branding purposes.&lt;ref name="Sharing"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/node/6832 Guidelines for sharing NVC], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

CNVC certifies trainers who wish to teach NVC in a manner aligned with CNVC's understanding of the NVC process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/training/certification.html Certification], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt; CNVC also offers trainings by certified trainers.&lt;ref name="IIT"&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/training/international-intensive-trainings-iits.html Nonviolent Communication International Intensive Training], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some trainings in Nonviolent Communication are offered by trainers sponsored by organizations considered as allied with, but having no formal relationship with, the Center for Nonviolent Communication founded by Marshall Rosenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organizations |url=http://www.nvcworld.com/organisations |publisher=NVC World |website=nvcworld.com |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitalnvc.net/organizationofmovement Organization of the NVC Movement], capitalnvc.net&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these trainings are announced through CNVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnvc.org/trainingcal Training Schedule], cnvc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous NVC organizations have sprung up around the world, many with regional focuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nvcworld.com/organisations |title=International Organisations |first= |last= |work=nvcworld.com |year=2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnvc.org/organizations |title=Find nvc organizations |work=cnvc.org|year=2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Moral Fiction''''' is a collection of essays by the American novelist [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] published in 1978. ({{ISBN|0-465-05225-8}})

In this work, Gardner attacks what he sees as contemporary literature's lack of [[morality]], which he calls the highest purpose of art and which he defines in the book.  According to Gardner, morality is not an arbitrary construct of society, but an eternal truth, taking on different forms but not essentially changing through the ages.  He says that moral fiction "attempts to test human values, not for the purpose of preaching or peddling a particular ideology, but in a truly honest and open-minded effort to find out which best promotes human fulfillment."

[[Leo Tolstoy]], among others, espouses similar views in his essay ''[[What is Art?]]'', and Gardner draws upon Tolstoy in his argument.

This subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle and is similar to the [[Barnum effect|Forer effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf Forer BR (1949).

==Development==
The name derives from the 1913 novel ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] describing a girl who plays the "glad game"—trying to find something to be glad about in every situation. The novel has been adapted to film several times, most famously in [[Pollyanna (1920 film)|1920]] and [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|1960]]. An early use of the name "Pollyanna" in psychological literature was in 1969 by Boucher and Osgood who described a ''Pollyanna hypothesis'' as a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating.{{sfn|Boucher|Osgood|1969}} Empirical evidence for this tendency has been provided by computational analyses of large corpora of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Peter Sheridan|last2=Clark|first2=Eric M.|last3=Desu|first3=Suma|last4=Frank|first4=Morgan R.|last5=Reagan|first5=Andrew J.|last6=Williams|first6=Jake Ryland|last7=Mitchell|first7=Lewis|last8=Harris|first8=Kameron Decker|last9=Kloumann|first9=Isabel M.|date=2015-02-24|title=Human language reveals a universal positivity bias|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/2389|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=8|pages=2389–2394|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411678112|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25675475|pmc=4345622|arxiv=1406.3855|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.2389D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtz|first=Peter|last2=Deutschmann|first2=Emanuel|last3=Dobewall|first3=Henrik|date=2017-08-23|title=Cross-Cultural Psychology and the Rise of Academic Capitalism: Linguistic Changes in CCR and JCCP Articles, 1970-2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022117724902|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1410–1431|doi=10.1177/0022022117724902|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pollyanna principle'' was described by Matlin and Stang in 1978 using the [[archetype]] of Pollyanna more specifically as a psychological principle which portrays the [[nostalgia|positive bias people have when thinking of the past]]. According to the Pollyanna Principle, the brain processes information that is pleasing and agreeable in a more precise and exact manner as compared to unpleasant information. We actually tend to remember past experiences as more rosy than they actually occurred.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978}}

Researchers Margaret Matlin and David Stang provided substantial evidence of the Pollyanna Principle. They found that people expose themselves to positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli, they take longer to recognize what is unpleasant or threatening than what is pleasant and safe, and they report that they encounter positive stimuli more frequently than they actually do. Matlin and Stang also determined that selective recall was a more likely occurrence when recall was delayed: the longer the delay, the more selective recall that occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Pollyanna principle has been observed on online social networks as well. For example, [[Twitter]] users preferentially share more, and are emotionally affected more frequently by, positive information.{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015a}}{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015b}}

However, the Pollyanna principle does not always apply to individuals suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], who tend to either have more [[depressive realism]] or a negative bias.{{sfn|Carr|2004}}

==Mechanisms of transfer==
Testosterone is a [[steroid hormone]]; therefore it has the ability to diffuse through the [[amniotic fluid]] between fetuses.&lt;ref name=VS90/&gt; In addition, hormones can transfer among fetuses through the mother's bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorodeski|first=G.I.|author2=Sheean, L.A. |author3=Utian, W.H. |title=Sex hormone modulation of flow velocity in the parametrial artery of the pregnant rat|journal=Am.

==Consequences of testosterone transfer==

==Animal studies==
Most animal studies are performed on rats or mice. In these studies, the amount of testosterone each individual fetus is exposed to depends on its intrauterine position (IUP). Each gestating fetus not at either end of the uterine horn is surrounded by either two males (2M), two females (0M), or one female and one male (1M). Development of the fetus varies widely according to its IUP.&lt;ref name=RV/&gt;

===Mice===
In mice, prenatal testosterone transfer causes higher blood concentrations of testosterone in 2M females when compared to 1M or 0M females.&lt;ref name=VS90&gt;{{cite journal|last=vom Saal|first=F.S.|author2=Quadagno, D.M. |author3=Even, M.D. |author4=Keisler, L.W. |author5=Keisler, D.H. |author6=Khan, S. |title=Paradoxical effects of maternal stress on fetal steroids and postnatal reproductive traits in female mice from different intrauterine positions|journal=Biol.

==Human studies==
Studies involving humans often compare opposite-sex to same-sex dizygotic twins. Females of opposite-sex twin pairs are thought to have partially masculinized traits as a result of gestating along with a male. These studies test for a range of masculinized cognitive, morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. Studies testing for differences in behavior (i.e. temperament) tend to yield inconsistent results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cohen-Bendahan CC, van de Beek C, Berenbaum SA |title=Prenatal sex hormone effects on child and adult sex-typed behavior: methods and findings|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2005b|volume=29|pages=353–384|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.004|pmid=15811504|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those testing perception and cognition are typically more consistent.&lt;ref name=tapp/&gt; Though supporting evidence exists, whether or not prenatal testosterone transfer occurs in humans remains debatable.

'''Progress''' is the idea that advances in [[technology]], [[science]], and [[social organization]] can produce an improvement in the [[human condition]], and therefore that entire [[societies]], and humanity in general, can improve in terms of their social, political, and economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This may happen as a result of direct human action, as in [[social enterprise]] or through [[activism]], or as a natural part of [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, R., 2017. History of the Idea of Progress. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th century [[social theory|social theories]], especially [[social evolution]] as described by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was present in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]]. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

==Measuring progress==
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.&lt;ref&gt;Slaboch, M.W., 2017. A Road to Nowhere: The Idea of Progress and Its Critics. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GDP]] growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the [[sustainability]] of economic activity. [[Wikiprogress]] has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. [http://www.humanprogress.org/ HumanProgress.org] is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

The [[Social Progress Index]] is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.

Indices that can be used to measure progress include:
{{div col}}
* [[Broad measures of economic progress]]
* [[Disability-adjusted life year]]
* [[Green national product]]
* [[Gender-related Development Index]]
* [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]
* [[Gross National Happiness]]
* [[Gross National Well-being]]
* [[Happy Planet Index]]
* [[Human Development Index]]
* [[Legatum Prosperity Index]]
* [[Social Progress Index]]
* [[OECD Better Life Index]]
* [[Subjective life satisfaction]]
* [[Where-to-be-born Index]]
* [[Wikiprogress]]
* [[World Happiness Report]]
* [[World Values Survey]]

==Scientific progress==
{{see also|History of science|Technological change|Invention}}
'''Scientific progress''' is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of [[scientific knowledge]] to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wesseling|first=Henk|date=August 1998|title=History: Science or art?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/history-science-or-art/1D3620AE5FCD4AA371AC99E352260E68|journal=European Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1017/S106279870000329X|issn=1474-0575|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

This process differs from [[non-science]] fields, such as human languages or history:  the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Aspects of social progress, as described by [[Condorcet]], have included the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
How progress improved the degraded status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Ann Taylor (1999). "Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: the Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860–914," ''American Historical Review'' '''104''' (4): 1085–113; Nyland, Chris (1993). "Adam Smith, Stage Theory, and the Status of Women," ''History of Political Economy'' '''25''' (4): 617–40.&lt;/ref&gt; British theorists [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721–1793) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and [[republicanism|republican-based]] conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to an enlightened affirmation of modern European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Kontler, László (2004). "Beauty or Beast, or Monstrous Regiments? Robertson and Burke on Women and the Public Scene," ''Modern Intellectual History'' '''1''' (3): 305–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Robert William, &amp; Chris Nyland (2003). ''The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought''.Edward Elgar Publishing, p. 109; Ryrie, Charles Caldwell (1958). ''The Place of Women in the Church'', The Macmillan Company, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, Edward, &amp; Peter J. Seybolt, (2007). ''Through Chinese Eyes: Tradition, Revolution, and Transformation'', APEX Press, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leo Marx and [[Bruce Mazlish]] asking, "Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past," answer that there is no doubt "that the status of women has improved markedly" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Leo, &amp; Bruce Mazlish (1998). ''Progress: Fact or Illusion?''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernization==
{{main|Modernization}}
Modernization was promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Joyce; Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob (1995). ''Telling the Truth about History''. W.W. Norton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe [[social commentary|social commentators]] and [[philosopher]]s began to realize that people ''themselves'' could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves ''made their own society''—and not only that, as [[Giambattista Vico]] argued, ''because'' people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or [[proto-science]]s, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.&lt;ref&gt;The following annotated reference list appears in [[J. B. Bury]]'s study: ''The Idea of Progress,'' published in 1920 and [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4557/4557-h/4557-h.htm available in full on the web]:
{{Quote|The history of the idea of Progress has been treated briefly and partially by various French writers; e.g. Comte, {{lang|fr|Cours de philosophie positive}}, vi. 321 sqq.; Buchez, {{lang|fr|Introduction a la science de l'histoire}}, i. 99 sqq. (ed. 2, 1842); Javary, {{lang|fr|De l'idee de progres}} (1850); Rigault, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}} (1856); Bouillier, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne}} (1854); Caro, {{lang|fr|Problemes de la morale sociale}} (1876); Brunetiere, "{{lang|fr|La Formation de l'idee de progres|italic=no}}", in {{lang|fr|Etudes critiques}}, 5e serie. More recently M. Jules Delvaille has attempted to trace its history fully, down to the end of the eighteenth century. His {{lang|fr|Histoire de l'idee de progres}} (1910) is planned on a large scale; he is erudite and has read extensively. But his treatment is lacking in the power of discrimination. He strikes one as anxious to bring within his net, as {{lang|fr|theoriciens du progres}}, as many distinguished thinkers as possible; and so, along with a great deal that is useful and relevant, we also find in his book much that is irrelevant. He has not clearly seen that the distinctive idea of Progress was not conceived in antiquity or in the Middle Ages, or even in the Renaissance period; and when he comes to modern times he fails to bring out clearly the decisive steps of its growth. And he does not seem to realize that a man might be "progressive" without believing in, or even thinking about, the doctrine of Progress. Leonardo da Vinci and Berkeley are examples. In my ''Ancient Greek Historians'' (1909) I dwelt on the modern origin of the idea (p. 253 sqq.). Recently Mr. R. H. Murray, in a learned appendix to his ''Erasmus and Luther'', has developed the thesis that Progress was not grasped in antiquity (though he makes an exception of Seneca),—a welcome confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this gave rise to [[Progressivism|progressive]] opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about [[panacea]]s for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the [[French Revolution]], [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]] hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.

The scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon's]] book the [[New Atlantis]]. In the 17th century, [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of [[John Locke]] provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists [[Diderot]], [[Holbach]], and [[Condorcet]]. Locke had a powerful influence on the American [[Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, Thomas L. (1990). ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete statement of progress is that of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], in his "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. [[Condorcet]] predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) pp. 224–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential ''Principles of Economics'' (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called ''sustainable development.'' For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Caldari, Katia (2004). "Alfred Marshall's Idea of Progress and Sustainable Development," ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'', '''26''' (4): 519–36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1989). ''Economic Development: The History of an Idea''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by [[Peter the Great]] (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Herbert J. (1965). "Economic Modernization in Imperial Russia: Purposes and Achievements," ''Journal of Economic History'' '''25''' (4): 523–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" that would benefit all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, John E. (1973). "Juan Bautista Alberdi: A Study of His Thought," ''Americas'' '''29''' (4): 489–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, [[Jose Mora]] (1795–1856) was a leader of [[classical liberalism]] in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the ''hacendados''. He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, John M. (1972). "Jose Mora: His Idea of Progress and the Origins of Mexican Liberalism," ''North Dakota Quarterly'' '''40''' (2): 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.&lt;ref&gt;DalLago, Enrico (2002). ''The American South and the Italian Mezzogiorno: Essays in Comparative History''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the 20th century the [[KMT]] or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused mass famines. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, Dmitry (2004). "Deng Xiaoping and the Modernization of China," ''Far Eastern Affairs'' '''32''' (4): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, [[bright green environmentalism]] endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 9, "Technological Optimism and Belief in Progress", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; warning of impending global crisis (through [[climate change]] or [[peak oil]], for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001). ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''. Cambridge University Press, pp 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the philosophy of [[Deep Ecology]].

==Philosophy==
Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] said that "No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defines five "crucial premises" of the idea of progress:
# value of the past
# nobility of Western civilization
# worth of economic/technological growth
# faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason
# intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth

Sociologist [[P. A. Sorokin]] said, "The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view".&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Sorokin, 1932 paper, quoted in Fay (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and "modernisation" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Youwei, Kang, &amp; Lawrence G. Thompson (1958). ''Ta T'ung Shu: The One World Philosophy of Kang Yu-wei.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1957). ''The Poverty of Historicism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], a self-proclaimed [[neo-luddism|neo-luddite]] author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled "Five Facets of a Myth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers (1965) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychoanalyst [[Charles Baudouin]] claimed modernity has retained the "corollary" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:
{{quote|sign=|source=|
The last two centuries were familiar with the myth of progress. Our own century has adopted the myth of modernity. The one myth has replaced the other. ...

Men ceased to believe in progress; but only to pin their faith to more tangible realities, whose sole original significance had been that they were the instruments of progress. ..

This exaltation of the present ... is a corollary of that very faith in progress which people claim to have discarded. The present is superior to the past, by definition, only in a mythology of progress. Thus one retains the corollary while rejecting the principle. There is only one way of retaining a position of whose instability one is conscious. One must simply refrain from thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]], ''The Myth of Modernity'', ''Le Mythe du moderne'' (1946), as translated by [[Bernard Miall]] (1950), sections 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A cyclical theory of history was adopted by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' in 1920. [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the rise of [[totalitarianism]] demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Farrenkopf, John (1993). "Spengler's Historical Pessimism and the Tragedy of our Age," ''Theory and Society'' Vol. 22, Number 3, pp. 391–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of [[republicanism]]. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] wrote in 1920:&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/ideaofprogressin00buryuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Idea of Progress'']. London: Macmillan and Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable. The movement may be Progress, or it may be in an undesirable direction and therefore not Progress..... The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.}}

In the [[postmodernist]] thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized.  In the new vision, radical modernizers like [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] appear as [[totalitarian]] despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed.  Postmodernists question the validity of 19th century and 20th century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner [[happiness]] and [[Wiktionary:peace of mind|peace of mind]]. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.

{{anchor|Myth of Progress}}{{see also|Progress trap}}
Some 20th-century authors refer to the "Myth of Progress" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician [[Montague David Eder]] wrote: "The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= David Eder | first=Montague | year=1932 | title=The Myth of Progress | journal=D. Eder. 'the Myth of Progress.' the British Journal of Medical Psychology 1932, Vol. Xii, P. 1.. Int. J. Psycho-Anal | volume=14 | pages=399 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IJP.014.0399A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (b. 1948), concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (2004). "An Illusion with a Future," ''Daedalus'' Vol. 133(3), pp 10+; also Gray (2004). ''Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions''. Granta Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Faith in the liberating power of knowledge is encrypted into modern life. Drawing on some of Europe's most ancient traditions, and daily reinforced by the quickening advance of science, it cannot be given up by an act of will. The interaction of quickening scientific advance with unchanging human needs is a fate that we may perhaps temper, but cannot overcome... Those who hold to the possibility of progress need not fear. The illusion that through science humans can remake the world is an integral part of the modern condition. Renewing the eschatological hopes of the past, progress is an illusion with a future.}}

Recently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as "what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal."&lt;ref&gt;Cerbaro, R. H. and Whisler, J. L. (2016). The Idea of Progress: A Theoretical and Concise Goal-Structure Model. Current Research in Psychology, 7 (1): 12.15, p. 13. DOI: 10.3844/crpsp.2016.12.15   [http://thescipub.com/PDF/crpsp.2016.12.15.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] said that thought in [[ancient Greece]] was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic "[[Original sin|fall of man]]," but rather from a preceding "[[Golden Age]]" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] as the explanation for a world without an intervening [[deity]].
{{cquote|For them, the earliest condition of men resembled that of the beasts, and from this primitive and miserable condition they laboriously reached the existing state of civilisation, not by external guidance or as a consequence of some initial design, but simply by the exercise of human intelligence throughout a long period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

[[Robert Nisbet]] and [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. [[Xenophanes]] said "The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better." [[Plato]]'s Book III of ''[[The Laws]]'' depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.

===Renaissance===
During the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] (a method of thinking and learning from the [[Middle Ages]]) interpretations of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a [[pantheistic]] interpretation of [[Plato]]. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst; Paul Oskar Kristeller and John Herman Randall (eds., 1948). ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Enlightenment (1650–1800)===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French historian and philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) was a major proponent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Jeanne A. (1991). "Reasonable Hope: Kant as Critical Theorist," ''History of European Ideas'', '''21''' (4): 527–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish theorist [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, John Andrew (1978). "Adam Ferguson and the Idea of Progress," ''Studies in Burke and His Time'' '''19''' (2): 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a [[secularization]] of ideas from early [[Christianity]], and a reworking of ideas from [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIZfQTd3nSMC&amp;pg=PA402 The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought] By David Miller, Janet Coleman, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein takes a minority view in seeing evidence for ''The Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity'', Johns Hopkins Press (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
In the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Christopher John, ed. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850''. Fitzroy Dearborn, Vol.  II, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is "the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man". He said, "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Samuel M. (1966). "Malthus and the Idea of Progress," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''27''' (1): 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, Giuseppe (2002). ''A Study on the Idea of Progress in Nietzsche, Heidegger and Critical Theory''. E. Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into an industrial and pacific one. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers, George G. (1965). "The Idea of Progress: A Critical Reassessment," ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist theory (late 19th century)===
Marx developed a theory of [[historical materialism]]. He describes the mid-19th century condition in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty, and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all which is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the Communist Party: Chapter 1, Marx &amp; Engels&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:

{{Quote|No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Preface|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|work=Critique of political economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Capitalism]] is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-[[reactionary]]. [[Marxism]] further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by [[socialism]] and eventually communism.

{{cquote|The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.|4=[[George Bernard Shaw]]}}

Many advocates of capitalism such as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through [[creative destruction]], but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.

Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was [[modernism]], a trend of thought which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">'''Psychical inertia''' is a term introduced by [[Carl Jung]] to describe the psyche's resistance to development and change.  He considered it one of the main reason for the neurotic opposing, or shrinking from, his/her age-appropriate tasks in life.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, ''Individuation and Narcissism'' (2013) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freudian and other developments==
[[Freud]] argued that such psychic inertia played a part in the lives of the normal, as well as of the neurotic,&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 358-9&lt;/ref&gt; and saw its origins in [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] between early instincts and their first impressions of significant objects.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; As late as ''[[Civilization and its Discontents]]'', he considered as a major obstacle to cultural development "the inertia of the [[libido]], its disinclination to give up an old position for a new one".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 129) p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Jungians have seen psychic inertia as a force of nature reflecting both internal and outer determinants;&lt;ref&gt;K. Evera-Fahey, ''Towards a Jungian Theory of the Ego'' (2016) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; while others have seen it as the product of social pressures, especially in relation to ageing.&lt;ref&gt;L. Woodward ed., ''Figuring Age'' (1999) p. 133 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rage''' (or '''fury''') is intense, uncontrolled [[anger]] that is an increased stage of hostile response to a particularly egregious injury or injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The [https://dictionary.apa.org/anger APA definition of anger] ("an emotion characterized by tension and hostility arising from frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice") and [https://dictionary.apa.org/rage rage] ("intense, typically uncontrolled anger. It is usually differentiated from hostility in that it is not necessarily accompanied by destructive actions but rather by excessive expressions").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Old French raige, rage (French: rage), from Medieval Latin rabia, from Latin rabies ("anger fury") akin to Sanskrit rabhas (violence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwdictfol?book=Dictionary&amp;va=rage|title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vulgar Latin]] spelling of the word possesses many cognates when translated into many of the modern Romance languages, such as Spanish, Galician, Catalan, Portuguese, and modern Italian: ''rabia'', ''rabia'', ''ràbia'', ''raiva'', and ''rabbia'' respectively.

==Symptoms and effects==

Rage can sometimes lead to a state of mind where the individuals experiencing it believe they can do, and often are capable of doing, things that may normally seem physically impossible. Those experiencing rage usually feel the effects of high [[adrenaline]] levels in the body. This increase in adrenal output raises the physical strength and endurance levels of the person and sharpens their senses, while dulling the sensation of pain. High levels of adrenaline actually impair memory. Temporal perspective is also affected: people in a rage have described [[Time perception|experiencing events in slow-motion]]. Time dilation occurs due to the individual becoming hyper aware of the hind brain (the seat of fight or flight){{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. Rational thought and reasoning would inhibit an individual from acting rapidly upon impulse. An older explanation of this "time dilation" effect is that instead of actually slowing our perception of time, high levels of adrenaline increase our ability to recall specific minutiae of an event after it occurs. Since humans gauge time based on the number of things they can remember, high-adrenaline events such as those experienced during periods of rage seem to unfold more slowly.&lt;ref name= abc5&gt;Eagleman, et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A person in a state of rage may also lose much of their capacity for rational thought and reasoning, and may act, usually [[Violence|violently]], on their impulses to the point that they may attack until they themselves have been incapacitated or the source of their rage has been destroyed.  A person in rage may also experience tunnel vision, muffled hearing, increased heart rate, and hyperventilation. Their vision may also become "rose-tinted" (hence "seeing red"). They often focus only on the source of their anger. The large amounts of adrenaline and oxygen in the bloodstream may cause a person's extremities to shake. Psychiatrists consider rage to be at one end of the spectrum of [[anger]], and [[annoyance]] to be at the other side.&lt;ref name= abc1&gt;DiGiuseppe &amp; Tafrate., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, rage was hypothesized to occur when [[oxytocin]], [[vasopressin]], and [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] are rapidly released from the [[hypothalamus]]. This results in the [[pituitary gland]] producing and releasing large amounts of the [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]], which causes the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[corticosteroid]]s. This chain reaction occurs when faced with a threatening situation.&lt;ref name= abc4&gt;Jezova et al., 1995; Sapolsky, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two decades later, more came to be known about the impacts of high epinephrine. As the focus in neuroscience began to shift towards the roles of white matter tissues, a more full bodied understanding of this complex emotion was able to be extrapolated.

Memory, being the “retention of perceptions”, can be viewed as a giant mosaic (Robertson, 2002). This mosaic would consist of fragmented perceptions (tiles) being held together by astrocytes (glue), creating [[Friction|resistance]]. A ratio of 3:2 could indicate an increased demand on neurons being held together, or insulated. This also raises the possibility that a more developed memory improved an individual’s fitness.

In addition, an increase in white matter tissues assisted in an individual's ability to adapt to new cultures and environments. The metaphor of a kaleidoscope is often utilized when expressing the extraordinary ability humans have at adapting to different cultures by engaging in different patterns of thought. Our ability to perceive patterns of behavior assists in our ability to utilize inductive reasoning, a type of reasoning that can assist in an individual's ability to think of how their behaviors may impact their future. Such lines of reasoning are strengthened through the use of deductive reasoning. Together, inductive and deductive reasoning have assisted in developing adaptive conflict management strategies that assist in the cessation of rage caused by [[cognitive dissonance]].

Astrocytes play a pivotal role in regulating blood flow to and from neurons by creating the blood-brain barrier (BBB).&lt;ref&gt;(Lundgaard I et al., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, these astrocytes are found in close proximity to the ‘end feet’ of blood vessels. These astrocytes aid in the tightening and expansion of the blood vessels to regulate which nutrients make their way to the neurons.&lt;ref&gt;(Frank 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB protects the brain from toxins and helps transport things such as oxygen and glucose to the brain.

This system plays a crucial role in the regulation of memory. Studies have suggested that glucose, together with epinephrine from the adrenal medulla have an effect on memory. Although high doses of epinephrine have been proven to impair memory, moderate doses of epinephrine actually enhance memory.&lt;ref&gt;(Gold, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to questioning the role that epinephrine has played on the evolution of the genus Homo as well as epinephrine's crucial role during fits of rage. The crucial role that astrocytes play in the formation of muscle memory may also shed light on the beneficial impact of meditation and deep breathing as a method of managing and controlling one's rage.

==Health complications==
Some research suggests that an individual is more susceptible to having feelings of depression and anxiety if he or she experiences rage on a frequent basis. Health complications become much worse if an individual represses feelings of rage.&lt;ref name= abc6&gt;Begley, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John E. Sarno]] believes that repressed rage in the subconscious leads to physical ailments. Cardiac stress and [[hypertension]] are other health complications that will occur when rage is experienced on a regular basis. Psychopathologies such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.littler.com/files/press/pdf/Adler-DSM-5-Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder-July-2014.pdf|title=DSM-5 and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder|last=Levin|first=Andrew P.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] regularly present comorbidly with rage.&lt;ref name= abc2&gt;Painuly et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Types of therapy===
Evidence has shown that behavioral and [[cognitive therapy]] techniques have assisted individuals that have difficulties controlling their anger or rage. Role playing and personal study are the two main techniques used to aid individuals with managing rage. Role playing is utilized by angering an individual to the point of rage and then showing them how to control it.&lt;ref name= abc12&gt;Willner et al., 2002; Lishman et al., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-modal cognitive therapy is another treatment used to help individuals cope with anger. This therapy teaches individuals relaxation techniques, problem solving skills, and techniques on response disruption. This type of therapy has proven to be effective for individuals that are highly stressed and are prone to rage.&lt;ref name= abc13&gt;Gerzina &amp; Drummond, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging business is the [[rage room]], a place where people relieve their stress by destroying objects within a room.&lt;ref&gt;business where people can vent their anger by destroying objects within a room&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
According to [[psychologist]]s, rage is an in-born behavior that every person exhibits in some form. Rage is often used to denote hostile/affective/reactive [[aggression]].&lt;ref name=abc16&gt;Fontaine, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rage tends to be expressed when a person faces a threat to their pride, position, ability to deceive others, self-deceptive beliefs, or socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=abc8&gt;Anderson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  This maladaptive conflict management strategy often stems from cognitive dissonance, most simply put, a 'no' where a 'yes' has been.

Cases in which rage is exhibited as a direct response to an individual's deeply held religious beliefs, may directly be related to cognitive dissonance in relation to an individual's ability to manage the terror associated with death and dying. Many researchers have questioned whether Buddhist concepts, such as reincarnation and nibbâna, help ease death anxieties. Coleman and Ka-Ying Hui (2012) stated that “according to the Terror Management Theory, a religious concept of an afterlife helps people manage their personal death anxiety” (949).  This suggests that rage, in relation to religious ideas, may stem from an inability to manage feelings of terror.

Some psychologists, however, such as Bushman and Anderson, argue that the hostile/predatory dichotomy that is commonly employed in psychology fails to define rage fully, since it is possible for anger to motivate aggression, provoking vengeful behavior, without incorporating the impulsive thinking that is characteristic of rage. They point to individuals or groups such as [[Seung-Hui Cho]] in the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] or [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] of the [[Columbine High School massacre]], all of whom clearly experienced intense anger and hate, but whose planning (sometimes over periods of years), forethought, and lack of impulsive behavior is readily observable.&lt;ref name=abc7&gt;DiGiuseppe &amp; Tafrate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reward system''' is a group of neural structures responsible for [[incentive salience]] (i.e., motivation and "wanting", desire, or craving for a reward), [[associative learning]] (primarily [[positive reinforcement]] and [[classical conditioning]]), and [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] [[emotion]]s, particularly ones which involve [[pleasure]] as a core component (e.g., [[joy]], [[euphoria]] and [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]).&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt; Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior, also known as approach behavior, and consummatory behavior.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; In its description of a rewarding stimulus (i.e., "a reward"), a review on reward neuroscience noted, "any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward."&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;  In [[operant conditioning]], rewarding stimuli function as [[positive reinforcer]]s;&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; however, the [[Converse (logic)|converse statement]] also holds true: positive reinforcers are rewarding.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

Primary rewards are a class of rewarding stimuli which facilitate the [[Evolution|survival of one's self and offspring]], and include homeostatic (e.g., [[palatability|palatable food]]) and reproductive (e.g.,  [[Sexual intercourse|sexual contact]] and [[parental investment]]) rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/94023.php |work=Medical News Today |title=Dopamine Involved In Aggression |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic rewards are unconditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior because they are inherently pleasurable.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Extrinsic rewards (e.g., money or seeing one's favorite sports team winning a game) are conditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior, but are not inherently pleasurable.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duarte|first=Isabel C.|last2=Afonso|first2=Sónia|last3=Jorge|first3=Helena|last4=Cayolla|first4=Ricardo|last5=Ferreira|first5=Carlos|last6=Castelo-Branco|first6=Miguel|date=1 May 2017|title=Tribal love: the neural correlates of passionate engagement in football fans|url=https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/5/718/3051628|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=718–728|doi=10.1093/scan/nsx003|pmid=28338882|pmc=5460049|issn=1749-5016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic rewards derive their motivational value as a result of a [[associative learning|learned association]] (i.e., conditioning) with intrinsic rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Extrinsic rewards may also elicit pleasure (e.g., euphoria from winning a lot of money in a lottery) after being [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] with intrinsic rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

Survival for most animal species depends upon maximizing contact with beneficial stimuli and minimizing contact with harmful stimuli. Reward cognition serves to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction by causing associative learning, eliciting approach and consummatory behavior, and triggering [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] emotions.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Thus, reward is a mechanism that evolved to help increase the adaptive fitness of animals.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;

== Definition ==

In neuroscience, the reward system is a collection of brain structures and neural pathways that are responsible for reward-related cognition, including [[associative learning]] (primarily [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant reinforcement]]), [[incentive salience]] (i.e., motivation and "wanting", desire, or craving for a reward), and [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] [[emotion]]s, particularly emotions that involve [[pleasure]] (i.e., hedonic "liking").&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt;

Terms that are commonly used to describe behavior related to the "wanting" or desire component of reward include appetitive behavior, approach behavior, preparatory behavior, instrumental behavior, anticipatory behavior, and seeking.&lt;ref name="Wanting and liking behaviors" /&gt; Terms that are commonly used to describe behavior related to the "liking" or pleasure component of reward include consummatory behavior and taking behavior.&lt;ref name="Wanting and liking behaviors"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Salamone JD, Correa M|title=The Mysterious Motivational Functions of Mesolimbic Dopamine|journal=Neuron|volume=76|issue=3|pages=470–485|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021|pmid=23141060|pmc=4450094|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three primary functions of rewards are their capacity to:
#produce [[associative learning]] (i.e., [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant reinforcement]]);&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;
#affect decision-making and induce approach behavior (via the assignment of [[motivational salience]] to rewarding stimuli);&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;
#elicit [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] emotions, particularly pleasure.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

== Anatomy ==

The brain structures that compose the reward system are located primarily within the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]];&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt; the [[basal ganglia]] portion of the loop drives activity within the reward system.&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt; Most of the pathways that connect structures within the reward system are [[glutamatergic]] [[interneuron]]s, [[GABAergic]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s (MSNs), and [[dopaminergic]] [[projection neuron]]s,&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reward system components and structure-specific functions"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SB, Lewis CR, Olive MF | title = The neurocircuitry of illicit psychostimulant addiction: acute and chronic effects in humans | journal = Subst Abuse Rehabil | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 29–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24648786 | pmc = 3931688 | doi = 10.2147/SAR.S39684 | quote = Regions of the basal ganglia, which include the dorsal and ventral striatum, internal and external segments of the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra, are highly implicated not only in fine motor control but also in [prefrontal cortex] PFC function.43 Of these regions, the [nucleus accumbens] NAc (described above) and the [dorsal striatum] DS (described below) are most frequently examined with respect to addiction. Thus, only a brief description of the modulatory role of the basal ganglia in addiction-relevant circuits will be mentioned here. The overall output of the basal ganglia is predominantly via the thalamus, which then projects back to the PFC to form cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops. Three CSTC loops are proposed to modulate executive function, action selection, and behavioral inhibition. In the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, the basal ganglia primarily modulate the identification and selection of goals, including rewards.44 The [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC circuit modulates decision-making and impulsivity, and the anterior cingulate circuit modulates the assessment of consequences.44 These circuits are modulated by dopaminergic inputs from the [ventral tegmental area] VTA to ultimately guide behaviors relevant to addiction, including the persistence and narrowing of the behavioral repertoire toward drug seeking, and continued drug use despite negative consequences.43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other types of projection neurons contribute (e.g., [[orexinergic]] projection neurons). The reward system includes the [[ventral tegmental area]], [[ventral striatum]] (i.e., the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[olfactory tubercle]]), [[dorsal striatum]] (i.e., the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]]), [[substantia nigra]] (i.e., the [[pars compacta]] and [[pars reticulata]]), [[prefrontal cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[insular cortex]], [[hippocampus]], [[hypothalamus]] (particularly, the [[orexinergic]] nucleus in the [[lateral hypothalamus]]), [[thalamus]] (multiple nuclei), [[subthalamic nucleus]], [[globus pallidus]] (both [[globus pallidus external|external]] and [[globus pallidus internal|internal]]), [[ventral pallidum]], [[parabrachial nucleus]], [[amygdala]], and the remainder of the [[extended amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yager LM, Garcia AF, Wunsch AM, Ferguson SM | title = The ins and outs of the striatum: Role in drug addiction | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 301 | issue = | pages = 529–541 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26116518 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033 | quote = [The striatum] receives dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SNr) and glutamatergic inputs from several areas, including the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (Swanson, 1982; Phillipson and Griffiths, 1985; Finch, 1996; Groenewegen et al., 1999; Britt et al., 2012). These glutamatergic inputs make contact on the heads of dendritic spines of the striatal GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) whereas dopaminergic inputs synapse onto the spine neck, allowing for an important and complex interaction between these two inputs in modulation of MSN activity&amp;nbsp;... It should also be noted that there is a small population of neurons in the [nucleus accumbens] NAc that coexpress both D1 and D2 receptors, though this is largely restricted to the NAc shell (Bertran- Gonzalez et al., 2008).&amp;nbsp;... Neurons in the NAc core and NAc shell subdivisions also differ functionally. The NAc core is involved in the processing of conditioned stimuli whereas the NAc shell is more important in the processing of unconditioned stimuli; Classically, these two striatal MSN populations are thought to have opposing effects on basal ganglia output. Activation of the dMSNs causes a net excitation of the thalamus resulting in a positive cortical feedback loop; thereby acting as a 'go’ signal to initiate behavior. Activation of the iMSNs, however, causes a net inhibition of thalamic activity resulting in a negative cortical feedback loop and therefore serves as a 'brake’ to inhibit behavior&amp;nbsp;... there is also mounting evidence that iMSNs play a role in motivation and addiction (Lobo and Nestler, 2011; Grueter et al., 2013). For example, optogenetic activation of NAc core and shell iMSNs suppressed the development of a cocaine CPP whereas selective ablation of NAc core and shell iMSNs&amp;nbsp;... enhanced the development and the persistence of an amphetamine CPP (Durieux et al., 2009; Lobo et al., 2010). These findings suggest that iMSNs can bidirectionally modulate drug reward.&amp;nbsp;... Together these data suggest that iMSNs normally act to restrain drug-taking behavior and recruitment of these neurons may in fact be protective against the development of compulsive drug use. | pmc=4523218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Review Reward System"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grall-Bronnec M, Sauvaget A | title = The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for modulating craving and addictive behaviours: a critical literature review of efficacy, technical and methodological considerations | journal = Neurosci.

Two theories exist with regard to the activity of the nucleus accumbens and the generation liking and wanting.  The inhibition (or hyper&amp;shy;polar&amp;shy;ization) hypothesis proposes that the nucleus accumbens exerts tonic inhibitory effects on downstream structures such as the ventral pallidum, hypothalamus or ventral tegmental area, and that in inhibiting {{abbr|MSNs|medium spiny neurons}} in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), these structures are excited, "releasing" reward related behavior.  While [[GABA receptor]] [[agonist]]s are capable of eliciting both "liking" and "wanting" reactions in the nucleus accumbens, glutaminergic inputs from the [[basolateral amygdala]], ventral hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex can drive incentive salience.  Furthermore, while most studies find that NAcc neurons reduce firing in response to reward, a number of studies find the opposite response.   This had led to the proposal of the disinhibition (or depolarization) hypothesis, that proposes that excitation or NAcc neurons, or at least certain subsets, drives reward related behavior.&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Castro 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castro|first1=DC|last2=Cole|first2=SL|last3=Berridge|first3=KC|title=Lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and ventral pallidum roles in eating and hunger: interactions between homeostatic and reward circuitry|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=90|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00090|pmid=26124708|pmc=4466441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlezon WA|first1=Jr|last2=Thomas|first2=MJ|title=Biological substrates of reward and aversion: a nucleus accumbens activity hypothesis|journal=Neuropharmacology|date=2009|volume=56 Suppl 1|pages=122–32|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.06.075|pmid=18675281|pmc=2635333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly 50 years of research on brain-stimulation reward, experts have certified that dozens of sites in the brain will maintain [[intracranial self-stimulation]]. Regions include the lateral hypothalamus and medial forebrain bundles, which are especially effective. Stimulation there activates fibers that form the ascending pathways; the ascending pathways include the [[mesolimbic dopamine pathway]], which projects from the ventral tegmental area to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. There are several explanations as to why the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is central to circuits mediating reward. First, there is a marked increase in dopamine release from the mesolimbic pathway when animals engage in intracranial self-stimulation.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt; Second, experiments consistently indicate that brain-stimulation reward stimulates the reinforcement of pathways that are normally activated by [[natural rewards]], and [[drug reward]] or intracranial self-stimulation can exert more powerful activation of central reward mechanisms because they activate the reward center directly rather than through the [[peripheral nerves]].&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise et al. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA, Rompre PP | title = Brain dopamine and reward | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 191–225 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2648975 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.40.020189.001203 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Brain reward circuitry: insights from unsensed incentives | journal = Neuron | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–240 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12383779 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00965-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, when animals are administered addictive drugs or engage in naturally rewarding behaviors, such as feeding or sexual activity, there is a marked release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kolb B, Whishaw IQ|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|date=2001|publisher=Worth|location=New York|isbn=9780716751694|pages=438–441|edition=1st|chapter=&lt;!-- placeholder --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dopamine is not the only reward compound in the brain.

--&gt;{{No selflink|Pleasure}} is a component of reward, but not all rewards are pleasurable (e.g., money does not elicit pleasure unless this response is conditioned).&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards in operant conditioning are positive reinforcers.&amp;nbsp;... Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... Third, rewards have a value component that determines the positively motivating effects of rewards and is not contained in, nor explained by, the sensory and attentional components (FIGURE 1, right). This component reflects behavioral preferences and thus is subjective and only partially determined by physical parameters. Only this component constitutes what we understand as a reward. It mediates the specific behavioral reinforcing, approach generating, and emotional effects of rewards that are crucial for the organism’s survival and reproduction, whereas all other components are only supportive of these functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards can also be intrinsic to behavior (31, 546, 547). They contrast with extrinsic rewards that provide motivation for behavior and constitute the essence of operant behavior in laboratory tests. Intrinsic rewards are activities that are pleasurable on their own and are undertaken for their own sake, without being the means for getting extrinsic rewards.&amp;nbsp;... Intrinsic rewards are genuine rewards in their own right, as they induce learning, approach, and pleasure, like perfectioning, playing, and enjoying the piano. Although they can serve to condition higher order rewards, they are not conditioned, higher order rewards, as attaining their reward properties does not require pairing with an unconditioned reward.&amp;nbsp;...  These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimuli that are naturally pleasurable, and therefore attractive, are known as ''intrinsic rewards'', whereas stimuli that are attractive and motivate approach behavior, but are not inherently pleasurable, are termed ''extrinsic rewards''.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;  Extrinsic rewards (e.g., money) are rewarding as a result of a [[associative learning|learned association]] with an intrinsic reward.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; In other words, extrinsic rewards function as motivational magnets that elicit "wanting", but not "liking" reactions once they have been acquired.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

The reward system contains {{if pagename|Reward system='''pleasure centers'''&amp;nbsp;or '''hedonic hotspots'''|other=[[pleasure centers]]&amp;nbsp;or [[hedonic hotspots]]}} – i.e., brain structures that mediate pleasure or "liking" reactions from intrinsic rewards. {{as of|2017|October|post=,}} hedonic hotspots have been identified in subcompartments within the [[nucleus accumbens shell]], [[ventral pallidum]], [[parabrachial nucleus]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC), and [[insular cortex]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C.

Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapping brain circuits"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richard JM, Castro DC, Difeliceantonio AG, Robinson MJ, Berridge KC | title = Mapping brain circuits of reward and motivation: in the footsteps of Ann Kelley | journal = Neurosci.

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&amp;nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.&lt;br /&gt;Cue-triggered 'wanting’ for the UCS&lt;br /&gt;A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.&lt;br /&gt;Cue as attractive motivational magnets&lt;br /&gt;When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers 'wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&amp;nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed 'wanting’ – CS-triggered pulses of intensified 'wanting’ for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed 'wanting’ – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book | author=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY, eds | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory.

Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience ("wanting") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of dopamine neurotransmission into the NAcc shell from the [[mesolimbic pathway]] is highly correlated with the magnitude of incentive salience for rewarding stimuli.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;

Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory (1993) proposed that ''reward'' contains separable psychological components: wanting (incentive) and liking (pleasure). To explain increasing contact with a certain stimulus such as chocolate, there are two independent factors at work – our desire to have the chocolate (wanting) and the pleasure effect of the chocolate (liking). According to Robinson and Berridge, wanting and liking are two aspects of the same process, so rewards are usually wanted and liked to the same degree. However, wanting and liking also change independently under certain circumstances. For example, rats that do not eat after receiving dopamine (experiencing a loss of desire for food) act as though they still like food. In another example, activated self-stimulation electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus of rats increase appetite, but also cause more adverse reactions to tastes such as sugar and salt; apparently, the stimulation increases wanting but not liking. Such results demonstrate that our reward system includes independent processes of wanting and liking. The wanting component is thought to be controlled by [[dopaminergic pathways]], whereas the liking component is thought to be controlled by opiate-benzodiazepine systems.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;

===Animals vs. humans===
Animals quickly learn to press a bar to obtain an injection of opiates directly into the [[midbrain tegmentum]] or the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The same animals do not work to obtain the opiates if the dopaminergic neurons of the [[mesolimbic pathway]] are inactivated. In this perspective, animals, like humans, engage in behaviors that increase dopamine release.

[[Kent C. Berridge|Kent Berridge]], a researcher in [[affective neuroscience]], found that sweet (''liked''&amp;thinsp;) and bitter (''disliked''&amp;thinsp;) tastes produced distinct [[Facial expression|orofacial expression]]s, and these expressions were similarly displayed by human newborns, orangutans, and rats. This was evidence that pleasure (specifically, ''liking'') has objective features and was essentially the same across various animal species. Most neuroscience studies have shown that the more dopamine released by the reward, the more effective the reward is. This is called the hedonic impact, which can be changed by the effort for the reward and the reward itself. Berridge discovered that blocking dopamine systems did not seem to change the positive reaction to something sweet (as measured by facial expression). In other words, the hedonic impact did not change based on the amount of sugar. This discounted the conventional assumption that dopamine mediates pleasure. Even with more-intense dopamine alterations, the data seemed to remain constant.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

Berridge developed the ''[[incentive salience]] hypothesis'' to address the ''wanting'' aspect of rewards. It explains the compulsive use of drugs by drug addicts even when the drug no longer produces euphoria, and the cravings experienced even after the individual has finished going through withdrawal. Some addicts respond to certain stimuli involving neural changes caused by drugs. This sensitization in the brain is similar to the effect of dopamine because ''wanting'' and ''liking'' reactions occur. Human and animal brains and behaviors experience similar changes regarding reward systems because these systems are so prominent.&lt;ref name="Berridge"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML|date=2008|title=Affective neuroscience of pleasure: reward in humans and animals|url=http://lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/publications/Berridge%20&amp;%20Kringelbach%20Affective%20neuroscience%20of%20pleasure%20Psychopharmacology%202008.pdf|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=199|issue=3|pages=457–480|doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1099-6|issn=0033-3158|access-date=20 October 2012|pmid=18311558|pmc=3004012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
{{Further|Associative learning}}
Rewarding stimuli can drive [[learning]] in both the form of [[classical conditioning|classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning)]] and [[operant conditioning|operant conditioning (instrumental conditioning)]]. In classical conditioning, a reward can act as an unconditioned stimulus that, when associated with the conditioned stimulus, causes the conditioned stimulus to elicit both musculoskeletal (in the form of simple approach and avoidance behaviors) and vegetative responses.  In operant conditioning, a reward may act as a [[reinforcer]] in that it increases or supports actions that lead to itself.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Learned behaviors may or may not be sensitive to the value of the outcomes they lead to; behaviors that are sensitive to the contingency of an outcome on the performance of an action as well as the outcome value are [[goal|goal-directed]], while  elicited actions that are insensitive to contingency or value are called [[habit]]s.&lt;ref name="Yinn 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=HH |last2=Ostlund |first2=SB |last3=Balleine |first3=BW |title=Reward-guided learning beyond dopamine in the nucleus accumbens: the integrative functions of cortico-basal ganglia networks |journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience |date=October 2008 |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1437–48 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06422.x |pmid=18793321 |pmc=2756656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is thought to reflected two forms of learning, model free and model based.  Model free learning involves the simple caching and updating of values.  In contrast, model based learning involves the storage and construction of an internal model of events that allows inference and flexible prediction. Although pavlovian conditioning is generally assumed to be model-free, the incentive salience assigned to a conditioned stimulus is flexible with regard to changes in internal motivational states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dayan |first1=P |last2=Berridge |first2=KC |title=Model-based and model-free Pavlovian reward learning: revaluation, revision, and revelation |journal=Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience |date=June 2014 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=473–92 |doi=10.3758/s13415-014-0277-8 |pmid=24647659 |pmc=4074442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct neural systems are responsible for learning associations between stimuli and outcomes, actions and outcomes, and stimuli and responses. Although classical conditioning is not limited to the reward system, the enhancement of instrumental performance by stimuli (i.e., [[Pavlovian-instrumental transfer]]) requires the nucleus accumbens. Habitual and goal directed instrumental learning are dependent upon the lateral [[striatum]] and the medial striatum, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yinn 2008"/&gt;

During instrumental learning, opposing changes in the ratio of [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] to [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] receptors and phosphorylated [[extracellular signal–regulated kinases|ERK]] occurs in the [[dopamine receptor D1|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type and [[dopamine receptor D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type MSNs that constitute the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop|direct and indirect pathways]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balleine |first1=BW |last2=Morris |first2=RW |last3=Leung |first3=BK |title=Thalamocortical integration of instrumental learning and performance and their disintegration in addiction |journal=Brain Research |date=2 December 2015 |volume=1628 |issue=Pt A |pages=104–16 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2014.12.023 |pmid=25514336 |quote=Importantly, we found evidence of increased activity in the direct pathway; both intracellular changes in the expression of the plasticity marker pERK and AMPA/NMDA ratios evoked by stimulating cortical afferents were increased in the D1-direct pathway neurons.

The intracellular cascade activated by D1 receptors involves the recruitment of [[protein kinase A]], and through resulting phosphorylation of [[DARPP-32]], the inhibition of phosphatases that deactivate ERK.  NMDA receptors activate ERK through a different but interrelated [[MAPK/ERK|Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway]].  Alone NMDA mediated activation of ERK is self-limited, as NMDA activation also inhibits PKA mediated inhibition of ERK deactivating phosphatases.  However, when D1 and NMDA cascades are co-activated, they work synergistically, and the resultant activation of ERK regulates synaptic plasticity in the form of spine restructuring, transport of AMPA receptors, regulation of [[CREB]], and increasing cellular excitability via inhibiting [[KCND2|Kv4.2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiflett |first1=MW |last2=Balleine |first2=BW |title=Molecular substrates of action control in cortico-striatal circuits |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |date=15 September 2011 |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.05.007 |pmid=21704115 |pmc=3175490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schultz |first1=W |title=Updating dopamine reward signals |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |date=April 2013 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=229–38 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2012.11.012 |pmid=23267662 |pmc=3866681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiflett |first1=MW |last2=Balleine |first2=BW |title=Contributions of ERK signaling in the striatum to instrumental learning and performance |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |date=17 March 2011 |volume=218 |issue=1 |pages=240–7 |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2010.12.010 |pmid=21147168 |pmc=3022085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Skinner box scheme 01.png|right|thumb|250px|Skinner box]]
The first clue to the presence of a reward system in the brain came with an accident discovery by James Olds and Peter Milner in 1954. They discovered that rats would perform behaviors such as pressing a bar, to administer a brief burst of electrical stimulation to specific sites in their brains. This phenomenon is called [[intracranial self-stimulation]] or [[brain stimulation reward]]. Typically, rats will press a lever hundreds or thousands of times per hour to obtain this brain stimulation, stopping only when they are exhausted. While trying to teach rats how to solve problems and run mazes, stimulation of certain regions of the brain where the stimulation was found seemed to give pleasure to the animals. They tried the same thing with humans and the results were similar. The explanation to why animals engage in a behavior that has no value to the survival of either themselves or their species is that the brain stimulation is activating the system underlying reward.&lt;ref name="pmid8833446"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Addictive drugs and brain stimulation reward | journal = Annu.

In a fundamental discovery made in 1954, researchers [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner found that low-voltage electrical stimulation of certain regions of the brain of the rat acted as a reward in teaching the animals to run mazes and solve problems.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409709/human-nervous-system/75649/Reward-and-punishment?anchor=ref942262 |title=human nervous system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps02.html |title=Positive Reinforcement Produced by Electrical Stimulation of Septal Area and Other Regions of Rat Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed that stimulation of those parts of the brain gave the animals pleasure,&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; and in later work humans reported pleasurable sensations from such stimulation. When rats were tested in [[Skinner box]]es where they could stimulate the reward system by pressing a lever, the rats pressed for hours.&lt;ref name="work" /&gt; Research in the next two decades established that [[dopamine]] is one of the main chemicals aiding neural signaling in these regions, and [[dopamine]] was suggested to be the brain's "pleasure chemical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Morten-L-Kringelbach/2010/06/25/the-functional-neuroanatomy-of-pleasure-and-happiness/ |title=The Functional Neuroanatomy of Pleasure and Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] was a psychologist who used the reward system to study [[classical conditioning]]. Pavlov used the reward system by rewarding dogs with food after they had heard a bell or another stimulus. Pavlov was rewarding the dogs so that the dogs associated food, the reward, with the bell, the stimulus.&lt;ref name=PavlovAnrep2003&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ivan Petrovich Pavlov|author2=G. V.

Edward L. Thorndike used the reward system to study operant conditioning. He began by putting cats in a puzzle box and placing food outside of the box so that the cat wanted to escape. The cats worked to get out of the puzzle box to get to the food. Although the cats ate the food after they escaped the box, Thorndike learned that the cats attempted to escape the box without the reward of food. Thorndike used the rewards of food and freedom to stimulate the reward system of the cats. Thorndike used this to see how the cats learned to escape the box.&lt;ref name="Fridlund 2014"&gt;Fridlund, Alan and James Kalat. Mind and Brain, the Science of Psychology.

[[&amp;Delta;FosB]] (DeltaFosB) – a [[gene transcription factor]] – [[overexpression]] in the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s of the [[nucleus accumbens]] is the ''crucial'' common factor among virtually all forms of addiction (i.e., [[behavioral addiction]]s and [[drug addiction]]s) that induces addiction-related behavior and [[neural plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /&gt; In particular, ΔFosB promotes [[self-administration]], [[reward sensitization]], and reward cross-sensitization effects among specific addictive drugs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olsen CM | title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 1109–1122 |date=December 2011  | pmid = 21459101 | pmc = 3139704 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010 | quote =  Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that gambling (Breiter et al, 2001), shopping (Knutson et al, 2007), orgasm (Komisaruk et al, 2004), playing video games (Koepp et al, 1998; Hoeft et al, 2008) and the sight of appetizing food (Wang et al, 2004a) activate many of the same brain regions (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic system and extended amygdala) as drugs of abuse (Volkow et al, 2004).&amp;nbsp;... Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&amp;nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&amp;nbsp;...

&lt;!-- This paragraph needs copyediting (done July 2017) + updated references --&gt;
The [[lateral hypothalamus]] and [[medial forebrain bundle]] has been the most-frequently-studied brain-stimulation reward site, particularly in studies of the effects of drugs on brain stimulation reward.&lt;ref name="Roy A. Wise 1998"&gt;Roy A. Wise, Drug-activation of brain reward pathways, ''Drug and Alcohol Dependence'' 1998; 51  13–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The neurotransmitter system that has been most-clearly identified with the habit-forming actions of drugs-of-abuse is the mesolimbic dopamine system, with its [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] targets in the nucleus accumbens and its local GABAergic [[wikt:afferent|afferents]]. The reward-relevant actions of amphetamine and cocaine are in the dopaminergic synapses of the nucleus accumbens and perhaps the [[medial prefrontal cortex]]. Rats also learn to lever-press for cocaine injections into the medial prefrontal cortex, which works by increasing dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goeders N.E., Smith J.E. | year = 1983 | title = Cortical dopaminergic involvement in cocaine reinforcement | url = | journal = Science | volume = 221 | issue = 4612| pages = 773–775 | doi=10.1126/science.6879176| bibcode = 1983Sci...221..773G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goeders N.E., Smith J.E. | year = 1993 | title = Intracranial cocaine self-administration into the medial prefrontal cortex increases dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens | url = | journal = J.

For opiates, the lowest-threshold site for reward effects involves actions on GABAergic neurons in the [[ventral tegmental area]], a secondary site of opiate-rewarding actions on medium spiny output neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Thus GABAergic [[wikt:afferent|afferent]]s to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (primary substrate of opiate reward), the mesolimbic dopamine neurons themselves (primary substrate of psychomotor stimulant reward), and GABAergic efferents to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (a secondary site of opiate reward) form the core of currently characterized drug-reward circuitry.&lt;ref name="Roy A. Wise 1998"/&gt;

===Motivation===
{{Main|Motivational salience}}

Dysfunctional motivational salience appears in a number of psychiatric symptoms and disorders.  [[Anhedonia]], traditionally defined as a reduced capacity to feel pleasure, has been reexamined as reflecting blunted incentive salience, as most anhedonic populations exhibit intact “liking”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rømer Thomsen |first1=K |last2=Whybrow |first2=PC |last3=Kringelbach |first3=ML |title=Reconceptualizing anhedonia: novel perspectives on balancing the pleasure networks in the human brain |journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience |date=2015 |volume=9 |pages=49 |doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00049 |pmid=25814941 |pmc=4356228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomsen |first1=KR |title=Measuring anhedonia: impaired ability to pursue, experience, and learn about reward |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |date=2015 |volume=6 |pages=1409 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01409 |pmid=26441781 |pmc=4585007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other end of the spectrum, heightened incentive salience that is narrowed for specific stimuli is characteristic of behavioral and drug addictions.  In the case of fear or paranoia, dysfunction may lie in elevated [[aversive salience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olney |first1=JJ |last2=Warlow |first2=SM |last3=Naffziger |first3=EE |last4=Berridge |first4=KC |title=Current perspectives on incentive salience and applications to clinical disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=August 2018 |volume=22 |pages=59–69 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.007 |pmid=29503841 |pmc=5831552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroimaging studies across diagnoses associated with anhedonia have reported reduced activity in the OFC and ventral striatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Preda |first1=Adrian |editor1-last=Ritsner |editor1-first=Michael |title=Anhedonia : a comprehensive handbook |date=2014 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-017-8590-7 |chapter=Brain Imaging Correlates of Anhedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One meta analysis reported anhedonia was associated with reduced neural response to reward anticipation in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=B |last2=Lin |first2=P |last3=Shi |first3=H |last4=Öngür |first4=D |last5=Auerbach |first5=RP |last6=Wang |first6=X |last7=Yao |first7=S |last8=Wang |first8=X |title=Mapping anhedonia-specific dysfunction in a transdiagnostic approach: an ALE meta-analysis |journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior |date=September 2016 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=920–39 |doi=10.1007/s11682-015-9457-6 |pmid=26487590 |pmc=4838562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood Disorders====
Depression is associated with reduced motivation, as assessed by willingness to expend effort for reward.  These abnormalities have been tentatively linked to reduced activity in areas of the striatum, and while dopaminergic abnormalities are hypothesized to play a role, most studies probing dopamine function in depression have reported inconsistent results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Treadway |first1=Michael, T. |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-first=Eleanor H. |editor2-last=Balsam |editor2-first=Peter D. |title=Behavioral Neuroscience of Motivation (Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences) |date=2016 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |location=Switzerland |isbn=978-3-319-26933-7 |page=343 |edition=1st |chapter=The Neurobiology of Motivational Deficits in Depression— An Update on Candidate Pathomechanisms |quote=In a relatively recent literature, studies of motivation and reinforcement in depression have been largely consistent in detecting differences as compared to healthy controls (Whitton et al. 2015). In several studies using the effort expenditure for reward task (EEfRT), patients with MDD expended less effort for rewards when compared with controls (Treadway et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salamone |first1=JD |last2=Yohn |first2=SE |last3=López-Cruz |first3=L |last4=San Miguel |first4=N |last5=Correa |first5=M |title=Activational and effort-related aspects of motivation: neural mechanisms and implications for psychopathology |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology |date=May 2016 |volume=139 |issue=Pt 5 |pages=1325–47 |doi=10.1093/brain/aww050 |pmid=27189581 |pmc=5839596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although postmortem and neuroimaging studies have found abnormalities in numerous regions of the reward system, few findings are consistently replicated.  Some studies have reported reduced NAcc, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity, as well as elevated [[basolateral amygdala]] and [[Brodmann area 25|subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC)]] activity during tasks related to reward or positive stimuli. These neuroimaging abnormalities are complimented by little post mortem research, but what little research has been done suggests reduced excitatory synapses in the mPFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Russo |first1=SJ |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |title=The brain reward circuitry in mood disorders |journal=Nature Reviews.

Attempts to investigate underlying neural circuitry in animal models has also yielded conflicting results.  Two paradigms are commonly used to simulate depression, chronic social defeat (CSDS), and chronic mild stress (CMS), although many exist. CSDS produces reduced preference for sucrose, reduced social interactions, and increased immobility in the forced swim test.  CMS similarly reduces sucrose preference, and behavioral despair as assessed by tail suspension and forced swim tests.  Animals susceptible to CSDS exhibit increased phasic VTA firing, and inhibition of VTA-NAcc projections attenuates behavioral deficits induced by CSDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=JJ |last2=Han |first2=MH |title=The heterogeneity of ventral tegmental area neurons: Projection functions in a mood-related context |journal=Neuroscience |date=12 December 2014 |volume=282 |pages=101–8 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.06.006 |pmid=24931766 |pmc=4339667}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, inhibition of VTA-{{abbr|mPFC|medial prefrontal cortex}} projections exacerbates social withdrawal.  On the other hand, CMS associated reductions in sucrose preference and immobility were attenuated and exacerbated by VTA excitation and inhibition, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lammel |first1=S |last2=Lim |first2=BK |last3=Malenka |first3=RC |title=Reward and aversion in a heterogeneous midbrain dopamine system |journal=Neuropharmacology |date=January 2014 |volume=76 Pt B |pages=351–9 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.03.019 |pmid=23578393 |pmc=3778102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knowland |first1=D |last2=Lim |first2=BK |title=Circuit-based frameworks of depressive behaviors: The role of reward circuitry and beyond |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |date=5 January 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2017.12.010 |pmid=29309799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these differences may be attributable to different stimulation protocols or poor translational paradigms, variable results may also lie in the heterogenous functionality of reward related regions.&lt;ref name="Lammel2014b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lammel |first1=S |last2=Tye |first2=KM |last3=Warden |first3=MR |title=Progress in understanding mood disorders: optogenetic dissection of neural circuits |journal=Genes, Brain, and Behavior |date=January 2014 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=38–51 |doi=10.1111/gbb.12049 |pmid=23682971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optogenetic]] stimulation of the mPFC as a whole produces antidepressant effects.  This effect appears localized to the rodent homologue of the pgACC (the prelimbic cortex), as stimulation of the rodent homologue of the sgACC (the infralimbic cortex) produces no behavioral effects.  Furthermore, deep brain stimulation in the infralimbic cortex, which is thought to have an inhibitory effect, also produces an antidepressant effect.  This finding is congruent with the observation that pharmacological inhibition of the infralimbic cortex attenuates depressive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lammel2014b"/&gt;

====Schizophrenia====

Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in motivation, commonly grouped under other negative symptoms such as [[alogia|reduced spontaneous speech]].  The experience of “liking” is frequently reported to be intact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bucci |first1=P |last2=Galderisi |first2=S |title=Categorizing and assessing negative symptoms |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |date=May 2017 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=201–208 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000322 |pmid=28212174 |quote=They also provide a separate assessment of the consummatory anhedonia (reduced experience of pleasure derived from ongoing enjoyable activities) and anticipatory anhedonia (reduced ability to anticipate future pleasure). In fact, the former one seems to be relatively intact in schizophrenia, whereas the latter one seems to be impaired [32 – 34]. However, discrepant data have also been reported [35].}}&lt;/ref&gt; both behaviorally and neurally, although results may be specific to certain stimuli, such as monetary rewards.{{sfn|Young|2018|215a|ps=,"Several recent reviews (e.g., Cohen and Minor, 2010) have found that individuals with schizophrenia show relatively intact self-reported emotional responses to affect-eliciting stimuli as well as other indicators of intact response...A more mixed picture arises from functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to other types of pleasurable stimuli in schizophrenia (Paradiso et al., 2003)"}}  Furthermore, implicit learning and simple reward related tasks are also intact in schizophrenia.{{sfn|Young|2018|215b|ps=,"As such it is surprising that behavioral studies have suggested that reinforcement learning is intact in schizophrenia when learning is relatively implicit (though, see Siegert et al., 2008 for evidence of impaired Serial Reaction Time task learning), but more impaired when explicit representations of stimulus-reward contingencies are needed (see Gold et al., 2008). This pattern has given rise to the theory that the striatally mediated gradual reinforcement learning system may be intact in schizophrenia, while more rapid, on-line, cortically mediated learning systems are impaired."}}  Rather, deficits in the reward system present during reward related tasks that are cognitively complex.  These deficits are associated with both abnormal striatal and OFC activity, as well as abnormalities in regions associated with cognitive functions such as the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (dlPFC).{{sfn|Young|2018|216|ps =, "We have recently shown that individuals with schizophrenia can show improved cognitive control performance when information about rewards are externally presented but not when they must be internally maintained (Mann et al., 2013), with some evidence for impairments in DLPFC and striatal activation during internal maintenance of reward information being associated with individuals’ differences in motivation (Chung and Barch, 2016)."}}

'''SWOQe''' is a new method of [[strategic planning]] which derived from [[SWOT analysis|SWOT]]. SWOQe contains the same letters S, W and O with their meanings from SWOT Analysis involved in a [[project]] or in a [[business]] venture. SWOQe can be defined as Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and most importantly Quality evaluation  as a part of analysis. SWOQe and SWOT differ in just one element. SWOQe does emphasize on Quality evaluation in end while SWOT on Threats in end. SWOQe method of analysis came into existence recently from an analysis where Threat was not there or not important as Quality evaluation was.

where Ric is the [[Ricci tensor]], ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], ''g'' is the [[Riemannian metric]], &lt;math&gt;J=\frac{1}{2(n-1)}R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] of ''P'' and ''n'' is the dimension of the manifold.

The [[Weyl tensor]] equals the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] minus the [[Kulkarni&amp;ndash;Nomizu product]] of the Schouten tensor with the metric. In an index notation

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ijkl}=W_{ijkl}+g_{ik} P_{jl}-g_{jk} P_{il}-g_{il} P_{jk}+g_{jl} P_{ik}\, . &lt;/math&gt;

The Schouten tensor often appears in [[conformal geometry]] because of its relatively simple conformal transformation law

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\mapsto \Omega^2 g_{ij} \Rightarrow P_{ij}\mapsto P_{ij}-\nabla_i \Upsilon_j + \Upsilon_i \Upsilon_j -\frac12 \Upsilon_k \Upsilon^k g_{ij}\, , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Upsilon_i := \Omega^{-1} \partial_i \Omega\, . &lt;/math&gt;

'''Scottish Common Sense Realism''', also known as the '''Scottish School of Common Sense''',&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=George|title=Dominant themes of modern philosophy: a history|publisher=Ronald Press Co|location=New York|year=1957|pages=660|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-AYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22&amp;dq=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] school of [[philosophy]] that originated in the ideas of Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]], and [[Dugald Stewart]] during the 18th-century [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Reid emphasized man's innate ability to perceive common ideas and that this process is inherent in and interdependent with judgement. Common sense therefore, is the foundation of philosophical inquiry. Though best remembered for its opposition to the pervasive philosophy of [[David Hume]], Scottish Common Sense philosophy is influential and evident in the works of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and late 18th-century American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Towsey|first=Mark|title='Philosophically Playing the Devil' recovering readers' responses to David Hume and the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Historical Research|date=May 2010|volume=23|issue=220|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00503.x|pages=301–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Lucille M.|title=Uncovering the Significance of the Animal Imagery in Modern Chivalry: An Application of Common Sense Realism|journal=Early American Literature|date=December 1, 1979/80|volume=14|issue=3|pages=308–309|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a56bf090-21e9-4d55-8576-9b02e851b927%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=124|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]]]
The Scottish School of Common Sense was an [[epistemological]] philosophy that flourished in Scotland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots can be found in responses to the writings of such philosophers as [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and its most prominent members were [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Philosophically, Scottish Realism served as a rebuttal to scepticism while keeping with the influential teachings of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; While largely understated for many years,&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; the influence it had on philosophers elsewhere in Europe, not to mention in the United States, is of a considerable magnitude.

One central concern of the school was to defend "common sense" against philosophical [[paradox]] and [[scepticism]]. It argued that common-sense beliefs govern the lives and thoughts even of those who avow non-commonsensical beliefs and that matters of common sense are inherent to the acquisition of knowledge. The qualities of its works were not generally consistent; [[Edward S. Reed]] writes, e.g., "[Whereas] Thomas Reid wished to use common sense to develop philosophical wisdom, much of this school simply wanted to use common sense to attack any form of intellectual change."&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Reed, The Necessity of Experience, p. 16. Yale University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
The Scottish School of Common Sense was founded by Reid in opposition to [[Descartes]]'s  [[Idealism|Theory of Ideas]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Thomas (1997). An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press LTD. pp. xii-xxiii. {{ISBN|0748607226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the epistemology of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] led [[John Locke]] and David Hume to a skeptical philosophy that realists found absurd and contrary to common experience. Thus Hume and his sceptical argument would serve as the primary foil to the development of Reid's philosophy. Under the tutelage of [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]], Reid embraced the tenets of Providential Naturalism and its four interconnected tenets; using these as the basis for his refutation of the theory of ideas.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt; Reid painstakingly developed his treatise ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' over the course of 40 years, often seeking the input of his contemporary philosophers within the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] including Hume.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

Reid articulated the basic principle of Common Sense Realism:

:"If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid'' (2004) p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Common Sense Realism is rooted in Aristotelian thought and advocates an empirical and scientific philosophy wherein trust of our senses is implicit and necessary.&lt;ref name=Haldan&gt;Haldane, John (2007 April). "Scottish Philosophy". Monism 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} The principles of common sense are fundamental to our accumulation of knowledge of both [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and physical constructs.&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; However, observation alone cannot account for all knowledge and truth can be garnered by reflection.&lt;ref name=Haldan /&gt;{{rp|149}} In Reid's own words:

:"I can likewise conceive an individual object that really exists, such as [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Church]] in London. I have an idea of it; I conceive it. The immediate object of this conception is 400 miles distant; and I have no reason to think it acts upon me or that I act on it."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Thomas. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysonintellec02reiduoft#page/n7/mode/2up Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man]. Dublin: Ireland. Essay IV  p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The school taught that every person had ordinary experiences that provided intuitively certain assurance of a) the existence of the self, b) the existence of real objects that could be seen and felt; and c) certain "first principles" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. These principles laid the foundation for Reid's influential theory of perception.

In practice, philosophers of the Scottish school offered scientific explanations to historical events and advocated an unprejudiced and inter-disciplinary approach to education, free from religious and patriotic biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirayes|first=J. Rubén Valdés|title=The Prejudices of Education: Educational Aspects of the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Atlantis|year=2005|volume=27|issue=2|page=101|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5217a8a1-eb47-4963-a2f9-2f3fa8f0e59c%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=8&amp;hid=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plassart|first=Anna|title="Scientific Whigs"?

===Theories of perception===
Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart offered related theories of perception rooted in Scottish Common Sense Realism. According to [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] of [[Yale University]], Reid's philosophy can be non-contentiously reduced to four basic precepts:
:"(1) The objects of acts of perception are external objects-That is, mind-independent spatially-located entities;
: (2) The necessary and sufficient condition for perceiving an external object is that the object cause in one a conception thereof and an immediate (non-inferential) belief about it;
: (3) We human beings are so made that, in perception, the external object causes a conception of, and an immediate belief about, itself, by way of causing a sensation which in turn causes ('suggests') the conception and immediate belief;
: (4) The sensation may cause, and often does in fact cause, the conception and belief without one's being sufficiently attentive to the sensation for a belief about it to be formed in one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolterstorff|first=Nicholas|title=What Sort of Epistemological Realist was Thomas Reid?|journal=Journal of Scottish Philosophy|date=Autumn 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pages=111–112|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=9199cefe-9180-47a6-9e3d-6c43223696fa%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=123&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=23131624|doi=10.3366/jsp.2006.4.2.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dugald Stewart's theory of perception acknowledges a great influence from Reid whose philosophy he termed "fundamental laws of belief.".&lt;ref name=Dabney&gt;Townsend, Dabney (April 2007). [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5217a8a1-eb47-4963-a2f9-2f3fa8f0e59c%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=123 "Dugald Stewart on Beauty and Taste"] Monist 90 (2 p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stewart proffered a more moderate approach to realism and his theory of perception emphasized the utility of the senses.&lt;ref name=Dabney /&gt;

==Influence==
Common Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought in the 19th century, it had a major influence as well in France, the United States, and other countries. [[Victor Cousin]] (1792–1867) was the most important proponent in France. Reidian thought was the "orthodox philosophy of colleges and universities"&lt;ref name=redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=9199cefe-9180-47a6-9e3d-6c43223696fa%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123 | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 18th century and provided an intellectual bedrock for the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; 

===The Founding Fathers===
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', a painting by [[John Trumbull]] depicting the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] to the Congress on 28 June 1776. Trumbull's painting appears on the reverse of the [[United States two-dollar bill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html americanrevolution.org] – Key to Trumbull's picture&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Common Sense Realism swept American intellectual circles in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Daniel (April 2007). "The Scottish Enlightenment and the American Founding". Monist 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} Reid's philosophy was pervasive during the [[American Revolution]] and served as a stabilizing philosophical influence.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|180}}  Hailed by some as the "father of modern psychiatry,"&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|173}} [[Benjamin Rush]]'s tutelage at the [[University of Edinburgh]] imbued him with strong realist tendencies which influenced much of his scientific and political work including his moral opposition to slavery.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|174}}  Evidence of the influence of Scottish Common Sense realism can readily be found in the philosophy of both [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]]. Adams compared the contributions of Dugald Stewart favorably to works of [[Aristotle]] and [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|170}} Scotsman and signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[John Witherspoon]] presided over [[Princeton University]]; students under his tutelage included 12 state governors, 55 delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and future president [[James Madison]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|171}} His education at the University of Edinburgh made him a strong proponent of the Scottish Enlightenment and Realism. [[James McCosh]] (1811–94) continued the influence of Scottish Realism at Princeton when he became president of the university in 1868, reviving its influence as a major stronghold of the movement. [[Noah Porter]] (1811–92) taught Common Sense realism to generations of students at Yale.

===Fundamentalism===
[[File:Princeton Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|right|Princeton Seminary in the 1800s]]
Scottish Realism greatly influenced conservative religious thought and was strongest at [[Princeton Seminary]] until the Seminary moved in new directions after 1929. The Princeton theologians built their elaborate system on the basis of "common-sense" realism, biblicism and confessionalism.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Livingston and Francis Schüssler Fiorenza, ''Modern Christian Thought: The Enlightenment and the nineteenth century'' (2006) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; James McCosh was brought from Queen's College, Belfast, to Princeton College's Chair of Moral Philosophy and Presidency because of his book "The Method of Divine Government," a Christian philosophy that was precursory to Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" (1859). The [[Princeton Theologians]] followed McCosh to adopt a stance of theistic evolution. They tried to persuade [[John Gresham Machen]] (1881–1937), a leader of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|the Fundamentalists]] in the 1920s, but he would not stand with McCosh, nor could he stand for the shift the school was making. Therefore, he and a number of other Princeton faculty members left and started [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia. This, however, did not stop McCosh from moving forward. It was his goal to develop Princeton as a Christian university in North America, as well as a forefront intellectual seminary of the Presbyterian Church.  The faculty of the College and Seminary included both evolutionary thinkers and non-evolutionary thinkers. Much evangelical theology of the 21st century is based on Princeton theology and thus reflects Common Sense Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz, Brian McLaren, John R. Franke, ''Renewing the center: evangelical theology in a post-theological era'' (2006) pp 79, 177&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar Grant Osborne concludes that Scottish Common Sense Realism influenced biblical hermeneutics, that the surface level understanding of Scripture became popular, and individualistic interpretations abounded.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R. Osborne, The Hermeneutical Spiral: A Comprehensive Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Rev. and expanded, 2nd ed. (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2006), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-realization''' is an expression used in Western [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[spirituality]]; and in [[Indian religions]]. In the Western understanding it is the "fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality."&lt;ref name=SR/&gt; In the Indian understanding, self-realization is [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|liberating knowledge]] of the true Self, either as the permanent undying Atman, or as the absence (''sunyata'') of such a permanent Self.

==Western understanding==
Merriam Webster's dictionary defines self-realization as:
{{quote|Fulfillment by oneself of the possibilities of one's character or personality.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-realization |title=Self-realization|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Western world "self-realization" has gained great popularity. Influential in this popularity were psycho-analysis, humanistic psychology, the growing acquaintance with Eastern religions, and the growing popularity of Western [[esotericism]].

===Psychoanalysis===
Though [[Sigmund Freud]] was skeptical of religion and esotericism, his theories have had a lasting influence on Western thought and self-understanding. His notion of repressed memories, though based on false assumptions, has become part of mainstream thought.{{sfn|Webster|1996}}

Freud's ideas were further developed by his students and neo-psycho-analysts. [[Carl Jung]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[Winnicott]] have been especially important in the Western understanding of the self. But other alternatives have also been developed.

Jung developed the notion of [[individuation]], the lifelong process in which the centre of psychological life shifts from the ego to the self.

Erikson described human development throughout the life-span in his [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|theory of psychosocial development]].

[[Winnicott]] developed the notion of the [[True self and false self|true self]].

Roberto Assagioli developed his approach of [[Psychosynthesis]], an original approach to psychology.

===Western esotericism===
Western [[esotericism]] integrates a broad variety of traditions, some of which view self-realization as the ultimate goal of a human being.{{who|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Indian religions==
===Jainism===
[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest world philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Individual conscience and individual consciousness are central in the [[Jain philosophy]]. Self-realisation is one of the major pre-requisites to attain ultimate enlightenment and liberation ([[moksha]]). Self-realisation means peeling away fabricated layers of own personality to understand the true self and hence the true nature of reality. In Jainism, [[karma]] is portrayed as invisible particles of subtle matter that adhere to a living organism or [[Jiva]]. These particles come together to form a film of negativity and darkness around the soul that obscures the true consciousness; making the Jiva lose touch with its original essence as a [[soul]]. These karmic particles tend to attract more such particles which cause the inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul ([[Āsrava]]), leading the organism to fall into the bondage of lust, worldly pleasures, ego, hatred, jealousy, anger, etc. Thus self-realisation paves the way to simply reverse this process and help the seeker to decipher the absolute truth on its own. Jainism firmly rejects the belief of a creator, and one being is solely responsible for his thoughts, actions, and their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIgqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=self+realisation+Jainism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD8-qum9TcAhWVWysKHZA3CTMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=self%20realisation%20Jainism&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/is-self-realisation-possible-in-present-times-4002.htm|title=Is Self-realisation Possible in Present Times?|author=|date=|website=www.shrimadrajchandramission.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Samyak+darshan+Samyak+gnana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtx9eU3s7ZAhVTObwKHc6sDnQQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Samyak%20darshan%20Samyak%20gnana&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Expert needed|Hinduism

In [[Hinduism]], self-realization (''[[Atman jnana|atma-jnana]]'' or ''atmabodha'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%A7-meaning-in-english.words?amp=1|title=आत्मबोध|last=|first=|date=|website=dict.hinkhoj.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is knowledge of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|true self]] beyond both delusion and identification with material phenomena. It refers to self-identification and not mere ego identification{{Clarify|reason=|date=August 2018}}.

====Shaivism====
In  [[Shaivism]], self-realization is the direct knowing of the Self God [[Parashiva]]. Self-realization ([[nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]], which means "ecstasy without form or seed," or asamprajñata samādhi) is considered the ultimate spiritual attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/glossary_c.html|title=Glossary - "Self Realization"|last=Sivaya|first=Subramuniyaswami|last3=|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Self-realization is considered the gateway to [[moksha]], liberation/freedom from rebirth. This state is attained when the [[Kundalini]] force pierces through the [[Sahasrara|Sahasrara chakra]] at the crown of the head. The realization of Self, [[Parashiva]], considered to be each soul's destiny, is attainable through renunciation, sustained meditation and preventing the germination of future [[karma]] (the phrase "frying the seeds of karma" is often used)&lt;ref&gt;Veeraswamy Krishnaraj, ''The Bhagavad-Gita: Translation and Commentary'' pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/dancing-with-siva/web/ch01_05.html|title=Dancing with Siva|last=Subramuniyaswami|first=Sivaya|publisher=Himalayan academy|year=1997|isbn=9780945497974|location=USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advaita Vedanta====
Ātman is the [[first principle]] in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. (2010), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Cosimo Classics, pp. 86-87. {{ISBN|1-61640-240-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]]. Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===Buddhism===
{{main|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}

Since [[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a separate self, as explicated in the teachings of [[anatman]] and [[sunyata]], self-realization is a ''contradictio in terminis'' for Buddhism. Though the [[tathagatagarbha|tathagatagarbha-teachings]] seem to teach the existence of a separate self, they point to the inherent possibility of attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], not to the existence of a separate self. The [[dharmadhatu|dharmadhatu-teachings]] make this even more clear: reality is an undivided whole; awakening is the realization of this whole.

===Sikhism===
{{main|Sikh philosophy}}

[[Sikhism]] propounds the philosophy of Self-realization. This is possible by "aatam-cheennea"&lt;ref&gt;[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], page 375&lt;/ref&gt; or "Aap Pashaanae", purifying the self from the false ego:&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P.1056&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'Atam-cheene' is self-analysis, which is gained by peeping into one's self in the light of the teachings of ''[[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]''. It is the process of evaluating and analyzing oneself on the touchstone of 'naam simran' which if practised, pierces into the self and washes it from within. The filth of too much of materialism goes, the self gets purified and the mind comes in 'charhdi kala/higher state of mind". This means that the self should be assessed, examined and purified, leading to self-realization and the purification of our mind. Once purified the mind helps in ushering in oneness with the Super Power as the Guru says, "Atam-cheen bhae nirankari" (SGGS:P. 415) which means that one gets attuned to the Formless Lord through self-realization. Indirectly it means that self-realization leads to God-realization.{{sfn|Majhail (Dr.)|2010|p=272}}}}

[[Guru Nanak]] says,
{{quote|Those who realize their self get immersed in the Lord Himself.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 421&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|He who realizes his self, comes to know the essence.&lt;ref&gt;SGGS: P. 224&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Linguistics}}

'''Speech''' is human vocal [[communication]] using [[language]]. Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[Speech_act|speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation_(linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[Loudness|loudness]], [[Tempo|tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent_(sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol_intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[Trance|trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.  

Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[Prayer|prayer]] or in [[Meditation|meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[Mantra|mantra]]).

Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]].  
Speech compares with [[written language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]]. 

The evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[Sign_language|sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

== Production ==
{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}

Speech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|date=|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Kieth|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425–442|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.

Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}

Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11–46|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|date=|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–490|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|pages=185–238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|date=|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition==
{{main|Speech repetition}}

In speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems involving speech==
{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}

There are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:

#Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.
#Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.
#Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.
#Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].
#In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.

==Brain physiology==

=== The classical model ===
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]

The classical or [[Wernicke–Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2005). "Wernicke--GeschwindModel". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hillis, A. E., &amp; Caramazza, A. (2005). "Aphasia". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to)|publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co|year=1995|isbn=90-272-1893-5|volume=4|location=Amsterdam|pages=69–89|chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875)|author=Wernicke K.|editor=Paul Eling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or [[receptive aphasia]], which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or [[Jargon aphasia|jargon speech]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern research ===
Modern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. &lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension. Damage to the left [[lateral sulcus]] has been connected with difficulty in processing and producing morphology and syntax, while lexical access and comprehension of irregular forms (e.g. eat-ate) remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of Speech: from sound to meaning.|last=Tyler|first=Lorraine K.|last2=Marslen-Wilson|first2=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-956131-5|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brian C.

Moreover, the circuits involved in human speech comprehension dynamically adapt with learning, for example, by becoming more efficient in terms of processing time when listening to familiar messages such as learned verses&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Manufacturing==
In the Kraft Process, high [[alkalinity]] and [[temperature]] converts the esters and carboxylic acids in [[rosin]] into soluble sodium [[soap]]s of [[lignin]], rosin, and [[fatty acid]]s. The spent cooking liquor is called weak [[black liquor]] and is about 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a [[Evaporator#Multiple-effect evaporators|multiple effect evaporator]] and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20–30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to [[Flotation process|float]] in the storage tank for the weak or intermediate liquors and are [[Skimmer (machine)|skimmed]] off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2–0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called ''raw rosin soap'' or ''rosinate''. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to [[Settling|settle]] or is [[centrifuge]]d to release as much as possible of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the ''acidulator'' where it is heated and [[acidified]] with [[sulfuric acid]] to produce ''crude tall oil'' (CTO).

The soap skimming and acidulator operation can be improved by addition of [[flocculant]]s. A flocculant will shorten the separation time and give a cleaner soap with lower viscosity. This makes the acidulator run smoother as well.

Most pines give a soap yield of 5–25&amp;nbsp;kg/ton pulp, while [[Scots pine]] gives 20–50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Scots pine grown in northern Scandinavia give a yield of even more than 50&amp;nbsp;kg/ton. Globally about 2 mill ton/year of CTO are refined.&lt;ref name="gull"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{see also|Resin acid}}
The composition of crude tall oil varies a great deal, depending on the type of wood used. A common quality measure for tall oil is [[acid number]]. With pure [[pine]]s it is possible to have acid numbers in the range 160–165, while mills using a mix of [[softwood]]s and [[hardwood]]s might give acid numbers in the range of 125–135.&lt;ref name="gull" /&gt;

Normally crude tall oil contains [[rosin]]s (which contains [[resin acid]]s (mainly [[abietic acid]] and its [[isomer]]s), [[fatty acid]]s (mainly [[palmitic acid]], [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]]) and [[fatty alcohol]]s, [[unsaponifiable]] [[sterol]]s (5–10%), some [[sterol]]s, and other [[alkyl]] [[hydrocarbon]] derivates.&lt;ref name="bier" /&gt;

By [[fractional distillation]] ''tall oil rosin'' is obtained, with rosin content reduced to 10–35%. By further reduction of the rosin content to 1–10%, ''tall oil fatty acid'' (''TOFA'') can be obtained, which is cheap, consists mostly of [[oleic acid]], and is a source of volatile fatty acids.

==Applications==
The tall oil rosin finds use as a component of [[adhesive]]s, [[rubber]]s, and [[ink]]s, and as an [[emulsifier]]. The [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] is used as a [[binder (material)|binder]] in cement, an adhesive, and an [[emulsifier]] for [[asphalt]].

TOFA is a low-cost and [[vegetarian]] lifestyle-friendly alternative to [[tallow]] fatty acids for production of [[soap]]s and [[lubricant]]s. When esterified with [[pentaerythritol]], it is used as a compound of [[adhesive]]s and oil-based [[varnish]]es. When reacted with amines, polyamidoamines are produced which may be used as [[epoxy resin]] curing agents &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexion.com/en-us/chemistry/epoxy-resins-curing-agents-modifiers/curing-agents/polyamides|title=Hexion Amidoamine epoxy curing agents|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Tall oil is also used in oil drilling as a component of [[drilling fluid]]s.

The '''Terrafugia TF-X''' is the first fully autonomous flying car under development by Boston-based [[Terrafugia]]. Its expected release date is listed as eight to twelve years.&lt;ref name=TF-X&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrafugia.com/tf-x|title=TF-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TF-X seats four passengers and uses an engine combined with two electric motors for propulsion.&lt;ref name=Autoblog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/27/this-awesome-terrafugia-electric-vehicle-will-fly-someday/|title=This awesome Terrafugia electric vehicle will fly, someday [w/video]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previously proposed [[Terrafugia Transition|Transition]], the TF-X is capable of [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]] by extending its retractable wings attached with pusher propellers while aerial thrust is provided by a ducted fan at the rear.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20150730-terrafugia|title=Terrafugia TF-X, the flying supercar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to fit in a single car garage.

Powered by two plug-in hybrid 600-horsepower electric motors and a 300-horsepower fuel engine, the TF-X is planned to have a flight range of 500 miles  (805&amp;nbsp;km) with a cruising flight speed of 200&amp;nbsp;mph (322&amp;nbsp;km/h) without the need to refuel or recharge.&lt;ref name=Autoblog /&gt; Road speed is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Top Gear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/car-news/future-tech/flying-car-here-last-its-terrafugias-tf-x|title=The flying car is here at last! It's Terrafugia's TF-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==

Due to the success of the Transition vehicle, Terrafugia announced in 2013 that they were developing the TF-X. When in flight, the TF-X is effectively autonomous, with its pilot able to navigate to a pre-specified landing zone—and pre-selected backup landing zones—by itself, although manual controls and overrides exist. Final landing must be approved by the pilot. The TF-X will also provide operators the choice to fly in either manual or automatic during flight with the ability to control the vehicle in a manner similar to steering the wheel of an automobile. Terrafugia claims that learning to drive the TF-X is likely to take five hours and will take substantially less time to learn how to safely operate than a traditional aircraft.&lt;ref name=TF-X /&gt;

===Safety features===

The TF-X will be capable of avoiding air traffic, bad weather, and restricted and tower-controlled airspace. For additional safety features, the TF-X would automatically land at the nearest airport if the operator becomes unresponsive. Additionally, if a TF-X operator declares an emergency, the authorities will be automatically notified of the situation and the TF-X can be landed in a non-approved landing zone. The TF-X also features a backup full vehicle parachute system that can be activated if the operator believes the vehicle is incapable of auto-landing.&lt;ref name=TF-X /&gt;

===Pricing===

Pricing is expected to be upwards of £200,000 (roughly $300,000).&lt;ref name=Autocar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-terrafugia-tf-x-flying-car-revealed|title=New Terrafugia TF-X flying car revealed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10186">'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.

The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in 1660, he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form.

[[Sir Isaac Newton]], in responding to questions from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in a letter in 1677, concealed the details of his [[calculus|"fluxional technique"]] with an anagram:

:''The foundations of these operations is evident enough, in fact; but because I cannot proceed with the explanation of it now, I have preferred to conceal it thus: 6accdae13eff7i3l9n4o4qrr4s8t12ux. On this foundation I have also tried to simplify the theories which concern the squaring of curves, and I have arrived at certain general Theorems.''

==Classification==
There are many timestamping schemes with different security goals:

* [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-based - timestamp token is protected using PKI [[digital signature]].
* [[Linked Timestamping|Linking-based schemes]] - timestamp is generated such a way that it is related to other timestamps.
* Distributed schemes - timestamp is generated in cooperation of multiple parties.
* [[Transient-key cryptography|Transient key]] scheme - variant of PKI with short-living signing keys.
* [[Message authentication code|MAC]] - simple secret key based scheme, found in [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]].
* Database - document hashes are stored in trusted archive; there is online lookup service for verification.
* Hybrid schemes - the linked and signed method is prevailing, see [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard|X9.95]].

==Trusted (digital) timestamping==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.svg|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party]]
According to the &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3161&lt;/nowiki&gt; standard, a trusted timestamp is a [[timestamp]] issued by a [[Trusted Third Party]] (TTP) acting as a '''Time Stamping Authority''' ('''TSA'''). It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records, ...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

The newer [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]] for [[Timestamp|trusted timestamps]] augments the &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3161&lt;/nowiki&gt; standard with data-level security requirements to ensure [[data integrity]] against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party. This standard has been applied to authenticating digitally signed data for regulatory compliance, financial transactions, and legal evidence.

==Creating a timestamp==
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is practically impossible to duplicate with any other set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram).

Since the original data cannot be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

==Checking the timestamp==
[[Image:Checking timestamp.svg|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA)]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA needs to be validated.  This can be done by checking that the signed hash provided by the TSA was indeed signed with their private key by [[digital signature]] verification.  The hash A is compared with the hash B inside the signed TSA message to confirm they are equal, proving that the timestamp and message is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

==Decentralized timestamping on the blockchain==
With the advent of cryptocurrencies like [[bitcoin]], it has become possible to securely timestamp information in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner. Digital data can be hashed and the hash can be incorporated into a transaction stored in the [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]], which serves as a secure proof of the exact time at which that data existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ws-dl.blogspot.de/2017/04/2017-04-20-trusted-timestamping-of.html|title=2017-04-20: Trusted Timestamping of Mementos|last=Jones|first=Shawn M.|date=2017-04-20|website=ws-dl.blogspot.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gipp, B., Meuschke, N. and Gernandt, A., 2015 [https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp15a.pdf "Decentralized Trusted Timestamping using the Crypto Currency Bitcoin."] in Proceedings of the iConference 2015. March 2015, Newport Beach, California.&lt;/ref&gt; The proof is due to a tremendous amount of computational effort performed after the hash was submitted to the blockchain. Tampering with the timestamp would also lead to breaking the integrity of the entire digital currency,&lt;ref name="stefan"/&gt; and this would result in the digital currency devaluing to zero.&lt;ref name="stefan"&gt;May, Stefan (2016). [http://www.spektrum.de/news/die-blockchain-koennte-die-weltwirtschaft-revolutionieren/1416132 "Blockchain - die Verkettung der Welt"] Spektrum der Wissenschaft.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Llewellyn Cadwaladr Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The unmarked grave of the actor [[Llewellyn Cadwaladr]] in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in the UK]]
An '''unmarked grave''' is one that lacks a marker, headstone, or nameplate indicating that a body is buried there.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title= Entertainment: 10 Famous People Buried in Unmarked Graves| url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/10-famous-people-unmarked-graves.htm||author=Hoyt, Alia |work=How Stuff Works }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=MySanAntonio|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/article/Using-radar-to-find-unmarked-graves-1352153.php|title=Using radar to find unmarked graves|date=May 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cultures that mark [[cemetery|burial sites]], the phrase '''unmarked grave''' has taken on a [[metaphor]]ical meaning.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Metaphorical meaning==
As a [[figure of speech]], a common meaning of the term "unmarked grave" is consignment to an ignominious end. A [[grave (burial)|grave]] monument (or [[headstone]]) is a sign of respect or fondness, erected with the intention of commemorating and remembering a person.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Criminals===
Conversely, a deliberately unmarked grave may signify disdain and contempt. The underlying intention of some unmarked graves may be to suggest that the person buried is not worthy of commemoration, and should therefore be completely ignored and forgotten, e.g., [[Seung-Hui Cho]], [[Dylan Klebold]], [[Adam Lanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/location-adam-lanzas-body-mass-shooters-unknown/story?id=18100476 |title=The Location of Adam Lanza's Body, Like Most Mass Shooters, Is Unknown|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmarked graves have long been used to bury [[executed]] [[criminals]] as an added degree of disgrace. Similarly, many 18th and 19th century prisons and [[mental asylum]]s historically used numbered (but otherwise featureless) markers in their inmate cemeteries, which allowed for record-keeping and visitations while also minimizing the shame associated with having one's family name on permanent display in such a disreputable context. [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E|Plot E]] at [[Oise-Aisne American Cemetery]] (consisting entirely of soldiers executed for rape and/or murder) is a rare example of this policy persisting into the 20th century. More recently, the practice has been to [[Cremation|cremate]] and secretly scatter the ashes of notorious criminals in some anonymous place. This was the fate of [[Nazi]] [[war criminals]] such as [[Adolf Eichmann]], [[Hermann Göring]], [[Heinrich Himmler#Capture and suicide|Heinrich Himmler]], [[Fritz Sauckel]], and [[Julius Streicher]]. The remains of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[serial killers]] [[Myra Hindley]], [[Dr Harold Shipman]], and [[Fred West]] were treated in the same way. The headstone of disgraced television presenter and sex offender [[Jimmy Savile]] was removed and destroyed three weeks after being erected, when posthumous allegations of sexual abuse over decades came to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-19893373 |title=Jimmy Savile's headstone removed from Scarborough cemetery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cremation and secret scattering of the ashes has the additional effect of removing all possibility of there being a grave to visit in the future.

===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], contact with a corpse confers uncleanness (see [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 19:11-22 and [[Oholot|Tractate Oholoth]] in the [[Mishna]]). Cohanim, descendants of Aaron, are prohibited from approaching within 4 cubits of a grave, except for when a funeral is of a close relative. Thus, an unmarked grave opens up the possibility that a pious Jew could become defiled without being aware that it happened. The Jews of early times, therefore, sought to avoid unmarked graves by two means: clearly designating cemeteries beyond the limits of their villages and cities, and making graves and tombs obvious by whitewashing them. This is the background for [[Jesus]]' comparison of the [[Pharisees]] of his time to white-washed tombs (see [[Matthew 23]]:27-28) and to "unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it" ([[Luke 11]]:44). Jesus warned that the Pharisees were defiling others by their hypocrisy, misplaced priorities, and selfish ambition.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Other reasons for unmarked graves==
However, disdain and contempt are not the only reasons why graves remain unmarked.

As Alicia Hoyt reports: "Historically, financial limitations and social status were factors in whether a person (even a famous one) was awarded a big fancy marker. Mass, unmarked graves were also common in times of widespread disease or war; plus older markers simply deteriorated over time or were stolen. Another reason might be: other gravesites reflect the wishes of the deceased or family members who simply don't want a marker, can't decide on wording, or plan to add one down the line when a loved one passes away and joins them in the plot. [sources: Texas Historical Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Texas Historical Commission |title=Locating Unmarked Graves |url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/unmarked-graves |accessdate=November 18, 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911232312/http://www.thc.state.tx.us/unmarked-graves |archivedate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Washington Post|title=The "Bone Finder" uses ground-penetrating radar to find lost graves at Congressional|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bone-finder-uses-ground-penetrating-radar-to-find-lost-graves-at-congressional/2013/12/13/9518d3e4-6441-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html|author=Binkovitz, Leah|date= December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Additionally, "modern celebrity concerns" may be related to a desire for privacy or to avoid vandalism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, [[Apple, Inc.]] founder [[Steve Jobs]] (whose grave site lacks a headstone), Academy Award-winning actor [[George C. Scott]], musician [[Frank Zappa]], comedian [[John Belushi]], and writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (discussed below) are notable people whose burial sites have been left unmarked (or marked deceptively) for reasons that are not financial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Find A Grave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/77692175|title=Steve Jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases when a person's remains are lost, a [[cenotaph]] may be erected. This is what happened to [[comedian]] [[John Belushi]]. The gravestone at his grave in a [[Martha's Vineyard]] cemetery was removed and relocated, after operators of the cemetery found many signs of [[vandalism]] and rowdiness, where his body lies. In response, a [[cenotaph]] gravestone was erected at a nearby empty grave, to deter disrespectful visitors, leaving his actual final resting place without a marker. Another John Belushi [[cenotaph]] gravestone was erected by his family in a [[Chicago]] area cemetery, at the Belushi family plot, where his parents are now buried.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Similarly, when [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s headstone in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] was stolen, a replacement marker was erected in a different location.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Deceased monarchs and princes of [[Saudi Arabia]] are buried in unmarked graves in the public [[Al Oud cemetery]] in [[Riyadh]]. There is also typically no public funeral or national show of mourning. The [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] sect of [[Sunni Islam]] practiced in Saudi Arabia considers public shows of grief or memorials to the dead to be un-Islamic, and therefore the [[House of Saud|royal family]] typically practices austere, private burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4743085.stm|title=Analysis: The Saudi way of death|date=3 August 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Numerous works, such as moving pictures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?q=unmarked%20grave&amp;s=tt&amp;ref_=fn_al_tt_mr|title=Moving pictures whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"}}&lt;/ref&gt; photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/search?q=photograpy+unmarked+grave&amp;pc=MOZI&amp;form=MOZLBR|title=Photographs whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"|website=Bing Search Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=unmarked+grave|website=Goodreads|title=Written works whose titles include the phrase "unmarked grave"}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been titled some variation of "Unmarked Grave".

'''White pride''' or '''White power''' is an expression primarily used by [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[white nationalism|white nationalist]], [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organizations in order to signal [[racism|racist]] or [[racialist]] viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van McVey|first=Sarah|title=Race, Gender, and the Contemporary White Supremacy Movement: The Intersection of "isms" and Organized Racist Groups|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabriel2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel, John|title=Whitewash: Racialized Politics and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80CEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75016-0|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a slogan used by the prominent post-[[Ku Klux Klan]] group [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and a term used to make racist/racialist viewpoints more palatable to the general public who may associate historical abuses with the terms "white nationalist", "neo-Nazi", and "white supremacist".

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile identified "White Power! White Pride!" as "a much-used chant of white separatist movement supporters",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Dobratz| first=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2= Stephanie L.| title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride | place=Baltimore|  publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=2001 |isbn=0-8018-6537-9|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologist Mitch Berbrier has identified the use of this phrase as part of a "new racist&amp;nbsp;... frame-transformation and frame-alignment by (a) consciously packaging a 'hate-free' racism, (b) developing strategies of equivalence and reversal–presenting whites as equivalent to ethnic and racial minorities, and (c) deploying ideas about 'love,' 'pride,' and 'heritage-preservation' to evidence both their putative lack of animosity toward others as well as their ethnic credentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Half the Battle": Cultural Resonance, Framing Processes, and Ethnic Affectations in Contemporary White Separatist Rhetoric|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/4/431|journal = Social Problems|date = 1998-11-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 431–450|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/3097206|language = en|first = Mitch|last = Berbrier|jstor = 3097206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[social psychology]] experiment that tested how white participants could be influenced to identify with white pride ideology, social psychologists framed white pride as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;[P]eople who openly express White pride seem invariably to be those alienated from the mainstream culture—KKK members, [[Skinhead|skin-heads]], and White supremacists—people trying to grab onto some basis for feeling good about themselves when conventional avenues such as successful careers and relationships are not working well for them. Consequently, the vast majority of people who avow White pride seem also to explicitly avow racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Jeff|last2=Schimel|first2=Jeff|last3=Martens|first3=Andy|last4=Solomon|first4=Sheldon|last5=Pyszcznyski|first5=Tom|date=2001-06-01|title=Sympathy for the Devil: Evidence That Reminding Whites of Their Mortality Promotes More Favorable Reactions to White Racists|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1010613909207|journal=Motivation and Emotion|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=113–133|doi=10.1023/A:1010613909207|issn=0146-7239}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Sociologists Monica McDermott and Frank L. Samson documented the rhetorical evolution of white pride movements thus, "Because white pride has historically been predicated upon a denigration of nonwhites, the articulation of the duties and requirements of whiteness reflects a desire to correlate a conscious white identity with positive attributes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Monica|last2=Samson|first2=Frank L.|date=2005-01-01|title=White Racial and Ethnic Identity in the United States|jstor=29737719|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=31|pages=245–261|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.31.041304.122322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and social scientists commonly argue that the idea of "white pride" is an attempt to provide a clean or more palatable public face for white supremacy or white separatism and that it is an appeal to a larger audience in hopes of inciting more widespread racial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration |last=Swain |first=Carol M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-80886-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph T. Roy of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], white supremacists often circulate material on the internet and elsewhere that "portrays the groups not as haters, but as simple white pride civic groups concerned with social ills".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/91499jtr.htm |title=Statement of Joseph T.

By contrast, then, "affirmations of white pride—however thinly cloaked as affirmations of ethnic pride—serve to mask and perpetuate [[white privilege]]".&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |title=Rights, Democracy, and Fulfillment in the Era of Identity Politics: Principled Compromises in a Compromised World |last=Ingram |first=David |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |place= Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-3348-4 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, Professor of Education at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], Cris Mayo, characterizes white pride as "a politically distasteful goal, given that whiteness is not a personal or community identity, but has been a strategy to maintain [[social inequality|inequities]] of privilege and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certain Privilege: Rethinking White Agency {{!}} Mayo {{!}} Philosophy of Education Archive|url = http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes/article/viewArticle/1675|website = ojs.ed.uiuc.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-04|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political science|Political scientists]] [[Carol M. Swain]] and Russell Nieli, in their text on white nationalism, identify the idea of "white pride" as a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. They argue that over the course of the 1990s, "a new white pride, white protest, and white consciousness movement has developed in America". They identify three contributing factors: an immigrant influx during the 1980s and 1990s, resentment over [[affirmative action]] policies, and the growth of the Internet as a tool for the expression and mobilization of grievances.&lt;ref name="swain5"&gt;*{{citation |last=Swain| first=Carol M. |last2=Nieli |first2=Russell|title=Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year=2003 |isbn=0-521-01693-2 |page=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Janet E. Helms]], founding director of [[Boston College]]'s Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture, a white person "must become aware of his or her Whiteness, accept it as personally and socially significant ... Not in the sense of Klan members' 'white pride' but in the context of a commitment to a just society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRof9vDClvQC|title="Why are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?": And Other Conversations about Race|last=Tatum|first=Beverly Daniel|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465083617|language=en}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among people who strongly identify as white, research differentiates between a power cognizant group and a prideful group. The prideful group is more likely to devalue diversity and to show prejudice, while the power cognizant group is more likely to value diversity.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_white_pride_lead_to_prejudice|title=Does White Pride Lead to Prejudice?|website=Greater Good|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
