The '''A415''' is a British [[A road (UK)|A road]] which runs from the [[A4074 road|A4074]] at [[Berinsfield]], [[Oxfordshire]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.6591|-1.1762|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A415 road (southeastern end)}}),}} to [[Witney]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.7852|-1.4965|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A415 road (northwestern end)}}),}} passing through [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Marcham]] and [[Kingston Bagpuize]].  It crosses the [[River Thames]] twice, at [[Abingdon Bridge]] and [[Newbridge, Oxfordshire|Newbridge]].

When UK roads were first classified in 1922, the A415 started at a junction with the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] just west of [[Maidenhead]] in [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml#4 1922 road list]&lt;/ref&gt;  It ran through [[Henley-on-Thames]] and [[Benson, Oxfordshire|Benson]] to [[Shillingford]] where it joined the then [[A42 road (Great Britain)|A42]].  It left the A42 a mile west at [[Dorchester, Oxfordshire|Dorchester]].  In the 1930s the section from Maidenhead to Shillingford became part of the [[A423 road|A423]].   It is now part of the [[A4130 road|A4130]] and the A4074.

In the 1980s, when the Dorchester Bypass was opened, the start of the A415 was switched to the western end of the bypass, at Berinsfield.

The '''A4230''' is a suburban main road in south [[Wales]].

The A4230 is a single carriageway road for its whole length.  It begins at the Peniel Green roundabout (junction with the [[M4 motorway]] and the [[A48 road|A48]]) in the far east of [[Llansamlet]].  It travels east through the Lonlas area of Skewen before passing through central [[Skewen]], after which it traverses the Neath Abbey area before connecting with the [[A474 road|A474]] at the Cwrt Herbert roundabout in [[Dyffryn Clydach]].  It then follows the same road as the [[A474]] along Neath Abbey Road then though [[Cadoxton-juxta-Neath|Cadoxton]] until it connects with the [[A465 road|A465]] just south of [[Aberdulais]].

'''Achelous''' is a relatively fresh [[impact crater|crater]] on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] adjacent to the similarly sized [[Gula (crater)|Gula]]. It has an outer lobate ejecta deposit extending about a crater radius from the rim. 

A characteristic feature of both craters, almost identical in size, is the "pedestal" - an outward-facing, relatively gently sloped scarp that terminates the continuous ejecta blanket. Similar features may be seen in ejecta blankets of Martian craters, suggesting impacts into a volatile (ice)-rich target material. Furthermore, both craters appear crisp and feature terraces. Gula has a prominent central peak; Achelous instead may show the remnant of a collapsed central peak or a central pit that is not fully formed. On lower-resolution images taken under higher sun illumination angle, both craters are shown to have extended bright rays, especially Achelous, which demonstrates that these two craters are younger than the respective surrounding landscape.

'''Biophysical chemistry''' is a physical science that uses the concepts of [[physics]] and [[physical chemistry]] for the study of [[Systems biology|biological systems]].&lt;ref name="Walla2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Jomo Walla|title=Modern Biophysical Chemistry: Detection and Analysis of Biomolecules|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ej__AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=8 July 2014|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-68354-3|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common feature of the research in this subject is to seek explanation of  the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the [[Supramolecular chemistry|supra-molecular]] structure of these systems.

==Techniques==
Biophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These techniques include spectroscopic methods such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[X-ray diffraction]]. For example, the work for which Nobel Prize was awarded in 2009 to three chemists was based on X-ray diffraction studies of [[ribosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/press.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 - Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the areas in which biophysical chemists engage themselves are [[protein structure]] and the functional structure  of [[cell membranes]]. For example, [[enzyme]] action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion. Similarly the structure and function of the biomembranes may be understood through the study of model supramolecular structures as [[liposomes]] or [[phospholipid]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] of different compositions and sizes.

==Institutes==
The oldest reputed institute for biophysical chemistry is the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in [[Göttingen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Journals==
Biophysical chemistry journals include ''[[Biophysical Journal]]'', ''[[Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics]]'' (published by [[Academic Press]]), ''[[Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications]]'' (Academic Press), ''[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]]'' ([[Elsevier Science]]), ''Biophysical Chemistry'', ''An International Journal devoted to the Physics and Chemistry of Biological Phenomena'' (Elsevier), ''[[Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods]]'' (Elsevier), ''Journal of Biochemistry'', ''Biology and Biophysics'' ([[Taylor &amp; Francis]]), and ''[[Journal de Chimie Physique]]'', ''Physico-Chimie Biologique'' ([[EDP Sciences]] and the [[Société chimique de France|Société Française de Chimie]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="476">'''Bradyspory''' is the gradual release of seed from a [[conifer cone|cone]] or [[fruit]] over a long period of time, as opposed to [[tachyspory]], the more-or-less immediate release of seed as soon as they have matured.

Bradyspory may occur because seed release is spontaneous but very gradual, or because seed release does not occur until triggered to do so by some environmental event. The latter case is termed [[serotiny]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">A ''' cash-flow diagram''' is a tool used by [[accountants]] and [[engineers]], to represent the transactions of cash which will take place over the course of a given project. Transactions can include initial investments, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] costs, projected earnings or savings resulting from the project, as well as [[Salvage value|salvage]] and resale value of equipment at the end of the project. Cash flow diagrams may also be used to represent payment schedules for [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[mortgages]] and other types of loans.It is often used with a break even sheet and a balance sheet in order to see where money is being made or lost. Also it is used to monitor results of different things. For instance when changing variables it will see if they are successful or not in causing future profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/bjfurman/courses/ME195/presentations/EngEconPatel03NOV04.ppt |title=Engineering Economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Financial_Assessment_Techniques(1).pdf |title=Financial Assessment Techniques }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehigh.edu/~rhs2/IBE098/CashFlow&amp;Interest.ppt ''Cash Flows, Interest Rates &amp; the Time Value of Money,'' '''Lehigh Valley University]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710065716/http://www.lehigh.edu/~rhs2/IBE098/CashFlow%26Interest.ppt |date=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-31975843.html Taking A Moment to Teach Engineering Economy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/CSTB/lib00224,0F51389A13D7E8F8.html "Instrumental in tech learning"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5002">In [[molecular biology]] and [[bioinformatics]], the '''consensus sequence''' (or '''canonical sequence''') is the calculated order of most frequent residues, either [[nucleotide]] or [[amino acid]], found at each position in a [[sequence alignment]]. It represents the results of multiple [[sequence alignment]]s in which related sequences are compared to each other and similar [[sequence motifs]] are calculated. Such information is important when considering sequence-dependent enzymes such as [[RNA polymerase]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Benjamin A. 2002. Genetics : A Conceptual Approach. 1st ed. New York: W.H. Freeman and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological significance==
A protein binding site, represented by a consensus sequence, may be a short sequence of [[nucleotide]]s which is found several times in the [[genome]] and is thought to play the same role in its different locations. For example, many [[transcription factors]] recognize particular patterns in the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of the [[gene]]s they regulate. In the same way, [[restriction enzymes]] usually have [[palindromic]] consensus sequences, usually corresponding to the site where they cut the DNA. [[Transposons]] act in much the same manner in their identification of target sequences for transposition. Finally, [[splice site]]s (sequences immediately surrounding the [[exon]]-[[intron]] boundaries) can also be considered as consensus sequences.

Thus a consensus sequence is a model for a putative [[DNA binding site]]: it is obtained by aligning all known examples of a certain recognition site and defined as the idealized sequence that represents the predominant base at each position. All the actual examples shouldn't differ from the consensus by more than a few substitutions, but counting mismatches in this way can lead to inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="Schneider2002" /&gt;

Any mutation allowing a mutated nucleotide in the core promoter sequence to look more like the consensus sequence is known as an '''up mutation'''. This kind of mutation will generally make the promoter stronger, and thus the RNA polymerase forms a tighter bind to the DNA it wishes to transcribe and transcription is up-regulated. On the contrary, mutations that destroy conserved nucleotides in the consensus sequence are known as '''down mutations'''. These types of mutations down-regulate transcription since RNA polymerase can no longer bind as tightly to the core promoter sequence.

==Sequence analysis==
Developing software for [[pattern recognition]] is a major topic in [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], and [[bioinformatics]]. Specific [[sequence motif]]s can function as [[regulatory sequence]]s controlling biosynthesis, or as [[signal peptide|signal sequences]] that direct a molecule to a specific site within the cell or regulate its maturation. Since the regulatory function of these sequences is important, they are thought to be conserved across long periods of [[evolution]].  In some cases, evolutionary relatedness can be estimated by the amount of conservation of these sites.

===Notation===
The conserved sequence motifs are called '''consensus sequences''' and they show which residues are conserved and which residues are variable. Consider the following example [[DNA]] sequence:

:A[CT]N{A}YR

In this [[Sequence motif#Pattern description notations|notation]], A means that an A is always found in that position; [CT] stands for either C or T; N stands for any base; and {A} means any base except A. Y represents any [[pyrimidine]], and R indicates any [[purine]].

In this example, the notation [CT] does not give any indication of the relative frequency of C or T occurring at that position.  An alternative method of representing a consensus sequence uses a [[sequence logo]]. This is a graphical representation of the consensus sequence, in which the size of a symbol is related to the frequency that a given nucleotide (or amino acid) occurs at a certain position. In sequence logos the more conserved the residue, the larger the symbol for that residue is drawn; the less frequent, the smaller the symbol. Sequence logos can be generated using [http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/ WebLogo], or using the [http://db.systemsbiology.net/gestalt/ Gestalt Workbench], a publicly available visualization tool written by Gustavo Glusman at the [http://www.systemsbiology.org Institute for Systems Biology].&lt;ref name="Schneider2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schneider TD |title=Consensus Sequence Zen|journal=Appl Bioinform |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=111–119 |year=2002 |pmid=15130839 |doi=|pmc=1852464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
Bioinformatics tools are able to calculate and visualize consensus sequences. Examples of the tools are [[JalView]] and [[UGENE]].

'''Differential thermal analysis''' (or '''DTA''') is a [[thermal analysis|thermoanalytic]] technique that is similar to [[differential scanning calorimetry]]. In DTA, the material under study and an inert reference are made to undergo identical thermal cycles, (i.e., same cooling or heating programme) while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference.&lt;ref&gt;Bhadeshia H.K.D.H. “Thermal analyses techniques. Differential thermal analysis”. University of Cambridge, Material Science and Metallurgy. www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2002/Thermal1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.

==Apparatus==
A DTA consists of a sample holder, thermocouples, sample containers and a ceramic or metallic block; a furnace; a temperature programmer; and a recording system. The key feature is the existence of two thermocouples connected to a voltmeter. One thermocouple is placed in an inert material such as [[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], while the other is placed in a sample of the material under study. As the temperature is increased, there will be a brief deflection of the voltmeter if the sample is undergoing a phase transition. This occurs because the input of heat will raise the temperature of the inert substance, but be incorporated as latent heat in the material changing phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Robert Bud, Deborah Jean Warner|title=Instruments of Science | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&amp;pg=PA170 | pages =170&amp;ndash;171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's instruments==
In today's market most manufacturers no longer make true DTA systems but rather have incorporated this technology into [[thermogravimetric analysis]] (TGA) systems, which provide both mass loss and thermal information. With today's advancements in software, even these instruments are being replaced by true TGA-[[differential scanning calorimetry|DSC]] instruments that can provide the temperature and heat flow of the sample, simultaneously with mass loss. 

==Applications==
A DTA curve can be used only as a ''finger print'' for identification purposes but usually the applications of this method are the determination of phase diagrams, heat change measurements and decomposition in various atmospheres.

DTA is widely used in the pharmaceutical&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer S., Borrás J., Martín Gil J. and Martín Gil F.J. "Thermal studies on sulphonamide derivative complexes”. ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1989, 147, 321 330; 1989, 153, 205 220; 1991, 185, 315 333.&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;Berger K.G., Akehurst E.E. “Some applications of differential thermal analysis to oils and fats”. ''International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology'', 1966, 1, 237–247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramos Sánchez M.C., Rey F.J., Rodríguez M.L., Martín Gil F.J. and Martín Gil J. "DTG and DTA studies on typical sugars". ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1988, 134, 55 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Rey, M.C. Ramos-Sánchez, M.L.Rodríguez, J. Martín-Gil, F.J. Martín-Gil.

"DTG and DTA studies on amino acids". ''Thermochim. Acta'', 1988, 134, 73 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTA may be used in cement chemistry,&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran V.S. “Applications of differential thermal analysis in cement chemistry”. Chap. V, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York (1969), 92.&lt;/ref&gt; mineralogical research&lt;ref&gt;Smykatz-Kloss W. “Application of differential thermal analysis in mineralogy”. ''J. Therm. Anal.

DTA curves may also be used to date bone remains&lt;ref&gt;Villanueva, PrE, Girela F. y Castellanos M. “The application of differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis to dating bone remains”. ''Journal of Forensic Sciences'', 1976, 21,&lt;/ref&gt; or to study archaeological materials.&lt;ref&gt;Misiego-Tejeda J.C., Marcos-Contreras G.J., Sarabia Herrero F.J., Martín Gil J. and Martín Gil F.J.

The '''Experimental Assembly of Structures in EVA''' and the '''Assembly Concept for Construction of Erectable Space Structures''', or '''EASE/ACCESS''', were a pair of [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] flight experiments that were performed on [[STS-61-B]], on November 29 and December 1, 1985. The purpose of the experiments was to study how quickly [[astronaut]]s would become proficient at assembling space structures during [[extravehicular activity]], and how quickly they would become fatigued, and to explore various construction and maintenance techniques.  In particular, researchers studied the applied [[moment of inertia|moments of inertia]] arising in the manual assembly of a large space structure.&lt;ref name="cousins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cousins|first=D.|author2=Akin, D.L.|title=Moments applied in the manual assembly of space structures: EASE biomechanics results from STS-61B.|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=19|issue=12|pages=973–9|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information.|date=December 1989|doi=10.1016/0094-5765(89)90092-1|pmid=11541162 |bibcode=1989AcAau..19..973C}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2006-12-26--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neal|first=Valerie |author2=McMahan, Tracy |author3=Dooling, Dave|title=Chapter 9 - Testing New Technology.|work=NP-119 Science in Orbit: The Shuttle &amp; Spacelab Experience, 1981-1986|url=https://history.nasa.gov/NP-119/ch9.htm|accessdate=2006-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EASE was a project of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[Space Systems Laboratory]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (later at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]), while ACCESS was developed by NASA's [[Langley Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=von Ofenheim|first=Bill|title=Space Shuttle Atlantis ACCESS EVA|work=NASA Langley Research Center - Multimedia Repository|publisher=NASA|date=2003-03-10|url=http://lisar.larc.nasa.gov/UTILS/info.cgi?id=EL-1996-00066|accessdate=2006-12-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928233619/http://lisar.larc.nasa.gov/UTILS/info.cgi?id=EL-1996-00066|archivedate=2006-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiment and EVAs==
Astronauts [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Sherwood C. Spring]] repeatedly assembled a {{Convert|3.7|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [[truss]] (EASE) and a triangular column truss (ACCESS) during two [[extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs). The first EVA was devoted to studying human performance in assembly techniques, while the second was dedicated to supplementary experiments, including alternative construction techniques and maintenance scenarios.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Space Shuttle Mission STS-61B|publisher=NASA|date=November 1985|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_023_STS-61B_Press_Kit.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EASE structure consisted of six identical [[aluminum]] beams, each {{convert|12|ft|sp=us}} long and with a mass of {{convert|64|lb|sp=us}}, connected by four nodal joints. ACCESS consisted of 93 tubular aluminum struts, each {{convert|1|in|sing=on|sp=us}} in diameter—thirty-three {{convert|4.5|ft|sp=us}} struts, and sixty {{convert|6|ft|sp=us}} struts—connected by thirty-three nodal joints.&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt; While assembling the EASE structure, the astronauts moved about the structure under their own power. For the assembly of the ACCESS structure, the astronauts were secured to a mobile platform on the [[Remote Manipulator System]], which was guided by astronaut [[Mary L. Cleave]].&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt;

A [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] camera system recorded the movements of the structural beams during assembly. Taking into account the effects of [[inertia]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], and virtual [[mass]], researchers used this data to reconstruct the applied moments of inertia. The structure was also assembled in [[neutral buoyancy]] simulation, and the two environments were compared. The EVAs were also recorded by an [[IMAX]] camera mounted in the shuttle cargo bay.

==Results==
[[Image:STS-61-B access practice.jpg|thumb|260px|Astronauts assemble the ACCESS structure in [[neutral buoyancy]] training.]] 
Applied moments of inertia during EVA were found to be on the order of {{Convert|2.0|Nm|lk=in|sp=us}}. In neutral buoyancy simulation, the applied moments of inertia were around five times greater than those during EVA.&lt;ref name="cousins"/&gt; Assembly time during EVA was around 20% less than in neutral buoyancy simulation. The [[learning curve]] was on the order of 78%, and was unaffected by the strength, coordination, or size of the astronaut, or the fit of the [[space suit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harkins|first=Wil|title=Public Lessons Learned Entry: 0833|publisher=NASA|date=1994-12-01|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/llis/0833.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615070812/http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/llis/0833.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-15|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both environments, moments of inertia were applied as short [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s, interspersed by several seconds of coasting.

==Conclusion==
The EASE/ACCESS experiments were deemed to be successful. The information gathered provided a basis for planning future manually assembled space structures, and in the process NASA accrued valuable EVA assembly experience. The team responsible for the EASE project was awarded a [[NASA Group Achievement Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Research Council|title=Biographical Sketches of Committee Members|work=Laying the Foundation for Space Solar Power: An Assessment of NASA's Space Solar Power Investment Strategy|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2001|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10202&amp;page=66|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science/physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in [[applied physics]] for a selected specialty such as [[optics]], [[quantum physics]], [[materials science]], [[applied mechanics]], [[electronics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[microfabrication]], [[microelectronics]], [[computing]], [[photonics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[nuclear engineering]], [[biophysics]], [[control theory]], [[aerodynamics]], [[energy]], [[solid-state physics]], etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in [[research]] and development, design, and analysis.

It is notable that in many languages the term for "engineering physics" would be directly translated into [[English language|English]] as "technical physics". In some countries, both what would be translated as "engineering physics" and what would be translated as "technical physics" are disciplines leading to academic degrees, with the former specializing in nuclear power research, and the latter closer to engineering physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm | title=2002 Applications for graduate study open in Shanghai Research Institute of Technical Physics (上海技术物理研究所2002年招生) | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院) | date=2001-10-07 | accessdate=2008-09-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607130833/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2001/10/07/0655.htm &lt;!--Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eas.caltech.edu/ Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/engineering_physics.htm Engineering Physics, Division of Engineering Science, University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beam.vt.edu/about/esm.php Engineering Science and Mechanics program at Virginia Tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech, [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] forms the foundation of the [[curriculum]], while typical elective areas may include [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum physics]], [[economics]], [[plasma physics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[solid mechanics]], [[operations research]], [[quantitative finance]], information technology and engineering, [[dynamical systems]], [[bioengineering]], [[environmental engineering]], computational engineering, engineering mathematics and [[statistics]], [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state device]]s, [[materials science]], [[electromagnetism]], [[nanoscience]], [[nanotechnology]], [[energy]], and [[optics]]. While typical undergraduate engineering programs generally focus on the application of established methods to the design and analysis of engineering solutions, undergraduate program in engineering science focuses on the creation and use of more advanced experimental or computational techniques where standard approaches are inadequate (i.e., development of engineering solutions to contemporary problems in the physical and life sciences by applying fundamental principles).

'''GeneTree''' was a family history website focused on using DNA testing to trace ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/faq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127015049/http://www.genetree.com/faq |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A website account was free, and within their account users could order DNA tests, enter results from other testing companies, search the DNA database, create an online family tree, and correspond with family members – including sharing pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eon.businesswire.com/portal/site/eon/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20071022106222&amp;newsLang=en EON article on GeneTree launch]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetree.com was closed on January 1, 2013 and its assets were transferred to [[Ancestry.com]].&lt;ref name="GeneTreeFAQ"/&gt;

==History==
GeneTree was founded in 1997 by a graduate of [[Wayne State University]]’s Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Terrence Carmichael, who earned a master’s degree in molecular biology and genetics in 1995.  Genetree did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests initially.  Carmichael declared, “Over 95 percent of our first-year business was in paternity testing.”  In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based [[Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation]] ("SMGF") which originated in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/scribe/PDF/Alum-06-SpringScribe%5B1%5D.pdf editor, "CMMG alum launches multi-million dollar genetic testing company"], ''Alum notes'', Wayne State University, School of Medicine's alumni journal, Vol. 17, num.2, Spring 2006 page 1, accessed 24 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The GeneTree website brought together elements of several existing Sorenson Companies: DNA testing by Sorenson Genomics, the DNA-genealogy database established by the SMGF research project, and the media sharing abilities of Sorenson Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230110230/http://www.genetree.com/history |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9043521/Genealogy_site_uses_DNA_and_social_networks_to_trace_ancestors?taxonomyId=71&amp;intsrc=kc_top&amp;taxonomyName=internet_business|title=Genealogy site uses DNA and social networks to trace ancestors|first=Heather|last=Havenstein|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ancestry.com announced to its customers, "In March, Ancestry.com DNA, LLC acquired access to an extensive collection of DNA assets from SMGF."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/05/ancestrycom-buys-genetree-and-launches.html Ancestry.com buys GeneTree and launches new service] Accessed 24 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetree.com was discontinued on January 1, 2013 and access to family trees was no longer made available through the GeneTree site.&lt;ref name="GeneTreeFAQ"/&gt;  Prior to that date, Ancestry.com offered their subscribers who were former GeneTree customers an opportunity to download their DNA test results and manually enter them at Ancestry.com.  Beginning January 1, 2013, those who don't have a current subscription to Ancestry.com no longer had access to their GeneTree DNA results.&lt;ref&gt;http://ancestry.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5499 Moving your information from GeneTree to Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA tests==

===Y chromosome===
GeneTree offered [[Y chromosome]] DNA testing (males only) that gives information about paternal ancestry, including 33-marker and a 46-marker test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/pg/dna-for-males |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923110917/http://www.genetree.com/pg/dna-for-males |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; YDNA is passed from father to son, so males with the same YDNA often have the same surname in addition to sharing a male ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/ydna |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230105940/http://www.genetree.com/ydna |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitochondrial DNA===
GeneTree offered [[mitochondrial DNA]] testing (males and females) that gives information about maternal ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/pg/dna-for-females |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912211053/http://www.genetree.com/pg/dna-for-females |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GeneTree's tests look at HVR1, HVR2, and HVR3 of the mtDNA. mtDNA is passed from mother to children, so people with the same mtDNA share a female ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genetree.com/mtdna |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230111859/http://www.genetree.com/mtdna |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA and genealogy services==
In addition to DNA testing services, GeneTree sold consultation services to help customers further understand their test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2010/03/|title=March – 2010 – The Genetic Genealogist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Hillis Aylward''' is an [[Australia]]n chemical author. He is known for writing the ''SI Chemical Data'' book.

==Biography==
Aylward graduated on 20 May 1952 with a [[BSc]] (Honours) in Applied Chemistry from the then-new [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name='unsw'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2004/mar/Alumni.html | publisher = University of New South Wales | title = A lunch half a century later | date = 22 March 2004 | accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='unsw1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/alumni/unsweng/issue6/graduate.htm |title=The university's first graduates |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |accessdate=2008-05-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727150120/http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/alumni/unsweng/issue6/graduate.htm |archivedate=27 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he received a MSc from the same university, and continued to teach Analytical Chemistry for 13 years there.&lt;ref name='booktopia'/&gt; During that period he organized the Approach to Chemistry [[summer school]]s, together with his co-teacher dr Tristan Findlay. To support the course, they wrote the book ''SI Chemical Data'' as the textbook.&lt;ref name='booktopia'/&gt;

Later Aylward joined [[Macquarie University]] as Associate Professor and worked from 1970 till his retirement in 2005 in developing countries as a Science Education consultant for [[UNESCO]], then for the [[World Bank]] and finally as a freelance Senior Science Education Advisor.&lt;ref name='booktopia'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.booktopia.com.au/si-chemical-data/prod9780470816387.html | title = Product Information SI Chemical Data | publisher = Booktopia | accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial ecology''' ('''IE''') is the study of [[material flow|material]] and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] through industrial systems.  The [[global economy|global]] [[industrial economy]] can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the [[Earth]] and transform those resources into [[Commodity|commodities]] which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity.  Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function.  Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the [[Natural environment|environment]], with use of the planet's supply of [[natural resources]], and with problems of [[waste disposal]].  Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[toxicology]] and the [[Outline of natural science|natural sciences]].

Industrial ecology has been defined as a "systems-based, multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behaviour of complex integrated human/natural systems".&lt;ref name="OntologiesOfIE"/&gt;  The field approaches issues of [[sustainability]] by examining problems from multiple perspectives, usually involving aspects of sociology, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[economy]] and [[technology]].  The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems.&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of [[Industrial Symbiosis]].  Waste steam from a [[Waste incineration|waste incinerator]] (right) is piped to an [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol plant]] (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes.

Much of the research focuses on the following areas:&lt;ref name="is4ieHistory"/&gt;
* [[Material flow analysis|material]] and energy flow studies ("[[industrial metabolism]]")
* [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] and [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]]
* technological change and the environment
* [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle planning, design and assessment]]
* [[Design for Environment|design for the environment ("eco-design")]]
* [[Extended producer responsibility| extended producer responsibility ("product stewardship")]]
* [[Eco-industrial park| eco-industrial parks ("industrial symbiosis") ]]
* product-oriented environmental policy
* [[eco-efficiency]]

Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems (for example a factory, an [[ecoregion]], or national or global economy) interact with the [[biosphere]].  Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another, in an "ecosystem" based on resources and [[infrastructural capital]] rather than on [[natural capital]]. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire [[sustainable design]].

Along with more general [[energy conservation]] and material conservation goals, and redefining [[commodity markets]] and [[product stewardship]] relations strictly as a [[service economy]], industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of [[Natural Capitalism]].  This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a [[political economy]] that values [[natural capital]] highly and relies on more [[instructional capital]] to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology.

==History==
[[File:View from Asnaes power station Kalundborg Denmark.jpg|300px|right|thumb|View of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park]]]]
{{Main|History of industrial ecology}}

Industrial ecology was popularized in 1989 in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by [[Robert Frosch]] and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos.  Frosch and Gallopoulos' vision was "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of [[raw material]]s, [[pollution]], and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing"/&gt;  A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]].  Here several linkages of [[byproduct]]s and [[waste heat]] can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi, Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP's, the park at Rantasalmi is Finland's first planned EIP.

The scientific field Industrial Ecology has grown quickly in recent years. The Journal of Industrial Ecology (since 1997), the [[International Society for Industrial Ecology]] (since 2001), and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology (since 2004) give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community.  Industrial Ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the [[Circular Economy]] that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the Circular Economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategy such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref name="CircularEconomy"/&gt;

== Principles ==
One of the central principles of Industrial Ecology is the view that societal and technological systems are bounded within the [[biosphere]], and do not exist outside it.  [[Ecology]] is used as a ''metaphor'' due to the observation that natural systems reuse materials and have a largely closed loop cycling of nutrients.  Industrial Ecology approaches problems with the hypothesis that by using similar principles as ''natural systems, industrial systems'' can be improved to reduce their impact on the natural environment as well. The table shows the general metaphor.

IE examines societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment. Through this ''[[holistic]] view '', IE recognizes that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems, various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation. Often changes in one part of the overall [[system]] can propagate and cause changes in another part. Thus, you can only understand a problem if you look at its parts in relation to the whole. Based on this framework, IE looks at environmental issues with a ''[[systems thinking]]'' approach. A good IE example with these societal impacts can be found at the [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|Blue Lagoon]] in Iceland. The Lagoon uses super-heated water from a local geothermal power plant to fill mineral-rich basins that have become recreational healing centers. In this sense the industrial process of energy production uses its wastewater to provide a crucial resource for the dependent recreational industry.

Take a city for instance. A city can be divided into commercial areas, residential areas, offices, services, infrastructures, and so forth. These are all sub-systems of the 'big city’ system. Problems can emerge in one sub-system, but the solution has to be global. Let’s say the price of housing is rising dramatically because there is too high a demand for housing. One solution would be to build new houses, but this will lead to more people living in the city, leading to the need for more infrastructure like roads, schools, more supermarkets, etc. This system is a simplified interpretation of reality whose behaviors can be ‘predicted’.

In many cases, the systems IE deals with are complex systems. [[Complex systems|Complexity]] makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the system and may lead to rebound effects. Due to unforeseen behavioral change of users or consumers, a measure taken to improve environmental performance does not lead to any improvement or may even worsen the situation.

Moreover, ''life cycle thinking'' is also a very important principle in industrial ecology. It implies that all environmental impacts caused by a product, system, or project during its life cycle are taken into account. In this context life cycle includes
*[[Raw material]] extraction
*[[Material processing]]
*Manufacture
*Use
*Maintenance
*Disposal
The transport necessary between these stages is also taken into account as well as, if relevant, extra stages such as [[reuse]], [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]], and [[recycle]].
Adopting a life cycle approach is essential to avoid shifting environmental impacts from one life cycle stage to another. This is commonly referred to as problem shifting. For instance, during the re-design of a product, one can choose to reduce its weight, thereby decreasing use of resources. However, it is possible that the lighter materials used in the new product will be more difficult to dispose of. The environmental impacts of the product gained during the extraction phase are shifted to the disposal phase. Overall environmental improvements are thus null.

A final important principle of IE is its ''integrated approach'' or ''[[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinarity]]''. IE takes into account three different disciplines: social sciences (including economics), technical sciences and environmental sciences. The challenge is to merge them into a single approach.

==Examples==
The [[Kalundborg]] industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other's waste (which then becomes by-products). For example, the Energy E2 [[Asnæs Power Station]] produces [[gypsum]] as a by-product of the electricity generation process; this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A/S which produces plasterboards.&lt;ref name="KalundborgCentre"/&gt; This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere-technosphere metaphor: in ecosystems, the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms; in industrial systems, waste from a company is used as a resource by others.

Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop, the use of an eco-industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants, like [[Photovoltaic system|Solar PV]], more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref name="PearcePhotovoltaic"/&gt;

Additional examples of industrial ecology include:
*Substituting the fly ash byproduct of coal burning practices for cement in concrete production&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Michael. "Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete." Portland Cement Association&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using second generation biofuels. An example of this is converting grease or cooking oil to biodiesels to fuel vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/28000/used-and-waste-oil-and-grease-for-biodiesel|title=Used and Waste Oil and Grease for Biodiesel - eXtension|author=|date=|website=extension.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*South Africa's National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC) was created in order to make the region's industries more efficient in terms of materials. Results of the use of sustainable methods will include lowered energy costs and improved waste management. The program assesses existing companies to implement change.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncpc.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The [[ecosystem]] metaphor popularized by [[Robert Frosch|Frosch]] and Gallopoulos&lt;ref name="StrategiesForManufacturing" /&gt; has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems.  Recently, it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology, and that advancements in understanding ecology based on [[complexity science]] have been made by researchers such as [[C. S. Holling]], [[James J. Kay]],&lt;ref name="OnComplexityTheory"/&gt; and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = S.

.&lt;ref name="ABMAndIE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApplyingABMinIE"/&gt;

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref name="ExergyUsefulConcept"/&gt; The term ''exergy'' was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, [[ecological economics]], [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

== Other examples ==

Another great example of industrial ecology both in practice and in potential is the Burnside Cleaner Production Centre in [[Burnside, Nova Scotia]]. They play a role in facilitating the 'greening' of over 1200 businesses that are located in Burnside, Eastern Canada's largest industrial park. The creation of waste exchange is a big part of what they work towards, which will promote strong industrial ecology relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcity.ca/Pages/industrial_ecology.html|title=Industrial Ecology: From Theory to Practice|author=|date=|website=newcity.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Journal NPCA title page 1800.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Title page of 1799-1800 volume&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''''A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts''''', generally known as ''Nicholson's Journal'', was the first monthly  scientific journal in Great Britain. [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] began it in 1797&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Iain P. Watts|title='We want no authors': William Nicholson and the contested role of the scientific journal in Britain, 1797–1813|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|pages=397–419|url=http://www.princeton.edu/histgrads/profiles/iwatts/Iain-Watts-We-Want-No-Authors.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014|doi=10.1017/s0007087413000964|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the editor until it merged with another journal at the end of 1813.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Nicholson, William (1753-1815) (DNB00)|"Nicholson, William (1753–1815)"]]. [[Dictionary of National Biography]]. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1885–1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson's journal would accept short papers, written by new or anonymous authors, and decide whether to publish them relatively quickly. These attributes distinguished the new journal from the established scientific journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''. By one account this less-formal model was so appealing that the next year a similar startup launched, [[Alexander Tilloch]]'s ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;Russell, Colin. Enterprise and electrolysis... ''Chemistry World'', Aug. 2003 ([http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/August/electrolysis.asp online])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant articles ==
* Nicholson and [[Anthony Carlisle]] split water into hydrogen and oxygen for the first time in 1800 and immediately published their results in the journal. They used [[Volta's pile]] (an electric battery) as soon as they learned of it to achieve this [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Hasok. 2012. ''Is Water H2O?: Evidence, Realism and Pluralism''. Springer. page 73. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=62kPsTT7XasC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Lilley+1948+Nicholson's+Journal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz2MdCuRHv&amp;sig=cohLI4RcC0yIJhIooJPzUGqke7U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5AWUqWsIvil4AOvpoDICQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilley%201948%20Nicholson's%20Journal&amp;f=false online at google books])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovery of the element [[palladium]] was announced in 1803. The author chose Nicholson's journal in order to remain anonymous at first, and later revealed himself to be [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;
* The journal published the first known [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] analysis of [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[heavier-than-air]] [[fixed-wing]] [[flying machines]] designs, by [[George Cayley]] in 1809-1810.&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;Cayley, George. "On Aerial Navigation" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810. (Via [[NASA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing business ==
By one account, William Nicholson started the journal and made all editorial decisions in a "pioneering and uncertain attempt" to make a living from publishing it. Revenues came only from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=cwl&gt;Chang, 2012, p. 73, also citing Lilley (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Tilloch's ''Philosophical Magazine'' was more successful as a popular science journal business than Nicholson's journal, according to one source, and another such journal appeared in 1813 (''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'').&lt;ref name=cw/&gt; Possibly partly because of this competition, William Nicholson ended the journal. By some accounts Nicholson's journal simply ceased, and by others it merged in 1814 with the ''Philosophical Magazine'' to form ''The Philosophical Magazine and Journal''.

The "Advertisement", dated 31 December 1813, at the start of Volume 42 of ''The Philosophical Magazine'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53080#page/20/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; states:

"Nearly seventeen years have elapsed since ''The Philosophical Journal'' was commenced by Mr. Nicholson, and sixteen since the appearance of the first number of ''The Philosophical Magazine''. [...] [T]he result of [...] deliberations [between the publishers of ''Nicholson's Philosophical Journal'' and ''The Philosophical Magazine'' in order to respond to readers' complaints regarding duplication of material in the two publications] has been that it would certainly be best that we should unite, and that the joint product of our exertions and our correspondence should be consolidated in one periodical work. [...] The Philosophical Journal will henceforth be discontinued; and The Philosophical Magazine will be conducted by William Nicholson and Alexander Tilloch, in the same manner as it has always been carried on."

For the duration of Volume 43 (January to June 1814) the joint publishers of the new merged journal provided duplicate title-pages for each number, ostensibly so that subscribers to ''Nicholson's Philosophical Magazine'' might be enabled to "preserve their Series without a chasm." However, despite their intention to continue this scheme of two-fold numeration, they abandoned it at the end of this trial period in June 1814, because of the perceived "confusion and risque of many errors" when referring to future volumes; from July 1814 a single numeration was used, following the numbering of ''The Philosophical Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53078#page/15/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1038">The '''Krackhardt E/I Ratio''' (or variously the '''E-I Index''') is a [[social network]] measure which the relative density of internal connections within a [[group (sociology)|social group]] compared to the number of connections that group has to the external world.  It was so described in a 1988 paper by [[David Krackhardt]] and Robert N. Stern noting the increased effectiveness in moments of crisis of organizations which had stronger informal networks that crossed formal internal group structures.

== Comparisons with network theory ==

The E/I ratio is related to the concept of [[conductance (graph)|conductance]], which measures the likelihood that a [[random walk]] on a subgraph will exit that subgraph.

[[File:LCO-logo-sq-xl.jpg|thumb|Las Cumbres Observatory official logo]]
'''Las Cumbres Observatory''' (LCO) is a network of astronomical observatories run by a [[non-profit]] private operating [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] directed by the technologist [[Wayne Rosing]]. Its offices are in [[Goleta, California]]. The telescopes are located at both northern and southern hemisphere sites distributed in longitude around the Earth. For some astronomical objects, the [[Longitude|longitudinal]] spacing of telescopes allows continuous observations over 24&amp;nbsp;hours or longer. The operating network currently consists of two 2&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes, nine 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes, and seven 40&amp;nbsp;cm telescopes, placed at six astronomical observatories. The network operates as a single, integrated, observing facility, using a software scheduler that continuously optimizes the planned observing schedule of each individual telescope.

==History==
Rosing incorporated Las Cumbres Observatory in 1993 with the goal of aiding universities, observatories, and individuals in the acquisition and improvement of telescopes, optics, and instrumentation. He also set the objective for the organization to build and implement a global telescope system. In 2005, Rosing established the global telescope version of Las Cumbres Observatory.

LCO initially acquired the two Faulkes 2&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes. [[Faulkes Telescope North]] (FTN) located at Haleakala Observatory, on Maui, Hawaii, and [[Faulkes Telescope South]] (FTS) at Siding Spring Observatory (SSO), in eastern Australia. LCO also purchased the company that built the Faulkes telescopes, Telescope Technologies Limited of Liverpool, with the intent of installing additional 2-meter telescopes at different sites to form a robotically operated network. Over the next few years, Rosing and the LCO staff came to understand that a network composed of many smaller telescopes would provide greater observing capacity. The organization designed its own 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescope with a plan to locate several of these at each chosen site.  An even smaller 40&amp;nbsp;cm telescope was also developed primarily for use in education projects.

During 2012 and 2013, nine 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes were constructed and deployed to McDonald Observatory at Fort Davis, Texas; Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile; South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), near Sutherland, South Africa; and SSO in Australia.  During 2015 and 2016, seven 40&amp;nbsp;cm telescopes were deployed to CTIO, Haleakala Observatory, SSO, and to Teide Observatory on Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

After completion of the construction and installation of these telescopes, LCO began its transition to operating a global observatory. In 2013, a Board of Directors was established and a President was hired to lead the organization. Full science scheduling began on 1&amp;nbsp;May 2014, with the two 2&amp;nbsp;meter and nine 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes operating as a single, integrated, observatory. The 40&amp;nbsp;cm telescopes were added to this system as they were commissioned.

Two agreements were completed in 2015 that will add to the scope of the LCO network.  An agreement between LCO and the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) will result in the deployment of two additional 1-meter telescopes to Ali Observatory in western Tibet.  An agreement between LCO and the Israeli I-CORE center will result in the integration of the 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescope at Wise Observatory into the LCO network.

The National Science Foundation made an award to LCO in 2016 through its Mid-Scale Innovations Program, purchasing access to the LCO network for all astronomers at U.S. institutions. The goal of this program is to prepare this community to carry out effective research following discoveries being made by current and future time domain astronomy surveys.

==Telescope network==
===Sites===
LCO operates its network at six sites, with plans to add two more in the next few years.  The operating sites are all professional astronomical observatories.

In the southern hemisphere:
* [[Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory]] (CTIO) in Chile
* [[South African Astronomical Observatory]] (SAAO), near [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]], South Africa
* [[Siding Spring Observatory]] (SSO), in eastern Australia

[[File:McDonald node, TX.jpg|300px|LCOGT commissioning at McDonald Observatory]]  [[File:LCOGT Sedgwick Reserve Night.JPG|300px|LCOGT 80&amp;nbsp;cm telescope enclosure at Sedgwick Reserve]]

In the northern hemisphere:
* [[McDonald Observatory]] at Fort Davis, Texas
* [[Haleakala Observatory]], on Maui, Hawaii
* [[Teide Observatory]] on Tenerife in the Canary Islands

The [[Ali Observatory]] in western Tibet and [[Wise Observatory]] in Israel will be added as the telescopes there become operational.

LCO also operates an identical 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescope at its headquarters in Goleta for engineering development and a 0.8&amp;nbsp;meter telescope at Sedgwick Reserve near Santa Ynez, California.

===Telescopes===
[[File:LCOGT 2m.JPG|150px|LCO 2m Faulkes Telescope North]]  [[File:LCOGT 1m.jpg|250px|LCO 1m Telescope prototype at Santa Barbara]]  [[File:LCOGT 40cm.jpg|250px|LCO 40&amp;nbsp;cm Telescope prototype at Santa Barbara]]

The 2&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes are the two Faulkes telescopes built by Telescope Technologies Ltd. They are f/10 Ritchey-Chrétien optical configurations on alt-az mounts.

The 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes are f/7.95 Ritchey-Chrétien optical systems on equatorial mounts. They have a 50&amp;nbsp;arcminute-diameter fully corrected field of view.

The {{convert|40|cm}} telescopes use the optics and tubes from Meade 16&amp;nbsp;inch RCX telescopes. The mount has been replaced by a scaled-down version of the LCO 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescope mount.

===Instruments===
The 2&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes are instrumented with optical imagers and low-resolution optical spectrographs.

The 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes are instrumented with “Sinistro” optical imagers that have a 26&amp;nbsp;arcminute square field of view.  During 2017, a set of high-resolution (R&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;50,000), high-stability spectrographs (NRES) are being deployed to four of the LCO sites to be coupled by optical fibers to the 1&amp;nbsp;meter telescopes.&lt;ref name="Siverd2014" /&gt;

The {{convert|40|cm}} telescopes are equipped with SBIG STX-6303 optical imagers.

===Operation===
The global telescope network operates as a single observatory. Users request observations only for a generic class of telescope/instrument and the software scheduler determines an optimum observing schedule for each telescope. The scheduler revises the observing schedules for all telescopes as necessary and updates can be provided within 15 minutes. The rapid-response request mode bypasses the scheduler and can begin an observation within a few minutes after submission. Each telescope carries out a nightly calibration program and adjusts its pointing and focus several times per night.&lt;ref name="Pickles2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boroson2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volgenau2016" /&gt;

The telescopes are all instrumented uniformly to facilitate the combining of data from multiple telescopes or sites. Data are returned to LCO headquarters, where they are processed to remove instrumental signature and ingested into an archive.  Users have immediate access to their observations and all data are made public after 12 months.

==Usage==
The network is available to researchers at institutions that are members of the LCO science collaboration. Institutions that operate the sites hosting the LCO telescopes and a few institutions that have contributed resources to help build the network are members of the collaboration. The entire U.S. astronomical community gained access to the LCO network in 2016 as a result of an award from the National Science Foundation’s Mid-Scale Innovation Program. The program is administered through a peer-review proposal process run by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Several science teams and individuals also purchase time on the LCO network.

==Research==
The design and operation of the LCO global telescope network provide the unique capabilities required for time domain astronomy. The LCO network offers the ability to observe objects or events continuously and the ability to obtain data rapidly upon the discovery or announcement of an event.

The LCO network has been used to study [[supernovae]] and other explosive transients; [[exoplanets]], through observations of both transits and microlensing; [[asteroids]]; and AGN variability. In 2017 LCO played a critical part in two major discoveries: first visible counterpart of a [[gravitational wave]] event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Seale |first=Sandy |date=16 October 2017 |title=Astronomers Use Global Telescope Network to Catch a Fleeting Kilonova for the First Time |url=https://lco.global/news/astronomers-use-global-telescope-network-to-catch-a-fleeting-kilonova-for-the-first-time/ |publisher=Las Cumbres Observatory |access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcavi2017" /&gt; and a new type of supernova with successive explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Seale |first=Sandy |date=November 8, 2017 |title=Las Cumbres Astronomers Discover a Star That Would Not Die |url=https://lco.global/news/las-cumbres-astronomers-discover-a-star-that-would-not-die/ |publisher=Las Cumbres Observatory |access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arcavi2017a" /&gt;

==Education==
Since the beginning of LCO, education has been one of its core missions. In 2017, for the first time in LCO's history it issued an open call for education partners&lt;ref name="partners17" /&gt;—groups who could use their robotic telescopes to inspire diverse audiences with educational and outreach projects that they support. In 2018 there are 17 LCO education partners&lt;ref&gt;https://lco.global/education/partners&lt;/ref&gt; based in the USA, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Australia, or running entirely online programs, for students, teachers, and the wider public.

The LCO education team also maintains in-house educational programs to trigger observations and make use of data from the LCO network.&lt;ref name="Hayden2016" /&gt; These programs are designed to inspire anyone with an interest in astronomy to explore science using robotic telescopes. Recent successful programs include Asteroid Tracker&lt;ref&gt;http://asteroidtracker.lco.global&lt;/ref&gt; and Agent Exoplanet.&lt;ref&gt;http://lco.global/agentexoplanet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2017 LCO received a grant from the Heising-Simons Foundation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; for $1,000,000&lt;ref name="HSaward17" /&gt; to be used in the construction and support of an additional 1-meter at their McDonald Observatory, Texas node.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5287">This is a '''list of national parks in Zambia'''.  There are twenty [[national parks]] in [[Zambia]], although a few of them are not maintained and so contain no facilities and few animals.  Others have high concentrations of animals and are popular with tourists, while two or three are world-famous.

==Map==
[[File:Zambia National Parks Map.png|thumb|center|500px|Map showing the twenty National Parks of Zambia]]

==Alphabetical list==
*[[Blue Lagoon National Park]] — a small park in the north of the [[Kafue Flats]] west of [[Lusaka]], known chiefly for bird life; one lodge
*[[Isangano National Park]] — east of the [[Bangweulu Swamps]], no facilities, little wildlife
*[[Kafue National Park]] — world-famous for its animals, one of the world's largest national parks, several lodges
*[[Kasanka National Park]] — privately operated, south of the [[Bangweulu Swamps]], one lodge
*[[Lavushi Manda National Park]] — south-east of the [[Bangweulu Swamps]], no facilities, little wildlife
*[[Liuwa Plain National Park]] — in the remote far west, no facilities but some large herds of animals
*[[Lochinvar National Park]] — a small park south of the [[Kafue Flats]] world-famous for bird life and herds of [[lechwe]], one lodge
*[[Lower Zambezi National Park]] — east of Lusaka, offers good wildlife viewing on the Zambezi River; numerous lodges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lower Zambezi National Park|url=http://www.lowerzambezi.com|website=LowerZambezi.com|publisher=Lowerzambezi.com|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Luambe National Park]] — a small park, close to South Luangwa National Park, recovering after previous neglect, one new lodge
*[[Lukusuzi National Park]] — east of Luambe, undeveloped but with potential
*[[Lusaka National Park]] — opened in 2015, a small park on the south-east side of the capital city [[Lusaka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lusaka National Park opens with a bang|url=https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/?p=32904|website=Zambia Daily Mail|publisher=Zambia Daily Mail|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lusenga Plain National Park]] — east of Lake Mweru, no facilities, no easy access, little wildlife
*[[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park]] ([[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park|Victoria Falls National Park]]) — the small park for Victoria Falls on the edge of the city of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] (where accommodation is available), includes a small 'safari park'
*[[Mweru Wantipa National Park]] — no facilities, neglected, little wildlife but has potential for redevelopment
*[[North Luangwa National Park]] — this reserve has no facilities and is closed except to specially-licensed tours 
*[[Nsumbu National Park]] (also known as Sumbu) — once ranked with Kafue and Luangwa, needs redevelopment but has good wildlife potential and offers lakeside game viewing, three lodges 
*[[Nyika National Park, Zambia|Nyika National Park]] — famous for its highland scenery and vegetation rather than wildlife; one lodge, but reached from the park of the same name in [[Malawi]]
*[[Sioma Ngwezi National Park]] — in the remote far south-west, no facilities but some large herds of animals
*[[South Luangwa National Park]] — world-famous as an icon of African wildlife, numerous lodges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Luangwa National Park|url=https://www.southluangwa.com|website=SouthLuangwa.com|publisher=SouthLuangwa.com|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[West Lunga National Park]] — no facilities, no easy access, neglected, little wildlife but has potential for redevelopment.

==Administration==
The national parks are administered by the [[Zambia Wildlife Authority]], an autonomous body responsible to the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources. This Authority took over from the former National Parks and Wildlife Service which suffered from chronic underfunding. Consequently of the 20 parks, five have never had management or facilities and have very little wildlife: Isangano, Lavushi Manda, Lusenga Plain, West Lunga, and Mweru Wantipa; three have substantial wildlife but have hitherto been left undeveloped as a matter of policy or because a neighbouring park has been favoured: North Luangwa, Luambe, and Lukusuzi; and three have wildlife but have been too remote to develop: Liuwa Plain, Sioma Ngwezi, and Nyika Plateau. Of the remainder, most are in quite good shape, except Nsumbu, which went through a decline due to a lack of transport infrastructure, and the zoological park section of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park which needs rehabilitation.

In approximate order of importance in terms of wildlife resources, the eight main functioning parks, all with access and accommodation are:
*[[South Luangwa National Park]]
*[[Kafue National Park]]
*[[Lower Zambezi National Park]]
*[[Nsumbu National Park]]
*[[Kasanka National Park]]
*[[Lochinvar National Park]]
*[[Blue Lagoon National Park]]     
*[[Victoria Falls National Park]]

{{Tropicalcyclone}}
Within the Pacific Ocean, the name of any significant [[tropical cyclone]] can be retired from the [[List of tropical cyclone names|tropical cyclone naming lists]] by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] if it is felt that a storm is so deadly or damaging that the future use of its name would be inappropriate. Storm names can also be retired for other reasons, such as being very similar to another retired name or because it might suggest an undesirable meaning in another language. Within the Eastern and Central Pacific basins, a total of eighteen names have been removed from the official lists. The deadliest system to have its name retired was Hurricane Pauline, which caused over 230 fatalities when it struck Mexico during October 1997, while the costliest hurricane was Hurricane Manuel which caused an economic impact of over {{ntsp|4200000000||$}} in damage in September 2013. [[Hurricane Patricia|Patricia]] was the most recent Pacific tropical cyclone to have its name retired, due to its exceptional intensity.

In 1950 a tropical cyclone that affected Hawaii was named Able, after a tropical cyclone had not affected Hawaii for a number of years. The system subsequently became widely known as Hurricane Hiki, since Hiki is Hawaiian for Able.&lt;ref name="C1950"&gt;{{cite report|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1900-52.php|accessdate=August 8, 2014|title=Tropical Cyclones During the Years 1900-1952|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simpson, Robert H|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00431672.1950.9927066|title=Hiki—Hawaii's First Hurricane of Record|journal=Weatherwise|pages=127–128|accessdate=August 8, 2014|doi=10.1080/00431672.1950.9927066|issn=0043-1672|date=December 1950|volume=3|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typhoons Olive and Della of 1952 and 1957, respectively, developed within the Central Pacific, but were not named until they had crossed the International Dateline and moved into the Western Pacific basin.&lt;ref name="C1950"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1957 ATCR"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1957 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|date=April 12, 2012|publisher=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|accessdate=July 21, 2014|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1957.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1957, two other tropical cyclones developed in the Central Pacific and were named Kanoa and Nina by the Hawaiian military meteorological offices.&lt;ref name="1957 ATCR"/&gt; It was subsequently decided that future tropical cyclones would be named by borrowing names from the Western Pacific naming lists.&lt;ref name="TC FAQ B1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Landsea, Christopher W |author2=Dorst, Neal |date=June 1, 2014 |title=Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Questions: |chapter=Subject: B1) How are tropical cyclones named? |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B1.html |author3=Hurricane Research Division |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q9nmDAns?url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt |archivedate=June 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic basin, after hurricanes [[Hurricane Carol|Carol]], [[Hurricane Edna|Edna]], and [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] struck the [[Northeastern United States]] and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.&lt;ref name="Mahina"&gt;{{cite web|title=They Called the Wind Mahina: The History of Naming Cyclones|author=Dorst, Neal|url=ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/pub/dorst/Mahina.pptx|author2=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|page=Slides 8–72|date=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's time (June) to match for Anna...|newspaper=The Daily Gleaner|date=June 1, 1969|author=Reuters|page=2|location=Kingston, Jamaica}}{{subscription required|via=The Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various reasons other than for causing a significant amount of death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and for political reasons.&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRD"&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=June 21, 2014 |author=Landsea, Christopher W |author2=Dorst, Neal |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |author5=Hurricane Research Division |date=June 20, 2014 |chapter=Subject: B3) What storm names have been retired? |title=Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Questions: |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206051005/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B3.html |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minutes"&gt;{{cite conference|title=Minutes of the 43rd Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference|publisher=The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermano '''Marco Antonio Serna Díaz''' (11 July 1936 - 31 December 1991) was a herpetologist, ornithologist, and naturalist from Colombia.

==Life==
Serna was born to Marco Antonio Serna and Anna Judith Díaz in [[San Vicente, Antioquia|San Vicente Ferrer]] in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], Colombia.&lt;ref name="Bol. SAO"&gt;[http://www.sao.org.co/publicaciones/boletinsao/oldissues/BoletinSAO_Vol_III_%285%29_1992.pdf In Memoriam] In: Boletín SAO Sociedad Antioqueña de Ornitología – SAO Volume III, 1992:p 3-8 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 1950 he entered the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]] in [[San Pedro, Antioquia]], where he discovered his love for natural sciences. From 1956 to 1958 he studied in San Antonio de Prado. On 10 January 1962 he made his perpetual profession at the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools.

He was curator of birds, amphibians, and reptiles at the [[Museo de La Salle]] in [[Bogotá]], and professor of ornithology at the [[University of Antioquia]].

Serna was both president of the Sociedad Antioqueña de Ornitología which he co-founded in 1984, and the Asociación Colombiana de Ornitología, two notable ornithological organisations in Colombia.&lt;ref name="Bol. SAO"/&gt;

Together with [[Juan A. Rivero|Juan Arturo Rivero]], a herpetologist from Puerto Rico, he described several new frog species, including ''Pristimantis dorsopictus'', ''Pristimantis johannesdei'', ''Hyloxalus breviquartus'', ''Pseudopaludicola ceratophryes'', and ''Colostethus ramirezi''.

In 1971, he collected the last known specimen of the [[Antioquia brush finch]] (''Atlapetes blancae'').&lt;ref&gt;Donegan, T. M. 2007. A new species of brush finch (Emberizidae: Atlapetes) from the northern Central Andes of Colombia. Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club. 127(4): 255-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the newly described [[Antioquia wren]] (''Thryophilus sernai'') was named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Lara, C. E., A. M. Cuervo, S. V. Valderrama, D. Calderón-F. &amp; C. D. Cadena. (2012). "A new species of wren (Troglodytidae: Thryophilus) from the dry Cauca River Canyon, northwestern Colombia". The Auk 129 (3): 537–550.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Rivero described the frog species ''Eleutherodactylus sernai'' which was later synonymized with ''[[Eleutherodactylus cerastes]]'' (Lynch, 1975).

The '''mariner's astrolabe''', also called '''sea astrolabe''', was an [[inclinometer]] used to determine the [[latitude]] of a ship at sea by measuring the sun's noon altitude (declination) or the [[meridian altitude]] of a star of known declination. Not an [[astrolabe]] proper, the mariner's astrolabe was rather a graduated circle with an [[alidade]] used to measure vertical angles.  They were designed to allow for their use on boats in rough water and/or in heavy winds, which astrolabes are ill-equipped to handle.  In the sixteenth century, the instrument was also called a '''ring'''.&lt;ref name="waters"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Astrolabio Aveiro Lisboa ca1600.jpg|thumb|Mariner's astrolabe from circa 1600.]]
[[File:Silver-plated Mariner's Astrolabe.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Mariner's astrolabe made in 1645 by Nicolao Ruffo at The [[Mariners' Museum]]]]
Many dates can be found for the appearance of the first mariner's astrolabes.  The earliest date, 1295, is offered by the [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorcan]] astronomer [[Ramon Llull]].&lt;ref name="oxfordShipsAndSea"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea'', Peter Kemp ed., 1976 {{ISBN|0-586-08308-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later dates center around the late 15th century, with [[Samuel Purchas]] claiming that it was adapted for marine navigation by [[Martin Behaim]],&lt;ref  name="oxfordShipsAndSea" /&gt; a mariner not considered a trustworthy source by some historians{{who|date=August 2013}}.  In any event, the instrument was certainly known by the end of the 15th century. Nevertheless, the creation and perfecting of the mariner's astrolabe is attributed to Portuguese navigators during the beginning of [[Portuguese discoveries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Comandante Estácio dos Reis |title=Astrolábios Náuticos |year=2002  |publisher=INAPA |isbn=9727970370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ancruzeiros.pt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancruzeiros.pt/anci-astrolabio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122134304/http://www.ancruzeiros.pt/anci-astrolabio.html |archivedate=22 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known description of how to make and use a sea astrolabe comes from [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]]’s&lt;ref&gt;See [[:es:Martín Cortés de Albacar]] for the Spanish Wikipedia biography&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arte de Navegar'' published in 1551,&lt;ref name="swanick"&gt;Swanick, Lois Ann. ''An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th century'', MA Thesis, Texas A&amp;M University, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although the basic principle is the same as that of the [[archipendulum]] used in constructing the [[Egyptian pyramids]].

There is strong evidence that the mariner's astrolabe was derived directly from the planispheric [[astrolabe]], as the earliest examples retain some of the markings (e.g. ''umbra recta'' and ''umbra versa'') of the prior device without having the same components.&lt;ref name="daumas"&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mariner's astrolabe would have replaced or complemented instruments such as the [[cross staff]] or [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] as a navigator's instrument.  The mariner's astrolabe was used until the middle or, at the latest, the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="daumas" /&gt;  It was replaced by more accurate and easier-to-use instruments such as the [[Davis quadrant]].

Although their heavy brass construction permits their longevity in marine environments,&lt;ref name="swanick" /&gt; mariner's astrolabes are very rare today.  In 2017, only 108 were known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;A. Stimson, ''The Mariner's Astrolabe. A survey of known, surviving sea astrolabes.''

Mearns]] on the wreck site of a Portuguese nau ''[[Esmeralda (carrack)|Esmeralda]],'' which sank off the coast of Oman in 1503.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Esmeralda" /&gt;

==Construction==
Mariner's astrolabes were made of [[brass]].  Since weight was advantageous when using the instrument on the heaving deck of a ship or in high winds, other materials, such as wood or [[ivory]], were not desirable though some wood sea astrolabes were made.  Early sea astrolabes were made from sheets of brass.  Due to their light weight, they tended to perform poorly at sea.  Heavier cast brass frames began to be made in the mid-sixteenth century and were considerably better.&lt;ref name="waters"&gt;Waters, David Watkin, ''The Art of Navigation in England in Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times'', Yale University Press, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  As the accuracy of the instrument is related to the radius of the divided circle, these were made as large as practical.

Since the large plate form of the [[astrolabe|planispheric astrolabe]] makes it sensitive to the wind, the mariner's astrolabe is made with a frame form.  The openings in the frame allow wind to pass through, inducing less motion in the instrument.

The essential function of the device was to measure angles.  Thus the instrument featured a ring graduated in degrees.  Early instruments were only [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] for 90°; later instruments were graduated for the full 360° circle around the [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]].  The sole purpose of the spokes was to support the pivot point for the [[alidade]].  In order to lower the [[centre of gravity]] of the device and thus increase its [[Frequency|period of motion]] as a means of stabilizing it, extra brass was usually added to the bottom of the instrument inside the ring.  This is clearly evident in the lower left instrument seen in the photograph above.

The [[alidade]] was free to rotate about a pin through the centre of the instrument.  The vanes of the alidade were either slotted or pierced with a hole to allow the user to align the alidade.

The astrolabe had a ring attached to the top of the instrument to allow it to hang vertically.

==Usage==
[[File:Astrolabe (PSF).png|thumb|left]]
In order to use the astrolabe, the navigator would hold the instrument by the ring at the top.  This caused the instrument to remain in a vertical plane.  The navigator would then align the plane of the astrolabe to the direction of the object of interest.  The alidade was aligned to point at the object and the altitude was read off the outer degree scale.

If observing a dim object such as a star, the navigator would observe the object directly through the alidade.  If observing the sun, it was both safer and easier to allow the shadow of one of the alidade's vanes to be cast onto the opposite vane.

==Limitations==
The mariner's astrolabe needed to be suspended vertically in order to measure the [[Celestial coordinate system|altitude]] of the celestial object. This meant it could not be used easily on the deck in windy conditions. It could not easily be used to measure the angle between two objects, which was necessary for [[longitude]] calculations by the [[lunar distance method]] (though that technique was not used when the instrument was developed). Another limitation was that the instrument's angular accuracy was directly proportional to the length of the [[alidade]], which was not very long.

[[File:NoPlaceToHide.jpg|thumb|Cover of first edition.]]

'''''No Place to Hide''''' is a 1948 book by American writer [[David J. Bradley]] published by [[Little, Brown and Company]]. The book is a [[Harvard Medical School]] graduate's autobiographical tale of his work in the Radiological Safety Section in the Pacific in the aftermath of the Bikini atomic bomb tests, [[Operation Crossroads]]. The book alerted the world to the dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear weapon explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Jacobs The Dragon's Tail: Americans Face the Atomic Age -- 2010  Page 31 "David Bradley's influential 1948 record of Operation Crossroads, No Place to Hide, was essentially a book about fallout. "What happened at Crossroads was the clearest measure yet of the menace of atomic energy," Bradley wrote."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Major, Rana Mitter,  Across the Blocs: Exploring Comparative Cold War Cultural  1135755671 2004 "The continuing debate over the consequences of nuclear explosions was entered by David Bradley in 1948 whose No Place to Hide was written in opposition to bland government reassurances that there was no need for the public to worry ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The book was marketed for Bantam by [[Judith Merril]], who found Bradley's prose "a man's book with little appeal for women", leading her to later write her own nuclear war story ''[[Shadow on the Hearth]]'' from the homemaker's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne Newell, Victoria Lamont ''Judith Merril: A Critical Study''  2012 Page 34 0786489855  "Merril concludes that Bradley's No Place to Hide was, in truth, “a man's book, with little appeal for women,” adding that “few women have read it or will, because the technique you used for relief from strain, the tropical isle stuff, fishing, etc.. "&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley toured lecturing on the dangers of fallout, including a 1950 lecture at [[Ford Hall Forum]].

The book was reissued with an epilogue in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kQYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp; Review - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Nov. 1983] "As the author explained in an interview at Dartmouth College on June 8, 1983, the writing of No Place to Hide was a response to this lack of concern and awareness, aided by the early interest in the project expressed by the Atlantic Monthly  "&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polychotomous key''' refers to the number of alternatives which a decision point may have in a non-temporal hierarchy of independent variables. The number of alternatives are equivalent to the root or [[nth root]] of a mathematical or logical variable.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Decision points or independent variables with two states have a binary root that is referred to as a [[wiktionary:dichotomy|dichotomous]] key whereas, the term polychotomous key refers to roots which are greater than one or unitary and usually greater than two or binary. Polychotomous keys are used in [[troubleshooting]] to build troubleshooting charts and in classification/identification schemes with characteristics that have more than one attribute and the order of characteristics is not inherently based on the progression of time.

'''RV ''Wecoma''''' is a research vessel owned by the [[National Science Foundation]] and operated by the College of Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Sciences at [[Oregon State University]] (OSU) as a member of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System]] (UNOLS) fleet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shipops.oregonstate.edu/ops/wecoma/cpm.html#Scheduling | Scheduling of R/V WECOMA&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based in [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] near OSU's [[Hatfield Marine Science Center]].&lt;ref name="aquatic"/&gt; Launched in 1975, it has a maximum displacement of {{convert|1150|LT|0}}.&lt;ref name="aquatic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/05/life_aquatic_with_osu_needs_ne.html|title=Life aquatic with OSU needs a new research ship|last=Learn|first=Scott|date=May 8, 2009|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|184.5|ft|m|adj=on}} ship is equipped with {{convert|1174|ft2|m2}} of laboratory space to support up to 18 scientists at sea.  It has a variety of equipment permanently installed, and optional additional equipment available on request, to measure and analyze navigational data; surface atmospheric conditions; sea surface temperature, salinity, fluorescence; bottom depth; dissolved oxygen titration; solar radiation; GPS time; bioacoustics; and geological sampling.  The range of depths of submerged equipment varies from {{convert|3000|to|6000|m|ft}}.  The vessel can support diving operations, radioactive isotope materials, and explosive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{TOC right}}

==Definition==
A regional park can be a special park district covering a region crossing several jurisdiction boundaries, or a park system of a single jurisdiction, such as a province, county, or city.

==By country==

===Canada===

====Saskatchewan====
There are 101 regional parks in Saskatchewan. All parks are operated by volunteer boards.

===Italy===
{{See also|List of regional parks of Italy}}
Regional parks in Italy are administered by each [[Regions of Italy|region in Italy]], a government unit like a U.S. state.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Regional parks of New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], regional parks are administered by [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] rather than the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] or [[territorial authority|territorial authorities]].

===United States===

====Definitions====
In the United States, a regional park is sometimes referred to as a 'Metropolitan Park (Metropark)' or as an [[open space reserve]]. The terms ''region'' and ''metropolitan'' can have different meanings in U.S. local government agencies. Regional parks can be administered by a regional park board, a [[U.S. state|state]], [[county#United States|county]] or other units of [[local government]]. A special authority can be set up, under the joint jurisdiction of two or more government bodies or as an independent park district to administer parks. Individual parks may or may not cross governmental boundaries. The park district holds the authority, similar to fire protection districts, to manage and raise taxes to cover park acquisition and management costs.

====Midwest====
{{See also|List of county and regional parks in Minnesota}}
In Ohio, under [[Ohio Revised Code]] Chapter 1545, metro parks such as the [[Metro Parks (Columbus, Ohio)|Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks]] can have their own [[police officer|sworn police forces]] ([[park ranger|rangers]]); The [[Cleveland Metroparks]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] [[Five Rivers Metroparks]] are also in the state. Other examples of large regional park systems are the [[Huron-Clinton Metroparks]] in southeast [[Michigan]]; and the [[Three Rivers Park District]] in [[Minnesota]].

====California====
{{See also|Category:Regional parks in California}}
The [[East Bay Regional Park District]] and [[Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District]] have extensive parklands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], protecting habitat and offering recreation.

===United Kingdom===
====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by [[subdivisions of Scotland|local authorities]].  Currently Scotland has three regional parks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/regional-parks|title=Regional parks|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SWEEPS-10''' is an extrasolar planet that, from June 2007 to August 2011, was the [[planet]] candidate with the shortest [[orbital period]] yet found, until [[PSR J1719-1438 b]] was discovered in 2011 with an even shorter orbit. The planet orbits the star SWEEPS J175902.00−291323.7 located in the [[Galactic bulge]] at a distance of approximately 22,000 [[light year]]s from [[Earth]] (based on a [[distance modulus]] of 14.1). 

It completes an orbit of its [[star]] (designated SWEEPS J175902.00−291323.7) in just 10 hours, and is categorized as an [[Hot_Jupiter#Ultra-short-period_Jupiters|ultra-short period planet]] (USPP). Located only 1.2 million kilometers from its star (roughly three times the distance between the Earth and the [[Moon]]), the planet is among the hottest ever detected; its estimated [[temperature]] is approximately 1,650 degrees [[Celsius]]. "This star-hugging planet must be at least 1.6 times the [[mass]] of [[Jupiter]], otherwise the star's gravitational muscle would pull the planet apart," said team leader Kailash Sahu of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Such USPPs seem to occur only around dwarf stars.

The small star's relatively low temperature allows the planet to exist. "USPPs occur preferentially around normal [[red dwarf]] stars that are smaller and cooler than our Sun," Sahu said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Jeremy|last=McGovern |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2006/10/hubbles-sweeps-16 |title=Hubble's SWEEPS 10 |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Astronomy Magazine |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Complex systems}}
'''Scalability''' is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|doi=10.1145/350391.350432|title=Characteristics of scalability and their impact on performance|conference=Proceedings of the second international workshop on Software and performance – WOSP '00|year=2000|last1=Bondi|first1=André B.|isbn=158113195X|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an [[economics|economic]] context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying [[business model]] offers the potential for [[economic growth]] within the company.

Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, {{cite journal|doi=10.1145/121973.121975|title=What is scalability?|year=1990|last1=Hill|first1=Mark D.|journal=ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|volume=18|issue=4|page=18}} and {{cite conference|doi=10.1145/1134285.1134460|title=A framework for modelling and analysis of software systems scalability|conference=Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering – ICSE '06|year=2006|last1=Duboc|first1=Leticia|last2=Rosenblum|first2=David S.|last3=Wicks|first3=Tony|isbn=1595933751|page=949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important. It is a highly significant issue in electronics systems, databases, routers, and networking. A system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added, is said to be a '''''scalable system'''''.

An [[algorithm]], design, [[Protocol (computing)|networking protocol]], [[Computer program|program]], or other system is said to ''scale'' if it is suitably [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient]] and practical when applied to large situations (e.g. a large input data set, a large number of outputs or users, or a large number of participating nodes in the case of a distributed system). If the design or system fails when a quantity increases, it ''does not scale''. In practice, if there are a large number of things ({{mvar|n}}) that affect scaling, then resource requirements (for example, algorithmic time-complexity) must grow less than {{mvar|n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{mvar|n}} increases. An example is a search engine, which scales not only for the number of users, but also for the number of objects it indexes. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in size as demand warrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/E_commerce.html?id=n4bUGAAACAAJ|title=E-commerce: Business, Technology, Society|first1=Kenneth Craig|last1=Laudon|first2=Carol Guercio|last2=Traver
|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall/Pearson Education|year=2008|isbn=9780136006459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The concept of scalability is desirable in technology as well as [[business]] settings. The base concept is consistent{{snd}} the ability for a business or technology to accept increased volume without impacting the [[contribution margin]] (= [[revenue]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; [[variable cost]]s). For example, a given piece of equipment may have a capacity for 1&amp;ndash;1000 users, while beyond 1000 users additional equipment is needed or performance will decline (variable costs will increase and reduce contribution margin).

Another example is the Incident Command System (ICS), the emergency management system used across response agencies in the United States.  ICS can scale resource coordination from a single-engine roadside brushfire to an interstate wildland fire, for example. The first resource on scene establishes IC, with authority to order resources and delegate responsibility within the span of control (managing five to seven officers, who will again delegate to up to seven, and on as the incident grows).  Senior officers assume command at the top as complexity warrants.  This proven system is remarkably simple, fully scalable and has been saving lives and property for nearly half a century.[http://amj.aom.org/content/44/6/1281.short]


Scalability can be measured in various dimensions, such as:

* ''Administrative scalability'': The ability for an increasing number of organizations or users to easily share a single distributed system.
* ''Functional scalability'': The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality at minimal effort.
* ''Geographic scalability'': The ability to maintain performance, usefulness, or usability regardless of expansion from concentration in a local area to a more distributed geographic pattern.
* ''Load scalability'': The ability for a [[distributed system]] to easily expand and contract its resource pool to accommodate heavier or lighter loads or number of inputs. Alternatively, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing load.
* ''Generation scalability'': The ability of a system to scale up by using new generations of components. Thereby, [[Open architecture|''heterogeneous scalability'']] is the ability to use the components from different vendors.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hesham El-Rewini and Mostafa Abd-El-Barr|title=Advanced Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing|url=https://books.google.ee/books?id=7JB-u6D5Q7kC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=parallel+architectures+scalability&amp;hl=et&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bQZtUtTKC6SO4gT27oC4Ag&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=parallel%20architectures%20scalability&amp;f=false|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=April 2005|isbn=978-0-471-47839-3|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;



* A [[routing protocol]] is considered scalable with respect to network size, if the size of the necessary [[routing table]] on each node grows as [[Big O notation|O]](log ''N''), where ''N'' is the number of nodes in the network.
* A scalable [[online transaction processing]] system or [[database management system]] is one that can be upgraded to process more transactions by adding new processors, devices and storage, and which can be upgraded easily and transparently without shutting it down.
* Some early [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) implementations of [[Gnutella]] had scaling issues. Each node query [[Query flooding|flooded]] its requests to all peers. The demand on each peer would increase in proportion to the total number of peers, quickly overrunning the peers' limited capacity. Other P2P systems like [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] scale well because the demand on each peer is independent of the total number of peers. There is no centralized bottleneck, so the system may expand indefinitely without the addition of supporting resources (other than the peers themselves).
* The distributed nature of the [[Domain Name System]] allows it to work efficiently even when all [[server (computing)|hosts]] on the worldwide [[Internet]] are served, so it is said to "scale well".

=={{Anchor|HORIZONTAL-SCALING|VERTICAL-SCALING}}Horizontal and vertical scaling==
Methods of adding more resources for a particular application fall into two broad categories: horizontal and vertical scaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4228359|conference=2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium|date=March 26, 2007|doi=10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370631|title=Scale-up x Scale-out: A Case Study using Nutch/Lucene|last1=Michael|first1=Maged|last2=Moreira|first2=Jose E.|last3=Shiloach|first3=Doron|last4=Wisniewski|first4=Robert W.|isbn=1-4244-0909-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* To '''scale horizontally''' (or '''scale out/in''') means to add more nodes to (or remove nodes from) a system, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. An example might involve scaling out from one Web server system to three. As computer prices have dropped and performance continues to increase, high-performance computing applications such as seismic analysis and biotechnology workloads have adopted low-cost "[[commodity server|commodity]]" systems for tasks that once would have required [[supercomputer]]s. System architects may configure hundreds of small computers in a [[computer cluster|cluster]] to obtain aggregate computing power that often exceeds that of computers based on a single traditional processor. The development of high-performance interconnects such as [[Gigabit Ethernet]], [[InfiniBand]] and [[Myrinet]] further fueled this model. Such growth has led to demand for software that allows efficient management and maintenance of multiple nodes, as well as hardware such as shared data storage with much higher I/O performance. ''Size scalability'' is the maximum number of processors that a system can accommodate.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;
* To '''scale vertically''' (or '''scale up/down''') means to add resources to (or remove resources from) a single node in a system, typically involving the addition of CPUs or memory to a single computer. Such vertical scaling of existing systems also enables them to use [[platform virtualization|virtualization]] technology more effectively, as it provides more resources for the hosted set of [[operating system]] and [[application software|application]] modules to share. Taking advantage of such resources can also be called "scaling up", such as expanding the number of [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] daemon processes currently running. ''Application scalability'' is the improved performance of running applications on a scaled-up version of the system.&lt;ref name="parallel_arch"/&gt;

There are tradeoffs between the two models. Larger numbers of computers means increased management complexity, as well as a more complex programming model and issues such as throughput and latency between nodes; also, [[Amdahl's Law|some applications do not lend themselves to a distributed computing model]]. In the past, the price difference between the two models has favored "scale up" computing for those applications that fit its paradigm, but recent advances in virtualization technology have blurred that advantage, since deploying a new virtual system over a [[hypervisor]] (where possible) is often less expensive than actually buying and installing a real one. Configuring an existing idle system has always been less expensive than buying, installing, and configuring a new one, regardless of the model.

'''Note that [[Network function virtualization|NFV]] defines these terms differently''': scaling out/in is the ability to scale by add/remove resource instances (e.g. virtual machine), whereas scaling up/down is the ability to scale by changing allocated resources (e.g. memory/CPU/storage capacity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Terminology for Main Concepts in NFV|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV003v010201p.pdf}} {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database scalability==
A number of different approaches enable [[database]]s to grow to very large size while supporting an ever-increasing rate of [[Transactions Per Second|transactions per second]]. The rapid pace of hardware advances in both the speed and capacity of [[mass storage]] devices, as well as similar advances in CPU and networking speed is also important.

One technique supported by most of the major [[Database management system|database management system (DBMS)]] products is the [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] of large tables, based on ranges of values in a key field. In this manner, the database can be ''scaled out'' across a cluster of separate [[database server]]s. Also, with the advent of 64-bit [[microprocessor]]s, [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] CPUs, and large [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP multiprocessors]], DBMS vendors have been at the forefront of supporting [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threaded]] implementations that substantially ''scale up'' [[transaction processing]] capacity.

[[Network-attached storage|Network-attached storage (NAS)]] and [[Storage area network|Storage area networks (SANs)]] coupled with fast local area networks and [[Fibre Channel]] technology enable still larger, more loosely coupled configurations of databases and distributed computing power. The widely supported [[X/Open XA]] standard employs a global transaction monitor to coordinate [[distributed transaction]]s among semi-autonomous XA-compliant database resources. [[Oracle RAC]] uses a different model to achieve scalability, based on a "shared-everything" architecture that relies upon high-speed connections between servers.

While DBMS vendors debate the relative merits of their favored designs, some companies and researchers question the inherent limitations of [[relational database management system]]s. [[GigaSpaces]], for example, contends that an entirely different model of distributed data access and transaction processing, [[space-based architecture]], is required to achieve the highest performance and scalability. On the other hand, [[Base One]] makes the case for extreme scalability without departing from mainstream relational database technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Base One|url=http://www.boic.com/scalability.htm|title=Database Scalability - Dispelling myths about the limits of database-centric architecture|year=2007|accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For specialized applications, [[NoSQL]] architectures such as Google's [[Bigtable]] can further enhance scalability. Google's horizontally distributed [[Spanner (distributed database technology)|Spanner]] technology, positioned as an relational alternative to Bigtable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Google|url=https://cloud.google.com/storage-options/|title=Choosing a storage option|year=2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, supports general-purpose [[database transaction]]s and provides a more conventional [[SQL]]-based query language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf|title=Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database|year= 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2012|isbn=978-1-931971-96-6|series=OSDI'12 Proceedings of the 10th USENIX conference on Operating Systems Design and Implementation|pages=251–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong versus eventual consistency (storage)==
In the context of scale-out [[Computer data storage|data storage]], scalability is defined as the maximum storage cluster size which guarantees full data consistency, meaning there is only ever one valid version of stored data in the whole cluster, independently from the number of redundant physical data copies. Clusters which provide "lazy" redundancy by updating copies in an asynchronous fashion are called [[Eventual consistency|'eventually consistent']]. This type of scale-out design is suitable when availability and responsiveness are rated higher than consistency, which is true for many web file hosting services or web caches (''if you want the latest version, wait some seconds for it to propagate''). For all classical transaction-oriented applications, this design should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eventual consistency by Werner Vogels|author=Sadek Drobi|url=http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/consistency-vs-availability|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=April 8, 2017|publisher=InfoQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open source and even commercial scale-out storage clusters, especially those built on top of standard PC hardware and networks, provide [[eventual consistency]] only. Idem some NoSQL databases like [[CouchDB]] and others mentioned above. Write operations invalidate other copies, but often don't wait for their acknowledgements. Read operations typically don't check every redundant copy prior to answering, potentially missing the preceding write operation. The large amount of metadata signal traffic would require specialized hardware and short distances to be handled with acceptable performance (i.e. act like a non-clustered storage device or database).

Whenever strong data consistency is expected, look for these indicators: 
* the use of InfiniBand, Fibrechannel or similar low-latency networks to avoid performance degradation with increasing cluster size and number of redundant copies. 
* short cable lengths and limited physical extent, avoiding signal runtime performance degradation.
* majority / quorum mechanisms to guarantee data consistency whenever parts of the cluster become inaccessible.

Indicators for [[Eventual consistency|eventually consistent]] designs (not suitable for transactional applications!) are:
* write performance increases linearly with the number of connected devices in the cluster.
* while the storage cluster is partitioned, all parts remain responsive. There is a risk of conflicting updates.

==Performance tuning versus hardware scalability==
It is often advised to focus system design on hardware scalability rather than on capacity. It is typically cheaper to add a new node to a system in order to achieve improved performance than to partake in [[performance tuning]] to improve the capacity that each node can handle. But this approach can have diminishing returns (as discussed in [[performance engineering]]). For example: suppose 70% of a program can be sped up if parallelized and run on multiple CPUs instead of one. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential, and &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction that can be parallelized, the maximum [[speedup]] that can be achieved by using P processors is given according to [[Amdahl's Law]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\alpha+\frac{1-\alpha} P}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the value for this example, using 4 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 4} = 2.105.&lt;/math&gt;

If we double the compute power to 8 processors we get

: &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {0.3+\frac{1-0.3} 8} = 2.581.&lt;/math&gt;

Doubling the processing power has only improved the speedup by roughly one-fifth. If the whole problem was parallelizable, the speed would also double. Therefore, throwing in more hardware is not necessarily the optimal approach.

==Weak versus strong scaling==
In the context of [[high performance computing]] there are two common notions of scalability:
* The first is ''strong scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed ''total'' problem size.
* The second is ''weak scaling'', which is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed problem size ''per processor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|title=The Weak Scaling of DL_POLY 3|publisher=STFC Computational Science and Engineering Department|accessdate=March 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307224104/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/cse/25052.aspx|archivedate=March 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Science &amp; Vie Junior''''' is a [[French language|French]] science [[magazine]] targeting children.The magazine is published by Mondadori France, a subsidiary of the Italian media company [[Mondadori]].&lt;ref name=mon&gt;{{cite web|title=Home &gt; Group &gt; Magazines &gt; France &gt; Science &amp; Vie Junior|url=http://www.mondadori.com/Group/Magazines/France/Science-Vie-Junior|work=Mondadori|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Science &amp; Vie Junior'' was started in 1989.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The magazine is published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The magazine is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[Science &amp; Vie]] made for teenagers. In 2010, it won the [[Grand prix des Médias]]. In 2012 the circulation of the monthly was 166,451 copies.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt;

==Sections of Science &amp; Vie Junior==
The magazine has 3 main parts.
* L'actu
* 100% Science
* MySVJ

=== L'actu ===
L'actu is the first section of the magazine. The main part of this section is news.

==== Cucaracha ====
Cucaracha is a comic in the L'actu section of the magazine. It is the first part of the section. It is about lives of [[cockroach]]es in [[society|human society]]. It was made by [[Marino Degano]], and [[Laurent Salles]].

Cucaracha cockroach is endowed with reason. With his small telescope, she is passionate about the sky and stars. But sometimes strange shadows infest his field of vision; These are Zoms who are struggling with frenzy. So rather than wait for the view emerges the heroine begins to watch them with a look relevant and sometimes critical.

The moral of this story... cockroaches need only be patient. One day the other, and will destroy the Zoms that day, they become "masters of the world".

Cucaracha is published monthly since November 2001 on the first page in Science et Vie Junior. The website presents a small selection of these stories.

==== Tout en images ====
Tout en images (All in images) is a part of L'actu. It takes an event that happened, gets lots of pictures. Then there are captions of one medium sized paragraph. Tout en images takes 7 pages most of the time.

==== Others ====
Another section explains news of different [[science]]s. It also has 1 citation from a person, and a piece of [[statistics]]. That is called "Le nombre" (The number). There is also a place called textos with no images. Just text. Also. there is a fake [[interview]] that has as example [[anti-hydrogen]].

=== 100% Sciences ===
100% Sciences is another section of the magazine. It has what is similar to the "Tout en images" but with less images. After, there are many long articles with 1 comic, experiments, [[technology]] tips, and [[math]] magic.

==Career==

===Economics (1983 – 2011)===
In 1983, he began his career as a freelance accountant in various small companies. From 1986 to 1991, Dr. Supeno served as Director of Finance and Accounting in PT. Singa Margana. Then, from 1990 to 1991, he served as President Director in BPR Disky Suryajaya and in 1991, he earned Brevet Tax Consultant from Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia. From 1991 to 1997, he was appointed as General Manager in South East Asia Bank (SEAB). Later, he continued his career as an Operational Coordinator of SEAB Liquidation Team. In 2002, he obtained license to be Registered Mutual FundRepresentative. In the same year, he was appointed as CEO in Shamrock Group company until 2011.

===Essays (1979 – 1987)===
In 1979, he received an award for his caricature from Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest newspaper in Japan. This achievement marked the beginning of his career in the field of press. Dr. Supeno then became a caricaturist, writer and journalist in BSF media (Bintang Sport Film). Furthermore, his essays were published in many daily newspapers in Medan, such as Harian Analisa, Bukit Barisan, Sinar Indonesia Baru (SIB) and BSF (Bintang Sport Film). He received numerous appreciations and awards for his essays. In 1981, he received an award from Ikatan Pers Mahasiswa (Students' Press Association)for student’s essays. In the next year, in 1982, Dr. Supeno received an award from Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa (Language Training and Development Center) for his literature essay writing. In 1987, Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia, Radius Prawiro, acknowledge him for his scientific article and popular article on tax. In the next year, he received an award from Pusat Penerangan ABRI and PWI Jaya (Indonesian Press Association) for his essay on defense and security of Republic of Indonesia. Furthermore, in the same year, he received an award from Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia as an Indonesian film critic.

===Environmental Field (1994 – 2015)===
He began his career in environmental field by doing research on Dioxin-Free since 1994. As he continued his research, he successfully completed his research and invention which was written in the book entitled “Dioxin-Free System” for preservation of the environment. This invention has received many world awards including award from MURI (Indonesia World Records Museum) as the first Dioxin-Free system in the world.
In 2000, Dr. Supeno became an active environmental activist and pioneer of Zero Burning in many plantations in Indonesia. In 2008, he established Buah Nabar Conservation in Sibolangit, Sumatera Utara, Indonesia. This conservation aims to become water catchments and storage areas for underground water which fill the wells in Medan and its surroundings to fulfill the needs of marginalized society. This conservation implements several methods, such as building thousands of biopores, planting trees, and preserving ecosystem in Buah Nabar region and its surroundings. In 2012, he was appointed as Director of Lembaga Konservasi dan Restorasi Hutan Indonesia (Institution of Indonesian Forest Conservation and Restoration) and Director of Lembaga Komunitas Peduli Masyarakat Marginal (Community Care for Marginalized Society). In 2015, he also established Yayasan REAL (Rekonstruksi Ekosistem Alam Lestari).

==Biotechnology==
Dr. Supeno began his career in Biology since he was in senior high school. His determination led him to join various courses and trainings in many countries. In 1998, he started his research on agriculture and organic palm plantation. Through the root analysis and nano particle implementation, he successfully produced more efficient organic fertilizers at lower cost and increased the production significantly. This implementation disproved the failure of the previous generation of organic fertilizers for perennials (especiallyoil palm). In 2008, he established PT. Propadu Konair Tarahubun (Plantation Key Technology/ PKT) which is the acronym for PROyek terPADU KONservasi AIR, TAnah, udaRA, HUtan, dan perkeBUNan (Integrated Project for Water, Earth, Air, Forests Conservation, and Plantations) as plantation professional and producer of organic fertilizers, biopesticides, bioherbicides. The implementation of nanotechnology is the foundation of the success of PT Propadu Konair Tarahubun&lt;ref&gt;[http://plantationkeytechnology.com/ PT. PKT]&lt;/ref&gt; (Plantation Key Technology/ PKT) as the pioneer of organic oil palm plant and CPO around the world and in Indonesia. He is also the first person in the world to invent a vaccine for Ganoderma disease in oil palm plantation. PKT is also the only company recognized by many parties for its success in preventing and handling basal stem rot disease (Ganoderma)in oil palm plantation.

==Research==
He began his research career in prevention of cancer, diabetes, infertility, and DNA damage by implementing Dioxin-Free system for the production, packaging, distribution and consumption processes. Dioxin-Free system has earned numerous world awards and making it the principle  to produce various foods and beverages which do not cause cancer (and other diseases). This mechanism is also implemented in PKT products.

==Ideas==
As a professional member of Institute of Nanotechnology in England and a pioneer who recommended the idea to implement nanotechnology in agriculture and plantation, he created NanoBiomimicry technique for oil palm, successfully producing fertilizers suitable for peat and other types of soil. As a member of Society for General Microbiology based in London, for over 30 years, he has consistently done research in microbiology, nanotechnology, and antibiotic development for human and plant.

==Findings==
Dr. Supeno obtained numerous patents (intellectual property rights) for his research in health, agriculture and food and beverage processing.

'''''Visible Language''''' is an American journal presenting visual communication research. Founded in 1967 as ''The Journal of Typographical Research'' by Merald Wrolstad, occasional ''Visible Language'' issues are co-edited with a guest editor-author. 

The journal was founded with the primary tenet of the journal being that reading and writing together form a new, separate, and autonomous language system. The journal has evolved to focus on research in visual communication. The journal has covered the subject of [[concrete poetry]], the [[Fluxus]] art movement, painted text, [[textual criticism]], the abstraction of symbols, [[articulatory synthesis]] and text, and the evolution of the page from print to on-screen display. Guest editor-authors have included [[Colin Banks]], [[John Cage]], [[Adrian Frutiger]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Richard Kostelanetz]], [[Craig J Saper|Craig Saper]], and [[George Steiner]].

The journal was edited for 26 years (1987-2012) by Sharon Poggenpohl of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology|Illinois Institute of Technology's]] [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]], with administrative offices at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. It is currently edited by Mike Zender of the University of Cincinnati, which publishes and provides administrative offices for the journal.
