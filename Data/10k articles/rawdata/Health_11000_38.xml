'''Aerial application''', or what was formerly referred to as '''crop dusting''', involves spraying crops with crop protection products from an [[agricultural aircraft]]. Planting certain types of seed are also included in aerial application. The specific spreading of fertilizer is also known as ''[[aerial topdressing]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; ''in some countries. Many countries have severely limited aerial application of [[pesticide]]s and other products because of environmental and public health hazards like [[Pesticide drift|spray drift]]; most notably, the [[European Union]] banned it outright with a few highly restricted exceptions in 2009,&lt;ref name=sprayBanEuro /&gt; effectively ending the practice in all member states.

Agricultural aircraft are highly specialized, purpose-built aircraft. Today's agricultural aircraft are often powered by turbine engines of up to 1500&amp;nbsp;hp and can carry as much as {{convert|800|USgal|l}} of crop protection product. [[Helicopter]]s are sometimes used, and some aircraft serve double duty as [[water bomber]]s in areas prone to [[wildfires]]. (These aircraft are referred to as SEAT, "single engine air tankers").

==History==

===Aerial Seed Sowing 1906===
The first known aerial application of agricultural materials was by John Chaytor, who in 1906 spread seed over a swamped valley floor in [[Wairoa]], [[New Zealand]], using a [[hot air balloon]] with mobile tethers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Aerial sowing of seed still continues to this day with cover crop applications and rice planting.

===Crop Dusting 1921===
[[Image:Etienne Dormoy and John A. Macready in front of 1st crop duster aircraft.JPG|Lt. Macready (right) and McCook Field engineer E. Dormoy (left) in front of the 1st crop duster airplane (August 3, 1921)|thumb|right]]The first known use of a heavier-than-air machine to disperse products occurred on 3 August 1921.&lt;ref name="JohnsonMary"&gt;Johnson, Mary Ann. ''McCook Field 1917-1927''. Landfall Press, Dayton, Ohio: 2002. {{ISBN|0-913428-84-1}}, pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop dusting was developed under the joint efforts of the US Agriculture Department, and the US Army Signal Corps's research station at [[McCook Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonMary" /&gt; Under the direction of McCook engineer [[Etienne Dormoy]], a [[United States Army Air Service]] [[Curtiss JN4]] Jenny piloted by [[John A. Macready]] was modified at McCook Field to spread [[lead arsenate]] to kill [[Ceratomia catalpae|catalpa sphinx]] [[caterpillars]] at a Catalapa farm near Troy, [[Ohio]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonMary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Harold R. Harris.&lt;ref name="JohnsonMary" /&gt; Use of [[insecticide]] and [[fungicide]] for crop dusting slowly spread in the Americas and to a lesser extent other nations in the 1930s. The name 'crop dusting' originated here, as actual dust was spread across the crops. Today, aerial applicators use liquid crop protection products in very small doses.

===Top dressing 1939–1946===
{{main|Aerial topdressing}}
Aerial topdressing is the aerial application of fertilisers over farmland using agricultural aircraft. It was developed in New Zealand in the 1940s and rapidly adopted elsewhere in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Purpose-built aircraft===
In 1951, Leland Snow begins designing the first aircraft specifically built for aerial application, the S-1. In 1957, The Grumman G-164 Ag-Cat is the first aircraft designed by a major company for ag aviation. Nowadays, the most common agricultural aircraft are the [[Air Tractor]], [[Cessna 188|Cessna Ag-wagon]], [[Gippsland GA200]], [[Grumman Ag Cat]], [[PZL-106 Kruk|PZL-106 KRUK]], [[M-18 Dromader]], [[PAC Fletcher]], [[Piper PA-36 Pawnee Brave]], [[Embraer EMB 202 Ipanema]], and [[Rockwell Thrush Commander]] but multi-purpose [[helicopter]]s are also used.

===Unmanned aerial application===

[[Image:YamahaRMax.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Yamaha R-MAX]], a [[unmanned aerial vehicles|UAV]] commonly used for aerial application in Japan.]]

Beginning in the late 1990s, [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] are also being used for agricultural spraying. This phenomenon started in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous terrain and relatively small family-owned farms required lower-cost and higher precision spraying. As of 2014, the use of UAV crop dusters, such as the [[Yamaha R-MAX]], is being expanded to the United States for use in spraying of vineyards.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Ackerman, [http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/aerial-robots/yamaha-demos-agricultural-robocopter Yamaha Demos Agricultural RoboCopter, But Humans Can't Unleash It Yet], [http://spectrum.ieee.org/ IEEE Spectrum], Oct. 16th 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Now they work long hours(10-12 hours a day) and almost everyday of the week.

==Bans==

Since the 1970s, multiple countries started to limit or ban aerial application of pesticides, [[fertilizer]]s and other products out of environmental and public health concerns, in particular from [[Pesticide drift|spray drift]]. Most notably, in 2009 the [[European Union]] prohibited aerial spraying of pesticides with a few highly restricted exceptions in article 9 of ''[[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 2009/128/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides'', which effectively ended most aerial application in all member states and overseas territories.&lt;ref name=sprayBanEuro&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0128&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses''' is a 1973 [[multilateral treaty]] whereby states agree to rules for the transport of [[cadaver|human corpse]]s across [[international border]]s. It is a treaty of the [[Council of Europe]] and as of 2013 has only been ratified by European states, but it is open to ratification by any state in the world. The Agreement was intended to replace and simplify the requirements of the 1937 '''International Convention on the Transport of Corpses'''.

==Content==
The Agreement mandates that every corpse being transported across international borders shall be accompanied by a ''[[Laissez-Passer|laissez-passer]]'' document issued by the state in which the transport begins. Transport may only be made in an impervious [[coffin]] that contains only the corpse and such personal effects as are to be [[burial|buried]] or [[cremation|cremated]] with the corpse. If the person died of an [[infectious disease]], the corpse must be wrapped in material that has been impregnated with an [[antiseptic]] solution. The Agreement also establishes the minimal standards for the coffins used for transporting corpses across international borders.

The Agreement does not apply to the transport of [[cremation]] [[wikt:ash|ash]]es.

==Signature, entry into force, and ratifications==
The Agreement was concluded in [[Strasbourg]] on 26 October 1973. Since then, it has been signed by 23 states. It entered into force on 11 November 1975 and has been ratified by the following 23 states:

}}
[[Germany]] signed the Agreement in 1974 but has not ratified it. The most recent ratification was by the Czech Republic in February 2012.

==Relationship to 1937 Convention==
The 1937 International Convention on the Transport of Corpses addresses the same issues as the 1973 Agreement. The 1973 Agreement simplifies some of the procedures and requirements that were first established in the 1937 Convention. For states that have ratified both treaties, the 1973 supersedes the 1937 Convention. However, the 1937 Convention remains in force for the following states that have ratified it but not the 1973 Agreement:

'''Agroecology''' is the study of [[applied ecology|ecological processes applied]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] production systems. Bringing [[ecology#Fundamental principles of ecology|ecological principles]] to bear in [[agroecosystem]]s can suggest novel management approaches that would not otherwise be considered. The term is often used imprecisely and may refer to "a science, a movement, [or] a practice".&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, A., Bellon, S., Doré, T., Francis, C., Vallod, D., David, C. (2009). Agroecology as a science, a movement or a practice. A review. Agronomy for Sustainable Development (published online)&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecologists study a variety of agroecosystems. The field of agroecology is not associated with any one particular method of [[farming]], whether it be [[Organic farming|organic]], [[Integrated farming|integrated]], or [[Industrial agriculture|conventional]], [[Intensive farming|intensive]] or [[Extensive farming|extensive]]. However, it has much more in common with organic and integrated farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wibblemann et al. (2013) Mainstreaming Agroecology: Implications for Global Food and Farming Systems. {{cite web |url=http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522154628/http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological strategy==
Agroecologists do not unanimously oppose technology or inputs in agriculture but instead assess how, when, and if technology can be used in conjunction with natural, social and human assets.&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, Jules. 2008. Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 363, 447-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecology proposes a context- or site-specific manner of studying agroecosystems, and as such, it recognizes that there is no universal formula or recipe for the success and maximum well-being of an agroecosystem.  Thus, agroecology is not defined by certain management practices, such as the use of [[Biological control|natural enemies]] in place of [[insecticides]], or [[polyculture]] in place of [[monoculture]].

Instead, agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: [[Ecology#Ecosystem productivity|productivity]], [[Ecological stability|stability]], [[sustainability]] and [[equitability]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gordon R. 1985. Agroecosystem analysis. Agricultural Administration, 20, 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to disciplines that are concerned with only one or some of these properties, agroecologists see all four properties as interconnected and integral to the success of an agroecosystem. Recognizing that these properties are found on varying spatial scales, agroecologists do not limit themselves to the study of agroecosystems at any one scale: gene-organism-population-community-ecosystem-landscape-biome, field-farm-community-region-state-country-continent-global.

Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

==Approaches==
Agroecologists do not always agree about what agroecology is or should be in the long-term. Different definitions of the term agroecology can be distinguished largely by the specificity with which one defines the term "ecology", as well as the term's potential political connotations. Definitions of agroecology, therefore, may be first grouped according to the specific contexts within which they situate agriculture.
Agroecology is defined by the [[OECD]] as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=81 Agroecology], Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; This definition refers to the "-ecology" part of "agroecology" narrowly as the natural environment. Following this definition, an agroecologist would study agriculture's various relationships with [[soil health]], water quality, air quality, meso- and micro-fauna, surrounding flora, environmental toxins, and other environmental contexts.

A more common definition of the word can be taken from Dalgaard et al., who refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment within agricultural systems.  Consequently, agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, including factors from [[agronomy]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; In this case, the "-ecology" portion of "agroecology is defined broadly to include social, cultural, and economic contexts as well. Francis et al. also expand the definition in the same way, but put more emphasis on the notion of food systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

Agroecology is also defined differently according to geographic location. In the global south, the term often carries overtly political connotations. Such political definitions of the term usually ascribe to it the goals of social and economic justice; special attention, in this case, is often paid to the traditional farming knowledge of indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroecology.org Agroecology.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422150352/http://www.agroecology.org/ |date=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American and European uses of the term sometimes avoid the inclusion of such overtly political goals. In these cases, agroecology is seen more strictly as a scientific discipline with less specific social goals.

===Agro-population ecology===
This approach is derived from the science of ecology primarily based on [[population ecology]], which over the past three decades has been displacing the ecosystems biology of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]].  Buttel explains the main difference between the two categories, saying that "the application of population ecology to agroecology involves the primacy not only of analyzing agroecosystems from the perspective of the [[population dynamics]] of their constituent species, and their relationships to [[climate]] and [[biogeochemistry]], but also there is a major emphasis placed on the role of [[genetics]]."&lt;ref name=buttel&gt;Buttel, Frederick. "Envisioning the Future Development of Farming in the USA: Agroecology between Extinction and Multifunctionality?" New Directions in Agroecology Research and Education (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous agroecology===

This concept was proposed by political ecologist Josep Garí to recognise and uphold the integrated agro-ecological practices of many indigenous peoples, who simultaneously and sustainably safeguard, manage and use ecosystems for agricultural, food, biodiversity and cultural purposes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2001). Biodiversity and Indigenous Agroecology in Amazonia. Etnoecologica 5 (7): 21-37&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous agroecologies are not systems and practices halted in time, but keep co-evolving with new knowledge and resources, such as that provided by development projects, research initiatives and agro-biodiversity exchanges. In fact, the first agro-ecologists were indigenous peoples that advocated development policies and programmes to support their systems, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2000).

===Inclusive agroecology===
Rather than viewing agroecology as a subset of agriculture, Wojtkowski&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Introduction to Agroecology: Principles and Practices. Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, 404p.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a more encompassing perspective. In this, natural ecology and agroecology are the major headings under ecology. Natural ecology is the study of organisms as they interact with and within natural environments. Correspondingly, agroecology is the basis for the land-use sciences. Here humans are the primary governing force for organisms within planned and managed, mostly terrestrial, environments.

As key headings, natural ecology and agroecology provide the theoretical base for their respective sciences. These theoretical bases overlap but differ in a major way. Economics has no role in the functioning of natural ecosystems whereas economics sets direction and purpose in agroecology.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.

Beyond this, the land-use sciences further subdivide. The subheadings include agronomy, [[organic farming]], traditional agriculture, [[permaculture]], and [[silviculture]]. Within this system of subdivisions, agroecology is philosophically neutral. The importance lies in providing a theoretical base hitherto lacking in the land-use sciences. This allows progress in biocomplex agroecosystems including the multi-species plantations of forestry and agroforestry.

==Applications==
To arrive at a point of view about a particular way of farming, an agroecologist would first seek to understand the contexts in which the farm(s) is(are) involved. Each farm may be inserted in a unique combination of factors or contexts. Each farmer may have their own premises about the meanings of an agricultural endeavor, and these meanings might be different from those of agroecologists. Generally, farmers seek a configuration that is viable in multiple contexts, such as family, financial, technical, political, logistical, market, environmental, spiritual. Agroecologists want to understand the behavior of those who seek livelihoods from plant and animal increase, acknowledging the organization and planning that is required to run a farm.

===Views on organic and non-organic milk production===

Because [[organic agriculture]] proclaims to sustain the health of soils, ecosystems, and people,&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM (International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movements)&lt;/ref&gt; it has much in common with Agroecology;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} this does not mean that Agroecology is synonymous with organic agriculture, nor that Agroecology views organic farming as the 'right' way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, it is important to point out that there are large differences in [[Organic food|organic standards]] among countries and certifying agencies.

Three of the main areas that agroecologists would look at in farms, would be: the environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and the social aspects.

Environmental impacts caused by organic and non-organic milk production can vary significantly. For both cases, there are positive and negative environmental consequences.

Compared to conventional milk production, [[organic milk]] production tends to have lower [[eutrophication]] potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, I J. M. 2003. Environmental impact assessment of conventional and organic milk production. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A key component of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated in one of the basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered – such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum [[forage]] proportion in the [[ruminant]] diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on [[pasture]] and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds.&lt;ref&gt;Hovi, M. el al. 2003. Animal health and welfare in organic livestock production in Europe: current state and future challenges. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 41–53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.&lt;ref&gt;Bennedsgaard, T.W. et al. 2003. Eleven years of organic dairy production in Denmark: herd health and production related to time of conversion and compared to conventional production. Livestock production science. Vol 80, p 121-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects of dairy enterprises include life quality of farmers, of farm labor, of rural and urban communities, and also includes public health.

Both organic and non-organic farms can have good and bad implications for the [[life quality]] of all the different people involved in that [[food chain]]. Issues like labor conditions, labor hours and labor rights, for instance, do not depend on the organic/non-organic characteristic of the farm; they can be more related to the socio-economical and cultural situations in which the farm is inserted, instead.

As for the public health or [[food safety]] concern, [[organic foods]] are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

In an organic dairy farm, an agroecologist could evaluate the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability, for instance by efficiently increasing the [[productivity]] of the animals to minimize [[waste]] of feed and of land use?
# Are there ways to improve the [[animal health|health status]] of the herd (in the case of organics, by using [[biological pest control|biological controls]], for instance)?
# Does this way of farming sustain good [[quality of life]] for the [[farmer]]s, their families, [[farmworker|rural labor]] and communities involved?

===Views on no-till farming===

[[no-till farming|No-tillage]] is one of the components of [[conservation agriculture]] practices and is considered more environmental friendly than complete [[tillage]].&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres&gt;Garcia-Torres, L. et al. 2002. Summary of the Workshop on Soil Protection and Sustainable Agriculture organized by the EU Commission DG Environment and the DG Environmental Quality of the Spanish Ministry of Environment (Soria, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branco, H. and Lal, R. 2008. Principles of Conservation Management. No Tillage-Farming (Ch.8). Springer Verlag. Netherlands. P. 195&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus that no-till can increase carbon content of topsoils, especially when combined with cover crops, but whether this improves the function of soils as a carbon sink is contested.&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolliger, A. et al. 2006. Taking stock of the Brazilian "Zero Till Revolution": A review of landmark research and farmers' practice. Adv. Agron. Vol 91, p 47–110&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Baker, J. M., Ochsner, T. E., Venterea, R. T., &amp; Griffis, T. J. (2007). Tillage and soil carbon sequestration—What do we really know?. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment, 118(1-4), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Powlson, D. S., Stirling, C. M., Jat, M. L., Gerard, B. G., Palm, C. A., Sanchez, P. A., &amp; Cassman, K. G. (2014). Limited potential of no-till agriculture for climate change mitigation. Nature Climate Change, 4(8), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

No-till can contribute to higher [[soil organic matter]] and organic carbon content in soils,&lt;ref name=Calegari&gt;Calegari, A. et al. 2008. Impact of Long-Term No-Tillage and Cropping System Management on Soil Organic Carbon in an Oxisol: A Model for Sustainability. Agronomy Journal. Vol 100, Issue 4, p 1013-1019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, T. and Post, W. 2002. Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration Rates by Tillage and Crop Rotation: A Global Data Analysis. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 66:1930–1946&lt;/ref&gt; though reports of no-effects of no-tillage in organic matter and organic carbon soil contents also exist, depending on environmental and crop conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, P.L.O.A. and Silva, C.A. 2001. Soil management under no-tillage systems in the tropics with special reference to Brazil. Nutr. Cycling Agroecosyst. Vol 61, p 119–130&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, no-till can indirectly reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Calegari /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, N. et al. 2003. Fuel consumption-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment. Vol 99, p 213–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crops can benefit from the practice of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fleizo et al. 2002"&gt;Fleizo et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koller&gt;Koller, K. 2003. Techniques of soil tillage. Ed. Adel El Titi ([[CRC Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of [[strip-till]] with no-till areas.&lt;ref name=Koller/&gt; Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.

The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations,&lt;ref&gt;Pavuk, D.M. 1994. Influence of weeds within Zea mays crop plantings on populations of adult Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment. Vol 50, p 165-175&lt;/ref&gt; which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Brust, B. Stinner &amp; D. McCartney. 1986. Predator activity and predation in corn agroecosystems. Environmental Entomology 15:1017-1021&lt;/ref&gt;

In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, G.W., and P.R. Hill. 2000. Fall strip-tillage systems. p. 193–199. In R.C. Reeder (ed.) Conservation tillage systems and management. MWPS-45, 2nd ed. Iowa State Univ., Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Licht, M.A. and Al-Kaisi, M. 2005. Strip-tillage effect on seedbed soil temperature and other soil physical properties. Soil and Tillage Research. Vol 80, p 233-249&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to [[pathogen]]s, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds,&lt;!-- I thought tillage caused more weed problems than no-till? This is one of the main reasons no-tillage is practiced --&gt; it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, [[mulch-till]] and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

In a no-till system, an agroecologist could&lt;!-- Would they ask these questions? Where did this section originate?--&gt; ask the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability; for instance by efficiently increasing the productivity of the crops to minimize land use?
# Does this way of farming sustain good quality of life for the farmers, their families, rural labor and [[communities|rural communities]] involved?

==History==

===Pre-WWII===
The notions and ideas relating to crop ecology have been around since at least 1911 when [[Franklin Hiram King|F.H. King]] released ''Farmers of Forty Centuries''. King was one of the pioneers as a proponent of more quantitative methods for characterization of water relations and physical properties of soils.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Francis |date=2003 |title=Agroecology: the ecology of food systems |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99–118 |doi=10.1300/J064v22n03_10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s the attempt to merge agronomy and ecology was born with the development of the field of crop ecology. Crop ecology's main concern was where crops would be best grown.&lt;ref name=gliess&gt;Gliessman, Stephen. R  Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was only in 1928 that agronomy and ecology were formally linked by Klages.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klages, K.H.W. 1928. Crop ecology and ecological crop geography in the agronomic curriculum. J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 20:336-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the term agroecology was in 1928, with the publication of the term by Bensin in 1928.&lt;ref name=wezel/&gt; The book of Tischler (1965), was probably the first to be actually titled 'agroecology'.&lt;ref&gt;Tischler, W. (1965). Agrarökologie. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 499 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the different components (plants, animals, soils and climate) and their interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of human [[agricultural management]] on these components. Other books dealing with agroecology, but without using the term explicitly were published by the German zoologist Friederichs (1930) with his book on agricultural zoology and related ecological/environmental factors for plant protection,&lt;ref&gt;Friederichs, K. (1930) Die Grundfragen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten der land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Zoologie. Vol. 1: Ökologischer Teil, Vol. 2: Wirtschaftlicher Teil. Verlagsbuchhandlung Paul Parey, Berlin, Germany, 417 and 443 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and by American crop physiologist Hansen in 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, B., Alrøe, H.F., Kristensen, E.S., 2001. Approaches to assess the [[environmental impact]] of [[organic agriculture|organic farming]] with particular regard to Denmark. Agric. Ecosys. Environ. 83, 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt; when both used the word as a synonym for the application of ecology within agriculture.&lt;ref name=dalgaard&gt;Dalgaard, Tommy, and Nicholas Hutchings, John Porter. "Agroecology, Scaling and Interdisciplinarity." Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 100(2003): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This sentence seems self-contradictory. I.e., did they use the term or not?|date=July 2016}}

===Post-WWII===
Gliessman mentions that post-WWII, groups of scientists with ecologists gave more focus to experiments in the natural environment, while [[agronomist]]s dedicated their attention to the cultivated systems in agriculture.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; According to Gliessman,&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; the two groups kept their research and interest apart until books and articles using the concept of agroecosystems and the word agroecology started to appear in 1970.&lt;ref name=wezel&gt;Wezel, A., Soldat, V. (2009). A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline agroecology. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 7 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalgaard&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; explains the different points of view in ecology schools, and the fundamental differences, which set the basis for the development of agroecology.  The early ecology school of [[Henry Gleason]] investigated plant populations focusing in the [[hierarchical]] levels of the organism under study.

Friederich Clement's ecology school, however included the organism in question as well as the higher hierarchical levels in its investigations, a "landscape perspective".  However, the ecological schools where the roots of agroecology lie are even broader in nature. The ecology school of [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]],&lt;!--(1935)--&gt; whose view included both the biotic organism and their environment, is the one from which the concept of agroecosystems emerged in 1974 with Harper.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J.L., 1974. Agric. Ecosyst. Agroecosyst. 1, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the increasing awareness of how humans manage the landscape and its consequences set the stage for the necessary cross between agronomy and ecology. Even though, in many ways the [[environmental movement]] in the US was a product of the times, the  {{clarify|text=Green Decade,|date=July 2016}} spread an environmental awareness of the [[unintended consequence]]s of changing ecological processes. Works such as ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and  ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and  changes in legislation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] caused the public to be aware of societal growth patterns, agricultural production, and the overall capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;

===Fusion with ecology===
After the 1970s, when agronomists saw the value of ecology and ecologists began to use the agricultural systems as study plots, studies in agroecology grew more rapidly.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; Gliessman describes that the innovative work of Prof. Efraim Hernandez X., who developed research based on [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous systems of knowledge]] in [[Mexico]], led to education programs in agroecology.&lt;ref name=qFran&gt;qtd. in Francis ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Efraim Hernandez X. explained that modern agricultural systems had lost their ecological foundation when [[socio-economic]] factors became the only driving force in the [[food system]].&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; The acknowledgement that the socio-economic interactions are indeed one of the fundamental components of any agroecosystems came to light in 1982, with the article Agroecologia del Tropico Americano by Montaldo. The author argues that the socio-economic context cannot be separated from the agricultural systems when designing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

In 1995 Edens et al. in Sustainable Agriculture and Integrated Farming Systems solidified this idea proving his point by devoting special sections to economics of the systems, ecological impacts, and ethics and values in agriculture.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; Actually, 1985 ended up being a fertile and creative year for the new discipline. For instance in the same year, [[Miguel Altieri]] integrated how consolidation of the farms, and cropping systems impact pest populations. In addition, Gliessman highlighted that socio-economic, technological, and ecological components give rise to producer choices of food production systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; These pioneering agroecologists have helped to frame the foundation of what we today consider the interdisciplinary field of agroecology and have led to advances in a number of farming systems. In Asian rice, for example, crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields has recently been demonstrated to reduce pests so effectively (by the flower nectar attracting and supporting parasitoids and predators) that insecticide spraying is reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% [http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 (Gurr et al., 2016)].

== By region ==

The principles of agroecology are expressed differently depending on local ecological and social contexts.

=== Latin America ===

{{Main article|Agroecology in Latin America}}
Latin America's experiences with North American Green Revolution agricultural techniques have opened space for agroecologists.  Traditional or [[indigenous knowledge]] represents a wealth of possibility for agroecologists, including "exchange of wisdoms".  See Miguel Alteiri's ''Enhancing the Productivity of Latin American Traditional Peasant Farming Systems Through an Agroecological Approach'' for information on agroecology in Latin America.

Agroecological techniques and knowledge played an important role in solving the severe food crisis in [[Cuba]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Funes |first1=Fernando |last2=García |first2=Luis |last3=Bourque |first3=Martin |last4=Pérez |first4=Nilda |last5=Rosset |first5=Peter |title=Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba |location= Oakland, CA |publisher=Food First Books |isbn=0-935028-87-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Cuba's urban agricultural movement, agroecology is integral to production in Cuban [[organopónico|organopónicos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

Historically, agroecology has had low traction in Africa, as governments, international organisations, extension services and farmers' organisations tended to focus on issues of inputs and outputs as the defining factors to deal with recurrent food crises and chronic malnutrition in the continent. Agrocecology was only a minor proposal from a few, non-governmental, small-scale projects and a sort of "experimental" idea of the Farmer Field Schools programme.

In the early 2000s, when the AIDS pandemic was creating a major rural crisis across Africa, Josep Garí proposed FAO to consider an agroecological approach as the most effective way to empower farmers cope with the impacts of the AIDS pandemic on agriculture and food production: in particular, he proposed agro-biodiversity as a key resource and knowledge for farmers to address the labour and malnutrition crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2003). Agrobiodiversity strategies to combat food insecurity and HIV/AIDS impact in rural Africa. FAO / Population and Development Service, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rapidly adopted by the Farmer Field Schools scheme across the world, and even presented and translated in China.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2004). Plant diversity, sustainable rural livelihoods and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Bangkok: UNDP &amp; FAO, 2004. Published in English and Chinese. {{ISBN|974-92021-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, agroecology has started to permeate projects and discourses on farming and natural-resource management in Africa. In 2011, the 1st encounter of agroecology trainers took place in Zimbabwe and issued the Shashe Declaration.

=== Madagascar ===
{{Main article|Agroecology in Madagascar}}
Most of the historical farming in Madagascar has been conducted by indigenous peoples.  The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by natives in Madagascar for centuries.  As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are wood, charcoal and grass for [[Zebu]] grazing.  These practices have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">The '''Catholic Health Association of the United States''' ('''CHA''') was founded in 1915 as the '''Catholic Hospital Association of the United States and Canada'''. The association has offices in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. 

==Description==
The association is a ministry of the Roman Catholic Church.  Comprising more than 600 hospitals and 1,400 long-term care and other health facilities in all 50 states, the association is the largest group of non-profit health care providers in the nation.

Every year, one in six hospitalized patients{{how many?|what are total numbers?|date=April 2012}} in the United States is cared for in a Catholic health care facility.  In addition, thousands of elders{{how many?|date=April 2012}} in the U.S. live and are cared for in Catholic long-term care and other continuum of care facilities.

The association is led by Sister [[Carol Keehan]], a member of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]], who assumed her duties as president and chief executive officer in 2005.

==Controversy==
CHA created a controversy within the Catholic Church when it defied the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and came out in support of [[Barack Obama]]'s health care overhaul, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/07/religious-groups-object-to-covering-birth-control/|title=Religious Groups Fear Health Law's Birth Control Loophole Too Narrow|date=7 August 2011|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USCCB believed the overhaul could provide for taxpayer funded abortion; the CHA said this was a "false claim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124784784|title=Catholic Hospitals, Bishops Split On Health Care Bill|date=March 17, 2010|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHA was criticized for subverting the bishops' authority. At least one bishop, [[Thomas Joseph Tobin]] of the [[Diocese of Providence]], withdrew his diocese's hospitals from membership in the CHA, saying, "Your enthusiastic support of the legislation, in contradiction of the bishops of the United States, provided an excuse for members of Congress, misled the public and caused a serious scandal for many members of the church" and said it was "embarrassing" to be associated with the CHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100319/AP09/303199881|title=Bishop bans RI hosps from pro-health reform group|publisher=Omaha World-Herald|date=2010-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912220132/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100319/AP09/303199881|archivedate=2012-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Archbishop]] [[Joseph Fred Naumann|Joseph Naumann]] said Keehan, who met with Obama before endorsing the bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0310/courting_catholics_e564233a-2aae-4a1c-8828-8e84a66b3f74.html|title=Obama met with CHA's Keehan - POLITICO 44|first=Glenn|last=Thrush|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "incredibly naive or disingenuous" for saying that the bill prevented taxpayer funding of abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2010/mar/10031704|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111181248/http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2010/mar/10031704|archivedate=2011-01-11|date=March 17, 2010|title=Archbishop Rips ‘Naive or Disingenuous’ CHA for Support for Pro-Abort Health Bill|first=Peter J.|last=Smith|website=LifeSiteNews|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francis George]], who was president of the USCCB at the time, reported that he and other bishops tried to reach out to Keehan both before and after the vote; he also said that in choosing Obama over the Church, she had "weakened the moral voice of the bishops in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/cardinal-george-sr.-keehan-chose-obama-over-catholic-bishops/|title=Cardinal George: Sr. Keehan chose Obama over Catholic bishops|publisher=Catholic News Agency|date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early termination of pregnancy===
Catholic hospitals are also subject of an ongoing controversy centered around emergency help for miscarrying women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/05/hospitals-pregnancy-abortion-reproductive-healthcare-catholic-rules-report?CMP=fb_gu|title=Report: hundreds of US hospitals follow Catholic rules on reproductive care|first=Molly|last=Redden|date=May 5, 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual basis ==

=== Philosophy ===
Chiropractic is generally categorized as [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM),&lt;ref name=Chapman-Smith/&gt; which focuses on manipulation of the [[musculoskeletal system]], especially the [[vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref name=Nelson /&gt; Its founder, D.D. Palmer, called it "a science of healing without drugs".&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval/&gt;

Chiropractic's origins lie in the [[folk medicine]] of [[bonesetter|bonesetting]],&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval /&gt; and as it evolved it incorporated [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; Its early philosophy was based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]], which helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession.&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; and relies on deductions from vitalistic first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /&gt; However, most practitioners tend to incorporate scientific research into chiropractic,&lt;ref name="Keating05" /&gt; and most practitioners are "mixers" who attempt to combine the materialistic [[reductionism]] of science with the [[metaphysics]] of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]].&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /&gt; A 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in [[critical thinking]] and evidence-based research.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy DR, Schneider MJ, Seaman DR, Perle SM, Nelson CF | title = How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

Although a wide diversity of ideas exist among chiropractors,&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; they share the belief that the spine and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Gay RE, Nelson CF |chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|veditors=Wainapel SF, Fast A |title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chiropractors claim spinal manipulation can have an effect of a variety of ailments such as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=nhs-choices&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiropractic/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Chiropractic |publisher=[[NHS Choices]] |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiropractic philosophy includes the following perspectives:&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm|chapter= Chiropractic belief systems|vauthors=Mootz RD, Phillips RB |year=1997|title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|pages=9–16|veditors=Cherkin DC, Mootz RD |accessdate=2008-02-14|location= Rockville, MD|publisher= [[Agency for Health Care Policy and Research]]|oclc=39856366}} AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holism]] assumes that health is affected by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or [[Existentialism|existential]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freeman J | title = Towards a definition of holism | journal = Br J Gen Pract | volume = 55 | issue = 511 | pages = 154–55 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15720949 | pmc = 1463203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, [[#Vertebral subluxation|vertebral subluxation]].&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt; [[Homeostasis]] emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities.

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain metaphysical definitions and vitalistic qualities.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "innate intelligence" exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies into their practice style.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (e.g., perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment).&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Although considered the minority group, "they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers."&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt;

''Mixer'' chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from chiropractic, medical and/or osteopathic viewpoints and make up the majority of chiropractors.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and hence they tend to be open to mainstream medicine.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt; Many of them incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ conventional treatments including techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[stretching]], [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, [[electrical muscle stimulation]], [[therapeutic ultrasound]], and [[moist heat]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Some mixers also use techniques from alternative medicine, including [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt;

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term "vertebral subluxation complex", and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; A 2008 survey of 6,000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing [[visceral disorder]]s, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions.&lt;ref name=Smith-Carber /&gt; The same survey showed that most chiropractors generally believed that the majority of their clinical approach for addressing musculoskeletal/biomechanical disorders such as back pain was based on subluxation.&lt;ref name=Smith-Carber&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[National University of Health Sciences#Publications|Journal of Chiropractic Humanities]]|year=2008|volume=15|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|vauthors=Smith M, Carber LA|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234244/http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-04-25|doi=10.1016/s1556-3499(13)60166-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors often offer conventional therapies such as physical therapy and lifestyle counseling, and it may for the lay person be difficult to distinguish the unscientific from the scientific.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2002&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zHxockt9CWQC|title=Spin Doctors: The Chiropractic Industry Under Examination|last=Benedetti|first=Paul|last2=MacPhail|first2=Wayne|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781550024067|language=en|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{Main|Vertebral subluxation}}

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself.&lt;ref name=History-PPC&gt;{{cite book|author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]]|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|veditors = Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ.&lt;ref name=Keating1995 /&gt; D. D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and philosophical meaning.&lt;ref name=Keating1995 /&gt; He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.&lt;ref name=Keating1995&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|format=PDF|title= D. D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic|author= Keating J. C. Jr|publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]]|year=1995|accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B. J. Palmer, and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic from conventional medicine. In 1910, D. D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:"[[Physiologist]]s divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]]. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality&amp;nbsp;– too much or not enough action&amp;nbsp;– which is disease."&lt;ref name=ChiropractorsAdjuster1910 /&gt;
[[File:Xray Machine Champion Chiropractic.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Chiropractors use [[x-ray radiography]] to examine the bone structure of a patient.]]
Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation /&gt; In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keating JC, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF | title = Subluxation: dogma or science? | journal = Chiropr Osteopat | volume = 13 | issue =  | page = 17 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16092955 | pmc = 1208927 | doi = 10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[J Chiropr Educ]]|year=2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=71–77|title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics|vauthors=Rose KA, Adams A|url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002073736/http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-02|format=PDF|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[J Man Manip Ther]]|year=2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=E14–18|title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor|author=Homola S|url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[vertebral subluxation|chiropractic subluxation]] was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines /&gt; It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity."&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines /&gt; This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[Radio diagnostics|X-rays]].&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines&gt;{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposes patients to harmful [[ionizing radiation]] for no evidentially supported reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=HJ|title=Awareness of radiographic guidelines for low back pain: a survey of Australian chiropractors.|journal=Chiropractic &amp; manual therapies|date=5 October 2016|volume=24|page=39|doi=10.1186/s12998-016-0118-7|pmc=5051064|pmid=27713818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ammendolia /&gt; The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist."&lt;ref name=Trick-or-Treatment&gt;{{cite book|pages=145–90|chapter=The truth about chiropractic therapy|title=Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine |last1=Singh |first1=S |last2=Ernst |first2=E |year=2008|publisher=W.W.

As of 2014, the [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] states "The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction.

Spinal manipulation, which chiropractors call "spinal adjustment" or "chiropractic adjustment", is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques /&gt; Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP /&gt; Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP /&gt; High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation.&lt;ref name=Pickar2007 /&gt; Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.&lt;ref name=Pickar2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W | title = Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control | journal = Spine J | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 583–95 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17905321 | pmc = 2075482 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Spinal manipulation policy statement|vauthors=Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS|accessdate=2008-05-24|year=2003|publisher=American Chiropractic Association|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114044/http://www.acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 systematic review suggested that the use of spine manipulation in clinical practice is a [[cost-effective]] treatment when used alone or in combination with other treatment approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michaleff ZA, Lin CW, Maher CG, van Tulder MW | title = Spinal manipulation epidemiology: Systematic review of cost effectiveness studies | journal = J Electromyogr Kinesiol | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 655–62 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22429823 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 systematic review found evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of using spinal manipulation for the treatment of sub-acute or chronic low back pain; the results for acute low back pain were insufficient.&lt;ref name=Lin2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin CW, Haas M, Maher CG, Machado LA, van Tulder MW | title = Cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for low back pain: a systematic review | journal = European Spine Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 1024–38 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21229367 | pmc = 3176706 | doi = 10.1007/s00586-010-1676-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 systematic cost-effectiveness review found that the reported cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation in the United Kingdom compared favorably with other treatments for back pain, but that reports were based on data from clinical trials without sham controls and that the specific cost-effectiveness of the treatment (as opposed to non-specific effects) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canter PH, Coon JT, Ernst E | title = Cost-Effectiveness of Complementary Therapies in the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– A Systematic Review† | journal = [[Evid Based Complement Alternat Med]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17173105 | pmc = 1697737 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nel044 | url = http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154423/http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425 | archivedate = 2008-05-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 American systematic review of economic evaluations of conservative treatments for low back pain found that significant quality problems in available studies meant that definite conclusions could not be drawn about the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Roer N, Goossens ME, Evers SM, van Tulder MW | title = What is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with low back pain? a systematic review | journal = [[Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol]] | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15949783 | doi = 10.1016/j.berh.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.&lt;ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C /&gt;

A 2010 study by questionnaire presented to UK chiropractors indicated only 45% of chiropractors disclosed with patients the serious risk associated with manipulation of the cervical spine and that 46% believed there was possibility of patient would refuse treatment if risk correctly explained.

== History ==
{{Main|History of chiropractic}}
[[File:Harvey Lillard.jpg|thumb|left|169px|[[William Harvey Lillard|Harvey Lillard]], first chiropractic patient]]
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.&lt;ref name=Baer /&gt; The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was [[Harvey Lillard]], a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a "pop" in his spine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Chiropractic competed with its predecessor osteopathy, another medical system based on magnetic healing and [[bonesetting]]; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.&lt;ref name=Baer&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Med Anthropol Q |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–93 |title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States |author=Baer HA |doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of innate intelligence, a [[vitalistic]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; D.D. Palmer said he "received chiropractic from the other world".&lt;ref name=Religion&gt;[http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic]&amp;nbsp;–  Letter from D.D. Palmer to P.W. Johnson, D.C., May 4, 1911. In the letter, he often refers to himself with [[Royal we|royal third person terminology]] and also as "Old Dad".&lt;/ref&gt; D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|format=PDF|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic: Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C|date=1911-05-04|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;
[[File:Bartlett joshua palmer.JPG|thumb|right|169px|[[B. J. Palmer]], early developer of chiropractic]]
Chiropractic has seen considerable [[Chiropractic controversy and criticism|controversy and criticism]].&lt;ref name=DeVocht /&gt;&lt;ref name=Homola/&gt; Although D.D. and B.J. were "straight" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called "mixers", advocated the use of instruments.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; In 1910, B.J. changed course and endorsed X-rays as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s, chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; DD Palmer was jailed in 1907 for practicing medicine without a license.&lt;ref name=Jail&gt;[http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/Gregory,Alva-chrono.pdf] — Chiro.org&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for [[Health care provider#Practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]], and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; To defend against medical statutes, B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors "analyzed" rather than "diagnosed", and "adjusted" subluxations rather than "treated" disease.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an "unscientific [[cult]]" in 1966,&lt;ref name=Chiro-PH&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE, Globe G, Green BN, Haneline M, Hawk C, Injeyan HS, Killinger L, Kopansky-Giles D, Lisi AJ, Mior SA, Smith M | title = Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 397–410 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18722194 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1980 advised its members that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with "unscientific practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherkin D | title = AMA policy on chiropractic | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 79 | issue = 11 | pages = 1569–70 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2817179 | pmc = 1349822 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a }}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, ''[[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk v. AMA]]'', in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt;

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.&lt;ref name=History-Primer&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiropractic history: a primer |author1=Keating JC Jr |author2=Cleveland CS III |author3=Menke M |url=http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher=Association for the History of Chiropractic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011335/http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt; However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, evidence-based medicine insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, managed care restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt; The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into alternative medicine and primary care.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt;

The word ''chiropractic'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χειρο- ''[[wikt:chiro#English|chiro-]]'' (itself from [[wikt:χείρ#Ancient Greek|χείρ]] ''cheir'' "hand"), "hand" and [[wikt:πρακτικός#Ancient Greek|πρακτικός]] ''praktikos'', "practical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiropractic |title=Definition of ''chiropractic'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiro- |title=Definition of ''chiro-'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractic is classified as a field of [[pseudomedicine]] on account of its [[esoteric]] origins.&lt;ref name=Swanson2015&gt;{{cite book |author=Swanson ES |title=Science and Society: Understanding Scientific Methodology, Energy, Climate, and Sustainability |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQmhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-21987-5 |page=65 |chapter=Pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health ==
{{further|Vaccine controversy#Alternative medicine|Water fluoridation controversy}}
Some chiropractors oppose [[vaccination]] and [[water fluoridation]], which are common [[public health]] practices.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt; Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination, one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.&lt;ref name=WardleFrawley2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wardle|first1=Jon|last2=Frawley|first2=Jane|last3=Steel|first3=Amie|last4=Sullivan|first4=Elizabeth|title=Complementary medicine and childhood immunisation: A critical review|journal=Vaccine|volume=34|issue=38|year=2016|pages=4484–4500|issn=0264-410X|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.026|pmid=27475472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,&lt;ref name=Busse /&gt; claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Busse /&gt; The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; The [[Canadian Chiropractic Association]] supports vaccination;&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M | title = Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 372–79 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15530683 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB | title = Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 1405–08 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2782512 | pmc = 1350185 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405 | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/79/10/1405.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt;

Hadow was born in 1846 at 49 York Terrace, [[Regent's Park]], London, the son of Patrick Douglas Hadow (Chairman of the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P. &amp; O. Steam Navigation Company]]) and Emma Harriett Nisbet (daughter of [[Robert Parry Nisbet]], of [[Southbroom House]], [[Wiltshire]]), who married at Southbroom on 28 January 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Sylvanus, ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' for January to June 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ve8IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA421 pp 421–422] online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 10 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Hadow's paternal great-grandfather was [[George Hadow]], professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Languages of Asia|Oriental Languages]] at the [[University of St Andrews]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/HadowTree.png Hadow family tree] at Wikimedia Commons (accessed 15 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his younger brothers was [[Frank Hadow]], who won the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon championship]] in 1878.

Hadow was educated at [[Harrow School]], where he and six of his brothers who also attended the school were known as the 'Harrow Hadows'.

==First season in the Alps==
In 1865, at the age of nineteen, Hadow undertook his first trip to the [[Alps]] as a protégé to [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Charles Hudson]], a clergyman from [[Skillington]] in Lincolnshire, and a leading advocate of guideless climbing. Together they made a swift ascent of [[Mont Blanc]] and a number of other climbs; these ascents – together with the backing of a climber of Hudson's stature – persuaded [[Edward Whymper]] that Hadow was a suitable companion for an attempt on the [[Matterhorn]].

Whymper later wrote:
{{quote|Before admitting his [Hudson's] friend—Mr. Hadow—I took the precaution of asking what he had done in the Alps, and, as well as I remember, Mr. Hudson's reply was, "Mr. Hadow has done Mont Blanc in less time than most men." He then mentioned several other expeditions that were unknown to me, and added, in answer to a further question, "I consider he is a sufficiently good man to go with us."|&lt;ref&gt;Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, London: John Murray, 1936, pp. 305–6. In the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'', vol. III, pp. 75–6, T. S. Kennedy wrote that Hadow took five and a half hours from the Grands Mulets to the summit of Mont Blanc, and descended to [[Chamonix]] in five hours.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 'A Modern View of the 1865 Accident', the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] president Capt. [[J. P. Farrar]] (1917–19) concurred with this positive estimation of Hadow's ability:{{quote|Hadow was one of those active young Englishmen capable, with experienced companions, of going anywhere. I say distinctly that Hudson and Croz were fully qualified to conduct him on the proposed expedition, and that the sum of the powers of the party was much above the average of half the parties that go mountain-climbing today.|&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Farrar, 'A Modern View of the 1865 Accident', in ''[[Alpine Journal]]'', vol. XXXII (1918), reprinted in Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, 1936, pp. 367–74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Image:3818 - Riffelberg - Matterhorn viewed from Gornergratbahn.JPG|thumb|240px|right|The [[Matterhorn]]. The fatal accident occurred on the sunny snow slopes at the top right of the mountain.]]

==Matterhorn accident==
{{see also|First ascent of the Matterhorn}}
During the first ascent of the Matterhorn on 14 July 1865, Hadow was, however, challenged by the technical difficulties presented by the mountain. Whymper noticed his inexperience after the party had traversed onto what he termed the 'north-west face' whilst ascending the mountain. In a piece published by ''[[The Times]]'' shortly after the accident, he wrote: 
{{quote|The general slope of the mountain at this part was less than forty degrees, and snow had consequently accumulated and filled up the irregularities of the rock face, leaving only occasional fragments projecting here and there. These were at times coated with a thin glaze of ice, from the snow above having melted and frozen again during the night. Still it was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety. We found, however, that Mr. Hadow was not accustomed to this kind of work, and required continual assistance; but no one suggested that he should stop, and he was taken to the top. It is only fair to say that the difficulty experienced by Mr. Hadow at this part arose, not from fatigue and lack of courage, but simply and entirely from want of experience.|&lt;ref&gt;Edward Whymper, 'The Fatal Accident on the Matterhorn', ''The Times'', 1865, reprinted in ''Peaks, Passes and Glaciers'', ed. Walt Unsworth, London: Allen Lane, 1981, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hadow's slip on the descent of the mountain was the immediate cause of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar notes, however, that '... the real cause of the accident was not the slip made by Hadow, nor the breaking of the rope, but the want of coherence in the "fortuitously" formed party. The great lesson to be learned from the occurrence is to undertake no serious expedition with a large party. 'A Modern View of the 1865 Accident', Alpine J, XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second on the rope as the party went down and he slipped not far from the summit, dragging three members of the party ([[Lord Francis Douglas]], [[Michel Croz]] and Charles Hudson) with him down the north face of the mountain to their deaths (the three other members of the party – Whymper and Taugwalder father and son – were saved when the rope between them and Douglas snapped). Claire Engel comments:
{{quote|When the tragedy occurred, Whymper did not see it: he was behind a rock. His surmises are probably correct, but they are only surmises. From the beginning of the descent, Hadow was showing signs of exhaustion. The boy was certainly at the end of his endurance. With Hudson a few days earlier he had done Mont Blanc in record time, and was probably still feeling the strain. Then, the Matterhorn had been another long ordeal. His shoes were worn out and made him slip constantly. At each step Croz had to make Hadow's feet secure, and to do so he had to lay down his ice axe so that he had no support himself. Suddenly, while Croz was turning round to continue the descent, after having made Hadow secure, Hadow slipped and both of his feet struck Croz in the back. The guide lost his footing and fell headlong down the steep slope, dragging the boy with him. Hudson came next, then Douglas; none had time to react ...|&lt;ref&gt;Claire Engel, ''Mountaineering in the Alps'', London: George Allen and Unwin, 1971, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hadow's body was recovered from the Matterhorn Glacier, and he was buried at the churchyard in [[Zermatt]]. One of Hadow's shoes can be seen in Zermatt's [[Matterhorn Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://swissalpin.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/ernstfall-am-matterhorn. Retrieved 10 April 2008. The text (in German) states 'The shoe appears to be in no state to tackle anything steeper than a flight of stairs.'&lt;/ref&gt; together with the snapped rope and other relics of the climb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zermatt.ch/en/page.cfm/zermatt_matterhorn/matterhorn The Matterhorn] Zermatt Tourist Office.

In [[Cambodia]], [[drugs]] can be readily obtained and are easily accessible, including illegal substances.

== Illegal drugs ==
{{main|Illegal drug trade}}
The Cambodian black market trade of illicit drugs includes [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[methamphetamine]], and high grade [[heroin]].  It is reported that foreigners requesting [[cocaine]] are sometimes provided with heroin instead.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  The Cambodian drug trade utilizes online services and the infamous [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] in Southeast Asia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Cambodia remains a major supplier of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to countries in East and Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Large amounts of heroin are also smuggled throughout the (Golden Triangle). Drug abuse is increasing among street children and rates of HIV/AIDS are increasing due to intravenous drug usage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Golden Triangle===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
[[Image:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|320px|Location of Major Drug Operations around the World]]
The [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] is one of Asia's main opium-producing areas with the other area being the [[Golden Crescent]].   The triangle is an area of roughly 350,000 square kilometers that overlaps the mountainous regions of four nations of Southeast Asian: Myanmar also known as Burma, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand.  The Golden Crescent is located at the intersection of Central, South, and Western Asia.  This area overlaps the borders of Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan with the mountainous regions which define the location of the crescent.  In both of these areas illicit drugs are produced and traffickers export these drugs out of the country and or shipped throughout neighboring nations.  The Ruak and Mekong rivers of these areas also influences the ease of how drugs are transported through this area.

The drugs are transported through the Triangle by horse and donkey caravans to refineries where the drugs are further processed and refined to become more pure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  They are then most frequently brought to the United States and other countries by couriers traveling on commercial airlines or they are smuggled into the country by shipping containers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Teng Bunma===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
[[Teng Bunma]] is one of the wealthiest people in Cambodia with connections to leading politicians, military officials, and businessmen. He is believed to be one of the main Cambodian drug lords. Bunma is the owner of the luxury hotel "Intercontinental" in [[Phnom Penh]] and the "[[Rasmei Kampuchea]]," the largest daily newspaper in Cambodia with a circulation of about 18,000. For years Bunma has been denied entry into the USA because he appears on the list of suspected drug dealers. A 1996 article, "[[Medellin]] on the [[Mekong]]" in the [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Far Eastern Economic Review]], by United States journalist [[Nate Thayer]], described Teng Bunma as a significant figure in Cambodia's international drug-smuggling trade.&lt;ref&gt;Nate Thayer, “Medellin on the Mekong,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 23 November 1995, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
Pertaining to the (online) drug market/trade which exists in Cambodia, more recently the trade took on its international intervention in which officials were able to prevent 10,000 tablets of Codeine and Valium being sent out of Cambodia to the United States and United Kingdom.

Johanne Vinther Axelsen, 55 of Denmark, was arrested and convicted of drug trafficking and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  It is alleged she tried to mail out illegal drugs that she claims did not know were illegal out of Cambodia to the United States and United Kingdom on the behalf of her drug dealing son, Niels Eikeland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009012723853/National-news/Danish-drug-dealer-blames-self.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de-glemte-danskere.blogspot.com/2009/09/cambodja-ikke-et-feriested.html Cambodia - Not a place for holiday (In Danish)], the Forgotten Danes blog, September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Many human rights activists in Denmark are advocating for the release of Axelsen due to the inhumane conditions of the prison and the Danish government are trying to work with Cambodian officials in order to appeal the court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=dk&amp;news_id=5195 Facebook-Group Collects Money to Imprisoned Dane] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930220245/http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=dk&amp;news_id=5195 |date=September 30, 2009 }}, by Charlotte Lund Dideriksen, Scand Asia.com, February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She was later released due to work of diplomacy and a private payment of 8.000 $ to officials so they would bend their policies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=kh&amp;news_id=6094 Mikkel Hass Gave 8.000 $ to Get Johanne Out of Jail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528210829/http://www.scandasia.com/viewNews.php?coun_code=kh&amp;news_id=6094 |date=May 28, 2012 }}, by Niels C. Jensen, Scand Asia, March 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2008 three foreign nationals were arrested in Cambodia on charges of possessing, consuming, and intending to sell drugs   A Taiwanese-American, Pakistani, and Britain national along with a Cambodian citizen were among the arrested.  They were allegedly caught in possession of nearly half a kilo of methamphetamines and cocaine.  The men potentially face life sentences if they are to be convicted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

These recent developments and arrests only further emphasizes that Cambodia is cracking down on the drug trade which exists in the country.  According to secretary-general of the National Authority to Combat Drugs they emphasized that ‘There will be further raids.  We are cracking down hard on people who provide illegal drugs.’

On April 10, 2009, four drug traders and traffickers, including two Cambodian nationals were prosecuted and arrested.  The four had established a ring to transport synthetic drugs from Cambodia to Vietnam across the border for the drugs to be distributed in cafes, bars, and discos.  According to initial investigators, the ring had been operating for nearly a decade &lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Cambodian-nationals-arrested-for-drug-trafficking/20094/103434.vov Cambodian nationals arrested for drug trafficking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415040705/http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/Cambodian-nationals-arrested-for-drug-trafficking/20094/103434.vov |date=April 15, 2009 }}, VOVnews, April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime - UNODC===
The [[UNODC]] is mandated to assist Member States in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime and terrorism. The UNODC is also working with high ranking government officials to lower illicit drugs and corruption.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  The UNODC is constantly updated on the country’s drug control and crime prevention efforts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Life ==
Zsigmondy's parents were Hungarians: Adolf Zsigmondy, born in Pozsony, and Irma von Szakmáry, born in [[Martonvásár]]. Zsigmondy was an excellent [[alpinist]], known for the risky nature of many of his climbs.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Braham|first=Trevor|title=When the Alps Cast Their Spell: Mountaineers of the Alpine Golden Age|year=2011|publisher=The In Pinn|isbn=978-1-906476-34-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcc8XBqOmywC&amp;pg=PT254|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began mountaineering as a teenager, climbing the [[Reisseck]] in [[Austria]] in a round trip of 26 hours with his brother, [[Otto Zsigmondy]]. By the late 1870s the two brothers were climbing [[Alpinism sans guide|without guides]] in the [[Zillertal Alps]]. In 1881, they climbed the [[Ortler]] from the [[Hochjoch]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

Emil Zsigmondy was the friend and companion of [[Ludwig Purtscheller]], the great pioneer of guideless Alpine climbing.&lt;ref name="Braham"/&gt; Emil and Otto climbed with Purtscheller in 1882 and 1884, including an ascent without guides of the Marinelli Couloir on [[Monte Rosa]]&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; and the first guideless traverse of the [[Matterhorn]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian 2"&gt;''Mountaineers'' (Douglas/Smithsonian), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Zsigmondy's outstanding achievements include the [[first ascent]] by the east [[arête]] of the {{convert|3983|m}} high [[Meije]] in the [[Massif des Écrins]] range, made by Zsigmondy, his brother Otto, and Purtscheller on 26 July 1885. A few days later he died on the same mountain. He was killed in an attempt to climb the south face of the Meije on 6 August 1885, probably as a result of his rope slipping off a rock.&lt;ref name="Gos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frison-Roche"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frison-Roche|first1=Roger|last2=Jouty|first2=Sylvain|others=Trans.

He had graduated as a [[doctor of medicine]] in 1884, less than a year before his death.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gos"/&gt;

American historian and mountaineer [[W. A. B. Coolidge]] would later write: {{quote|It is impossible, of course, to fix the precise date at which guideless climbing began to be ''abused''. But no one can doubt that one of the first signs of the change in men's views was the tragic death of Emil Zsigmondy on the Meije in 1885 . . . there are limits even to human skill and human daring, and, in the opinion of the present writer, these were overstepped on that occasion.&lt;ref name="Coolidge"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=df4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA249|first=W.

Zsigmondy is commemorated by the [[Zsigmondyspitze]] in the [[Zillertal Alps]], the Brèche Zsigmondy on the Meije (part of the route followed on the successful July 1885 climb), and the [[Zsigmondyhütte]] (''Rifugio Zsigmondy [[Emilio Comici|Comici]]'') in the [[Sexten Dolomites]].

== Family ==
[[File:Zsigmondy Otto Emil.jpg|thumb|The brothers Otto (left) and Emil Zsigmondy in 1880]]
Emil Zsigmondy was the second of the four sons of Dr. [[Adolf Zsigmondy]] of [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava), a [[dentist]] of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] origin, and [[Irma von Szakmáry]], a poet from [[Martonvásár]]. His older brother, Otto, a dentist by profession, was also known as a mountaineer. His younger brother, [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]], was a chemist and in 1925 received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">[[File:Dromaius novaehollandiae dad - Christopher Watson.jpg|alt=An Emu|267px|thumb|An [[emu]], the source of emu oil]]

'''Emu oil''' is  an [[oil]] derived from [[adipose tissue]] harvested from certain subspecies of the [[emu]], ''Dromaius novaehollandiae'', a [[flightless bird]] indigenous to [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="aea-emu"&gt;[http://aea-emu.org/faq American Emu Association FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emu_farming"&gt;{{cite book|title=Extraordinary Jobs in Agriculture and Nature|last1=Devantier|first1=Alecia T|last2=Carol|first2=Turkington|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8160-5854-9}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-02-21--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Unadulterated emu oil can vary widely in color and viscosity anywhere from an off-white creamy texture to a thin yellow liquid, depending on the diet of the emu and the refining method(s) used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aea-emu.org/sites/aea-emu.org/files/Emu%20Oil%20Trade%20Rule%20103.pdf American Emu Association - Definition of emu oil grades]&lt;/ref&gt; Industrially refined "emu grade" emu oil is composed of a minimum of 70% unsaturated [[fatty acid]]s. The largest component is [[oleic acid]], a monounsaturated [[omega-9 fatty acid]]. Emu oil also contains roughly 20% [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]) and 1–2% [[alpha-Linolenic acid|linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aea-emu.org/sites/aea-emu.org/files/Emu%20Oil%20Trade%20Rule%20103.pdf|title=Emu Oil Trade Rule 103|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully refined emu oil has a bland flavor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Emu oil has previously been wrongly promoted as a [[dietary supplement]] with the claim it can treat a variety of human ailments, including [[cancer]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

Commercial emu oil supplements are not standardized and vary widely in their potency.&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitehouse MW, Turner AG, Davis CK, Roberts MS |title=Emu oil(s): A source of non-toxic transdermal anti-inflammatory agents in aboriginal medicine |journal=Inflammopharmacology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=1998 |pmid=17638122 |doi=10.1007/s10787-998-0001-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] highlighted emu oils in a 2009 article on "How to Spot Health Fraud," pointing out that many "pure emu oil" products are unapproved drugs.&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm137284.htm | title = How to Spot Health Fraud | date = April 30, 2009 | accessdate = June 29, 2009 | first = Paula | last = Kurtzweil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''End of Life Choice Bill''' is a bill before the [[New Zealand Parliament]] that seeks to give people with a terminal illness or a grievous and irremediable medical condition the option of requesting [[assisted dying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), Explanatory note."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/d56e2.html |work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ACT New Zealand]] MP [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]] entered it into the [[private member's bill]]  ballot on 14 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seymour|first1=David |title=Seymour lodges assisted dying Bill|url=http://www.act.org.nz/posts/seymour-lodges-assisted-dying-bill|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed its first reading on 13 December 2017, with 76 votes in favour, 44 opposed.

==Contents of the bill==
'''Eligibility for assisted dying'''

The End of Life Choice Bill allows New Zealand citizens or permanent residents aged 18 or older to request assisted dying, provided that they suffer from a terminal illness that is likely to end their life within 6 months, or they suffer from a grievous and irremediable medical condition; that they are in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability; and they experience unbearable suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner that they consider tolerable; and they have the ability to understand the nature of assisted dying and the consequences for him or her of assisted dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 4."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285950.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process of assisted dying'''

A person who wishes to have an assisted death, and is eligible under the above criteria, must inform their attending medical practitioner. The medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form after having first talked to the patient about their illness, the nature of assisted dying, alternative options for end of life care, and numerous other matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 8."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285956.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the request has been confirmed, the patient must sign and date the prescribed form in the presence of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 9."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285957.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the form has been completed the attending medical practitioner, and following that an independent medical practitioner, must confirm that the person is eligible for assisted dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 10."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285958.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 11."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285959.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a disagreement between the two practitioners, or if it is recommended by either of the practitioners, a third opinion must be reached by an independent specialist appointed by the SCENZ Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 12."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285960.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the patient requesting assisted dying must choose the medication and method of delivery which will end their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 15."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285963.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the medication has been administered the attending medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form notifying the registrar at the Ministry of Health that an assisted death has occurred. The registrar must then forward the form to a review committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="End of Life Choice Bill (as at 06 March 2018), section 17."|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2017/0269/latest/DLM7285965.html|work=New Zealand Legislation: Bills|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental epidemiology==
Developmental epidemiology seeks to "disentangle how the trajectories of symptoms, environment, and individual development intertwine to produce [[psychopathology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costello |first=Jane |author2=Foley, Deborah |author3=Angold, Adrian  |year=2006 |title=10-year research update: The epidemiology of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders: II.

===Socio-economic influences===
Mental illness in childhood and adolescence is associated with parental unemployment, low family income, being on family income assistance,&lt;ref name="Belfer2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Belfer |first= Myron |year=2008 |title=Child and adolescent mental disorders: the magnitude of the problem across the globe |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=226–236 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01855.x |pmid=18221350}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-07-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; lower parental educational level, and single-parent, blended or stepparent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sawyer |first=M.G. |author2=Arney, F.M. |author3=Baghurst, P.A. |author4=Clark, J.J. |author5=Graetz, B.W. |author6=Kosky, R.J. |author7=Nurcombe, B. |author8=Patton, G.C. |author9=Prior, M.R. |author10=Raphael, B. |author11=Rey, J.M. |author12=Whaites, L.C. |author13=Zubrick, S.R. |year=2001 |title=The mental health of young people in Australia: key findings from the child and adolescent component of the national survey of mental health and well-being |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=806–814 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.2001.00964.x |pmid=11990891}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-07-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodological issues==
Epidemiological research has produced widely divergent estimates, depending on the nature of the diagnostic method (e.g. structured clinical interview, unstrutured clinical interview, self-report or parent-report questionnaire), but more recent studies using [[DSM-IV]]-based structured interviews produce more reliable estimates of clinical "caseness". Past research has also been limited by inconsistent definitions of clinical disorders, and differing upper and lower age limits of the study population. Changing definitions over time have given rise to spurious evidence of changing prevalence of disorders. Furthermore, almost all epidemiological surveys have been carried out in Europe, North America and Australia, and the cross-cultural validity of DSM criteria have been questioned, so it is not clear to what extent the published data can be generalized to developing countries.&lt;ref name=10-year/&gt;&lt;ref name="Belfer2008" /&gt;

'''The Finnegan scoring system''' is used to quantify and diagnose [[neonatal withdrawal]] or abstinence (NAS) syndrome. This is a withdrawal syndrome of [[infant]]s, caused by the cessation of the administration of licit or [[illicit drugs]]. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a group of problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive opiate or other drugs in utero.&lt;!--&lt;ref name =uslib/&gt;--&gt; There are two types of NAS: prenatal and postnatal. Prenatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs taken by the pregnant mother, while postnatal NAS is caused by discontinuation of drugs directly to the infant.&lt;ref name=emedicine&gt;{{eMedicine2|article|978763|Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome}} on eMedicine&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-one signs of withdrawal are scored. The scoring assessment is based upon the pathological significance and severity of the symptoms. Symptoms can be managed with medication. Though lengthy, it remains when used by trained clinicians. Bias and subjectivity can have some affect. The Finnegan scale is also used to assess the effectiveness of treatment and recovery of the infant. Assessment is performed and then scored. A daily score is calculated. The decision to treat the infant may be based upon a higher score. The Finnegan scale is used with assessment of comorbidities, prematurity, and clinician experience to guide treatment.&lt;ref name = meds+&gt; {{cite web | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/978763-clinical#b2

The '''glandular odontogenic cyst''' is a rare odontogenic [[cyst]].  In 85% of cases, it is found in the [[human mandible|mandible]], especially in anterior areas.  It is more common in adults in their fifth and sixth decades.  On [[radiograph]]s, it can appear as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucency (dark area).  Since the glandular odontogenic cyst can range in size, treatment can be as simple as [[Enucleation (surgery)|enucleation]] and [[curettage]] to [[Resection (surgery)|en bloc resection]] of the affected jaw.

'''Health care services in [[Nepal]]''' are provided by both public and private sectors and are generally regarded as failing to meet [[international standards]].

== Health care expenditure ==
In 2002, government funding for healthcare was approximately USD $2.30 per person. Approximately 70% of health expenditure came from out-of-pocket contributions. Government allocation for health care was approximately 5.8% of the budget in 2009.&lt;ref name="worldlifeexpectancy.com"&gt;[http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/country-health-profile/nepal Nepal Health Profile World Health Organisation data (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Nepalese government launched a pilot program for universal health insurance in five districts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=44591|title=Health for all|publisher=My Republica|accessdate=14 Nov 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109161710/http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=44591|archivedate=9 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, Nepal's total expenditure on health per capita was USD $127.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/npl/en/|title=Nepal|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health care infrastructure ==
Health care services, [[hygiene]], [[nutrition]], and [[sanitation]] in Nepal are of very poor quality and fail to reach a large proportion of the population, particularly in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karuna-shechen.org/project/health-care-services-in-nepal/|title=HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN NEPAL OFFERING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION TO UNDER-SERVED COMMUNITIES|last=|first=|date=|website=Karuna-Shechen Humanitarian Projects in the Himalayan Region|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor have limited access to basic health care due to high costs, low availability, lack of health education and conflicting traditional beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Beine, David. 2001.

These problems have led many governmental and non-governmental organizations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) to implement communication programs encouraging people to engage in healthy behavior such as family planning, contraceptive use, spousal communication and safe motherhood practices, such as the use of skilled birth attendants during delivery and immediate breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Karki | first1 = Yagya B. | last2 = Agrawal | first2 = Gajanand | title = Effects of Communication Campaigns on the Health Behavior of Women of Reproductive Age in Nepal, Further Analysis of the 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey | publisher = Macro International Inc. | date = May 2008 | url = http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FA51/FA51.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-nutrient deficiencies are widespread, with almost half of pregnant women and children under five, as well as 35% of women of reproductive age, being anaemic. Only 24% of children consume iron-rich food, 24% of children meet a minimally acceptable diet, and only half of the pregnant women take recommended iron supplementation during pregnancy. A contributing factor to deteriorating nutrition is high [[Diarrhea|diarrhoeal]] disease morbidity, exacerbated by the lack of access to proper sanitation and the common practice of open defecation (44%) in Nepal.&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/USAID-Nepal_NCP.pdf|title=Nepal: Nutrition Profile|website=usaid.gov|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition of children under 5 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nepal Demographic and Health Survey|date=2011|publisher=Ministry of Health and Population|location=Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Periods of stagnant economic growth and political instability have contributed to acute food shortages and high rates of [[malnutrition]], mostly affecting vulnerable women and children in the hills and mountains of the mid and far western regions. Despite the rate of individuals with stunted growth and the number of cases of underweight individuals having decreased, alongside an increase of exclusive breastfeeding in the past seven years, 41% of children under the age of five still suffer from stunted growth, a rate that increases to 60% in the western mountains. A report from DHS 2016, has shown that in Nepal, 36% of children are stunted (below -2 standard deviation), 12% are severely stunted (below -3 standard deviation), 27% of children under 5 are underweight, and 5% are severely underweight. Variation in the percentage of stunted and underweight children under 5 can be compared between urban and rural regions of Nepal, with rural areas being more affected (40% stunted and 31% underweight) than urban areas (32% stunted and 23% underweight). There is positive association between household food consumption scores and lower prevalence of [[stunted growth|stunting]], [[underweight]] and [[wasting]]. Children in a secure food household have the lowest rates of stunting (33%), while children in an insecure food household have the highest rates (49%). Similarly, maternal education has an inverse relationship with childhood stunting. In addition, underweight and stunting issues are also inversely correlated to their equity possessions. Children in the lowest wealth quintile are more stunted (49%) and underweight (33%) than children in the highest quintile (17% stunted and 12% underweight).&lt;ref name="Ministry of Health and Population"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nepal Demographic and Health Survey|date=2016|publisher=Ministry of Health and Population|location=Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutritional status of children in Nepal has improved over the last two decades. Decreasing trends of children having stunted growth and being underweight have been observed since 2001. The percentage of stunted children in Nepal was 14% between 2001 and 2006, 16% between 2006 and 2011, and 12% between 2011 and 2016.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Health and Population"/&gt; A similar trend can also observed for underweight children. These trends demonstrate progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target. However, there is still a long way to go to meet the SDG target of reducing stunting to 31% and underweight to 25% among children under 5 by 2017 (National Planning Commission 2015).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Geographical constraints ===
Much of rural [[Nepal]] is located on hilly or mountainous regions. Nepal's rugged terrain and the lack of properly enabling infrastructure make it highly inaccessible, limiting the availability of basic health care in many rural mountain areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/web/guest/country/home/tags/nepalThe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) retrieved 20 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In many villages, the only mode of transportation is by foot. This results in a delay of treatment, which can be detrimental to patients in need of immediate medical attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/umcor/stories/topoftheworld.cfm United Methodist Committee on relief; retrieved on 20 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Nepal's health care facilities are concentrated in urban areas. Rural health facilities often lack adequate funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nutriweb.org.my/publications/mjn008_2/mjn8n2_art6.pdf Shiba Kumar Rai, Kazuko Hirai, Ayako Abe, Yoshimi Ohno 2002 "Infectious Diseases and Malnutrition Status in Nepal: an Overview" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Nepal had 10 health centers, 83 hospitals, 700 health posts, and 3,158 "sub-health posts," which serve villages. In addition, there were 1,259 [[physician]]s, one for every 18,400 persons.&lt;ref name="worldlifeexpectancy.com"/&gt; In 2000, government funding for health matters was approximately USD $2.30 per person and approximately 70% of health expenditure came from contributions. Government allocations for health were around 5.1% of the budget for the 2004 fiscal year, and foreign donors provided around 30% of the total budget for health expenditure.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

=== Political influences ===
[[Nepal]]’s health care issues are largely attributed to its political power and resources being mostly centered in its capital, [[Kathmandu]], resulting in the social exclusion of other parts of Nepal. The restoration of [[democracy]] in 1990 has allowed the strengthening of local institutions. The 1999 Local Self Governance Act aimed to include devolution of basic services such as health, drinking water, and rural infrastructure but the program has not provided notable public health improvements. Due to a lack of political will,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nrb.org.np/ecorev/articles/4.pdf|title=Decentralization of Corruption and Local Public Service Delivery in Nepal|last=Raj Panta|first=Krishna Ph.D.|date=|website=Nepal Rastra Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal has failed to achieve complete decentralisation, thus limiting its political, social and physical potential.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"/&gt;

== Health status ==
=== [[Life expectancy]] ===
In 2010, the average Nepalese lived to 65.8 years. According to the latest [[World Health Organization|WHO]] data published in 2012, life expectancy in Nepal is 68. Life Expectancy at birth for both sexes increased by 6 years over the year 2010 and 2012. In 2012, healthy expectancy in both sexes was 9 year(s) lower than overall life expectancy at birth. This lost healthy life expectancy represents 9 equivalent year(s) of full health lost through years lived with morbidity and disability&lt;ref name="Nepal: WHO Statistical Profile"/&gt;

=== Diseases ===
According to WHO data, the nine leading causes of morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) in Nepal are:
# [[COPD]] (9.2%)
# [[Ischaemic Heart Disease]] (9.2%)
# [[Lower respiratory infection]] (7%)
# [[Diarrhoeal disease]] (3.3%)
# [[Self harm]] (3%)
# [[Tuberculosis]] (3%)
# [[Diabetes]] (2.8%)
# Road injury (2.7%)
# [[Preterm birth]] (2.5%)&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepal: Country Profile|url=http://www.who.int/gho/countries/npl/country_profiles/en/|website=who.int|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Nepal}}

Making up approximately 8.1% of the total estimated population of 40,723, there were about 3,282 children aged 14 years or younger living with HIV in Nepal in 2013. There are 3,385 infections estimated among the population aged 50 years and above (8.3% of the total population). By sex, males account for two‐thirds (66%) of the infections and the remaining, more than one‐third (34%) of infections are in females, out of which around 92.2% are in the reproductive age group of 15‐49 years. The male to female sex ratio of total infection decreased from 2.15 in 2006 to 1.95 in 2013 and is projected to be 1.86 by 2020.&lt;ref name="ministry of health and population, Nepal"&gt;{{cite web|title=annual health report|url=http://dohs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Annual_Report_FY_2071_72.pdf|website=dohs.gov.np|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidemic in Nepal is driven by injecting drug users, migrants, sex workers &amp; their clients and MSM. Results from the 2007 Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance Study (IBBS) among IDUs in [[Kathmandu]], [[Pokhara]], and East and West [[Terai]] indicate that the highest prevalence rates have been found among urban IDUs, 6.8% to 34.7% of whom are HIV-positive, depending on location. In terms of absolute numbers, Nepal's 1.5 million to 2 million labor migrants account for the majority of Nepal’s HIV-positive population. In one subgroup, 2.8% of migrants returning from [[Mumbai]], India, were infected with HIV, according to the 2006 IBBS among migrants.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/nepal_profile.pdf | title=Health Profile: Nepal | publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] | date=March 2008 | accessdate=25 August 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817052540/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/ane/nepal_profile.pdf | archivedate=17 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, HIV prevalence among female sex workers and their clients was less than 2% and 1%, respectively, and 3.3% among urban-based MSM. HIV infections are more common among men than women, as well as in urban areas and the far western region of Nepal, where migrant labor is more common. Labor migrants make up 41% of the total known HIV infections in Nepal, followed by clients of sex workers (15.5 percent) and IDUs (10.2 percent).&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

=== Maternal health ===
Nepal has made significant progress in improving the health of women and children and is on track in 2013 to achieve [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] (MDGs) #4 (to reduce child mortality) and #5A (to reduce maternal mortality). This review provided an opportunity for the MoHP and other stakeholders in Nepal to synthesize and document how these improvements were made, focusing on effective policy and program management practices.

Nepal has made significant progress in improving maternal health. [[Maternal death|Maternal mortality rate]] was reduced from 748 per 100,000 live births in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles&amp;state_time_value=1991&amp;end=2013&amp;startSelected=1980&amp;endSelected=2013;&amp;entities_select@_geo=npl&amp;trailStartTime=1991;;;&amp;marker_axis%2F_y_which=maternal%2F_mortality%2F_ratio%2F_per%2F_100000%2F_live%2F_births&amp;domainMax:2680&amp;zoomedMin:1&amp;zoomedMax:2680&amp;scaleType=log;&amp;axis%2F_x_which=time&amp;domainMin=1800&amp;domainMax=2015&amp;zoomedMin=1800&amp;zoomedMax=2012&amp;scaleType=time|title=Gap minder : Maternal mortality rate 1991 Nepal|last=|first=|date=|website=Gapminder|publisher=|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 190 per 100,000 live births on 2014. Nepal also has made some progress on reducing [[total fertility rate]] (TFR), from 5.3 in 1991&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nepal fertility, family planning and health survey: (NFHS, 1991)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=Kathmandu Nepal|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2.3 in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dohs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Annual_Report_2070_71.pdf|title=Annual Report 2013/2014|date=January 2015|publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Population (Nepal)|Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal]], Department of Health Services|access-date=24 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241}}

Despite other indicators related to maternal health, the indicator of contraceptive prevalence rate is showing a decreasing trend: 2006 (44.2%) and 2011 (43.2%),&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR257/FR257%5B13April2012%5D.pdf|title=Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2011. Kathmandu, Nepal: Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), New ERA  and ICF International, Calverton, Maryland; 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been attributed to high rates of spousal separation due to migration to other countries for employment (3/4 of youth in rural areas). The use of maternal health services has improved (increased) since 1996, with increases in the coverage and number of ANC visits (60% for at least four [[Prenatal care|antenatal visits]]) in 2014,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|242}} rates of institutional deliveries as well as deliveries attended by a [[Birth attendant|skilled birth attendant]] (56%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|242}}

=== Child health ===

Nepal is also on track to achieve MDG 4, having attained a rate of 35.8 under 5 child deaths per 1000 live births in 2015,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/nepal|title=World Development Indicators [online database]. Washington DC: The World Bank; 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=World Development Indicators [online database].|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from 162 in 1991&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; according to national data. Global estimates indicate that the rate has been reduced by 65% from 128 to 48 per 1000 live births between 1991 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles&amp;state_time_value=2011&amp;start=1931&amp;end=2011&amp;startSelected=1949&amp;endSelected=2011;&amp;entities_select@_geo=npl&amp;trailStartTime=2011;;;&amp;marker_axis%2F_y_which=under%2F_five%2F_mortality%2F_from%2F_cme%2F_per%2F_1000%2F_born&amp;domainMin:1.8&amp;domainMax:492.8&amp;zoomedMin:1.8&amp;zoomedMax:492.8&amp;scaleType=log;&amp;axis%2F_x_which=time&amp;domainMin=1931&amp;domainMax=2011&amp;zoomedMin=1931&amp;zoomedMax=2011&amp;scaleType=time|title=Gapminder Under five mortality from 1991 to 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=Gapminder|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal has successfully improved coverage of effective interventions to prevent or treat the most important causes of child mortality through a variety of community-based and national campaign approaches. These include high coverage of semiannual vitamin A supplementation and deworming; CB-IMCI; high rates of full child immunization; and moderate coverage of exclusive breastfeeding of children under 6 months. However, in the past few years, the NMR has remained stagnant with it being stated at around 22.2 deaths per 1000 live births in 2015. This compares to a rate of 27.7 in India (2015) and 45.5 in Pakistan (2015).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The NMR is a serious concern in Nepal, accounting for 76% of the infant mortality rate (IMR) and 58% of the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) as of 2015, and is one of its challenges going forward.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Typically, a history of conflict negatively affects health indicators. However, Nepal made progress in most health indicators despite its decade-long armed conflict. Attempts to understand this has provided a number of possible explanations including the fact that in most instances the former rebels did not purposely disrupt delivery of health services; pressure was applied on health workers to attend clinics and provide services in rebel base areas; the conflict created an environment for improved coordination among key actors; and Nepal’s public health system adopted approaches that targeted disadvantaged groups and remote areas, particularly community-based approaches for basic service delivery with a functional community support system through female community health volunteers (FCHVs), women’s groups and Health Facility Operational Management Committees (HFOMCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devkota|first=Bhimsen|date=1 December 2010|title=Understanding effects of armed conflict on health outcomes: the case of Nepal|journal=Conflict and Health|volume=4|issue=|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1752-1505-4-20|pmid=21122098|pmc=3003631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child health programmes ====

The Nepalese Child Health Division of the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), has launched several child survival interventions, including various operational initiatives, to improve the health of children in Nepal. These include the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI), the Community-Based Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (CB-IMCI) program, the Community-Based Newborn Care Program (CB-NCP), the Infant and Young Child Feeding program, a micro-nutrients supplementation program, vitamin A and deworming campaign, and the Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

===== Immunization =====
The National Immunisation Program is a priority 1 (P1) program in Nepal. Since the inception of the program, it has been universally established and successfully implemented. Immunisation services can be obtained for free from EPI clinics in hospitals, other health centers, mobile and outreach clinics, non-governmental organizations and private clinics. The government has provided all vaccines and immunization-related logistics without any cost to hospitals, private institutions, and nursing homes. Nepal has since gained recognition for the success of the program, in relation to its successful coverage of 97% population equally, regardless of wealth, gender and age. However, despite the widespread success of the National Immunisation Program, inequities still exist. Nevertheless, the trends in last past 15 years have shown promising positive changes indicating possibilities of achieving complete immunization coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/4/16-178327/en/|title=Increased immunization coverage addresses the equity gap in Nepal|date=|publisher=WHO|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more vaccines were introduced between 2014 and 2015&amp;nbsp;– the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Six districts of Nepal are declared with 99.9% immunization coverage. Nepal achieved polio-free status on 27 March 2014. Neonatal and maternal tetanus was already eliminated in 2005 and Japanese encephalitis is in a controlled state. Nepal is also on track to meet the target of the elimination of measles by 2019.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|i,⁠8}} One percent of children in Nepal have not yet received any of the vaccine coverage.

===== Community-Based Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (CB-IMCI) =====
The Community-Based Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (CB-IMCI) program is an integrated package that addresses the management of diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and measles, as well as malnutrition, among children aged 2 months to 5 years. It also includes management of infection, Jaundice, Hyperthermia and counseling on breastfeeding for young infants less than 2 months of age. CB-IMCI program has been implemented up to the community level in all the districts of Nepal and it has shown positive results in the management of childhood illnesses. Over the past decade, Nepal has had success in reducing under-five mortality, largely due to the implementation of the CB-IMCI program. Initially, the Control of Diarrheal Diseases (CDD) Program began in 1982; and the Control of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Program was initiated in 1987. The CDD and ARI programs were merged into the CB-IMCI program in 1998.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Community-Based Newborn Care Program (CB-NCP) =====
The Nepal Family Health Survey 1996, Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys, and [[World Health Organization]] estimations over time have shown that neonatal mortality in Nepal has been decreasing at a slower rate than infant and child mortality. The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2011 has shown 33 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births, which accounts for 61% of under 5 deaths. The major causes of neonatal death in Nepal are an infection, birth asphyxia, preterm birth, and hypothermia. Given Nepal’s existing health service indicators, it becomes clear that strategies to address neonatal mortality in Nepal must consider the fact that 72% of births take place at home (NDHS 2011).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Therefore, as an urgent step to reduce neonatal mortality, Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) initiated a new program called 'Community-Based Newborn Care Package' (CB-NCP) based on the 2004 National Neonatal Health Strategy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== National Nutritional Program =====
The National Nutrition Program under the Department of Health Services has set it's ultimate goal as “all Nepali people living with adequate nutrition, food safety and food security for adequate physical, mental and social growth and equitable human capital development and survival” with the mission to improve the overall nutritional status of children, women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and all ages through the control of general malnutrition and the prevention and control of micronutrient deficiency disorders having a broader inter and intra sectoral collaboration and coordination, partnership among different stakeholders and high level of awareness and cooperation of population in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multi-sector Nutrition Plan 2013-2017 (2023)|last=|first=|publisher=GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL / National Planning Commission|year=2013|isbn=|location=http://scalingupnutrition.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Nepal_MSNP_2013-2017.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnutrition remains a serious obstacle to child survival, growth, and development in Nepal. The most common form of malnutrition is protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Other common forms of malnutrition are iodine, iron, and vitamin A deficiency. These deficiencies often appear together in many cases. Moderately acute and severely acutely malnourished children are more likely to die from common childhood illness than those adequately nourished. In addition, malnutrition constitutes a serious threat to young children and is associated with about one-third of child mortality. Major causes of PEM in Nepal is low birth weight of below 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg due to poor maternal nutrition, inadequate dietary intake, frequent infections, household food insecurity, poor feeding behaviour and poor care &amp; practices leading to an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264256425_A_case_control_study_on_risk_factors_associated_with_malnutrition_in_Dolpa_district_of_Nepal|title=A case-control study on risk factors associated with malnutrition in Dolpa district of Nepal|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2016-09-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the causes of stunted growth in Nepal reveals that around half is rooted in poor maternal nutrition, and the other half in poor infant and young child nutrition. Around a quarter of babies are born with a low birth weight. As per the findings of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS, 2011), 41 percent of children below 5 years of age are stunted. A survey by NDHS and NMICS also showed that 30% of the children are underweight and 11% of children below 5 years are wasted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|241}}

In order to address under-nutrition problems in young children, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has implemented:

:a)    Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)
:b)    Control of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)
:c)    Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD)
:d)    Control of Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD)
:e)    Control of Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA)
:f)    Deworming of children aged 1 to 5 years and vitamin A capsule distribution
:g)    Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)
:h)    Hospital-based nutrition management and rehabilitation

The hospital-based nutrition management and rehabilitation program treats severe malnourished children at Out-patient Therapeutic Program (OTP) centres in Health Facilities. As per requirement, the package is linked with the other nutrition programs such as the Child Nutrition Grant, [[Micronutrient|Micronutrient powder]] (MNP) distribution to young children (6 to 23 months)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|22,⁠24}} {{citation needed span|since=January 2017|text=and food distribution in the food insecure areas|date=January 2017}}.

===== Infant and Young Child Feeding program =====
UNICEF and WHO recommended that children be exclusively breastfed (no other liquid, solid food, or plain water) during the first six months of life (WHO/UNICEF, 2002). The nutrition program under the 2004 National Nutrition Policy and Strategy promotes exclusive breastfeeding through the age of 6 months and, thereafter, the introduction of semisolid or solid foods along with continued breast milk until the child is at least age 2. Introducing breast milk substitutes to infants before age 6 months can contribute to breastfeeding failure. Substitutes, such as formula, other kinds of milk and porridge are often watered down and provide too few calories. Furthermore, possible contamination of these substitutes exposes the infant to the risk of illness. Nepal’s Breast Milk Substitute Act (2049) of 1992 promotes and protects breastfeeding and regulates the unauthorized or unsolicited sale and distribution of breast milk substitutes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Policy - Mother's Milk Substitutes (Control of Sale and Distribution) Act, 2049 (1992)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=https://extranet.who.int/nutrition/gina/sites/default/files/NPL%201992%20Mother%27s%20Milk%20Substitues%20Control%20of%20sale%20and%20distribution%20Act%202049.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six months, a child requires adequate complementary foods for normal growth. Lack of appropriate complementary feeding may lead to malnutrition and frequent illnesses, which in turn may lead to death. However, even with complementary feeding, the child should continue to be breastfed for two years or more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Road Traffic Accidents in Nepal ===
Road traffic injuries are one of the global health burdens, an eighth leading cause of death worldwide. Globally, approximately 1.25 million lives are cut short every year because of a road traffic injuries. Ranging from 20 to 50 million people become victims of non-fatal injuries, with many acquiring a disability for the rest of the life as a result of their injury. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries|title=Road traffic injuries|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, a road traffic accident rank eighth among killer causes of [[Disability-adjusted life year|disability-adjusted life years]] and also eighth among premature cause of death after [[Non-communicable disease|Non-Communicable Diseases]] and Communicable Diseases. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthdata.org/nepal|title=Nepal {{!}} Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|website=www.healthdata.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A substantial problem of road traffic accident with fatalities occurs mainly on highways caused by bus crashes in [[Nepal]]. Due to the country's geography, bus accidents mostly happen in the hilly region and along the long-distance route causing 31 percent of fatalities and serious injuries every year. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/opennepal/datasources/blob/master/Development/Status_Paper%20_2013.pdf|title=opennepal/datasources|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accidents involving motorcycles, micro-buses, cars etc highly prevail in the capital city, Kathmandu compared to other cities and lowland areas.

=== Mental Health ===
In terms of the network of mental health facilities, there are 18 outpatient mental health facilities, 3 day treatment facilities, and 17 community-based psychiatric inpatient units available in the country. The majority of the mental health service users are treated in outpatient facilities. Thirty-seven percent of patients are female. The patients admitted to mental hospitals belong primarily to the following two diagnostic groups: Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (34%) and Mood [affective] disorders (21%). On average, patients spend 18.85 days in mental hospitals. All of the patients spent less than one year in the mental hospital during the year of assessment.

Two percent of the training for medical doctors is devoted to mental health, and the same percentage is provided for nurses. One Non Government Organization is running a community mental health service in 7 of the 75 districts in the country. In other districts, community mental health services are not available, as mental health services are not yet integrated into the general health service system.

Even though Nepal's mental health policy was formulated in 1996, there is no mental health legislation as yet. In terms of financing, less than one percent (0.17%) of health care expenditures by the government are directed towards mental health. There is no human right review body to inspect mental health facilities and impose sanctions on those facilities that persistently violate patients' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e409862004-001|title=Organization of mental health services in developing countries: Sixteenth Report of the WHO Expert Committee on Mental Health.|date=1975|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperprolactinaemia''' or '''hyperprolactinemia''' is the presence of abnormally high levels of [[prolactin]] in the blood. [[Reference ranges for common blood tests|Normal levels]] are less than 500 mIU/L [20&amp;nbsp;ng/mL or µg/L] for women, and less than 450 mI U/L for men.

Prolactin is a [[peptide hormone]] produced by the anterior [[pituitary gland]] that is primarily associated with [[lactation]] and plays a vital role in breast development during [[pregnancy]]. Hyperprolactinaemia may cause [[galactorrhea]] (production and spontaneous flow of breast milk)  and disruptions in the normal [[menstrual period]] in women and [[hypogonadism]], [[infertility]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] in men.

Hyperprolactinaemia can also be a part of normal body changes during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It can also be caused by diseases affecting the [[hypothalamus]] and pituitary gland. It can also be caused by disruption of the normal regulation of prolactin levels by drugs, medicinal herbs and heavy metals inside the body. Hyperprolactinaemia may also be the result of disease of other organs such as the liver, kidneys, ovaries and thyroid.&lt;ref name=Mancini2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancini T, Casanueva FF, Giustina A | title = Hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas | journal = Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–99, viii | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18226731 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecl.2007.10.013 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Medical citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
In women, a high blood level of prolactin often causes [[hypoestrogenism]] with anovulatory [[infertility]] and a decrease in [[menstruation]]. In some women, menstruation may disappear altogether ([[amenorrhoea]]). In others, menstruation may become irregular or menstrual flow may change. Women who are not pregnant or nursing may begin producing [[breast milk]]. Some women may experience a loss of [[libido]] (interest in sex) and breast pain, especially when prolactin levels begin to rise for the first time, as the hormone promotes tissue changes in the breast. [[Sexual intercourse|Intercourse]] may become difficult or painful because of [[vaginal dryness]].{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In men, the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia are decreased [[libido]], [[sexual dysfunction]] (in both men and women), [[erectile dysfunction]], [[infertility]], and [[gynecomastia]]. Because men have no reliable indicator such as [[menstruation]] to signal a problem, many men with hyperprolactinaemia being caused by a [[pituitary adenoma]] may delay going to the doctor until they have [[headaches]] or eye problems caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the adjacent [[optic chiasm]]. They may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or [[libido]]. Only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function.{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Because of hypoestrogenism and [[hypoandrogenism]], hyperprolactinaemia can lead to [[osteoporosis]].{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Causes==
Hyperprolactinaemia may be caused by either disinhibition (e.g., compression of the pituitary stalk or reduced dopamine levels) or excess production from a [[prolactinoma]] (a type of [[pituitary adenoma]]). A blood serum prolactin level of 1000–5000 mIU/L could be from either mechanism, but &gt;5000 mIU/L (&gt;200&amp;nbsp;µg/L) is likely due to the activity of an adenoma; macroadenomas (large tumours over 10&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) have levels of prolactin up to 100,000 mIU/L.

Hyperprolactinemia inhibits the secretion of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] (by increasing the release of [[dopamine]] from the [[arcuate nucleus]]), which in turn inhibits the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[pituitary gland]] and results in diminished [[gonad]]al [[sex hormone]] production (termed [[hypogonadism]]).&lt;ref name="Jr.2010"&gt;{{cite book| first = Edmund S. | last = Sabanegh | name-list-format = vanc |title=Male Infertility: Problems and Solutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YthJpK5clTMC&amp;pg=PA83|date=20 October 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-60761-193-6|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of many of the symptoms described below.

In many people, elevated prolactin levels remain unexplained and may represent a form of [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] dysregulation.

===Physiological causes===
Physiological (i.e., non-[[pathological]]) causes include: [[pregnancy]], [[breastfeeding]], and [[stress (medicine)|mental stress]].

===Medications===
Prolactin secretion in the pituitary is normally suppressed by the brain chemical [[dopamine]]. Drugs that block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include the [[typical antipsychotic]]s:  [[phenothiazine]]s such as [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine), and [[butyrophenone]]s such as [[haloperidol]] (Haldol);  [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[risperidone]] (Risperdal) and [[paliperidone]] (Invega);&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torre DL, Falorni A | title = Pharmacological causes of hyperprolactinemia | journal = Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 929–51 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 18473017 | pmc = 2376090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kantrowitz J, Citrome L | title = Paliperidone: the evidence of its therapeutic value in schizophrenia | journal = Core Evidence | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–71 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 21221191 | pmc = 3012441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gastroprokinetic]] drugs used to treat [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastro-oesophageal reflux]] and medication-induced nausea (such as that from [[chemotherapy]]): [[metoclopramide]] (Reglan) and [[domperidone]]; less often, [[methyldopa|alpha-methyldopa]] and [[reserpine]], used to control [[hypertension]]; and also [[estrogen]]s and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baumgartner A, Gräf KJ, Kürten I | title = Prolactin in patients with major depressive disorder and in healthy subjects. II. Longitudinal study of basal prolactin and post-TRH-stimulated prolactin levels | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 268–85 | date = July 1988 | pmid = 3135848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sleep drug [[ramelteon]] (Rozerem) also increases the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. A benzodiazepine analog, [[etizolam]], can also increase the risk of hyperprolactinaemia.{{Medical citation needed|date=June 2018}} In particular, the dopamine antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone are both powerful prolactin stimulators and have been used to stimulate breast milk secretion for decades. However, since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.

===Specific diseases===
Prolactinoma or other tumours arising in or near the pituitary — such as those that cause [[acromegaly]] may block the flow of dopamine from the brain to the prolactin-secreting cells, likewise, division of the [[pituitary stalk]] or hypothalamic disease.  Other causes include [[chronic kidney failure]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[bronchogenic carcinoma]] and [[sarcoidosis]]. Some women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] may have mildly-elevated prolactin levels.

[[Nonpuerperal mastitis]] may induce transient hyperprolactinemia (neurogenic hyperprolactinemia) of about three weeks' duration; conversely, hyperprolactinemia may contribute to nonpuerperal mastitis.&lt;ref name="pmid2918655"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters F, Schuth W | title = Hyperprolactinemia and nonpuerperal mastitis (duct ectasia) | journal = JAMA | volume = 261 | issue = 11 | pages = 1618–20 | date = March 1989 | pmid = 2918655 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1989.03420110094030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from diagnosing hyperprolactinaemia and [[hypopituitarism]], prolactin levels are often checked by physicians in patients that have suffered a [[seizure]], when there is doubt as to whether they have had an [[epileptic seizure]] or a [[non-epileptic seizure]].  Shortly after epileptic seizures, prolactin levels often rise, whereas they are normal in non-epileptic seizures.

==Diagnosis==
A doctor will test for prolactin blood levels in women with unexplained milk secretion ([[galactorrhea]]) or irregular [[menses]] or [[infertility]], and in men with impaired sexual function and milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor will test [[thyroid]] function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. While a plain [[X-ray]] of the bones surrounding the pituitary may reveal the presence of a large macro-adenoma, the small micro-adenoma will not be apparent. Magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]) is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumours and determining their size. [[MRI]] scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumour progression and the effects of therapy. [[Computed Tomography]] (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.

In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumour, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues, and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones is normal. Depending on the size of the tumour, the doctor may request an eye exam with measurement of visual fields.

The hormone prolactin is downregulated by [[dopamine]] and is upregulated by [[estrogen|oestrogen]]. A falsely-high measurement may occur due to the presence of the biologically-inactive [[macroprolactin]] in the serum. This can show up as high prolactin in some types of tests, but is asymptomatic.

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually medication with [[dopamine agonist]]s such as [[cabergoline]],&lt;ref name="pmid10404830"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verhelst J, Abs R, Maiter D, van den Bruel A, Vandeweghe M, Velkeniers B, Mockel J, Lamberigts G, Petrossians P, Coremans P, Mahler C, Stevenaert A, Verlooy J, Raftopoulos C, Beckers A | title = Cabergoline in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia: a study in 455 patients | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 84 | issue = 7 | pages = 2518–22 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10404830 | doi = 10.1210/jc.84.7.2518 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10404830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bromocriptine]] (often preferred when pregnancy is possible),&lt;ref name="pmid7915824"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webster J, Piscitelli G, Polli A, Ferrari CI, Ismail I, Scanlon MF | title = A comparison of cabergoline and bromocriptine in the treatment of hyperprolactinemic amenorrhea.

'''Idiopathic osteosclerosis''' is a condition which may be found around the roots of a [[tooth]].  It is usually painless and found during routine [[radiograph]]s.  It appears as a [[radiopaque]] (light area) around a tooth, usually a [[premolar]] or [[Molar (tooth)|molar]].  There is no sign of [[inflammation]] of the tooth.

==Presentation==
Focal radiodensity of the jaw which is NOT inflammatory, dysplastic, neoplastic or a manifestation of a systemic disease.
This is common and affects 5% of the population, usually seen in teens and those in their 20s.  Typically asymptomatic and is an incidental finding on a radiograph. found anywhere in the jaw, most commonly in the mandibular premolar-molar region. The shape ranges from round to linear streaks to occasional angular forms.

==Cause ==
A reaction to past trauma or infection but it's difficult to rule out in some cases.

==Diagnosis==
Usual diagnosis is via radiograph, patient history, [[biopsy]] is rarely needed.  Periodic follow ups should included additional radiographs that show minimal growth or regression.

===Radiology===
Well defined, rounded or triangular radiodensity, that is uniformly opaque.  There is no lucent component.  Found near the root apex or in the inter-radicular area.  Root resorption and tooth movement are rare.

===Differential Diagnosis===
[[Condensing osteitis]], [[Garre's sclerosing osteomyelitis|sclerosing osteomyelitis]], Enostosis [[cementoblastoma]], [[hypercementosis]], Exostoses (tori).
Condensing osteitis may resemble idiopathic osteosclerosis, however, associated teeth are always nonvital in condensing osteitis.

==Treatment==
No treatment is necessary.

The '''Experimental Medicine and Biology Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental}}, IByME) is a [[research and development]] centre affiliated to the [[University of Buenos Aires]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

==History==
The institute was privately founded on March 14, 1944 by Dr. [[Bernardo A. Houssay]], [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] and [[Medicine]] (1947) for his work in [[diabetes]] and the control of the [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]]. Drs. [[Eduardo Braun-Menéndez]], [[Oscar Orías]], [[Juan T. Lewis]] and [[Virgilio G. Foglia]] were co-founders. The founding of the Institute was motivated by the dismissal of Dr. Houssay, together with 150 other professors from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], by the military government. Dr. Houssay became its director and brought to work with him several colleagues and students. The initiative was made possible by the support of Dr. [[Miguel F. Laphitzondo]] and others who granted financial contributions in memory of [[Juan B. Sauberán]].

The institute was the first organization devoted to [[scientific research]] in Argentina.  Its initial structure resembled that of the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] (now [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States) and of the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France. In 1949, the Institute was established as a [[charter]]ed [[foundation (charity)|foundation]] recognized by the National Bureau of Non-Profit Entitites (''Registro Nacional de Entidades de Bien Público'').

Later on, several Houssay’s disciples left the Institute to settle research groups in many Argentine and other [[Latin American]] universities. Many research laboratories were founded following the model of Houssay’s Institute. For example, Dr. [[Miguel Rolando Covian]] chaired the Department of Physiology of the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto]] of the [[University of São Paulo]] from 1952 to 1986, giving origin to a large scientific group in [[Brazil]].

On January 16, 1959, Eduardo Braun Menéndez, who played an outstanding role in the life of the Institute, died. His vacancy in the Board of Directors was filled by Dr. [[Luis F. Leloir]] who would later receive the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] (1970).

After Dr. Houssay and others were reintegrated into the University of Buenos Aires, in 1959, the Institute was affiliated to this University, remaining so until today. Dr. Bernardo Houssay was the director of the Institute until his death in 1971. Thereupon, an Administrative Commission led by Prof. Dr. Virgilio Foglia, assisted by Dr. Julia V. Uranga and Dr. Luis F. Leloir, undertook the Institute's affairs. The Institute established legal associations with the [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]].

The death of Prof. Dr. Luis F. Leloir, in December 1987, and the growth of the Institute prompted the need of increasing the number of members in the Administrative Commission. Accordingly, the necessary changes in the Institute Bylaws were submitted to the National Bureau of Legal Entitites (''Dirección General de Personas Jurídicas'') for approval. While the new Bylaws were under consideration, Drs. Alberto Baldi, Jorge Blaquier, Ricardo Calandra, Eduardo Charreau, Alejandro De Nicola, Enrique Segura, Alicia Roldán, Enrique del Castillo, Carlos Libertun, and Marta Tesone collaborated with Dr. Virgilio G. Foglia and Dr. Uranga in the administration of the Institute.

On July 12, 1993, the Institute was given the status of a Unit of Technological Transfer by the Argentinian Secretary of Science and Technology. This enabled the participation of technological and scientific sectors as consultants to productive sectors, public or private, both in the selection and adaptation of available technology and in the transfer of results derived from research.

==Activities==

The interests of the Institute can be grouped into three categories: 
* Basic and applied investigations in [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]];
* Training of students and pre- and postdoctoral fellows; and
* Organization of courses at pre- and post-graduate levels.

The Institute is the site for the Argentine Committee of the Postdoctoral Program of selection of postdoctoral research fellowships in the area of Biomedical Sciences granted by [[John E. Fogarty International Center]] from the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]]; such Committee being chaired by Dr. Eduardo Charreau.

Historically, the main discoveries were in the fields of [[endocrinology]] and physiology.  The current research areas are wider and include [[Neurosciences]], [[Biology of Reproduction]], Experimental [[Oncology]] and [[Immunology]].  Results are published in journals of international recognition, thus demonstrating the level of excellence reached by the different research groups.

'''Liri Berisha''', née '''Ramaj''', is an Albanian [[pediatrician]] and president of the Albanian Children Foundation, and also an UNICEF ambassador.

She is the wife of [[Sali Berisha]], the former President and Prime Minister of [[Albania]], with whom she has two children, daughter Argita, and son Shkëlzen.

Liri Berisha was born '''Slobodanka Ramaj''', the daughter of Rexhep Ramaj Balidemaj, an ethnic Albanian from [[Martinovići, Plav|Martinovići]] near [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], at the time part of Yugoslavia (now [[Montenegro]]), and Milica Bulatović, a Serbian woman of Montenegrin descent born and raised in [[Belgrade]]. After the Yugoslav-Albanian split in 1948, her name was changed by the government to Liri.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gazetadita.al/korigjojeni-emrin-e-nenes-ne-gjendjen-civile-znj-berisha/|language=Albanian|publisher=Gazeta Dita|date=2015-05-08|title=FAKSIMILE: A e ka korrigjuar më në fund emrin e nënës në Gjendjen Civile, zonja Berisha?|trans-title=Facsimile: Did Mrs. Berish correct her mother's name in the Civic Office registers?|quote=Liri Berisha është e bija e Rexhepit dhe Milicës.

In 2008, Berisha founded the Mother Teresa Cultural Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/04/27/E683-3_honoring-the-first-lady-of-albania-dr-liri-berisha/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Women's Information Network]] named Berisha "Woman of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/04/27/E683-3_honoring-the-first-lady-of-albania-dr-liri-berisha/|title=Honoring The First Lady Of Albania, Dr. Liri Berisha|publisher=Capitol Words|date=|accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berisha joined [[Autism Speaks]] in 2011 in celebrating the opening of a new centre for autistic children in Albania, calling the centre a way to improve the lives of children with autism there.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=https://autismspeaksblog.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/albania-autism/|title=First Lady of Albania Attends Opening of New Autism Support Center in Tirana

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred in [[Oceania]] and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].

This section does '''not''' include [[List of rampage killers#School massacres|school massacres]]; [[List of rampage killers#Workplace killings|workplace killings]]; [[List of rampage killers#Religious, political or racial crimes|religious, political, or racial crimes]]; or mass murders that took place primarily in a [[List of rampage killers#Domestic violence|domestic environment]], like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:

{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:

* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

His teenage son Farul Rafiq was 17 when diagnosed with leukemia in 1992. Farul was flown to London, England (Hammersmith Hospital) for treatment. There, he underwent a regimented treatment which included an autologous bone marrow transplant, which was not yet available in Malaysia. A few years into battling the diseases, he was finally certified cancer-free.

While recuperating at the hospital in London, Dato’ Mohd Farid’s family made a promise that on their return to Malaysia, they would set up a cancer organisation aimed to help those from lower income groups gain access to cancer treatment.

On 4 August 2011, Farul died of lung fibrosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">'''Maxillary lateral incisor agenesis''' ('''MLIA''') is lack of development ([[agenesis]]) of one or both of the [[maxillary lateral incisor]] teeth. In normal [[human dentition]], this would be the second tooth on either side from the center of the top row of teeth. The condition is bilateral if the incisor is absent on both sides or unilateral if only one is smissing. It appears to have a [[Genetic disorder|genetic component]].

==Use in anthropology==
Because MLIA can be detected from partial skeletal remains, it is useful in the field of [[anthropology]]. Anthropologically-interesting human remains often have relatively well preserved [[human skeleton|skeleton]]s, but no [[soft tissue]]s or intact [[DNA]]. This makes it hard to determine relationships between the deceased individuals. MLIA is sometimes related to [[inbreeding]], so the presence of MLIA in many members of a large collection of remains can indicate that the population that lived there was relatively inbred. This technique has been used to study a group of [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic farmer]]s.&lt;ref name="First Farmers Were Also Inbred"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/did-inbreeding-bind-early-farmer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622151900/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2013/06/did-inbreeding-bind-early-farmer.html |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }} First Farmers Were Also Inbred, from [[Science (journal)|ScienceNOW]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance seal.PNG|thumb|seal]]
The '''Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance''' (MBDS) consortium is a self-organised and sub-regional co-operation spearheaded by health ministries from member countries to collaborate on infectious disease surveillance and control. The co-operation focuses on cross-border co-operation at selected sites and has matured through several phases of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbdsoffice.com/index_2008.php Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112234/http://www.mbdsoffice.com/index_2008.php |date=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRO/MBDS is a component of the outbreak reporting system [[ProMED-mail]].

== History ==
The Ministries of Health of Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2001 in [[Kunming]], China, with the Regional Coordinating office agreed to be located in the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghsi.org/projects/mbds.html Global Health and Security Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108094610/http://www.ghsi.org/projects/mbds.html |date=8 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

=== Executive Board ===
Cambodia: Prof. Sann Chan Soeung (Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health)

China: Dr. Wang Liying (Director, Ministry of Health)

Lao PDR: Dr. Bounlay Phommasack (Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health)

Myanmar: Prof. Saw Lwin (Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health)

Thailand: Dr. Kumnuan Ungchusak (Senior Expert, Ministry of Public Health)

Vietnam: Dr. Nguyen Hoang Long (Vice Director, Ministry of Health)

=== MBDS Coordinating Office ===
Dr. Moe Ko Oo
MBDS Coordinator, c/o Ministry of Public Health

== Achievements ==
MBDS has applied epidemiology and GIS, initiated tabletop exercises (TTXs) on Pandemic Preparedness in country and regional levels in 2006 and 2007. It is prepared to conduct at least one outbreak investigation, TTX or drill at each cross-border site each year, seeking to conduct joint investigation of a zoonotic disease as a particular priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-influenza.org/node/705 Avian Influenza and Pandemic Threat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612140445/http://www.un-influenza.org/node/705 |date=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the extension of MOU was signed by the six MBDS health ministers in Geneva, for indefinite time period. With the increasing number of cross-border sites, MBDS developed a new 6-year action plan focusing on seven inter-
related core strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apeiresearch.net/document_file/news_20070705110009-1.pdf Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network Signs New Memorandum of Agreement at World Health Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;

It piloted cross-border co-operation, with the exchange of regular disease information on a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, cross-border meetings, monitoring and evaluation, multi-sector engagement (especially immigration, local authorities), cross-border epidemiologic case history, cross-border medical care and clinical follow-up to nearby provincial areas. It has  used 2-way ICT-based communications between local, provincial and central levels in routine surveillance reporting and outbreak investigation (examples include equipment and protocols for communications through internet,  cell phone SMS messaging, satellite telephones, telephone hotline, email).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbdsoffice.com/pdf/presentation_mbds_office.pdf Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network Presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008222232/http://www.mbdsoffice.com/pdf/presentation_mbds_office.pdf |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also trained field epidemiologist and health officials of Member Countries through treating FETP alumni as training staff for countries to establish new long-term and short-term epidemiology training programs, at the same time enhancing short-course training in each member country by supporting curriculum design and training or providing lecturers/expert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeas.europa.eu/health/pandemic_readiness/docs/07_13_assessment_final_report_en.pdf Outcome and Impact Assessment of the Global Response to the Avian Influenza Crisis ]&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2006-2007, 110 workers were trained in either field epidemiology and disease surveillance, analytical techniques or social, political and economic aspects of border health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/2B17C7E0-915B-43AC-9D2E-DC74425B53F9/0/05_CSR.pdf Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628131244/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/2B17C7E0-915B-43AC-9D2E-DC74425B53F9/0/05_CSR.pdf |date=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unprecedented joint avian influenza investigation was triggered when an infected Lao citizen was found in Thailand. Since then, Vietnam and Lao PDR also carried out joint investigations for outbreaks of typhoid and malaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTOPAVIFLU/Resources/UN_WB_AHI_ProgressReportFinal.pdf Responses to Avian Influenza and State of Pandemic Readiness Third Global Progress Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Chamberlain]] sporting a monocle]]

A '''monocle''' is a type of [[corrective lens]] used to correct or enhance the [[visual perception|vision]] in only one [[Human eye|eye]]. It consists of a circular [[Lens (optics)|lens]], generally with a wire ring around the circumference that can be attached to a string or wire. The other end of the string is then connected to the wearer's clothing to avoid losing the monocle. The [[antiquarian]] [[Philipp von Stosch]] wore a monocle in Rome in the 1720s, in order to closely examine [[engraving]]s and antique [[engraved gem]]s, but the monocle did not become an article of gentlemen's apparel until the nineteenth century. It was introduced by the [[dandy]]'s '''quizzing glass''' of the 1790s, as a sense of high fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocles|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/college/museyeum/online_exhibitions/spectacles/monocles.cfm|work=Spectacles Gallery|publisher=The College of Optometrists|accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
[[File:monocle with gallery.jpg|thumb|left|An early-20th-century [[gold-filled jewelry|gold-filled]] monocle with gallery]]
There are three styles of monocle. The first style consists of a simple loop of metal with a lens which was slotted into the eye [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. These were the first monocles worn in England and could be found from the 1830s onwards. The second style, which was developed in the 1890s, was the most elaborate, consisting of a frame with a raised edge-like extension known as the ''gallery''.&lt;ref&gt;Ekstein, J. and J. &amp; G. Perkinks. ''Gentlemen's Dress Accessories''. Shire Publications. U.K.:1994. {{ISBN|0-85263-904-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery was designed to help secure the monocle in place by raising it out of the eye's orbit slightly, so that the eyelashes would not jar it. Monocles with galleries were often the most expensive. The very wealthy would have the frames custom-made to fit their eye sockets. A sub-category of the galleried monocle was the "sprung gallery", where the gallery was replaced by an incomplete circle of flattened, ridged wire supported by three posts. The ends were pulled together, the monocle was placed in the eye orbit, and the ends released, causing the gallery to spring out and keep the monocle in place.
The third style of monocle was frameless. This consisted of a cut piece of glass, with a serrated edge to provide a grip and sometimes a hole drilled into one side for a cord. Often the frameless monocle had no cord and would be worn freely. This style was popular at the beginning of the 20th century as the lens could be cut to fit any shape eye orbit inexpensively, without the cost of a customized frame.

It is a myth that wearing a monocle is uncomfortable{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. If customised, monocles could be worn securely with little effort. However, periodic adjustment is a fact of life for monocle wearers to keep the monocle from popping, as can be seen in films featuring [[Erich von Stroheim]]. Often only the rich could afford to have a monocle custom-fabricated, while the poor had to settle for ill-fitting monocles that were both less comfortable and less secure. The popular perception was (and still is) that a monocle could easily fall off with the wrong [[facial expression]]. This is true to an extent, as raising the eyebrow too far will allow the monocle to fall. [[File:Quizzingglass.jpg|thumb|right|19th-century [[Gold-filled jewelry|gold-filled]] quizzing glass]]A once-standard [[comedic device]] exploits this: an upper-class gentleman effects a shocked expression in response to some event, and his monocle falls into his drink, or smashes to pieces on the floor, etc. 
Another myth is that [[Abraham Lincoln]] wore a monocle. &lt;ref&gt;Ekstein, J. and J. &amp; G. Perkinks. Gentlemen's Dress Accessories. Shire Publications. U.K.:1994. {{ISBN|0-85263-904-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been said that he created his own style of monocle and wore it when he was away from the public or very rarely when in public. 

The quizzing glass should not be confused with a monocle, since it is held to one's eye with a handle in a fashion similar to a [[lorgnette]]. A quizzing glass is not held by the eye socket itself.

==Wearers==
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the monocle was generally associated with wealthy upper-class men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/luxury_explainer/2012/12/monocles_how_did_they_become_a_symbol_of_wealth.html |title=The One-Eyed Man Is King |author= J. Bryan Lowder |date=December 27, 2012 |work=Slate |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/monocles-ow-do-people-really-wear-these |title=Monocles: ‘Ow, do people really wear these?’ |author=Will Femia |date=September 19, 2012 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a [[morning coat]] and a [[top hat]], the monocle completed the costume of the stereotypical 1890s [[Capitalism|capitalist]]. Monocles were also accessories of [[German Army (German Empire)|German military]] officers from this period; especially from [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. German military officers known to have worn a monocle include [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]], [[Werner von Fritsch]],&lt;ref name="schikelgruber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schikelgruber.net/images/fritsch.jpg|title=Image: fritsch.jpg|publisher=schikelgruber.net|accessdate=2015-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320111314/http://schikelgruber.net/images/fritsch.jpg|archive-date=2012-03-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Ludendorff]],&lt;ref name="mousely"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mousely.com/wiki_image/6/6a/VonLudendorff.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727082022/http://mousely.com/wiki_image/6/6a/VonLudendorff.jpg|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-27|title=Image: VonLudendorff.jpg|publisher=mousely.com|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Model]],&lt;ref&gt;http://home.scarlet.be/~tsc94696/images/Walter_Model.jpg{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter von Reichenau]], [[Dietrich von Saucken]], [[Hans von Seeckt]],&lt;ref name="preussen-chronik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussen-chronik.de/bilder/1265_Hans_von_Seeckt.jpeg|title=Image: 1265_Hans_von_Seeckt.jpeg, (349 × 480 px)|publisher=preussen-chronik.de|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hugo Sperrle]].

Monocles were most prevalent in the late 19th century, but are rarely worn today. This is due in large part to advances in [[optometry]] which allow for better measurement of [[refraction error|refractive error]], so that [[glasses]] and [[contact lens]]es can be prescribed with different [[optical power|strengths]] in each eye.

The monocle did, however, gain a following in the stylish [[lesbian]] circles of the early 20th century, when lesbians would don a monocle for effect. Such women included [[Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge|Una Lady Troubridge]], [[Radclyffe Hall]], and Weimar German reporter [[Sylvia von Harden]]. (The painting ''Portrait of the Journalist Sylvia Von Harden'' by German expressionist painter [[Otto Dix]] depicts its subject sporting a monocle.)

Famous figures who wore a monocle include British politicians [[Joseph Chamberlain]], his son [[Austen Chamberlain|Austen]], [[Henry Chaplin]], and [[Angus Maude]]. [[Percy Toplis]] ([[The Monocled Mutineer]]), founder of Pakistan [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], Portuguese President [[António de Spínola]], filmmakers [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]], prominent 19th-century Portuguese writer [[Eça de Queiroz]], Soviet writer [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], actor [[Conrad Veidt]], [[Dada]]ists [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Raoul Hausmann]], esotericist [[Julius Evola]], French collaborationist politician [[Louis Darquier de Pellepoix]], [[Poet laureate]] [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], singer [[Richard Tauber]], diplomat [[Christopher Ewart-Biggs]] (a smoked-glass monocle, to disguise his glass eye), Major [[Johnnie Cradock]], actors [[Ralph Lynn]], [[George Arliss]] and [[Martyn Green]], and [[Karl Marx]]. In another vein, [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] was one of only a few noted women who occasionally wore a monocle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4115443,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Elizabeth Anscombe | date=2001-01-11 | accessdate=2010-05-13 | first=Jane | last=O'Grady}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous wearers of the 21st century so far include [[astronomy|astronomer]] [[Patrick Moore|Sir Patrick Moore]], and former [[boxing|boxer]] [[Chris Eubank]]. Abstract expressionist painter [[Barnett Newman]] wore a monocle mainly for getting a closer look at artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Pierre (Summer 1969). "Through the Louvre with Barnett Newman". ''Artnews''. '''68''' (4): 34–39, 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Tauber]] wore a monocle to mask a squint in one eye.

Fictional characters that wear monocles include Planters mascot [[Mr. Peanut]], aristocratic 1920s sleuth [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], the [[P. G. Wodehouse]] character [[Psmith]], [[Batman]] antagonist [[the Penguin]], and ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' antagonist and leader of HYDRA Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker.  [[Count von Count]] from the children's program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' wears a monocle to show his distinction as a count. The ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' mascot [[Eustace Tilley]], an early 19th-century dandy, is depicted using a monocle like a quizzing glass. A monocle is also a distinctive part of the costume of at least three [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] characters: [[The Pirates of Penzance#Roles|Major-General Stanley]] in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Sir Joseph Porter in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', and Reginald Bunthorne in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and composer Sullivan used one himself. In some variant productions, numerous other characters sport the distinctive eyewear, and some noted performers of the "G&amp;S" repertoire also have worn a monocle. [[First Doctor|The Doctor]] as played by [[William Hartnell]] wore one. The French gentleman thief [[Arsene Lupin]] is commonly said to have a monocle, and is illustrated with it on whenever not under a disguise. [[Edgar Bergen]]'s famous dummy [[Charlie McCarthy]] wore a monocle and was normally attired in formal wear. [[Werner Klemperer]] as Kommandant Wilhelm Klink in ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' usually wore one in his left eye. [[Doc Savage]] aide 'Johnny' Littlejohn wore a monocle, as he was blind in one eye.

'''Napa State Hospital''' is a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Napa, California]], founded in 1875. It is located along [[California State Route 221]], also known as the Napa Vallejo Highway. One of California's five state hospitals, Napa State holds civil and forensic patients in a sprawling 138 acre campus. According to a hospital spokesperson, there were 2,338 people employed at the facility during the 2016-2017 fiscal year,  making it one of the region's largest employers.

The [[Napa Valley Cricket Club]] play their matches at McGrath Field, a multi-use sports field, at the eastern end of the Napa State Hospital campus.

==History==
Originally named Napa Insane Asylum, the facility opened on November 15, 1875.  It sat on {{convert|192|acre|km2|1}} of property stretching from the [[Napa River]] to what is now Skyline Park.  The property was originally part of [[Rancho Tulucay]], part of a [[Ranchos of California|Mexican Land Grant]], sold by Cayetano Juarez to the [[State of California]] in 1872.  The facility was originally built to relieve overcrowding at [[Stockton State Hospital|Stockton Asylum]].  By the early 1890s the facility had over 1,300 patients which was over double the original capacity it was designed to house.  The original main building known as "The Castle" was an ornate and imposing building constructed with bricks.  Facilities on the property included a large farm that included dairy and poultry ranches, vegetable garden and fruit orchards that provided a large part of the food supply consumed by the residents.

It is also the site of [[The Cramps]] famous 1978 show when several patients attempted to escape. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''National Stroke Awareness Month''' is observed in the [[United States]] annually during the month of May. National Stroke Awareness Month was created to promote public awareness and reduce the incidence of [[stroke]] in the United States.

==History==

National Stroke Awareness Month began in May 1989 after President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed the Presidential Proclamation 5975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=20508#axzz1IIjVldn1 UCSB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zphib1920.org/zetashaveheart/may-national-stroke-awareness-month/ Zetas]&lt;/ref&gt; National Stroke Awareness Month aims to increase the public awareness about the warning signs of stroke, symptoms of a stroke, stroke prevention, and the impact of stroke on survivors, families and caregivers. The United States Government, along with National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, and other [[Nonprofit organization|non-profits]], work together to educate the American people about the prevention of stroke and provide key resources to stroke survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=20508. UCSB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Because [[Tissue plasminogen activator|tPA]], a clot-busting drug, can only be administered to stroke patients within the first three hours of the onset of stroke, recognizing the symptoms of stroke is very important. National Stroke Awareness Month aims to educate Americans to recognize the symptoms of stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/preventing_stroke.htm Ninds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.firstgiving.com/blog/bid/91765/May-is-National-Stroke-Awareness-Month First Giving]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
80 percent of strokes are caused by lifestyle; therefore, strokes are largely preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blessinghospital.org/?id=952&amp;sid=2 Blessing Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; Although some stroke [[risk factor]]s, such as age or race, cannot be controlled, there are many other steps individuals can take to reduce their risk of stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroke.org/we-can-help/survivors/stroke-recovery/first-steps-recovery/preventing-another-stroke National Stroke Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">"'''Nothing About Us Without Us!'''" ([[Latin]]: "'''Nihil de nobis, sine nobis'''") is a [[slogan]] used to communicate the idea that no policy should be decided by any representative without the full and direct participation of members of the group(s) affected by that policy. This involves [[Nation state|national]], [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[social model of disability|disability-based]], or other groups that are often thought to be [[social exclusion|marginalized]] from political, social, and economic opportunities.

The saying has its origins in [[Central Europe]]an political traditions. It was the political motto that helped establish—and, loosely translated into Latin, provided the name for—Poland's 1505 constitutional legislation, ''[[Nihil novi]]'', which first transferred governing authority from the monarch to the parliament. It subsequently became a byword for democratic norms. In this use, it is closely analogous to one of the most familiar slogans of the [[American Revolutionary War]], '[[No taxation without representation]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Davies| first = Norman| title = Heart of Europe: The Past in Poland's Present| year = 1984|publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also a long-standing principle of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] law and [[foreign policy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bentley| first = R| title = Hungary, from 1848 to 1860| year = 1860| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=enuRlR0UHhoC&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a cornerstone of the foreign policy of [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 16| issue = 48| pages = 558–571| last = Smogorzewski| first = Kazimierz| title = Poland's Foreign Relations| journal = The Slavonic and East European Review| year=1938| jstor = 4203420}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| pages = 47–88| editors = P Wandycz (ed.)| last = Kornat| first = Marek|author2=J Micgiel | title = Reflections on Polish Foreign Policy| chapter = The Policy of Equilibrium and Polish Bilateralism| year = 2007| url = http://politologia.wsb-nlu.edu.pl/uploadedFiles/file/M_Kornat%20-%20The%20Policy%20of%20Equilibrium%20and%20Polish%20Bilateralism.pdf|isbn=0-9654520-7-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term in its English form came into use in [[disability activism]] during the 1990s. [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] relates that he first heard the term used in talks by [[South African]] disability activists Michael Masutha and William Rowland, who had in turn heard the phrase used by an unnamed [[East European]] activist at an earlier international disability rights conference. In 1998, Charlton used the saying as title for a book on disability rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 0-520-22481-7| last = Charlton| first = James I| title = Nothing About Us Without Us| accessdate = 2010-06-22| year = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ohqff8DBt9gC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability rights activist [[David Werner]] used the same title for another book, also published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe001/dwe00101.htm ''Nothing About Us Without Us: Developing Innovative Technologies For, By and With Disabled Persons,'' Healthwrights, Palo Alto CA, 1998] {{ISBN|9780965558532}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The saying has since moved from the [[disability rights]] movement to other [[interest group]], [[identity politics]], and [[populism|populist]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsalliance.org/publicationsdetails.aspx?id=310|title=Nothing about us without us: Greater, meaningful involvement of people who use illegal drugs|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexworkawareness.org/nothing-about-us-without-us-the-shared-goals-of-the-harm-reduction-and-sex-worker-rights-movements|title=Nothing About Us Without Us: The Shared Goals of the Harm Reduction and Sex Worker Rights Movements|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''pancreatic cyst''' is a fluid filled sac within the [[pancreas]].

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes range from benign to malignant. Pancreatic pseudocysts can occur in the setting of [[pancreatitis]], though they are only reliably diagnosed 6 weeks after the episode of acute pancreatitis.

Benign tumors such as [[Pancreatic serous cystadenoma|serous cystadenomas]] can occur. Main branch [[intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm]]s (IPMNs) are associated with dilatation of the main [[pancreatic duct]], while side branch IPMNs are typically benign, and not associated with dilatation. [[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography|MRCP]] can help distinguish the position of the cysts relative to the pancreatic duct, and direct appropriate treatment and follow-up. The most common malignancy that can present as a pancreatic cyst is a [[mucinous cystic neoplasm]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Follow up guidelines==
Cysts from 1–5&amp;nbsp;mm on CT or ultrasound are typically too small to characterize and considered benign. No further imaging follow-up is recommended for these lesions. Cysts from 6–9&amp;nbsp;mm require a single follow-up in 2–3 years, preferably with MRCP to better evaluate the pancreatic duct.  If stable at follow-up, no further imaging follow-up is recommended. For cysts from 1–1.9&amp;nbsp;cm follow-up is suggested with MRCP or multiphasic CT in 1–2 years. If stable at follow-up, the interval of imaging follow-up is increased to 2–3 years. Cysts from 2–2.9&amp;nbsp;cm have more malignant potential, and a baseline endoscopic ultrasound is suggested, followed by MRCP or multiphasic CT in 6–12 months. If patients are young, surgery may be considered to avoid the need for prolonged surveillance. If these cysts are stable at follow-up, interval imaging follow-up can be done in 1–2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=NM |last2=Katz |first2=SS |last3=Escalon |first3=JG |last4=Do |first4=RK |title=Imaging patterns of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: an illustrated discussion of the International Consensus Guidelines for the Management of IPMN |journal=Abdominal Imaging |date=March 2015 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=663–77 |pmid=25219664 |doi=10.1007/s00261-014-0236-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="121986">'''Patient safety''' is a discipline that emphasizes [[safety]] in [[health care]] through the prevention, reduction, reporting, and analysis of [[medical error]] that often leads to [[adverse effect]]s. The frequency and magnitude of avoidable adverse events experienced by [[patient]]s was not well known until the 1990s, when multiple countries reported staggering numbers of patients harmed and killed by medical errors. Recognizing that healthcare errors impact 1 in every 10 patients around the world, the [[World Health Organization]] calls patient safety an endemic concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en/index.html | title= World Alliance for Patient Safety |accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Organization Web Site | publisher= World Health Organization|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, patient safety has emerged as a distinct healthcare discipline supported by an immature yet developing scientific framework.  There is a significant transdisciplinary body of theoretical and research literature that informs the science of patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patrick A. Palmieri| year = 2008 | title = The anatomy and physiology of error in averse healthcare events | journal =Advances in Health Care Management | volume = 7 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-8231(08)07003-1 | pages = 33–68|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting patient safety knowledge continually informs improvement efforts such as: applying lessons learned from business and industry, adopting innovative technologies, educating providers and consumers, enhancing error reporting systems, and developing new economic incentives.[[File:Surgeon operating, Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, circa 1990.JPEG|250px|right|alt=A thoracic surgeon performs a mitral valve replacement at the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center.|A thoracic surgeon performs a mitral valve replacement at the [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]].]]

==Prevalence of adverse events==

[[File:Medicine aryballos Louvre CA1989-2183.jpg|thumb|Greek physician treating a patient, c. 480–470 BC (Louvre Museum, Paris, France)]]
Millennia ago, Hippocrates recognized the potential for injuries that arise from the well-intentioned actions of healers.  Greek healers in the 4th century BC drafted the [[Hippocratic Oath]] and pledged to "prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone."&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Health, History of Medicine: [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html Greek Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since then, the directive ''primum non nocere'' (“first do no harm) has become a central tenet for contemporary medicine.  However, despite an increasing emphasis on the [[Medicine#History|scientific basis of medical practice]] in Europe and the United States in the late 19th Century, data on adverse outcomes were hard to come by and the various studies commissioned collected mostly anecdotal events.&lt;ref&gt;The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, [http://www.apsf.org/about/brief_history.mspx A Brief History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113073054/http://www.apsf.org/about/brief_history.mspx |date=2006-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the public and the medical specialty of [[anesthesia]] were shocked in April 1982 by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television program [[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]] entitled ''The Deep Sleep''. Presenting accounts of anesthetic accidents, the producers stated that, every year, 6,000 Americans die or suffer brain damage related to these mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Tomlin (producer): ''The Deep Sleep: 6,000 will die or suffer brain damage'', WLS-TV Chicago, 20/20. April 22, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1983, the British [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]] jointly sponsored a symposium on anesthesia deaths and injuries, resulting in an agreement to share statistics and to conduct studies.&lt;ref&gt;Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation: [http://www.apsf.org/about/rovenstine/part4.mspx The establishment of the APSF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416075723/http://www.apsf.org/about/rovenstine/part4.mspx |date=2006-04-16 }}  by Ellison C. Pierce, Jr., M.D.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 1984 the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA) had established the [[APSF|Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation]] (APSF). The APSF marked the first use of the term "patient safety" in the name of professional reviewing organization.&lt;ref&gt;Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation: [http://www.apsf.org/about_safety.php Comments From the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Although anesthesiologists comprise only about 5% of physicians in the United States, anesthesiology became the leading medical specialty addressing issues of patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  David M Gaba | year = 2000 | title = Anesthesiology as a model for patient safety in health care | journal = Medical Care | volume = 320 | pages = 785–788 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7237/785 | accessdate = 2006-06-24 | pmid = 10720368 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.785 | issue =  7237 | pmc =  1117775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in Australia, the [[#Australian Patient Safety Foundation .28APSF.29|Australian Patient Safety Foundation]] was founded in 1989 for anesthesia error monitoring. Both organizations were soon expanded as the magnitude of the medical error crisis became known.

In the United States, the full magnitude and impact of errors in health care was not appreciated until the 1990s, when several reports brought attention to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Thomas, Eric J.

The IOM called for a broad national effort to include establishment of a Center for Patient Safety, expanded reporting of adverse events, development of safety programs in health care organizations, and attention by regulators, health care purchasers, and professional societies. The majority of media attention, however, focused on the staggering statistics: from 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths annually due to medical error in hospitals, 7,000 preventable deaths related to medication errors alone. Within 2 weeks of the report's release, Congress began hearings and President Clinton ordered a government-wide study of the feasibility of implementing the report's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Charatan | first=Fred | year=2000 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/320/7235/597?ijkey=190e9b6dd6e8fec4ca3c2e353f290efb8237b334&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | title=Clinton acts to reduce medical mistakes | publisher=BMJ Publishing Group | accessdate=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, subsequent reports emphasized the striking prevalence and consequences of medical error.

The experience has been similar in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Fund International Survey: [http://www.cmwf.org/Publications/Publications_show.htm?doc_id=313012 Taking the Pulse of Health Care Systems: Experiences of Patients with Health Problems in Six Countries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621014659/http://www.cmwf.org/Publications/Publications_show.htm?doc_id=313012 |date=2006-06-21 }} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication==
Effective communication is essential for ensuring patient safety. Communicating starts with the provisioning of available information on any operational site especially in mobile professional services. Communicating continues with the reduction of administrative burden, releasing the operating staff and easing the operational demand by model driven orders, thus enabling adherence to a well executable procedure finalised with a qualified minimum of required feedback.

===Effective and ineffective communication===
[[File:Nurse takes a patient's blood pressure.jpg|thumb|Nurse and patient non-verbal communication|right]]

The use of effective communication among patients and healthcare professionals is critical for achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the [[Patient safety organization#Canadian Patient Safety Institute|Canadian Patient Safety Institute]], ineffective communication has the opposite effect as it can lead to patient harm.&lt;ref name=CPSI&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/English/toolsResources/safetyCompetencies/Documents/Safety%20Competencies.pdf | title=The Safety Competencies - Enhancing Patient Safety Across the Health Professions | edition=first | date=August 2009 | publisher=Canadian Patient Safety Institute | vauthors=Frank JR, Brien S | isbn=978-1-926541-15-0 | access-date=2014-11-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614151111/http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/English/toolsResources/safetyCompetencies/Documents/Safety%20Competencies.pdf | archive-date=2013-06-14 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication with regards to patient safety can be classified into two categories: prevention of adverse events and responding to adverse events. Use of effective communication can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an adverse event, then better and more effective communication skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt;

Methods of effective verbal and nonverbal communication include treating patients with respect and showing empathy, clearly communicating with patients in a way that best fits their needs, practicing active listening skills, being sensitive with regards to cultural diversity and respecting the privacy and confidentiality rights of the patient.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt; To use appropriate communication technology, healthcare professionals must choose which channel of communication is best suited to benefit the patient. Some channels are more likely to result in communication errors than others, such as communicating through telephone or email (missing nonverbal messages which are an important element of understanding the situation). It is also the responsibility of the provider to know the advantages and limitations of using [[electronic health records]], as they do not convey all information necessary to understanding patient needs. If a health care professional is not practicing these skills, they are not being an effective communicator which may affect patient outcome.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt;

The goal of a healthcare professional is to aid a patient in achieving their optimal health outcome, which entails that the patient's safety is not at risk. Practice of effective communication plays a large role in promoting and protecting patient safety.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt;

===Teamwork and communication===

During complex situations, communication between health professionals must be at its best. There are several techniques, tools, and strategies used to improve communication. Any team should have a clear purpose and each member should be aware of their role and be involved accordingly.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt; To increase the quality of communication between people involved, regular feedback should be provided. Strategies such as briefings allow the team to be set on their purpose and ensure that members not only share the goal but also the process they will follow to achieve it.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt; Briefings reduce interruptions, prevent delays and build stronger relationships, resulting in a strong patient safety environment.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt;

[[Debriefing]] is another useful strategy. Healthcare providers meet to discuss a situation, record what they learned and discuss how it might be better handled. [[Closed loop communication]] is another important technique used to ensure that the message that was sent is received and interpreted by the receiver. [[SBAR]] is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in the most convenient form possible.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt; Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.&lt;ref name=CPSI/&gt;

===Safety culture===
{{see also|Safety culture}}
As is the case in other industries, when there is a mistake or error made people look for someone to blame.  This may seem natural, but it creates a blame culture where ''who'' is more important than ''why'' or ''how''.  A ''just culture'', also sometimes known as ''no blame'' or ''no fault'', seeks to understand the root causes of an incident rather than just who was involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Marx|title=Patient Safety and the "Just Culture:" A Primer For Health Care Executives|url=http://www.safer.healthcare.ucla.edu/safer/archive/ahrq/FinalPrimerDoc.pdf|website=University of California Los Angeles|accessdate=30 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232047/http://www.safer.healthcare.ucla.edu/safer/archive/ahrq/FinalPrimerDoc.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In health care, there is a move towards a patient safety culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Disclosure Guidelines BEING OPEN WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES|url=http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/English/toolsResources/disclosure/Documents/CPSI%20Canadian%20Disclosure%20Guidelines.pdf|website=Patient Safety Institute|accessdate=30 October 2014|page=16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122052204/http://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/English/toolsResources/disclosure/Documents/CPSI%20Canadian%20Disclosure%20Guidelines.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies the lessons learned from other industries, such as [[Aviation safety|aviation]], [[Maritime Resource Management|marine]], and [[Occupational safety and health|industrial]], to a health care setting.

When assessing and analyzing an incident, individuals involved are much more likely to be forthcoming with their own mistakes if they know that their job is not at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Zane Robinson|last2=Hughes|first2=Ronda G.|title=Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses.|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|location=Chapter 35|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a much more complete and clear picture to be formed of the facts of an event.  From there, [[root cause analysis]] can occur.  There are often multiple causative factors involved in an adverse or near miss event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunadharaju|first1=Kumar|last2=Smith|first2=Todd|last3=DeJoy|first3=David|title=Line-of-duty deaths among U.S. firefighters: An analysis of fatality investigations|journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention|date=May 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=1171–1180|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457510004070|accessdate=6 November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2010.12.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only after all contributing factors have been identified that effective changes can be made that will prevent a similar incident from occurring.

===Disclosure of an incident===

After an adverse event occurs, each country has its own way of dealing with the incident. In Canada, a quality improvement review is primarily used. A quality improvement review is an evaluation that is completed after an adverse event occurs with the intention to both fix the problem, as well as preventing it from happening again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/qio110c16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The individual provinces and territories have laws on whether it is required to disclose the quality improvement review to the patient. Healthcare providers have an obligation to disclose any adverse event to their patients because of ethical and professional guidelines.&lt;ref name="royalcollege.ca"&gt;http://www.royalcollege.ca/portal/page/portal/rc/common/documents/policy/getting_it_right_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  If more providers participate in the quality improvement review, it can increase interdisciplinary collaboration and can sustain relationships between departments and staff.&lt;ref name="royalcollege.ca"/&gt; In the US, [[clinical peer review]] is used: uninvolved medical staff review the event and work toward preventing further incidents.

The disclosure of adverse events is important in maintaining trust in the relationship between healthcare provider and patient. It is also important in learning how to avoid these mistakes in the future by conducting quality improvement reviews, or clinical peer review. If the provider accurately handles the event, and disclose it to the patient and their family, he/she can avoid getting punished, which includes lawsuits, fines and suspension.&lt;ref&gt;http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/intqhc/early/2010/08/13/intqhc.mzq042.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*Infrastructure failure. According to the [[WHO]], 50% of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

The [[JCAHO|Joint Commission]]'s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the root cause of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;The Joint Commission’s Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007: [http://www.jointcommissionreport.org/ Improving America’s Hospitals] (Accessed 2008-04-09)&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient's condition, and poor leadership or training.

Common misconceptions about adverse events are:
* "'Bad apples' or incompetent health care providers are a common cause." Many of the errors are normal human slips or lapses, and not the result of poor judgment or recklessness.&lt;ref name=Epid/&gt;
* "High risk procedures or medical specialties are responsible for most ''avoidable'' adverse events". Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are easier to notice, errors occur in all levels of care.&lt;ref name=Epid /&gt; Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to the severity of the condition being treated.&lt;ref name=cause /&gt;&lt;ref name=barrier&gt;{{cite journal |author1=René Amalberti, MD |author2=Yves Auroy, MD |author3=Don Berwick, MD, MPP |author4=Paul Barach, MD, MPH | date=3 May 2005| title = Five System Barriers to Achieving Ultrasafe Health Care | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 142 | pages = 756–764 | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/142/9/756 | accessdate = 2006-07-12 | pmid = 15867408 | issue = 9 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-142-9-200505030-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]] has reported that medication errors during the course of a surgical procedure are three times more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.&lt;ref name=Gardner /&gt;

The Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) is a program modeled upon the Aviation Safety Reporting System and developed by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) to monitor patient safety through voluntary, confidential reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lenert LA, Burstin H, Connell L, Gosbee J, Phillips G |title=Federal patient safety initiatives panel summary |journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc |volume=9 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=S8–10 |year=2002 |pmid=12386172 |pmc=419408 |url=http://www.jamia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12386172 |doi=10.1197/jamia.M1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Required training in [[crew resource management]] (CRM), which focused on team dynamics both inside the cockpit and outside was introduced in the early 1980s after the tragic mishap of United Airlines 173.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United 173 - The Need for CRM|url=http://goflightmedicine.com/united-airlines-173/|website=www.goflightmedicine.com|accessdate=30 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CRM is considered an effective means of improving safety in aviation and is utilized by the DoD, NASA, and almost all commercial airlines.  Many of the tenets of this training have been incorporated into medicine under the guise of [http://teamstepps.ahrq.gov Team Stepps], which was introduced by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)]].  The AHRQ calls this program "an evidence-based teamwork system to improve communication and teamwork skills among health care professionals."

;Near-miss reporting
:A [[Near miss (safety)|near miss]] is an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage - but had the potential to do so. Reporting of near misses by observers is an established error reduction technique in aviation,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and has been extended to private industry, traffic safety and fire-rescue services with reductions in accidents and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Mandak  | first = Joe  | title = Database seeks to lower firefighter deaths  | publisher = USA Today  | date = September 18, 2005  | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-09-18-firefigher-database_x.htm?POE=click-refer  | accessdate =  2006-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AORN]], a US-based professional organization of perioperative registered nurses, has put in effect a voluntary near miss reporting system (SafetyNet&lt;ref&gt;AORN: [http://www.patientsafetyfirst.org/safetynet/ SafetyNet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717212521/http://www.patientsafetyfirst.org/safetynet/ |date=2006-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), covering medication or transfusion reactions, communication or consent issues, wrong patient or procedures, communication breakdown or technology malfunctions. An analysis of incidents allows safety alerts to be issued to AORN members.  AlmostME&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almostme.com/ AlmostME]&lt;/ref&gt; is another commercially offered solution for near-miss reporting in healthcare.

;Limits of the industrial safety model
:[[Unintended consequence]]s may occur as improvements in safety are undertaken. It may not be possible to attain maximum safety goals in healthcare without adversely affecting patient care in other ways. An example is blood transfusion; in recent years, to reduce the risk of transmissible infection in the blood supply, donors with only a small probability of infection have been excluded. The result has been a critical shortage of blood for other lifesaving purposes, with a broad impact on patient care.&lt;ref name=barrier /&gt; Application of high-reliability theory and normal accident theory can help predict the organizational consequences of implementing safety measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamuz M, Harrison MI |title=Improving patient safety in hospitals: Contributions of high-reliability theory and normal accident theory |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=41 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=1654–76 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16898984 |pmc=1955347 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00570.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology in healthcare===
{{Further|Health information technology}}
;Overview
According to a study by RAND Health, the U.S. healthcare system could save more than $81 billion annually, reduce adverse healthcare events, and improve the quality of care if [[Health Information Technology|health information technology]] (HIT) is widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;RAND Healthcare: [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9136/index1.html Health Information Technology: Can HIT Lower Costs and Improve Quality?] Retrieved on July 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The most immediate barrier to widespread adoption of technology is cost despite the patient benefit from better health, and payer benefit from lower costs.  However, hospitals pay in both higher costs for implementation and potentially lower revenues (depending on reimbursement scheme) due to reduced patient length of stay.  The benefits provided by technological innovations also give rise to serious issues with the introduction of new and previously unseen error types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross Koppel| year = 2005 | title = Role of Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | pages = 1197–1203 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197 | pmid = 15755942 | issue = 10 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of healthcare technology====
Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to substantial errors and injuries, according to the IOM (2000) report.&lt;ref name=IOM /&gt;  The follow-up IOM report, ''Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century'', advised rapid adoption of electronic patient records, electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=2001 | url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309072808/html | title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This section contains only the patient safety related aspects of HIT.

===== Electronic Health Record (EHR) =====
The [[Electronic health record]] (EHR), previously known as the [[Electronic medical record]] (EMR), reduces several types of errors, including those related to prescription drugs, to emergency and preventive care, and to tests and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Physicians Observer: [http://www.acponline.org/journals/news/sep04/emr.htm How EMR software can help prevent medical mistakes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830042002/http://www.acponline.org/journals/news/sep04/emr.htm |date=2008-08-30 }} by Jerome H. Carter (September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Important features of modern EHR include automated drug-drug/drug-food interaction checks and allergy checks, standard drug dosages and patient education information.  Drug Information at the point-of-care and drug dispensing points help in reducing errors. Example: India, MedCLIK. Also, these systems provide recurring alerts to remind clinicians of intervals for preventive care and to track referrals and test results. Clinical guidelines for disease management have a demonstrated benefit when accessible within the electronic record during the process of treating the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kensaku Kawamoto, fellow1, Caitlin A Houlihan, E Andrew Balas, David F Lobach | year = 2005 | title = Improving clinical practice using clinical decision support systems: a systematic review of trials to identify features critical to success | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 330 | pages = 765–768 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/330/7494/765 | accessdate = 2006-06-29 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38398.500764.8F | pmid = 15767266 | issue = 7494 | pmc = 555881}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[health informatics]] and widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records promise access to a patient's records at any health care site. Still, there may be a weak link because of physicians' deficiencies in understanding the patient safety features of e.g. government approved software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C J Morris |author2=B S P Savelyich |author3=A J Avery |author4=J A Cantrill |author5=A Sheikh | year = 2005 | title = Patient safety features of clinical computer systems: questionnaire survey of GP views | journal = Quality and Safety in Health Care | volume = 14 | pages = 164–168 | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/14/3/164 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1136/qshc.2004.011866 | pmid = 15933310 | issue = 3 | pmc = 1744017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors associated with patient misidentification may be exacerbated by EHR use, but inclusion of a prominently displayed patient photograph in the EHR can reduce errors and near misses.&lt;ref name = "AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/verification-screen-includes-prominent-patient-photograph-significantly-reduces-errors |title=Verification Screen That Includes Prominent Patient Photograph Significantly Reduces Errors Caused by Orders Placed in Wrong Chart | publisher = [[AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange]] | date = 2013-04-24 | accessdate = 2013-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable offline emergency medical record devices have been developed to provide access to health records during widespread or extended infrastructure failure, such as in natural disasters or regional conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emergentag.com/ EMERGENTag], portable offline emergency medical record&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Active RFID platform =====

These [[RFID|systems']] basic security measures are based on sound identifying electronic tags, in order that the patient details provided in different situations are always reliable. These systems offer three differently qualified options: 
* Identification upon request of health care personnel, using scanners (similar to readers for passive RFID tags or scanners for barcode labels) to identify patient semi-automatically upon presentation of patient with tag to staff
* Automatic identification upon entry of patient. An automatic identification check is carried out on each person with tags (primarily patients) entering the area to determine the presented patient in contrast to other patient earlier entered into reach of the used reader.
* Automatic identification and range estimation upon approach to most proximate patient, excluding reads from more distant tags of other patients in the same area&lt;ref&gt;[http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=bibdat&amp;docid=DE102009039879B4 Method and components for registering and controlling of services with patients]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any of these options may be applied whenever and wherever patient details are required in electronic form Such identifying is essential when the information concerned is critical. There are increasing numbers of hospitals that have an RFID system to identify patients, for instance: [http://www.tsbtecnologias.es/e-health-products/SPHERAhospital/success-stories Hospital La Fe in Valencia(Spain)]; Wayne Memorial Hospital (US); Royal Alexandria Hospital (UK).

=====Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE)=====
Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable errors in hospitals (IOM, 2000; 2007). The IOM (2006) estimates that each hospitalized patient, on average, is exposed to one medication error each day.&lt;ref name=iom06&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = Preventing Medication Errors | last = The Institute of Medicine | journal = The National Academies Press | url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11623.html | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computerized provider order entry (CPOE), formerly called [[computerized physician order entry]], can reduce medication errors by 80% overall but more importantly decrease harm to patients by 55%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = David W.

;Complete Safety Medication System
A standardized [[bar code]] system for dispensing drugs might prevent 25% of drug errors.&lt;ref name=iom06 /&gt;  Despite ample evidence to reduce medication errors, compete medication delivery systems (barcoding and [[Electronic prescribing]]) have slow adoption by doctors and hospitals in the United States, due to concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Kaufman  | first = Marc  | title = Medication Errors Harming Millions, Report Says.

===== Specific Patient Safety Software =====
A standardized, modular technology system that allows a hospital, clinic, or health system record their Incidents that include falls, medication errors, pressure ulcers, near misses, etc. These systems can be configured to specific workflows and the analytics behind it will allow for reporting and dashboards to help learn from things that have gone wrong (and right). Some vendors include Datix, RL Solutions, Verge, Midas, and Quantros.

====Technological Iatrogenesis====
Technology induced errors are significant and increasingly more evident in care delivery systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lohr  | first = Steve  | title = Doctors' Journal Says Computing Is No Panacea  | publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2005-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09compute.html?ei=5089&amp;en=402b792e748d99a2&amp;ex=1268110800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;adxnnlx=1150474153-xVix1BcYkvTKJpuLyHStrQ  | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This idiosyncratic and potentially serious problems associated with HIT implementation has recently become a tangible concern for healthcare and information technology professionals. As such, the term technological iatrogenesis describes this new category of adverse events that are an emergent property resulting from technological innovation creating system and microsystem disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patrick Palmieri | year = 2007 | title = Technological iatrogenesis: New risks force heightened management awareness | journal = Journal of Healthcare Risk Management | volume = 27 | url = http://www.hom.ba.ttu.edu/FordPub/Palmieri_JHCRM_2008_Technological%20iatrogenesis.pdf | format = PDF | pages = 19–24 | accessdate = 2008-07-02 | doi = 10.1002/jhrm.5600270405 | pmid = 20200891 | issue = 4 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217113718/http://www.hom.ba.ttu.edu/FordPub/Palmieri_JHCRM_2008_Technological%20iatrogenesis.pdf | archivedate = 2008-12-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare systems are complex and adaptive, meaning there are many networks and connections working simultaneously to produce certain outcomes. When these systems are under the increased stresses caused by the diffusion of new technology, unfamiliar and new process errors often result. If not recognized, over time these new errors can collectively lead to catastrophic system failures.  The term "e-iatrogenesis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weiner | year = 2007 | title =e-Iatrogenesis: The most critical unintended consequence of CPOE and other HIT | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 14 | url = http://www.jamia.org/cgi/reprint/14/3/387.pdf |format=PDF | pages = 387–388 | doi = 10.1197/jamia.M2338 | pmid = 17329719|accessdate =2008-08-24 | last2 = Kfuri | first2 = T | last3 = Chan | first3 = K | last4 = Fowles | first4 = JB | issue = 3 | pmc = 2244888|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to describe the local error manifestation. The sources for these errors include:
*Prescriber and staff inexperience may lead to a false sense of security; that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided.&lt;ref name=barcode /&gt;
*Shortcut or default selections can override non-standard medication regimens for elderly or underweight patients, resulting in toxic doses.
*CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Santell | first=John P | year=2004 | url=http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf | title=Computer Related Errors: What Every Pharmacist Should Know | format=PDF | publisher=United States Pharmacopia | accessdate=2006-06-20 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120194519/http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf | archivedate=2008-11-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Irrelevant or frequent warnings can interrupt work flow.
Solutions include ongoing changes in design to cope with unique medical settings, supervising overrides from automatic systems, and training (and re-training) all users.

===Evidence-based medicine===

[[Evidence-based medicine]] integrates an individual doctor's exam and diagnostic skills for a specific patient, with the best available evidence from medical research. The doctor's expertise includes both diagnostic skills and consideration of individual patient's rights and preferences in making decisions about his or her care. The clinician uses pertinent clinical research on the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the efficacy and safety of therapy, rehabilitation, and prevention to develop an individual plan of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David L Sackett |author2=William M C Rosenberg |author3=J A Muir Gray |author4=R Brian Haynes |author5=W Scott Richardson | year = 1996 | title = Editorials: Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 312 | pages = 71–72 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7023/71 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | pmid = 8555924 | issue = 7023 | pmc = 2349778 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of evidence-based recommendations for specific medical conditions, termed [[Guideline (medical)|clinical practice guidelines]] or "best practices", has accelerated in the past few years.

#Evidence-based medicine may reduce adverse events, especially those involving incorrect diagnosis, outdated or risky tests or procedures, or medication overuse.
#Clinical guidelines provide a common framework for improving communication among clinicians, patients and non-medical purchasers of health care.
#Errors related to changing shifts or multiple specialists are reduced by a consistent plan of care.
#Information on the clinical effectiveness of treatments and services can help providers, consumers and purchasers of health care make better use of limited resources.
#As medical advances become available, doctors and nurses can keep up with new tests and treatments as guidelines are improved.

#Managed care plans may attempt limit "unnecessary" services to cut the costs of health care, despite evidence that guidelines are not designed for general screening, rather as decision-making tools when an individual practitioner evaluates a specific patient.
#The medical literature is evolving and often controversial; development of guidelines requires consensus.
#Implementing guidelines and educating the entire health care team within a facility costs time and resources (which may be recovered by future efficiency and error reduction).
#Clinicians may resist evidence-based medicine as a threat to traditional relationships between patients, doctors and other health professionals, since any participant can influence decisions.
#Failing to follow guidelines might increase the risk of [[Medical malpractice|liability]] or disciplinary action by regulators.

===Quality and safety initiatives in community pharmacy practice===
Community pharmacy practice is making important advances in the quality and safety movement despite the limited number of federal and state regulations that exist and in the absence of national accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission - a driving force for performance improvement in health care systems.  Community pharmacies are using automated drug dispensing devices (robots), computerized drug utilization review tools, and most recently, the ability to receive electronic prescriptions from prescribers to decrease the risk for error and increase the likelihood of delivering high quality of care.

Quality Assurance (QA) in community practice is a relatively new concept. {{As of|2006}}, only 16 states have some form of legislation that regulates QA in community pharmacy practice.  While most state QA legislation focuses on error reduction, North Carolina has recently approved legislation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2005&amp;BillID=hb1493 North Carolina General Assembly - House Bill 1493 Information/History (2005–2006 Session)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that requires the pharmacy QA program to include error reduction strategies and assessments of the quality of their pharmaceutical care outcomes and pharmacy services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kessler |first1= JM |title= Pharmacy Quality Assurance |journal= Journal of the North Carolina Association of Pharmacists |date= Winter 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality improvement and patient safety is a major concern in the pediatric world of health care. This next section will focus on quality improvement and patient safety initiatives in inpatient settings.

Over the last several years, pediatric groups have partnered to improve general understanding, reporting, process improvement methodologies, and quality of pediatric inpatient care. These collaborations have created a robust program of projects, benchmarking efforts, and research.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Susan |last1= Lacey |first2= Janis B. |last2= Smith |first3= Karen |last3= Cox |url= http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nurseshdbk/docs/LaceyS_PSQ.pdf |title= Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses |publisher= [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research and focus on adverse events has been on medication errors–the most frequently reported adverse event for both adult and pediatric patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Institute of Medicine]] |title= To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[National Academies Press]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also of interest to note that medication errors are also the most preventable type of harm that can occur within the pediatric population. It has been reported that when pediatric medication errors occur, these patients have a higher rate of death associated with the error than adult patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kaushal |first1= R |last2= Bates |first2= DW |last3= Landrigan |first3= C |displayauthors= 2 |title= Medication errors and adverse drug events in pediatric inpatients |journal= [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |year= 2001 |volume= 285 |issue= 16 |pages= 2114–20|doi=10.1001/jama.285.16.2114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent review of potential pediatric safety issues conducted by Miller, Elixhauser, and Zhan found that hospitalized children who experienced a patient safety incident, compared with those who did not, had&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Miller |first1= MR |last2= Elixhauser |first2= A |last3= Zhan |first3= C |title= Patient safety events during pediatric hospitalizations |journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |date= June 2003 |volume= 111|issue= 6 |pages= 1358–66 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.6.1358}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1) Length of stay 2- to 6-fold longer
* 2) Hospital mortality 2- to 18-fold greater
* 3) Hospital charges 2- to 20-fold higher
In order to reduce these errors the attention on safety needs to revolve around designing safe systems and processes. Slonim and Pollack point out that safety is critical to reduce medical errors and adverse events. These problems can range from diagnostic and treatment errors to hospital-acquired infections, procedural complications, and failure to prevent problems such as pressure ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= AD |last1= Slonim |first2= MM |last2=Pollack |title= Integrating the Institute of Medicine’s six quality aims into pediatric critical care: Relevance and applications |journal= [[Pediatric Critical Care Medicine]] |year= 2005 |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |pages= 264–9 |doi=10.1097/01.pcc.0000160592.87113.c6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to addressing quality and safety issues found in adult patients there are a few characteristics that are unique to the pediatric population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Beal |first1= AC |last2= Co |first2= JPT |last3= Dougherty |first3= D |displayauthors= 2 |date=Jan 2004 | title = Quality Measures for Children's Health Care | url = | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 113 | issue = 1| pages = 199–209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Development:''' As children mature both cognitively and physically, their needs as consumers of health care goods and services change. Therefore, planning a unified approach to pediatric safety and quality is affected by the fluid nature of childhood development.
*
* '''Dependency:''' Hospitalized children, especially those who are very young and/or nonverbal, are dependent on caregivers, parents, or other surrogates to convey key information associated with patient encounters. Even when children can accurately express their needs, they are unlikely to receive the same acknowledgment accorded adult patients. In addition, because children are dependent on their caregivers, their care must be approved by parents or surrogates during all encounters.
*
* '''Different epidemiology:''' Most hospitalized children require acute episodic care, not care for chronic conditions as with adult patients. Planning safety and quality initiatives within a framework of "wellness, interrupted by acute conditions or exacerbations," presents distinct challenges and requires a new way of thinking.
*
* '''Demographics:''' Children are more likely than other groups to live in poverty and experience racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Children are more dependent on public insurance, such as State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid.

One of the main challenges faced by pediatric safety and quality efforts is that most of the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Woods |first1= DM |last2= Johnson |first2= J |last3= Holl |first3= JL |displayauthors= 2 |title= Anatomy of a patient safety event: Pediatric patient safety taxonomy |journal= Qual Saf Health Care |date= December 2005 |volume= 14 |pages= 422–7 |doi=10.1136/qshc.2004.013573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt;

'''Leaders in Pediatric Safety and Quality'''

The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) is the Federal authority for patient safety and quality of care and has been a leader in pediatric quality and safety. AHRQ has developed Pediatric Quality Indicators (PedQIs) with the goal to highlight areas of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pediatric Quality Indicators Overview |series= AHRQ Quality Indicators |date= February 2006 |publisher= [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] |location= Rockville, MD |url= http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/pdi_overview.htm |access-date= 2012-02-03 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527083459/http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/pdi_overview.htm |archive-date= 2010-05-27 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen pediatric quality indicators are included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

Possible additions to the dataset will address the patient’s condition on admission and increase the understanding of how laboratory and pharmacy utilization impact patient outcomes. The goal of AHRQ is to refine the area-level indicators to improve outcomes for children receiving outpatient care and reduce the incidence of hospitalization for those defined conditions.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt;

'''Nurse Staffing and Pediatric Outcomes'''

While the number of nurses providing patient care is recognized as an inadequate measure of nursing care quality, there is hard evidence that nurse staffing is directly related to patient outcomes. Studies by Aiken and Needleman have demonstrated that patient death, nosocomial infections, cardiac arrest, and pressure ulcers are linked to inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Aiken |first1= LH |last2= Clarke |first2= SP |last3= Sloane |first3= DM |displayauthors= 2 |date=Oct 2002 | title = Hospital nurse staffing and patient mortality, nurse burnout, and job dissatisfaction | url = | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 288 | issue = 16| pages = 1987–93 | doi=10.1001/jama.288.16.1987 | pmid=12387650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Needleman |first1= J |last2= Buerhaus |first2= P |last3= Mattke |first3= S |displayauthors= 2 |date= May 2002 | title = Nurse-staffing levels and the quality of care in hospitals | url = | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 346 | issue = | pages = 1715–22 | doi=10.1056/nejmsa012247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or absence of registered nurses (RNs) impacts the outcome for pediatric patients requiring pain management and/or peripheral administration of intravenous fluids and/or medications. These two indicators of pediatric nursing care quality are sensitive measures of nursing care. Professional nurses play a key role in successful pain management, especially among pediatric patients unable to verbally describe pain. Astute assessment skills are required to intervene successfully and relieve discomfort.33 Maintenance of a patient’s intravenous access is a clear nursing responsibility. Pediatric patients are at increased risk for intravenous infiltration and for significant complications of infiltration, should it occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lamagne |first1= P |last2= McPhee |first2= M |title= Troubleshooting pediatric peripheral IVs: Phlebitis and infiltration |journal= Nurs Spectrum |year= 2004 |volume= 8 |issue= 13 |pages= 18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Infusion Nursing Society |title= Infusion nursing standards of practice |journal= J Intraven Nurs |year= 2000 |volume= 23 |issue= 6 Suppl |pages= S1-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of effective indicators of pediatric nursing care quality include the following:&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt; 
* '''Scalable:''' The indicators are applicable to pediatric patients across a broad range of units and hospitals, in both intensive care and general care settings.
* '''Feasible:''' Data collection does not pose undue burden on staff of participating units as the data is available from existing sources, such as the medical record or a quality improvement database, and can be collected in real time.
* '''Valid and reliable:''' Indicator measurement within and across participating sites is accurate and consistent over time.

'''Conclusions'''

Pediatric care is complex due to developmental and dependency issues associated with children. How these factors impact the specific processes of care is an area of science in which little is known. Throughout health care providing safe and high quality patient care continues to provide significant challenges. Efforts to improve the safety and quality of care are resource intensive and take continued commitment not only by those who deliver care, but also by agencies and foundations that fund this work. Advocates for children’s health care must be at the table when key policy and regulatory issues are discussed. Only then will the voice of our most vulnerable groups of health care consumers be heard.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt;

'''Working Hours of Nurses and Patient Safety'''

A recent increase in work hours and overtime shifts of nurses has been used to compensate for the decrease of registered nurses (RNs). Logbooks completed by nearly 400 RNs have revealed that about "40  percent of the 5,317 work shifts they logged exceeded twelve hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers, Hwang, Scott, Aiken, Dinges|first1=Ann E., Wei-Ting, Linda D., Linda H., David F.|title=The Working Hours Of Hospital Staff Nurses And Patient Safety|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/23/4/202.full|website=HealthAffairs|publisher=Project HOPE: The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors by hospital staff nurses are more likely to occur when work shifts extend beyond 12 hours, or they work over 40 hours in one week. Studies have shown that overtime shifts have harmful effects on the quality of care provided to patients, but some researchers "who evaluated the safety of 12-hour shifts did not find increases in medication errors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/15/1/30.full|title=Effects of Critical Care Nurses' Work Hours on Vigilance and Patients' Safety|last2=Rogers|first2=Ann E.|website=American Journal of Critical Care|publisher=American Association of Critical-Care Nurses|last3=Hwang|first3=Wei-Ting|last4=Zhang|first4=Yawei|last1=Scott|first1=Linda D.|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The errors which these researchers found were "lapses of attention to detail, errors of omission, compromised problem solving, reduced motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmaT66U5kqUC&amp;dq=working+hours+of+nurses+and+patient+safety+&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Environment of Nurses|last=Committee on the Work Environment for Nurses and Patient Safety, Board of Health Care Services, Institute of Medicine|date=Feb 27, 2004|publisher=National Academics Press|isbn=0309187362|page=12|editor1-last=Page|editor1-first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to fatigue as well as "errors in grammatical reasoning and chart reviewing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott, Rogers, Hwang, Zhang|first1=Linda D., Ann E., Wei-Ting, Yawei|title=Effects of Critical Care Nurses' Work Hours on Vigilance and Patients' Safety|url=http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/15/1/30.full|website=American Journal of Critical Care|publisher=American Association of Critical-Care Nurses|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overworked nurses are a serious safety concern to their patients wellbeing. Working back to back shifts, or night shifts, are a common cause of fatigue in hospital staff nurses.

===Health literacy===
[[Health literacy]] is a common and serious safety concern.  A study of 2,600 patients at two hospitals determined that between 26-60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]], or basic health care materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= MV |last1= Williams | year = 1995  | title = Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 274 | issue = 21 | pages = 677–82 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677  | doi = 10.1001/jama.274.21.1677 | pmid = 7474271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mismatch between a clinician's level of communication and a patient's ability to understand can lead to medication errors and adverse outcomes.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report found low health literacy levels negatively affects healthcare outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these patients have a higher risk of hospitalization and longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= TC |last1= Davis |first2= MS |last2= Wolf |first3= PF, III |last3= Bass |first4= JA |last4= Thompson |first5= HH |last5= Tilson |first6= M |last6= Neuberger |first7= RM |last7= Parker |displayauthors= 4 | date=29 November 2006| title = Literacy and Misunderstanding Prescription Drug Labels | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 145 | issue = 12 | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/0000605-200612190-00144v1 | accessdate = 2006-11-30  | pmid = 17135578 | pages = 0000605–200612190–00144 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-145-12-200612190-00144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are more ill when they seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: [http://www.health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsliteracy.htm Quick Guide to Health Literacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOFLA&gt;{{cite journal |first1= MV |last1= Williams | year = 1995  | title = The test of functional health literacy in adults: A new instrument for measuring patients' literacy skills. | journal = J Gen Intern Med | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 537–41 | doi = 10.1007/BF02599568 | pmid = 8576769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay for performance (P4P)===
{{Main|Pay for performance (healthcare)}}
{{Off topic|date=May 2012}}

Pay for performance systems link compensation to measures of work quality or goals. {{As of|2005}}, 75 percent of all U.S. companies connect at least part of an employee's pay to measures of performance, and in healthcare, over 100 private and federal pilot programs are underway. Current methods of healthcare payment may actually reward less-safe care, since some insurance companies will not pay for new practices to reduce errors, while physicians and hospitals can bill for additional services that are needed when patients are injured by mistakes.&lt;ref name=fiveyears&gt;The Commonwealth Fund: [http://www.cmwf.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=278113 Five Years After "To Err Is Human": What Have We Learned?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004065212/http://www.cmwf.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=278113 |date=2006-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, early studies showed little gain in quality for the money spent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= MB |last1= Rosenthal |first2= RG |last2= Frank |first3= Z |last3= Li |first4= AM |last4= Epstein | year = 2005 | title = Early experience with pay-for-performance: From concept to practice | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 294 | issue = 14 | pages = 1788–93 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/14/1788 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.14.1788 | pmid = 16219882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= LA |last1= Petersen |first2= LD |last2= Woodard |first3= T |last3= Urech |first4= C |last4= Daw |first5= S |last5= Sookanan |displayauthors= 4  | date=15 August 2006| title = Does pay-for-performance improve the quality of health care? | journal = [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] | volume = 145 | issue = 4 | pages = 265–272 | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/265?etoc | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | pmid = 16908917 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-145-4-200608150-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as evidence suggesting unintended consequences, like the avoidance of high-risk patients, when payment was linked to outcome improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = MB | last1 = Rosenthal | first2 = RG | last2 = Frank | year = 2006 | title = What Is the empirical basis for paying for quality in health care? | journal = Medical Care Research and Review | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–57 | url = http://www.cmwf.org/topics/topics_show.htm?doc_id=371797 | doi = 10.1177/1077558705285291 | pmid = 16595409 | access-date = 2006-07-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060712222120/http://www.cmwf.org/topics/topics_show.htm?doc_id=371797 | archive-date = 2006-07-12 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Congress, House Committee on Employer-Employee Relations: Pay For Performance Measures and Other Trends in Employer Sponsored Healthcare, {{cite web|url= http://www.cmwf.org/usr_doc/Rosenthal_testimony_05-17-2005.pdf |title=Testimony of Meredith B.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) began an ambitious pay for performance initiative in 2004, known as the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF).&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; General practitioners agreed to increases in existing income according to performance with respect to 146 quality indicators covering clinical care for 10 chronic diseases, organization of care, and patient experience. Unlike proposed quality incentive programs in the United States, funding for primary care was increased 20% over previous levels.

A component of this program, known as '' exception reporting'', allows physicians to use criteria to exclude individual patients from the quality calculations that determine physician reimbursement.  There was initial concern that exception reporting would allow inappropriate exclusion of patients in whom targets were missed ("gaming").  However, a 2008 study has shown little evidence of widespread gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= T |last1= Doran |first2= C |last2= Fullwood |first3= D |last3= Reeves |first4= H |last4= Gravelle |first5= M |last5= Roland |displayauthors= 4 |title=Exclusion of patients from pay-for-performance targets by English physicians |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=359 |issue=3 |pages=274–84 |year=2008 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/359/3/274 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMsa0800310 |pmid= 18635432 }} Retrieved 2008-07-18&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] has various pay-for-performance ("P4P") initiatives in offices, clinics and hospitals, seeking to improving quality and avoid unnecessary health care costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author= [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |url= http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1343  |title= Pay For Performance (P4P) Initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) has several demonstration projects underway offering compensation for improvements:

*Payments for '''better care coordination''' between home, hospital and offices for patients with chronic illnesses. In April 2005, CMS launched its first value-based purchasing pilot or "demonstration" project- the three-year Medicare Physician Group Practice (PGP) Demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author= [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |url= http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1341 |title= Medicare Begins Performance-Based Payments For Physician Groups |accessdate= 2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project involves ten large, multi-specialty physician practices caring for more than 200,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Participating practices will phase in quality standards for preventive care and the management of common chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Practices meeting these standards will be eligible for rewards from savings due to resulting improvements in patient management. The ''First Evaluation Report to Congress'' in 2006 showed that the model rewarded high quality, efficient provision of health care, but the lack of up-front payment for the investment in new systems of case management "have made for an uncertain future with respect for any payments under the demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |work= Medicare Physician Group Practice Demonstration |url= http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/downloads/PGP_Final_Congress.pdf |title= First Evaluation Report to Congress |accessdate= 2007-04-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008103441/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DemoProjectsEvalRpts/downloads/PGP_Final_Congress.pdf |archivedate= 2008-10-08 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A set of 10 '''hospital quality measures''' which, if reported to CMS, will increase the payments that hospitals receive for each discharge. By the third year of the demonstration, those hospitals that do not meet a threshold on quality will be subject to reductions in payment. Preliminary data from the second year of the study indicates that pay for performance was associated with a roughly 2.5% to 4.0% improvement in compliance with quality measures, compared with the control hospitals.&lt;ref name="pmid17259444"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindenauer |first1= PK |last2= Remus |first2= D |last3= Roman |first3= S |displayauthors= 2 |title=Public reporting and pay for performance in hospital quality improvement |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=356 |issue=5 |pages=486–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17259444 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa064964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Arnold Epstein of the Harvard School of Public Health commented in an accompanying editorial that pay-for-performance "is fundamentally a social experiment likely to have only modest incremental value."&lt;ref name="pmid17259445"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Epstein |first1= AM |title=Pay for performance at the tipping point |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=356 |issue=5 |pages=515–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17259445 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe078002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unintended consequences of some publicly reported hospital quality measures have adversely affected patient care.

====Complex illness====

Pay for performance programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values or use of emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= American Academy of Neurology |work= Federal Legislation Position Statements: |url= http://www.aan.com/advocacy/federal/pdfs/P4P_statement.pdf |title= Pay-For-Performance |accessdate= 2007-04-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061018083605/http://www.aan.com/advocacy/federal/pdfs/P4P_statement.pdf |archivedate= 2006-10-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient.&lt;ref name="pmid17360991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pham |first1= HH |last2= Schrag |first2= D |last3= O'Malley |first3= AS |last4= Wu |first4= B |last5= Bach |first5= PB |displayauthors= 4 |title=Care patterns in Medicare and their implications for pay for performance |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=356 |issue=11 |pages=1130–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17360991 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa063979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors doubt that pay-for-performance systems can accurately attribute responsibility for the outcome of care for such patients.

===Public reporting===

====Mandatory reporting====
;Denmark :The Danish Act on Patient Safety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.patientsikkerhed.dk/admin/media/pdf/133907d0940e4d5f751852ec8f6b1795.pdf |title= Danish Act on Patient Safety |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609101852/http://www.patientsikkerhed.dk/admin/media/pdf/133907d0940e4d5f751852ec8f6b1795.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-09 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed Parliament in June 2003, and on January 1, 2004, Denmark became the first country to introduce nationwide mandatory reporting. The Act obligates frontline personnel to report adverse events to a national reporting system. Hospital owners are obligated to act on the reports and the National Board of Health is obligated to communicate the learning nationally. The reporting system is intended purely for learning and frontline personnel cannot experience sanctions for reporting. This is stated in Section 6 of the Danish Act on Patient Safety (as of January 1, 2007: Section 201 of the Danish Health Act): "A frontline person who reports an adverse event cannot as a result of that report be subjected to investigation or disciplinary action from the employer, the Board of Health or the Court of Justice." The reporting system and the Danish Patient Safety Database is described in further detail in a National Board of Health publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.patientsikkerhed.dk/admin/media/pdf/0a9d4fdf5645d9b29a159288ff2a2a69.pdf |author= Danish National Board of Health |title= Danish Patient Safety Database 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United Kingdom :The [[Patient safety organization#National Patient Safety Agency .28NPSA.29|National Patient Safety Agency]] encourages voluntary reporting of health care errors, but has several specific instances, known as "Confidential Enquiries", for which investigation is routinely initiated: maternal or infant deaths, childhood deaths to age 16, deaths in persons with mental illness, and perioperative and unexpected medical deaths. Medical records and questionnaires are requested from the involved clinician, and participation has been high, since individual details are confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= National Confidential Enquiries |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=212731 |title= Strategy |access-date= 2006-07-02 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131443/http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=212731 |archive-date= 2007-09-29 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual patient disclosures====
For a health care institution, disclosing an unanticipated event should be made as soon as possible. Some health care organizations may have a policy regarding the disclosure of unanticipated events. The amount of information presented to those affected is dependent on the family's readiness and the organization's culture. The employee disclosing the event to family requires support from risk management, patient safety officers and senior leadership. Disclosures are objectively documented in the medical record.

In April 2008, consumer, employer and labor organizations announced an agreement with major physician organizations and health insurers on principles to measure and report doctors' performance on quality and cost.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer-Purchaser Disclosure Project: Consumers, Purchasers, Physicians, and Insurers Agree on Principles to Guide Physician Performance Reporting (2008-04-01)   [http://healthcaredisclosure.org/docs/files/PatientCharterDisclosureRelease040108.pdf News Release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401222114/http://healthcaredisclosure.org/docs/files/PatientCharterDisclosureRelease040108.pdf |date=2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom, [[whistleblowing]] is well recognised and is government sanctioned, as a way to protect patients by encouraging employees to call attention to deficient services. Health authorities are encouraged to put local policies in place to protect whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;Whistleblowing.org [http://www.whistleblowing.org.uk/] Retrieved on 2008-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Department of Health: News Release(1999-09-01: [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Pressreleases/DH_4025596 Government Moves To Halt Secrecy In NHS]  Retrieved 2008-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Naomi Craft | year = 1995 | title = Medicine and books:  Whistleblowing in the Health Service: Accountability, Law and Professional Practice; Whistleblowing: Subversion or Corporate Citizenship? | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 311 | page = 1444 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/7017/1444 | accessdate = 2008-03-17 | issue=7017 | doi=10.1136/bmj.311.7017.1444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of patient safety===
Numerous organizations, government branches, and private companies conduct research studies to investigate the overall health of patient safety in America and across the globe. Despite the shocking and widely publicized statistics on preventable deaths due to medical errors in America's hospitals, the 2006 National Healthcare Quality Report&lt;ref&gt;AHRQ: [http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nhqr06/nhqr06.htm 2006 National Healthcare Quality Report] Retrieved 2007-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; assembled by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) had the following sobering assessment:&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Most measures of Quality are improving, but the pace of change remains modest.
*Quality improvement varies by setting and phase of care.
*The rate of improvement accelerated for some measures while a few continued to show deterioration.
*Variation in health care quality remains high.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2011 study of more than 1,000 patients with advanced colon cancer found that one in eight was treated with at least one drug regimen with specific recommendations against their use in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The study focused on three chemotherapy regimens that were not supported by evidence from prior clinical studies or clinical practice guidelines. One treatment was rated "insufficient data to support," one had been "shown to be ineffective," and one was supported by "no data, nor is there a compelling rationale."  Many of the patients received multiple cycles of non-beneficial chemotherapy and some received two or more unproven treatments. Potential side effects for the treatments include [[hypertension]], heightened risk of bleeding and bowel perforation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110607094517.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations advocating patient safety==
{{Main|Patient safety organization}}
Several authors of the 1999 Institute of Medicine report revisited the status of their recommendations and the state of patient safety, five years after "To Err is Human".&lt;ref name=fiveyears /&gt; Discovering that patient safety had become a frequent topic for journalists, health care experts, and the public, it was harder to see overall improvements on a national level. What was noteworthy was the impact on attitudes and organizations. Few health care professionals now doubted that preventable medical injuries were a serious problem. The central concept of the report—that bad systems and not bad people lead to most errors—became established in patient safety efforts. A broad array of organizations now advance the cause of patient safety. For instance, in 2010 the principal European anaesthesiology organisations launched [[The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology]], which incorporates many of the principles described above.

The '''Tacoma nurses strike of 2014''' was a 24-hour strike called by the '''Service Employees Union healthcare Local 1199NW'''. The strike was begun on Tuesday, November 18, 2014 at 7:00 A.M. There were 1,100 workers at two Pierce County hospital operated by [[Franciscan Health System|CHI Franciscan Health]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] participated in the strike event. The two hospitals are [[St. Joseph Medical Center (Tacoma, Washington)|St. Joseph Medical Center]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[St. Clare Hospital]] in [[Lakewood, Washington|Lakewood]]. Nurse assistant, licensed practical nurses, unit secretaries, dietary workers, housekeepers, sterile processors, technical workers and other services of the two hospitals were walked off the job to participate in the strike.&lt;ref name=komonews&gt;{{cite web|title=1,100 workers stage one-day strike at 2 Pierce Co. hospitals|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/1100-workers-stage-one-day-strike-at-Pierce-Co-hospitals-283069371.html|website=KOMO News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike did not include nurses and doctors. The union members were demanding CHI Franciscan Health to improve wages, improve on health care, improve on their charity care policy, and end unfair labor practices.

==Background==

===CHI Franciscan Health===
[[Franciscan Health System|'''CHI Franciscan Health''']] is a non-profit organization based in Tacoma. The organization affiliated with national non-profit Catholic Health initiatives based in Colorado.  The Franciscan Foundation was established in 1986 to receive charitable gifts and funds made on CHI Franciscan Health. According to CHI Franciscan Health, 100 percent of contribution to the foundations will goes directly to programs and accounts that were designed to help their communities and patients. Furthermore, CHI Franciscan Health promises to provide equal opportunity to their employees regarding their employees' race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability or veteran status. They are also a member of the Washington State Hospital Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHI Franciscan|url=http://www.chifranciscan.org/About-Us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEIU Local 1199NW===
Service Employees International Union Healthcare Local 1199NW, also known as Local 1199NW, is an independent organization founded in 1983. The organization was formed by a group of nurses at Group Puget Sound. They organized a union with 1199-Hospital and health Care Employees Union, also known as [[1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East|1199SEIU]]. 1199SEIU was founded by pharmacists and drug clerks in [[New York (state)|New York]] 1932. It was the first and largest health workers' union in the United States. Local 1199NW is also a part of the 2.1 million members of [[Service Employees International Union]]. The Local 1199NW and other organizations that they take part in are fighting for their union members for their equality and ended the unfair labor practices in their labor force. The organization has more than 26,000 members that are nurses and healthcare workers across the [[Washington (state)|Washington State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEIU 1199NW|url=http://www.seiu1199nw.org/about/|website=SEIU 1199NW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strike Timeline==

===Before the strike began===
Before the strike occurred on November 18, 2014, the union members of Union Health Care Local 1199 NW had been bargaining their contract with CHI Franciscan Health since June 2013.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX&gt;{{cite web|title=On strike: Workers at two hospitals in Pierce County walk out|url=http://q13fox.com/2014/11/17/st-joseph-and-st-clare-hospital-workers-prepare-for-tuesday-morning-strike/|website=Q13FOX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union members were demanding better wages, improved health care, and ending of unfair labor practices. According to the workers of the hospitals, the hospital had cut 10% of staff members, even though the hospital had the same number of patients.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt; The workers had to work over time, but their pay check did not increase. Moreover, the employees could not afford the health care plan that was provided by the company. In [[Q13 Fox]], union member Jennifer Storm said, "We have employees at the hospital that are in debt and have creditors for being cared for by CHI and so that's a big issue". It was opposite to what CHI Franciscan Health promised them.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt; CHI Francisco promised to provide better health care for them, but the healthcare plan cost more than what that their employees and their families could afford. They also said CHI Franciscan was cutting back their employees' benefits and funds from the two hospitals in Tacoma and sending the profit to CHI based in Denver, Colorado.

Furthermore, the members of SEIU Local 1199NW showed their support to their patients and their community. They were calling for increasing investment in frontline caregiver, a charity care policy that keeps patients out of debt. The union says CHI Franciscan health made a $165 million profit in 2013, while cutting its commitment to their patient cares.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt; Patients that could not afford to pay for their hospital bills were not being cared for by CHI Franciscan. The health care workers of the hospital felt that they should give back to their community by standing up for their clients and demanding the CHI to improve their charity care policy.

However, their bargaining sessions with CHI Franciscan Health were not ending with the resolution that they wanted to have. A session of negotiation with CHI Franciscan on Wednesday 12, 2014 ended at 8 P.M with no resolution.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt; It was frustrating the community and the members of Local 1199NW that their negotiation with the CHI Franciscan Health employers did not come to the agreement. Therefore, the union members had no alternative action but to go on strike and stand up for themselves, their patients, and their community. The workers notified CHI Franciscan one week before the strike day that they intended to strike. According to [[Taft-Hartley Act]], the union members required by law to give the hospital notice to ensure patients are not affected.&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt;

As for CHI Franciscan Health, they were recognizing the raising concern of the union. According to CHI Franciscan Health, they said they was working in addressing the concern of the union, including being more clear in its communication with their patients and employees. They also said they were working in finding and giving the options to help their clients to pay their bills. The company expected the strike and was prepared for it. In Q13 Fox, Thomas, the spokesman of CHI Franciscan, said in the interview, "We're going to deploy other staff from our other facilities to both hospitals to fill those position and other positions. Where we have needs, we will contract with other agencies to fill up those gaps".&lt;ref name=Q13FOX /&gt; The company made sure that the patients do not feel effected by the strike.

===The Strike begins===
On Tuesday, November 18, 2014, 1,100 workers from two Pierce County hospitals operated by CHI Franciscan Health walked out the job. There were 800 nursing assistants, licensed practical nurses, unit secretaries, dietary workers, housekeepers, sterile processors, technical workers and other service workers from [[St. Joseph Medical Center (Tacoma, Washington)|St. Joseph Medical Center]] in [[Tacoma, WA]] and another 300 workers from [[St. Clare Hospital]] in [[Lakewood, WA]] were striking. The strike, however, did not include doctors and nurses. The strike began at 7:00 A.M and would last 24 hours. The strike called by Service Employees International Union Healthcare Local 1199NW. The members of SEIU Local 1199NW were holding signs and protesting in front of the two hospitals.&lt;ref name=komonews /&gt;

==Aftermath==
After months of negotiating and calling for CHI Franciscan to invest in Tacoma patient and a public hearing, the workers at ST. Joseph and St. Clare hospitals, including 1,100 workers that went on strike on November 18, 2014, signed their new contract at 8 P.M Tuesday, January 27, 2015 with the company.&lt;ref name=SEIU1199NW&gt;{{cite web|title=SEIU 1199NW|url=http://www.seiu1199nw.org/2015/01/27/hospital-workers-at-chi-franciscan-st-joseph-and-st-clare-win-new-contract-with-increased-investment-in-front-line-care/|website=SEIU 1199NW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new contract included: improved staffing and wage and benefit improvement. The union was succeeding in stopping CHI Franciscan corporation from taking health money from Pierce County. The resulted of the new agreement are strengthen labor management partnership in determining staffing, an increased investment in worker's retirement, wage increases, and a management commitment to transparency in the matter of employees' qualification for charity care financial assistance to meet their families' healthcare needs. For the workers, their new contract means that they can worry less about supporting their families. Also, the workers are now can concentration on take care their patients.

'''''The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability''''' is a 1998 book by psychologist [[Arthur Jensen]]. The book is about the topic of the [[G factor (psychometrics)|general factor of human mental ability]], or ''g''.

==Summary==
The book traces the origins of the idea of individual differences in general mental ability to 19th century researchers [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Francis Galton]]. [[Charles Spearman]] is credited for inventing [[factor analysis]] in the early 20th century, which enabled statistical testing of the hypothesis that general mental ability is required in all mental efforts. Spearman gave the name ''g'' to the common factor underlying all mental tasks. He suggested that ''g'' reflected individual differences in "mental energy", and hoped that future research would uncover the biological basis of this energy.&lt;ref name="jensen1999"&gt;Jensen, A.R. (1999). [http://www.cogsci.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/psyc/newpsy?10.023 The g Factor: the Science of Mental Ability. Precis of Jensen on Intelligence-g-Factor.] ''Psycoloquy: 10(023)''&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that because it is difficult to arrive at a consensual scientific definition of the term ''intelligence'', scientists should dispense with the term and focus on specific abilities and their covariances. It also argues that mental abilities are best conceptualized as a three-level hierarchy, with a large number of narrow abilities at the base, a relatively small number of broad factors at the intermediate level, and a single general factor, ''g'', at the apex.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt;

The ''g'' factor can be derived from a correlation matrix of mental ability tests by many different methods of factor analysis. A ''g'' factor always emerges provided that the test battery is sufficiently large and diverse. The only exception is when one uses orthogonal rotation which precludes the appearance of a ''g'' factor. Jensen argues that orthogonal rotation is not appropriate for substantially positively correlated variables such as mental abilities.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt; The ''g'' factor has been found to be largely invariant across different factor analytic methods and in different racial and cultural groups. Jensen argues that ''g'' is normally distributed in any population. He also contends that ''g'' cannot be described in terms of the information content or item characteristics of tests, and likens it to a computer's [[CPU]]. Jensen hypothesizes that ''g'' is fundamentally about the speed or efficiency of the neural processes related to mental abilities.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt;

The book reviews studies on biological correlates of ''g'', and notes that they are numerous, including brain size, latency and amplitude of evoked brain potentials, rate of brain glucose metabolism, and general health. The book puts the broad-sense heritability of ''g'' at .40 to .50 in children, at .60 to .70 in adolescents and young adults, and at nearly .80 in older adults. It argues that shared family influences on ''g'' are substantial in childhood, but that in adults the environmental sources of variance are almost exclusively of the within-family kind. The book suggests that the main environmental influence on ''g'' is developmental "noise", consisting of more or less random physical events affecting the neurophysiological substrate of mental growth.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt; It reviews the evidence that elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) are correlated with ''g''. It argues that the ECT research supports the notion that ''g'' is related to the speed and efficiency of neural processes.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt;

The book argues that the ''g'' factor shows considerable practical validity. It is related to a large number of economically, educationally, and socially valued attributes. It is a particularly good predictor of academic and job-related outcomes.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt; It stresses the difference between ''g'' and what it calls ''vehicles'' of ''g''. Changes in test scores do not necessarily represent changes in the underlying construct, viz., ''g''. Practice effects on test scores appear to be unrelated to ''g''. An authentic change in ''g'' happens when the change shows broad generalizability to a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Intensive psychological interventions beginning in infancy have generally failed to produce lasting effects on ''g''. To what extent the [[Flynn effect]] represents a change in ''g'' is unknown.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt;

Mainly due to the relation between differences in ''g'' and important educational, economic, and social differences, there has long been interest in group differences in ''g'' in the United States. The most extensively researched is the gap between white and black Americans. According to the book, whites outscore blacks in the US by about 1.2 standard deviations, or 18 IQ points, on average. Blacks in sub-Saharan Africa score, on average, about two standard deviations below the white mean. The black-white gap in the US is not due to test bias. Cognitive tests have the same reliability and validity for all American-born, English-speaking groups. The magnitude of the black-white gap in the US is best predicted by the test's ''g'' loading, implying that the gap is mainly due to a difference in ''g''. Jensen argues that the black-white gap has a biological component. The book contends that the causes of differences in ''g'' between blacks and whites consist of the same environmental and genetic differences and in approximately the same magnitudes as within-population differences.&lt;ref name="jensen1999"/&gt;

The book argues that the ''g'' factor is important because it is a major node in a complex network of educationally, socially and economically important variables ("the ''g'' nexus"). The book argues that a person's level of ''g'' is a threshold variable, and that above a certain threshold other, non-''g'' abilities and talents, including personality differences, are critical for educational and vocational success.&lt;ref name="jensen1999"/&gt; The book anticipated that after 1998, subsequent research on ''g'' would have to extend into two directions, "horizontal" and "vertical": horizontal research to identify new variables in the ''g'' nexus, and vertical research to uncover the origins of ''g'' in terms of evolutionary biology and neurophysiology.&lt;ref name="jensen1999" /&gt;&lt;!-- I'll find reviews in reliable sources for this book. Some of the reviews are quite favorable, and other reviews contrast the book with other books published at about the same time. --&gt;

==Reviews==
''The g Factor'' was reviewed favorably by Canadian psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]], who called it "an awesome and monumental exposition of the case for the reality of g."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushton|first1=J. Philippe|title=The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability|journal=Politics and the Life Sciences|date=1998|volume=17|issue=2|pages=230–232|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9904053&amp;fileId=S0730938400012296|doi=10.1017/s0730938400012296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]] was more critical in his review, writing that "there is a great deal of evidence of various kinds that the general factor does not do what Jensen claims." He also acknowledged that "Even those who disagree with most of what Arthur Jensen says in The g Factor, such as myself, have to admire the sheer dedication, pertinacity, and tireless scholarship that must have gone into a work of this scope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/220135839?pq-origsite=gscholar | title=The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability | author=Sternberg, Robert J. | journal=Personnel Psychology {{subscription |via=[[ProQuest]]}} | date=Summer 1999| pages=471-476 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1999.tb00170.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobacco''' has a long history in the '''United States'''.

Tobacco distribution is measured in the United States using the term, "tobacco outlet density."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20541232|year=2010|last1=Yu|first1=D|title=Tobacco outlet density and demographics: Analysing the relationships with a spatial regression approach|journal=Public Health|volume=124|issue=7|pages=412–6|last2=Peterson|first2=N.

E|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2010.03.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 36.5 million people, or 15.1% of all adults (aged 18 years or older), in the [[United States]] smoked cigarettes in 2015. By state, in 2015, smoking prevalence ranged from between 9.1% and 12.8% in [[Utah]] to between 23.7% and 27.4% in [[West Virginia]]. By region, in 2015, smoking prevalence was highest in the Midwest (18.7%) and South (15.3%) and lowest in the West (12.4%).  Men tend to smoke more than women. In 2015, 16.7% of men smoked compared to 13.6% of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/|title=Smoking and Tobacco Use Fact Sheet|date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 46.6 million, or 20.6 percent of adults 18 and older were current smokers.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for approximately 443,000 deaths, or 1 of every 5 deaths, in the United States each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/ Adult Cigarette Smoking in the United States: Current Estimate] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)&lt;/ref&gt; Cigarette smoking alone has cost the United States $96 billion in direct medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity per year or an average of $4,260 per adult smoker.

==History of commercial tobacco==
{{Main|History of commercial tobacco in the United States}}Tobacco is a natural plant once classified as an herb with healing properties among the Indian Doctors in The United States of America.  It became one of the very first commodities in world trade and one of the first bartering systems in The United States of America.

Commercial tobacco production dates back to the 17th century when the first commercial crop was planted.  The industry originated in the production of [[tobacco]] for [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]]s and [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]].  Different war efforts in the world created a shift in demand and production of tobacco in the world and the American colonies.  With the advent of the [[American Revolution]] trade with the [[Thirteen colonies|colonies]] was interrupted which shifted trade to other countries in the world.  During this shift there was an increase in demand for tobacco in the United States, where the demand for tobacco in the form of [[cigar]]s and [[chewing tobacco]] increased.  Other wars, such as the [[War of 1812]] would introduce the [[Andalusia]]n [[cigarette]] to the rest of Europe.  This, accompanied with the [[American Civil War]] changed the production of tobacco in America to the manufactured cigarette.

===John Rolfe===
[[File:Nicotiana tabacum Blüten.jpg|thumb|right|Nicotiana Tabacum]]
In 1612, [[John Rolfe]] arrived in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] to find the colonists there struggling and [[Starving Time|starving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Ancestors in Jamestown, Virginia|url=http://www.genealogical-gleanings.com/Jamestown.htm|website=Genealogical Gleanings|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had brought with him a new species of tobacco known as [[nicotiana tabacum]].&lt;ref name="jrolfe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Rolfe_John_d_1622#start_entry|title=Rolfe, John (d. 1622)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species was preferable to the native [[nicotiana rustica]] as it was much smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shifflett|first1=Crandall|title=John Rolfe (1585-1622)|url=http://www.virtualjamestown.org/jrolfe.html|website=Virtual Jamestown|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown where John Rolfe got the seeds for this new species of tobacco, as the sale of the seeds to a non-Spaniard was punishable by death.&lt;ref name="jrolfe" /&gt; However, this new nicotiana tabacum proved to be very popular in England and the first shipment was sent in 1614. By 1639, 750 tons of tobacco had been shipped to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.tobacco.org/History/Jamestown.html|title=No Title|first=Gene|last=Borio|date=6 September 2018|website=archive.tobacco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation methods===
[[File:Cultivation of tobacco at Jamestown 1615.jpg|thumb|Cultivation of tobacco at Jamestown 1615]]
In the period of 1619 to 1629, the average tobacco farmer was expected to produce 712 pounds of tobacco in a year. By the period of 1680 to 1699, the output per worker was 1,710 pounds of tobacco in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menard|first1=R. R.|title=Economy and Society in Early Maryland|date=1985|location=New York|pages=448–50, 462}}&lt;/ref&gt; These increases in productivity were brought about primarily from relocation and better farming techniques. While early tobacco [[Cultivation of tobacco|cultivation]] techniques were relatively rudimentary, colonial farmers quickly developed more efficient techniques.&lt;ref name="McGregory1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregory|first=Jerrilyn|title=Wiregrass Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kwchjDboMoC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=1997-04-01|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=9780878059263|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco will wear out the soil in just a few years and this necessitated farmers to relocate from coastal areas up rivers in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="enva" /&gt; Production was further increased by the use of slave labor on larger farms. On the frontier, hired help would both farm the tobacco and protect farms from Indian raids.&lt;ref name="cato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pecquet|first1=Gary M.|title=British Mercantilism and Crop Controls in the Tobacco Colonies: A Study of Rent-Seeking Costs|journal=Cato Journal|date=2003|volume=22|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2003/1/cj22n3-5.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of trade===
In 1621, King James prohibited the production of tobacco in [[England]], limiting its growth to the colonies in America.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt; While it would take many years for this to take effect, it influenced other policies.  In reaction to this, the colonies would pass legislation like the [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730]] in [[Virginia]] as a way to control the production of tobacco and raise its price. Legislation was also passed as a way of ensuring that low-quality trash tobacco was not being shipped or used for the payment of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=General Assembly|title=Tobacco Inspection of 1730|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/_An_Act_for_amending_the_Staple_of_Tobacco_and_for_preventing_Frauds_in_his_Majesty_s_Customs_1730|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of legislation on both sides of the Atlantic to exert control over the tobacco industry would continue until the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt;

===Tobacco's economic decline===
Due to the Revolutionary War, Southern exports dropped by 39% from the upper South and almost 50% from the lower South. Lack of domestic market growth exasperated these effects and a stagnated tobacco industry failed to fully recover as cotton became the main cash crop of the south going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soltow|first1=James H.|title=Cotton as Religion, Politics, Law, Economics and Art|journal=Agricultural History|date=1994|volume=68|issue=2|pages=6–19|jstor=3744399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact of the early tobacco industry==

===Economic growth in the early colonies===
[[Image:Tobacco cultivation (Virginia, ca. 1670).jpg|thumb|200px|This 1670 painting shows enslaved Africans working in the tobacco sheds of a colonial tobacco plantation]]
Tobacco played a huge role in the development of the early [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. With the early tobacco boom in Virginia and the expansion of trade with England, the value of tobacco soared and provided an incentive for a large influx of colonists. In Virginia, the rough climate made it difficult for the colonists to produce crops that were necessary for survival. Due to this difficulty, the colonists lacked a source of income and food.&lt;ref name="enva" /&gt; The colonists of Virginia began to grow tobacco. Tobacco brought the colonists a large source of revenue that was used to pay taxes and fines, purchase slaves, and to purchase manufactured goods from England.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt; As the colonies grew, so did their production of tobacco. Slaves and indentured servants were brought into the colonies to participate in tobacco farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menard|first1=R. R.|title=Plantation Empire: How Sugar and Tobacco Planters Built Their Industries and Raised an Empire|journal=Agricultural History|date=2007|volume=81|issue=3|pages=319|jstor=20454724}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that some colonies would have continued to fail had it not been for the production of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Roanoke Colonies|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Roanoke_Colonies_The|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Starving Time|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Starving_Time_The|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco provided the early colonies with an opportunity for expansion and economic success.&lt;ref name="enva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Tobacco_in_Colonial_Virginia|title=Tobacco in Colonial Virginia|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt;

===British mercantilism and monopolization of the tobacco trade===
As early as 1621, only 14 years after the establishment of a colony in Virginia and just 9 years after John Rolfe discovered the economic potential of tobacco in America, British merchants were on the march in an attempt to control the tobacco trade.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt; A measure was introduced into the [[British Parliament]] in 1621 with two major components: a restriction on tobacco importation from anywhere with the exception of Virginia and the [[British West Indies]] and an edict that tobacco was not to be grown and cultivated anywhere else within England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Middleton|first1=A.P.|title=Tobacco Coast|journal=Newport News, VA|date=1953|volume=Mariners' Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the merchants was to monopolize and control all means of tobacco distribution within Europe and throughout the world. By doing so it was possible to secure a stable return on investment for the American Colonies and profit tremendously within Europe. The British merchants influenced economies using the power of the nation-state to influence and  protect business interests. In exchange, taxes were levied in order to fund political interests. The bill that the merchants put forward in 1621 to Parliament was a classic example of the power and influence of [[mercantilism]].

The measure passed the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] although it was defeated in the [[House of Lords]]. Despite this defeat the measure eventually was pushed through by proclamation from [[King James VI and I|King James]].&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt; Ironically King James had very strong opinions against the use of tobacco, pointing to the ill health effects and social impact of those that used tobacco &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/blaste.app.html|title=BLASTE Appendix, King James I of England, A Counterblaste to Tobacco|website=www.laits.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these grievances the King was then able to capture import duties on tobacco and in exchange monopoly power was granted to the merchants.

The measures also prevented any foreign ships from carrying colonial tobacco.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt; This monopolization became extremely profitable and flourished during the 1600s. The economy of Virginia was extremely dependent on the tobacco trade. So much so that subtle shifts in demand and prices dramatically affected the Virginian economy as a whole.&lt;ref name="enva" /&gt; This led to several booms and busts related to tobacco. The price of tobacco dropped from 6.50 pennies per pound in the 1620s down to as low as .80 pennies per pound in the 1690s. This downward trending triggered a whole series of crop controls and government sponsored price manipulations throughout the 1600s to try to stabilize pricing, but to no avail.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt;

===Cash crop===
[[File:Lorillard hogshead, 1789.jpg|thumb|Lorillard hogshead, 1789]]
By the mid 1620s tobacco became the most common commodity for bartering due to the increasing scarcity of gold and silver and the decreasing value of [[wampum]] from forgery and [[overproduction]]. In order to help with accounting and standardizing trade, colonial government officials would rate tobacco and compare its weight into values of pounds, shillings, and pence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-colonial/1646|title=LEARN NC has been archived|website=www.learnnc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of American tobacco increased dramatically in the colonial period eventually leading to English goods being traded  equally with tobacco.  Because England's climate did not allow for the same quality of tobacco as that grown in America, the colonists did not have to worry about scarcity of tobacco. This eventually led to tobacco being the main form of trade with England.

Imports of tobacco into England increased from 60,000 pounds in 1622 to 500,000 pounds in 1628, and to 1,500,000 pounds in 1639. Such dramatic growth in demand for tobacco eventually led to overproduction of the commodity, and in turn extreme devaluation of tobacco. To compensate for the loss of value, farmers would add dirt and leaves to increase the weight, but lowering the quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html|title=No Title|first=Gene|last=Borio|date=6 September 2018|website=archive.tobacco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1640s to the 1690s the value of tobacco would be highly unstable, government officials would help stabilize tobacco by reducing the amount of tobacco produced, standardizing the size of a tobacco hogshead, and prohibiting shipments of bulk tobacco.  Eventually the tobacco currency would stabilize in the early 1700s but would be short lived as farmers started cutting back on growing tobacco. In the 1730s tobacco crops were being replaced with food crops as the colonies moved closer to revolution with England.&lt;ref name="enva" /&gt;

== Current smoking among adults in 2016 (nation) ==
According to the research, every 100 U.S adults there are more than 15 at the age of 18 or older smoked cigarettes in 2016. In other words, there are about 37.8 million cases in the United State that smoking cigarettes. This leads to serious consequence, the number of Americans live with a [[smoking and disease]] smoking-related disease is huge which more than 16 million people. However, the number of people were smoking in 2016 has decreased to 15.5 % which is 5.4% different from 2005. This also reflects the increase of smokers who had quit. The proportion of male smokers is more than women. At every 100 adults, men nearly got 4 more cases than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Adult Cigarette Smoking in the United States - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2018-09-24|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
A half million children work in the fields of America picking food in 2012. In eastern [[North Carolina]], children have been interviewed as young as fourteen who worked harvesting tobacco, and recent news reports describe children as young as nine and ten doing such work. Federal law provides no minimum age for work on small farms with parental permission, and children ages twelve and up may work for hire on any size farm for unlimited periods outside school hours. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], farm-work is the most hazardous occupation open to children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/05/hidden-victims-tobacco The Hidden Victims of Tobacco] HRW September 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/series/children-in-the-field/Children-in-the-Field-North-Carolina-Tobacco-Farms-165011006.html Children in the Fields: North Carolina Tobacco Farms]  NBC August 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walkit.com''' is an urban walking [[route planning software|route planner]].

== History ==
The site launched with coverage of [[central London]] in 2006. The cities of [[Edinburgh]] and [[Birmingham]] were then added within the first year. The service now also covers [[Aberdeen]], [[Aylesbur]]y, [[Bolton]], [[Bristo]]l, [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Cambridge]], [[Coventry]], [[Derby]], [[Glasgow]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Ipswich]], [[Leeds]], [[Lowestoft]], [[Manchester]], [[Middlesbrough]], Newcastle and Gateshead, [[Norwich]], [[Nottingham]], [[Oldham]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Sheffield]], [[Stockport]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], Trafford and Wigan, with an ongoing programme of launches in new cities and towns.

[http://walkit.com/ walkit.com] is independently owned and managed by a team of staff based in Birmingham, London and Norfolk.

== Services ==

The site generates both A to B and circular routes, providing printable written directions and maps. As walkit.com is specifically tailored to [[pedestrians]], it includes data that is omitted from many traditional vehicle-based journey planners, such as routes across parks, beside rivers and canals and along footpaths and alleyways. There is also the option to select a 'less busy' route, which avoids main roads where possible. Some cities also have additional features, such as step-free routes, hill profiles, and [[air-pollution]] aware routes.

walkit.com also hosts a blog page, an events page highlighting walking related events in its featured cities, and information pages on walking for health, walking to work, walking to school and going green.

In 2010, personalised walkit accounts were launched in the form of mywalkit (free) and mywalkit+ (£1.50 per month/£15.00 annually). Subscribers to the mywalkit account are able to personalise their walking speed in order to provide more accurate walking statistics. The mywalkit+ account allows subscribers to keep a log of their previous walks, as well as setting three different personalised speeds, and keep a record of their carbon savings.

walkit.com also allows users to create 'link to us' widgets for their own sites, in order to promote walking. Widgets can be specifically created for directions to or from particular destinations, between two specific locations, or for circular walks from a predefined point.

walkit.com has both a Facebook fan page and group and an active Twitter account.

== Awards ==
Walkit.com has been both shortlisted for and received a number of awards since its creation.

These include one of "The Guardian's 100 top sites for 2009" [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/18/internet-websites], one of "The Telegraph's 101 most useful websites of 2008" [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6554835/The-101-most-useful-websites-2008.html] and one of "Time Out's 50 Best London Websites" in 2008 [http://www.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/features/4273/3.html].

walkit.com was named the winner of the "Most Innovative Transport Project" at the National Transport Awards in 2008 [http://www.acttravelwise.org/news/1137], and  shortlisted for both the "Ethical Business of the Year" by the Observer Ethical awards 2008 [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/08/ethicalliving.lifeandhealth1], and the "Media Guardian Innovation Awards" in 2008 [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/28/10].

'''Water chlorination''' is the process of adding [[chlorine]] or chlorine compounds such as [[sodium hypochlorite]] to [[water]]. This method is used to kill certain bacteria and other microbes in [[tap water]] as chlorine is highly toxic. In particular, chlorination is used to prevent the spread of [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhoid]].

==History==
In a paper published in 1894, it was formally proposed to add chlorine to water to render it "germ-free". Two other authorities endorsed this proposal and published it in many other papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= F.E. Turneaure |author2= and H.L. Russell |year= 1901 |title= Public Water-Supplies: Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works |edition= 1st |location= New York |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. In 1897 the town of [[Maidstone]], England was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply caused a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stop the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of so-called ''chloride of lime'' to the water being treated. This was not simply modern calcium chloride, but contained chlorine gas dissolved in lime-water (dilute calcium hydroxide) to form calcium hypochlorite (chlorinated lime). The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6: Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London: Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|300px|thumb|Manual Control Chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for [[disinfection]] took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm. The treatment process was conceived by Dr. [[John L. Leal]], and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York: Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account, "It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= V. B. Nesfield|title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2218881 |journal=[[Am J Public Health]] |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=783–97 |author=Darnall CR |title=The purification of water by anhydrous chlorine |date=November 1911 |pmid=19599675 |doi=10.2105/ajph.1.11.783}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''. Shortly after Darnall's demonstration, Major [[William J. L. Lyster]] of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. 

For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). The canvas "bag, water, sterilizing" was a common component of field kitchens, issued one per 100 persons, of a standard 36-gallon capacity that hung from an often-improvised tripod in the field. In use from World War I through the Vietnam War, it has been replaced by [[reverse osmosis]] systems that produce [[drinking water|potable water]] by pressure straining local water through microscopic-level filters: the Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (1980) and the Tactical Water Purification System (2007) for large-scale production, and the Light Water Purifier unit for smaller-scale needs that includes ultrafiltration technology to produce potable water from any source and uses automated backwash cycles every 15 minutes to simplify cleaning operations.

Chlorine gas was first used on a continuing basis to disinfect the water supply at the Belmont filter plant, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] by using a machine invented by Charles Frederick Wallace{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} who dubbed it the Chlorinator. It was manufactured by the Wallace &amp; Tiernan company beginning in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.rit.edu/findingaids/Inventories/WallaceAndTiernanCompanyRecords.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, disinfection of U.S. drinking water by chlorine gas had largely replaced the use of chloride of lime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodges|first=L.|title=Environmental Pollution|publisher=Rinehart and Winston|year=1977|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Moses N. (1981). ''The Quest for Pure Water: the History of Water Purification from the Earliest Records to the Twentieth Century.'' 2nd Edition. Vol. 1. Denver: American Water Works Association. p. 341-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorination can also be practiced using [[sodium hypochlorite]] or various other chemicals.

==Biochemistry==
As a [[halogen]], [[chlorine]] is a highly efficient disinfectant, and is added to public water supplies to kill disease-causing pathogens, such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and [[protozoans]], that commonly grow in water supply reservoirs, on the walls of water mains and in storage tanks.&lt;ref name=Calderon&gt;{{cite journal |author= Calderon, R. L. |year= 2000 |title= The Epidemiology of Chemical Contaminants of Drinking Water |journal= Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume= 38 |pages= S13–S20 |doi= 10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00133-7 |pmid= 10717366 |issue= 1 Suppl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The microscopic agents of many diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[dysentery]] killed countless people annually before disinfection methods were employed routinely.&lt;ref name=Calderon/&gt;

Chlorine is [[chlorine production|manufactured]] from salt by electrolysis or other methods. It is a gas at atmospheric pressures but liquefies under pressure. The liquefied gas is transported and used as such.

As a strong [[oxidizing agent]], chlorine kills via the oxidation of organic molecules.&lt;ref name=Calderon/&gt; Chlorine and hydrolysis product [[hypochlorous acid]] are neutrally charged and therefore easily penetrate the negatively charged surface of pathogens. It is able to disintegrate the lipids that compose the cell wall and react with intracellular [[enzymes]] and [[proteins]], making them nonfunctional. [[Microorganisms]] then either die or are no longer able to multiply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Kleijnen, R.G. |date= December 16, 2011 |title= The Chlorine Dilemma |publisher= Eindhoven University of Technology |pages=  |url= http://students.chem.tue.nl/ifp42/Downloads/Final%20Report%20MDP%20Group%201%20-%20The%20Chlorine%20Dilemma.pdf |accessdate= January 18, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222152238/http://students.chem.tue.nl/ifp42/Downloads/Final%20Report%20MDP%20Group%201%20-%20The%20Chlorine%20Dilemma.pdf# |archive-date= 2014-02-22 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===
When dissolved in water, chlorine converts to an equilibrium mixture of chlorine, [[hypochlorous acid]] (HOCl), and [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl):
:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} HOCl + HCl

In acidic solution, the major species are {{chem|Cl|2}} and HOCl, whereas in alkaline solution, effectively only ClO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[hypochlorite]] ion) is present. Very small concentrations of ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are also found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Shunji Nakagawara, Takeshi Goto, Masayuki Nara, Youichi Ozaqa, Kunimoto Hotta and Yoji Arata |title= Spectroscopic Characterization and the pH Dependence of Bactericidal Activity of the Aqueous Chlorine Solution |journal= Analytical Sciences |volume= 14 |pages= 691–698 |year= 1998 |doi= 10.2116/analsci.14.691 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock chlorination===
[[Shock chlorination]] is a process used in many swimming pools, [[water well]]s, [[spring (hydrology)|springs]], and other water sources to reduce the [[bacteria]]l and [[algae|algal]] residue in the water. Shock chlorination is performed by mixing a large amount of [[hypochlorite]] into the water. The hypochlorite can be in the form of a powder or a liquid such as chlorine bleach (solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]]  or calcium hypochlorite in water). Water that is being shock chlorinated should not be swum in or drunk until the sodium hypochlorite count in the water goes down to three [[parts per million]] (PPM) or until the calcium hypochlorite count goes down to 0.2 to 0.35 PPM.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

==Drawbacks==
Disinfection by chlorination can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine can react with naturally occurring [[organic compound]]s found in the water supply to produce compounds known as [[disinfection by-product]]s (DBPs). The most common DBPs are [[trihalomethane]]s (THMs) and [[haloacetic acid]]s (HAAs). Trihalomethanes are the main disinfectant by-products created from chlorination with two different types, [[bromoform]] and [[dibromochloromethane]], which are mainly responsible for health hazards. Their effects depend strictly on the duration of their exposure to the chemicals and the amount ingested into the body. In high doses, bromoform mainly slows down regular brain activity, which is manifested by symptoms such as sleepiness or sedation. Chronic exposure of both bromoform and dibromochloromethane can cause liver and kidney cancer, as well as heart disease, unconsciousness, or death in high doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher= ATSDR |year= 2011 |title= Public Health Statement: Bromoform &amp; Dibromochloromethane}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the potential [[carcinogenicity]] of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the [[developed world]] require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems. The [[World Health Organization]] has stated that "the risks to health from these by-products are extremely small in comparison with the risks associated with inadequate disinfection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality |volume=Volume 1, Recommendations |year= 2008 |edition= third edition incorporating the first and second addenda |publisher= World Health Organization |url= http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/204411/1/9789241547611_eng.pdf |page=5}}&lt;!-- index is at http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/gdwq3rev/en/ --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other concerns regarding chlorine, including its volatile nature which causes it to disappear too quickly from the water system, and [[organoleptic]] concerns such as taste and odor.

== Dechlorinator ==
A '''dechlorinator''' is a chemical additive that removes [[chlorine]] or [[chloramine]] from water.  Where tap water is [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]], it should be dechlorinated before use in an [[aquarium]], since chlorine can harm aquatic life in the same way it kills [[Microorganism|micro-organisms]]. Chlorine will kill fish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-qrDxOwa9IC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=dechlorinator%20how%20it%20works&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q=dechlorinator&amp;f=false|title=Freshwater Aquariums for Dummies|last=Hargrove|first=Maddy|last2=Hargrove|first2=Mic|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=9780470051030|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=181|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause damage to an aquarium's [[Filter (aquarium)|biological filter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firsttankguide.net/dechlorinator.php|title=Dechlorination - The First Tank Guide - Preparing Your Tap Water for Aquarium Use|last=Seyffarth|first=Keith|date=|website=First Tank Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals that serve this function are [[reducing agents]] which reduce chlorine species to [[chloride]], which is less harmful to fish.  

Some compounds employed in commercial dechlorinators are: [[sodium thiosulfate]], Sodium hydroxymethanesulfonate (used in AmQuel), and Sodium hydroxymethane sulfinic acid (used in Marineland Bio-safe).

==Alternative methods for water disinfection==
===Chlorine dioxide===
The use of [[chlorine dioxide]] as an alternative to chlorine is now widespread in both municipal and industrial applications.{{cn|date=March 2018}}  It eliminates potential of harmful DBPs and is a highly efficient disinfectant.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Ozonation===
[[Ozone#Consumers|Ozonation]] is used by many European countries and also in a few municipalities in the United States and Canada. This alternative is more cost effective but energy intensive. It involves ozone being bubbled through the water, breaking down all parasites, bacteria, and all other harmful organic substances. However, this method leaves no residual ozone to control contamination of the water after the process has been completed.&lt;ref name=Neumann&gt;Neumann, H. (1981). "Bacteriological safety of hot tap water in developing countries." ''Public Health'' Rep.84:812-814.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of chlorine in comparison to ozone is that the residual persists in the water for an extended period of time. This feature allows the chlorine to travel through the water supply system, effectively controlling pathogenic backflow contamination. In a large system this may not be adequate, and so chlorine levels may be boosted at points in the distribution system, or [[chloramine]] may be used, which remains in the water for longer before reacting or dissipating.

===Chloramination===
[[Chloramination]] is also becoming increasingly common. Disinfection with [[chloramine]] produces less undesirable [[disinfection by-product|byproducts]] than chlorine (gas or hypochlorite). Chloramine has a longer half-life in the distribution system, and maintains effective protection against pathogens. Chloramines persist in the distribution because of their lower redox potential in comparison to free chlorine. Chloramine is formed by adding ammonia and chlorine into drinking water to form monochloramine and/or dichloramine. Whereas ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' can be many times more resistant to chlorine than ''Escherichia coli'', both organisms are about equally susceptible to the disinfecting effect of chloramine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker KH, Hegarty JP, Redmond B, Reed NA, Herson DS |title=Effect of Oxidizing Disinfectants (Chlorine, Monochloramine, and Ozone) on ''Helicobacter pylori'' |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=68 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=981–984 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/68/2/981 |format= [[PDF]] |doi=10.1128/AEM.68.2.981-984.2002 |pmc=126689 |pmid=11823249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bromination and iodinization===
Chlorine in water is over three times more effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than an equivalent concentration of [[bromine]], and over six times more effective than an equivalent concentration of [[iodine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF |title=Comparison of Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine as Disinfectants for Swimming Pool Water |journal=Applied Microbiology |volume=14 |issue=2 |date=1 March 1966 |pages=276–279 |pmc=546668 |pmid=4959984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home filtration===
Water treated by [[filtration]] and home filtration may not need further disinfection; a very high proportion of pathogens are removed by materials in the filter bed. Filtered water must be used soon after it is filtered, as the low amount of remaining microbes may proliferate over time. In general, these home filters remove over 90% of the chlorine available to a glass of treated water. These filters must be periodically replaced otherwise the bacterial content of the water may actually increase due to the growth of bacteria within the filter unit.&lt;ref name=Neumann/&gt;

===UV radiation===
[[Ultraviolet#Sterilization and disinfection|UV disinfection]] is gaining popularity. UV treatment leaves minimal residue in the water. In water UV generates ozone in situ and thus has many of the advantages of ozone disinfection. However, [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] alone (as well as chlorination alone) will not remove toxins from bacteria, pesticides, heavy metals, etc. from water.

===Ionizing radiation===
Like UV, [[sterilization (microbiology)#Ionizing radiation sterilization|ionizing radiation]] (X-rays, gamma rays, and electron beams) has been used to sterilize water.

'''[[Water supply]] and [[sanitation]] in Spain''' is characterized by universal access and generally good service quality, while tariffs are among the lowest in the EU.&lt;ref name="iwahq.org"&gt;[http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/sgs/sg%20on%20statistic%20and%20ec/doc%20and%20reports/IWA%20international%20statistics%200806.pdf IWA 2006 International Statistics for Water Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of the population is served by private or mixed private-public water companies, which operate under concession contracts with municipalities. The largest of the private water companies, with a market share of about 50% of the private concessions, is Aguas de Barcelona ([[Agbar]]). However, the large cities are all served by public companies except Barcelona and Valencia. The largest public company is [[Canal de Isabel II]], which serves the metropolitan area of Madrid.

Droughts occasionally affect water supply in Southern Spain, which has considered seawater [[water desalination|desalination]] to meet its water needs.

== Access ==
Access to water supply and sanitation in Spain is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/spain/summary/statistics/|title=Spain|last=|first=|date=|website=WASHwatch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt; 98% of the urban population and 93% of the rural population is connected to sewers, while the remainder is served by on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks.

== Service quality ==
99.5% of the public tap water in Spain is considered potable (safe to drink) according to Ministerio de Sanidad that is responsible for the quality of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mspsi.es/profesionales/saludPublica/saludAmbLaboral/calidadAguas/consumoHumano.htm|title=Ministerio de Sanidad, Servicios Sociales e Igualdad - Profesionales - Salud ambiental y laboral - Calidad de las aguas - Agua de consumo humano|website=www.mspsi.es|language=es|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every local provider has to report certified lab tests every 6 months resulting in over 40 million reports per year available from Sinac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sinac.msc.es/|title=SINAC - Sistema de Información Nacional de Agua de Consumo|website=sinac.msc.es|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each water company is also obliged to provide a test report about the quality of the water when requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://todosobreelagua.com/spanish-tap-water-quality/|title=Spanish tap water quality and components {{!}} Everything about water|work=Everything about water|access-date=2017-02-26|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the consumer organization OCU analyzed the presence of six pollutants in drinking water in 64 cities and towns. The pollutants were [[trihalomethane]], [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[pesticides]], [[nitrate]], [[boron]] and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]. The analysis showed that drinking water had improved since the last report by OCU on drinking water in 2006. Problems were encountered only in [[Ourense]] (trihalomethane) and in [[Girona]] (pesticides).&lt;ref name="OCU" /&gt;

OCU carried out another analysis in 2014 of 62 municipalities and cities and found that 7 had issues with contamination whereof one was major (Cáceres).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocu.org/alimentacion/agua/informe/agua-del-grifo|title=Agua del grifo: ¿es la mejor?|website=website_ALine_ES|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning wastewater treatment, in 2005 77% of municipal wastewater was treated in accordance with standards set by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.mma.es/portal/secciones/novedades_web/pdf/politica_de_agua_balance_28_12.pdf Balance Politica de Agua 2006, p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water resources ==
Southern Spain regularly suffers from severe droughts. The National Hydrological Plan (PHN by its Spanish acronym, from ''Plan Hidrológico Nacional'') foresaw substantial investments into the transfer of surface water from the [[Ebro River]] south to cities on the Mediterranean coast. However, in 2004, these plans have been shelved by the newly elected Spanish government in favor of seawater [[Water desalination|desalination]], adding to 700 existing desalination plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irc.nl/page/103 IRC]:[http://www.irc.nl/page/13174 Spain: new water programme emphasizes desalination], September 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Data about water sources and use vary according to the source of information. According to the utility association ASOAGA, about 74% of municipal water supply originates in surface water, only 19% in groundwater,and 7% in springs and desalination.&lt;ref name="asoaga.org"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.asoaga.org/datos.htm Asociación Española de Empresas Gestoras de los Servicios de Agua a Poblaciones (ASOAGA) Data]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2007 survey by the National Statistical Institute, 63% of the water distributed by utilities came from surface water, 33% from groundwater, and 4% from other sources such as desalination.&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt; According to the utility association ASOAGA, water use is about 280 liter per capita and day (l/c/d).&lt;ref name="asoaga.org"/&gt; This figure may include [[non-revenue water]]. A survey by the [[International Water Association]] (IWA) in four Spanish cities gives water use as between 169 l/c/d in Valencia and 192 l/c/d in Valencia, including industrial water use. These usage levels are similar to the average of OECD countries.&lt;ref name="iwahq.org"/&gt; The National Statistical Institute gives an average water consumption of 157 l/c/d, varying between 125 l/c/d in the Basque country to 189 l/c/d in Cantabria.&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt;

About 20% of treated wastewater in Spain is being reused (this is also called [[reclaimed water]]), primarily for irrigation and landscaping.&lt;ref name="asoaga.org"/&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===
A cornerstone of the legal framework for water supply and sanitation is the 1985 Water Law (Ley de Aguas). Policy and regulation functions for water supply and sanitation are shared among various Ministries. For example, the Ministry of Environment is in charge of water resources management and the Ministry of Health is in charge of drinking water quality monitoring.

Basin Agencies (Confederaciones de Cuencas Hidrográficas) are in charge of planning, constructing and operating major water infrastructure such as dams; elaborating basin plans; setting water quality targets, as well as monitoring and enforcing them; granting permits to use water, as well as inspecting water facilities for which permits were granted; undertaking hydrological studies; and to provide advisory services to other entities at their request. Basin Agencies are headed by a President who is nominated by the Cabinet at the proposal of the Minister of Environment. Each agency has a Board, a user assembly and a council to ensure broad participation by various stakeholders in its decision-making process, both in planning and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://hispagua.cedex.es/siagua/documentos/directores03/presentacion5.ppt#260,12,COMETIDOS DE LOS ORGANISMOS DE CUENCA Ministry of Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040731204333/http://hispagua.cedex.es/siagua/documentos/directores03/presentacion5.ppt#260,12,COMETIDOS |date=July 31, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 15 Basin Agencies in Spain for rivers that flow through more than one [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]]. If a river runs entirely within the territory of an autonomous community the water administration of the respective autonomous community, instead of one of the basin agencies, is in charge of managing its water resources. This is the case in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] and [[Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.directivamarco.es/2007/11/el-nuevo-mapa-del-agua-en-espana-organismos-de-cuenca-demarcaciones-hidrograficas-y-autoridades-competentes/ Directiva Marco del Agua]&lt;/ref&gt;

While basin agencies do not provide water and sanitation services, they play an important role in determining the framework for the provision of such services.

=== Service provision ===
Service provision is the responsibility of more than 8,000 municipalities. Municipalities can provide services directly or through a municipal public company (54% of market share), or through [[concession (contract)|concession]]s to a mixed [[public-private company]] (13%) or a private company (33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.asoaga.org/gestion.htm Asociación Española de Empresas Gestoras de los Servicios de Agua a Poblaciones (ASOAGA) Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities water supply is the responsibility of a company, while sanitation services are provided directly by the municipality. This is the case, for example, in Barcelona.

The main water service provider in Spain is Aguas de Barcelona ([[Agbar]]), a private company that provides water services to about 13 million people in more than 1,000 localities under concession contracts. Sewer services are provided to 8.25 million people in 365 localities, and wastewater treatment is carried out for 9.3 million people in 445 localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Agbar:[http://www.agbar.es/es/donde-estamos.html Donde estamos:España], retrieved on June 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Its main competitor is Aqualia. The largest public water company is Canal Isabel II that serves the metropolitan area of Madrid. The government of the Madrid region plans to sell 49% of the shares of the company to private investors since 2008, but has not done so until early 2015.

===Corruption===
In February 2013 the director of Agbar’s Aquagest concession in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was jailed because of alleged bribes to municipal officials to ensure the renewal of his firm's contract.&lt;ref name="Corruption in concession"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption taints Spanish concessions market|url=http://www.globalwaterintel.com/archive/14/3/general/corruption-taints-spanish-concessions-market.html#sthash.ebDJ1Mqs.dpuf|publisher=Global Water Intelligence, March 2013|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 25 prominent Valencian politicians and administrators were charged with "fraudulently obtaining €23 million between 2004 and 2009 by inflating the cost of treating sewage sludge from metropolitan Valencia’s wastewater treatment plant", operated at the time by the public company EMARSA, a subsidiary of the regional wastewater company EMARSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where there’s muck there’s top brass, in Valencia|publisher=Global Water Intelligence, 5th June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 there were numerous ongoing investigations into alleged corruption in the awarding of municipal water contracts. In January 2016 top executives of the Spanish water companies Acciona and FCC were arrested amid these investigations. Furthermore, the Director General and other senior employees of the government water procurement agency Acuamed were arrested. Acuamed, an agency under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment, is in charge of major infrastructure programs financed by the central government, including desalination plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spanish water sector reels under new corruption scandal|url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/global-water-intelligence-magazine/17/1/general/spanish-water-sector-reels-under-new-corruption-scandal|publisher=Global Water Intelligence, January 2016|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform proposals===
It is common practice in Spain that municipalities legally request upfront payments (canon) when awarding water concessions. These funds are not used for water infrastructure, but to generate revenue for the municipality. Also, not all contracts are awarded through competitive bidding. For example, in 2012 the Barcelona metropolitan authority awarded a 35-year concession worth an estimated €330 million to Agbar without a competitive tender. Roque Gistau, president of the Spanish water and sanitation association (AEAS), says that the current system to award contracts must be reformed. He calls for the abolishment of the Canon because it distorts the market. He also calls for the establishment of a water regulator such as the ones existing in England and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Corruption in concession"/&gt;

== History and recent developments ==

Spain was one of the first countries in the world to create river basin agencies through a Royal Decree-Law published in 1926. The first river basin agencies (''Confederaciones Hidrográficas'') were created in the [[Ebro]] basin and in the [[Segura]] basin in 1926, followed by the [[Guadalquivir]] in 1927 and the Eastern [[Pyrenees]] in 1929. Until 1961 basin agencies were created in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://directivamarco.es/2007/11/el-nuevo-mapa-del-agua-en-espana-organismos-de-cuenca-demarcaciones-hidrograficas-y-autoridades-competentes/ El nuevo mapa del agua en España. Organismos de cuenca, Demarcaciones Hidrográficas y Autoridades Competentes, by Alejandro Maceira Rozados, November 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502051445/http://directivamarco.es/2007/11/el-nuevo-mapa-del-agua-en-espana-organismos-de-cuenca-demarcaciones-hidrograficas-y-autoridades-competentes/ |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of water resources in Spain during much of the 20th century has been characterized by strong state intervention. This intervention focused on the construction of hydraulic works in an effort to increase water available for irrigation (supply policy) and hydropower generation, was considered the engine of Spanish economic development policy. The Plans of Hydraulic Works of 1902 and 1933, financed for the most part by the state, are an example of this type of policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unirioja.es/dptos/dd/redur/numero0/fanlo.pdf|title=Fanlo Loras, Antonio (2001).

From that year the pace accelerated considerably, reaching an average of 20 annual dams, until reaching the infrastructure existing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.programaagua.com/secciones/acm/fondo_docu_descargas/libro_blanco/pdf/sintesis.pdf|title=Dirección General de Obras Hidráulicas y Calidad de las Aguas (2000).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mma.es/portal/secciones/|title=pp. pp. 8, 23-28.

The Law of Water of 1866 represents the first attempt to regulate Spanish territorial waters specifically, although it did not come into force due to the revolutionary period that gave rise to the first republic. Its basic principles, however, are the basis largely of the Law of 1879, including the public domain of all natural streams, river banks and river banks. Ground waters, which belong to the owner of the land where they were found, were not included. This provision continued in force until its retroactive amendment by the 1985 Law, and is one of the causes of the current situation of lack of administrative control of groundwater sources.

The Law of 1879, includes the right to private use of water linked to an administrative concession. The Law regulates in a very precise way both the procedure and the general rules on the concession of public waters as well as specific provisions for the different uses (supply to populations, irrigations, industrial establishments, etc.). In the case of irrigation, in addition, the right to use water is linked to that of land ownership. Likewise, the Law establishes the community of irrigators, an institution that is self-governing and has sanctioning power. The subsequent evolution of water towards multipurpose uses and the concurrence of several users over the same water body have expanded the figure of the irrigation community to the current user communities.

The Regulation of the Law of 1879 never came into practice and this normative element was replaced by several provisions of lower rank that tried to solve the numerous problems that were arising in the application of the Law due both to the wide field covered by this law, the prolonged validity that faced it with situations for which it were not effective.

The most important of the normative novelties is the one that refers to the creation, or rather the institutionalization of an existing reality, of the basin organisms, with the creation of the first hydrographic confederation in 1926 as the overarching organ of management of the water to Level of basin. The functions of basin organizations have been alternated between the specific ones of development and more general of water management during the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/fpd/water/pdf/PineroGESTI%D3NDELAGUAENESPA%D1A.pdf|title=Pinero Campos, José María (nd). World Bank. pp. pp. 1-2. Consultado el 20 de mayo de 2008.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Blomquist, in a study of hydrographic confederations in 2005, shows that the formal structure of these organizations traditionally gives more weight to user groups for irrigation, leaving public or private organizations representing urban centers or environmental issues in a background. Similarly, some confederations continue to emphasize their advocacy tasks while adapting to fully manage, in a broad sense, their water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2005/03/06/000090341_20050306125008/Rendered/PDF/wps3526.pdf|title=Blomquist, William (et al.)

== Efficiency ==
A survey by the National Statistical Institute estimates the avereage level of [[non-revenue water]] at 24% 2007, including real (physical) losses of 16% and apparent losses due to undermetering and other factors of 8%.&lt;ref name="INE"/&gt;

== Tariffs and cost recovery ==
'''Tariff level.''' A survey commissioned by the utility association AEAS in 2009 showed that the average [[water tariff|tariff]] for water supply and sanitation was Euro 1.50/m3. On average, industrial users paid Euro 1.81/m3 and residential users Euro 1.40/m3.&lt;ref name="AEAS Tarifas"&gt;[http://iagua.es/acerca-de-iagua/ IAgua.es]:
[http://iagua.es/2010/01/informe-aeas-sobre-tarifas-y-precios-del-agua-en-espana/ Informe AEAS sobre “Tarifas y Precios del Agua en España”], January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the lowest water tariffs in the EU. There are large variations between cities and regions. The province with the highest average tariff are the Balearic Islands (Euro 2.65/m3) and the region with the lowest is [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]] (Euro 0.61/m3). The study commissioned by AEAS wants to shed light on the actual cost of water and make citizens aware of the need to pay the full costs of this service.&lt;ref name="AEAS Tarifas"/&gt; According to a survey carried out in 2009 by the Spanish consumer organization OCU the water bill was slightly higher than in the ANEAS survey at Euro 227 per year for a water consumption of 175 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the survey shows a slightly lower average water and sewer tariff at Euro 1.30/m3. The OCU survey also shows that annual bills vary substantially between cities, ranging from 112 to 413 Euro per year.&lt;ref name="OCU"/&gt; According to another survey, an international water tariff survey by the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), the annual water and sewer bill of a household using 200 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year was US$300 per year, or US$25 per month. This was the second lowest bill among 12 EU countries included in the survey.&lt;ref name="iwahq.org"/&gt;

'''Affordability.''' The AEAS study says that a cup of coffee costs as much as 2.3 days of water supply. The average water and sanitation bill of Euro 191 per year accounts for only 0.6% of household expenditures.&lt;ref name="AEAS Tarifas"/&gt;

'''Tariff structure.''' 92% of Spanish cities used increasing-block tariffs, i.e. the tariff per cubic meter increases as consumption increases.&lt;ref name="AEAS Tarifas"/&gt; Many cities had a large fixed fee that included a consumption of between 60 and 180 cubic meter per year, thus providing no financial incentive to save water below this level.&lt;ref name="OCU"/&gt;

'''Cost recovery.''' The Ministry of Environment estimates the cost recovery for water supply and sanitation at "between 50% and 90%". However, independent sources estimate it to be as low as 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:Spain faces call to double water tariffs, February 2010, quoting a presentation by Adrian Baltanás, director general of the lobby group Asagua and ex-head of public water company Acuamed, at a January 2010 conference on water pricing organized by AEAS&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment and financing ==
'''Investment.''' According to a blog on "Sustainable Spain", Spain spends €6,330 million annually on the capture, transport and extraction of underground water, plus water distribution and sanitation.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Spain"&gt;[http://sustainablespain.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/spain-cheap-water-gets-wasted/ Sustainable Spain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207184317/http://sustainablespain.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/spain-cheap-water-gets-wasted/ |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the industry association AGA estimates investments by its members, which supply water to 75% of the population, at "more than €290 million" annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.asoaga.org/ Asociación Española de Empresas Gestoras de los Servicios de Agua a Poblaciones (ASOAGA) Investment]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financing.''' The European Union is a major financier of the Spanish water and sanitation sector, both through grants by the [[European Commission]] and through loans from the [[European Investment Bank]]. Between 1986 and 2008 Spain received Euro 21 billion in EU funding for water infrastructure. However, European funding to Spain is set to fall by 40% in the period to 2013, compared with 2000-2006.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:Spain faces call to double water tariffs, February 2010, quoting José Luis Gonzalez, ex-director of Spain's European Commission representation&lt;/ref&gt; "Europe's generosity has contributed to the unsustainability of the Spanish water sector's economic model", says Enrique Cabrera of the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:Spain faces call to double water tariffs, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Investments are also financed through loans and bonds, such as a $500 million bond issue by Canal Isabel II in 2015.

}}

Water supply problems in [[Caleta Olivia]] occurred on 2014 (called the '''Thirst Days''') and culminated in a series of protests about the lack of water produced by the rupture of the aqueduct Jorge Carstens. The [[Sarmiento, Chubut|Sarmiento]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] and [[Rada Tilly]] areas of Argentina were affected. The water shortage began on the 10th of February with a rupture near ti Cerro Dragón (Dragon Hill). This issue left the area of [[San Jorge Gulf]] without water.

==Origin==
[[File:ZonasAgua.jpg|thumb|left|In red: areas where there was no water. In blue, areas where water was obtained from Cañadón Quintar and Meseta Espinoza.]]

Once the first breakdown at Cerro Dragón (Dragon Hill) was repaired on 11 February, the aqueduct broke again near Valle Hermoso (Beautiful valley). This issue created a longer-lasting lack of water that affected the area until 17 February. The moment that the pipes were refilled with drinking water new punctures and cracks appeared at the [[Caleta Olivia]] area. This issue mainly occurred because when pipes are not carrying water inside they tend to contract; once the pressure of water returns the expansion of the tubes makes them burst. 
From 1999 the aqueduct accumulated more than 550 cracks and punctures in its 77&amp;nbsp;km section from Cerro Arenales (Arenales Hill) to [[Caleta Olivia]]. This damage was mainly caused by the low-quality materials used in the construction of the aqueduct. In [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], the water supply is interrupted during weekends due to the high water consumption rates of industry, the [[Argentine Army]], and the local population.

==Dispute==
[[File:Caleta escasez33.jpg|thumb|left|Mayor José Córdoba's speech.]]
[[File:Caleta corte.jpeg|thumb|Traffic jams cause by the road blockades.]]
[[File:Caleta agua.jpeg|thumb|Alternative roads used by drivers to avoid blockades.]]  
[[File:Caleta escasez15.jpg|thumb|Protests in front of the Town Hall.]]

The State Society of Public Services ("Servicios Públicos Sociedad del Estado" in Spanish) gave very little information about the incident. This provoked some 3,000 self-motivated people to protest, calling for the restoration of the precious water supply. The picketers carried banners, blocked streets and avenues, the Town Hall and the National Road number 3 (RN 3) at the city's northern access. The residents who took part in the protest were demanding action from the Mayor to solve the problem. Most of the population had to use seawater to clean up their homes. 
After the debate between the Mayor and the people it was decided to keep the RN 3 blockade (main communication road for the east Patagonian region) until the governor of the [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], [[Daniel Peralta]] reached [[Caleta Olivia]] to find a definitive solution to the conflict.
Other problems were exacerbated by the lack of water: sewer systems collapsed, there was a lack of public transport, banks and public offices closed, hospitals provided just minimum services, and production at a few oil wells halted due to the strikes.

==Aqueduct==

The Jorge Carstens aqueduct promised 100 years of proper operation, with a capacity of 115 million litres per day. Since 1999 the issues that troubled normal functionality were:
* Population increased (from 36,077 to 68,691).
* Water volume flow increased (from 2,600,000 to 22,000,000).
* Poor and defective pipe material.
* Sabotage.
* Poor system administration. 
* Delays in the construction of a parallel aqueduct to ease the problem.
* Filed promise to build a new aqueduct to bring water from [[General Carrera Lake|Lake Buenos Aires]] to supply the northern region of [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]] with water.
This aqueduct area is usually visible from the Comodoro Rivadavia – Caleta Olivia motorway, which connects around 300,000 inhabitants, so every time a puncture occurs it is easy to locate. 
In 2013 an agreement was signed to improve the regional aqueduct system from [[Musters Lake]] – [Comodoro Rivadavia] – [[Rada Tilly]] – [[Caleta Olivia]].
The company responsible for this was the National Entity for Hydrological and Sanitation Works (in Spanish, "ENOHSA"). Mr. Lucio Tamburo presented the plans for the parallel aqueduct, assuring that it was estimated to be finished in between August and September.
The plan he suggested was:
* Replacement of 46 kilometres of pipe (PRFV DN 600 and 700&amp;nbsp;mm).
* Improvement of 5 pumping stations.
* A new water-treatment plant. 
* An increase of 45% in drinking water production.
* Dragon Hill – Arenales Hill section: A third parallel pipe with PRFV DN 500, 400 y 350&amp;nbsp;mm.
* Sarmiento – Black Hill section: New 25&amp;nbsp;km piping with a diameter in between 600&amp;nbsp;mm to 700&amp;nbsp;mm.

==Emergency==

On the 15th of February, due to the demonstrations and the lack of water, the Council declared the city under a state of "hydric emergency". After this [[Daniel Peralta]] and the local government declared the same state for the entire province.
The long lasting emergency caused the [[Argentine Army]] to increase efforts to supply the city population with drinking water.
The local people, together with some local authorities, requested that the provincial government upgrade the status to [[disaster area]].

==Responses==

The cabinet chief [[Jorge Capitanich]] said that "there were eight ruptures" in the aqueduct which "has issues and ruptures that are in process to be repaired, in the majority of districts".{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}}
The governor [[Daniel Peralta]] declared the city in water emergency on behalf of the province and said that he would request authorization from the legislature to draw credit for $140,000,000 to buy equipment, to build an aqueduct for the water wells at Cañadón Seco ("Dry Ravine") and for the construction of a [reverse osmosis plant] that will generate 5,000,000 litres of water per day. Fernando Cotillo, the vice-governor, criticised the townsfolk for their complaints and said that the roadblocks were doing no good to the problem; he also visited the affected area. 
The mayor of [[Caleta Olivia]], José Manuel Córdoba, denied rumours of resignation and he criticised the people who took part in the RN 3 roadblock. He also announced that 900,000 m³ of water was to be distributed using 17 trucks. The city councillor Juan Erwin Bolívar Acuña Kunz said that he would ask for reports if the solutions did not reach the city. MP Estela Bubola criticised the government; she said that it was obscene to expend more than $20,000,000 on a party at [[El Calafate]] while in Caleta Olivia there is no water. She requested an urgent session for the provincial council legislature in Caleta Olivia. She also criticized the mayor of El Calafate.
The provincial education council suspended all school activities for all of February at Caleta Olivia, Cañadón Seco, Jaramillo and Fitz Roy. ENOHSA informed on 20 February that the parallel aqueduct construction was 20% completed. 
The Council workers and employees union and the private oil workers of the Santa Cruz union requested the authorities to "face the problem". The secretary of the latest union also complained about the oil drilling companies. The Council Assembly for Civil Protection wrote a letter to the governor requesting "his prompt intervention".
Omar Latini, the head of the [[Workers' Party (Argentina)|Workers Party]] in Santa Cruz laid a charge of "unfulfillment of public servant duties"{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}} against the mayor, governor and his cabinet.
A group of local people endorsed a request demanding the presence of Governor Peralta and requested to the Council an impeachment for the local mayor.

==Aid==
[[File:Caleta escasez9.jpg|thumb|5000 m3 reserve located at [[YPF]] fields.]]

[[File:CaletaEscasez101.jpg|thumb|[[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] deployed at the north access.]]
Due to the lack of water in the city, several companies, shops, unions and organizations sent bottled water and food to the city. A description of some of them is below:
* La Anónima supermarket made a donation of 4,000 litres of bottled mineral water.
* The oil company Instalex distributed 5,500 litres using a company truck.
* The 86 battalion "Aonikenk" of the Argentinean explorers of Don Bosco, collaborated with the General direction for Civil Protection for area XI, taking care of calls, receipt of goods, unloading and delivery of drinking water drums.
* The Union Front for a Better Living ([[Radical Civic Union]]) began a campaign to help the city to collect drinking water from several province towns.
* Several stores collaborated in the distribution of food to the people that were blocking the roads. 
* Several cities from the [San Jorge Gulf] Basin offered tanker trucks to be used in Caleta Olivia; two from each of [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], [[Perito Moreno, Santa Cruz|Perito Moreno]], [[Pico Truncado]], and one from [[Río Gallegos]].
* YPF donated 6,000 litres of drinking water in 8 litres drums, and also added several tanker trucks from different services companies from Comodoro Rivadavia, Pico Truncado and Las Heras.
* The Teacher's Union (in Spanish, "ADOSAC") donated bottled water at their filial in Caleta Olivia.
* New Generation FM, from [[Pico Truncado]] donated 92,000 litres of drinking water for the Pedro Tardivo Hospital.
* [[Radical Civic Union]] councilors from [[Los Antiguos]], Pico Truncado and Las Heras made donations of water and they also presented demands about the water problem.
* The center of the students from Santa Cruz in [[La Plata]] participated in a collection of drinking water that was sent to the affected city.

===Argentine Army===

* The regiment of Mechanized Infantry 8 collaborated with 4,000 litres of drinking water and trucks to assist in the distribution.
* Use of a water purification plant located at Novosel fields to supply the Zona de Chacras area and settlements. 
* Use of a [[reverse osmosis plant]] (for desalination) brought from [[Bahía Blanca]], installed on the 23rd of February in the area of Caleta Paula port, 14 marines and personnel from the ministry were taking care of the coordination of the resources deployment. 
*The Mechanic Brigade Command sent 7 troops with 3 [[Water purification|water purifiers]] (one as reserve) with a production capacity of 10,000 litres of drinking water per hour. These purification stations were placed at La Laurita area, located 25 kilometers from the city; there all the processes of extraction, purification and distribution were performed.  
* Until the 22nd of February 29 trucks were involved in the water distribution.

'''Ya ba''' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:ยาบ้า|ยาบ้า]]}}, {{lang-lo|ຢາບ້າ}}, literally "mad drug"), formerly known as '''ya ma''' ({{lang-th|[[:wikt:ยาม้า|ยาม้า]]}}; literally "horse drug"), are tablets containing a mixture of [[methamphetamine]] and [[caffeine]].&lt;ref name=NDIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaba Fast Facts|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs5/5048/index.htm|website=US National Drug Intelligence Center|publisher=National Drug Intelligence Center|accessdate=2014-11-13|date=Jun 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
"From ya khayan (hard-working pill) in its early days to ya maa (horse medicine), the drug was named ya ba (crazy pill) in 1996".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glahan|first1=Surasak|title=Time we shook off meth's criminal stigma|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/time-we-shook-off-meths-criminal-stigma/1015605|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=21 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given to horses when pulling carts up steep hills and for other strenuous work in [[Shan State]]. The slang terms for ya ba in Burma are  "kyethi" (literally, "button"), "athi", and "palarkar".

Ya ba is sometimes called "bhul bhuliya" in India. The name commonly used for it in the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]] is "shabú". In north Thailand it is often referred to as "chocalee" due to the somewhat sweet taste ya ba leaves in the mouth and its strong chocolate smell.&lt;ref&gt;"Drugs Inc. Bangkok Ice" S7/Ep19 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The name commonly used for it in China is "ma-goo" or "ma-guo". In Bangladesh, it's colloquially known as "baba", "guti", "laal", "khawon", "loppy", "bichi" etc.

In Northeast India, especially Manipur, a major trade route of drugs, it is commonly called Y(wai), Angangba/Lal (red), Katha, Prithibi, Maru, WY etc.

==Appearance and use==
Ya ba is typically produced in a round pill form. There are many different versions of ya ba, and the most common are red, orange, or lime green in color and carry logos such as "R" or "WY". They are small and round, roughly {{convert|6|mm}} in diameter (similar size to [[Smint]] but round), which means they can be packed inside a plastic soda straw for easy transportation or in a reusable "mint" container. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Ya ba tablets typically are consumed orally. Another common method is called "[[chasing the dragon]]". Users place the ya ba tablet on aluminum foil and heat it from below. As the tablet melts, vapors rise and are inhaled. The drug also may be administered by crushing the tablets into powder, which is then snorted or mixed with a solvent and injected.&lt;ref name=NDIC /&gt; When swallowed in pill form the duration of the drug's effect is between 8–16 hours, as compared to 1–3 hours when smoked, while the intensity is considerably reduced. The peak of the drug's effect is followed by a come down period lasting 6–10 hours, during which the user may have difficulty sleeping or eating. Many users report that it takes them up to 24 hours after consumption to be able to fall asleep.

Ya ba is not commonly injected as many intravenous users favour the pure product instead (methamphetamine, called "ice" in Southeast Asia). This illegal drug is especially popular in Thailand, where it is imported from Burma or Laos even though it is sometimes manufactured locally in Thailand.

Typical ya ba users are working males, aged 16–40 years old, and its use is not uncommon among both female and male sex workers in Thailand and Cambodia.

==Suppliers==
[[Burma]] (Myanmar) is the largest producer of methamphetamine in the world, with the majority of ya ba found in Thailand being produced in Burma, particularly in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] and northeastern [[Shan State]], which borders Thailand, Laos, and China.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/279434/myanmar-reforms-mask-meteoric-rise-in-drug-trade|title=Myanmar's rising drug trade|last=Thornton|first=Phil|date=12 February 2012|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Burma trafficked 1&amp;nbsp;billion tablets to neighboring Thailand.&lt;ref name="thornton"/&gt; Ethnic militias and rebel groups (in particular the [[United Wa State Army]]) are responsible for much of this production; however, the Burmese military units are believed to be heavily involved in the trafficking of the drugs.&lt;ref name="thornton"/&gt;

==Rise and fall in popularity in Thailand==
Ya ba tablets were formerly sold at gas stations and were commonly used by long-haul drivers to stay awake. After many horrific long-distance bus accidents, they were outlawed by the Thai government in 1970. The deposed Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s campaign from 2003 to eliminate drug-trafficking further helped to curtail widespread use. In particular, use of the drug by bus drivers and truckers is not as widespread as it was in the 1980s.

As a result of the Thai government crackdown, restricted supply has had an effect on prices, further curtailing the popular use of ya ba. In 1999–2000, when buying a straw-full (around 20 pills) in Chiang Rai Province, north Thailand, ya ba was sold for around 10 [[Thai baht|baht]] per pill and commonly used on the go-go circuit and by young "MTV" clubbers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Retail prices have risen{{When|date=July 2010}} from 100–150 baht (US$3–4) to 250–450 baht per pill as a result of the crackdown, though it remains a popular party drug.

In 2000, ya ba was smuggled across the porous border with [[Myanmar]] and from the neighbouring Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai Provinces of Thailand. Illegal traffickers often marketed or promoted their product by claiming that the pills contained up to six percent [[heroin]]. Rumour suggested it was produced by the corrupt personnel of [[United Wa State Army|Wa State Army]] in Burma.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2014, it was reported that Thailand's northeast provinces have seen a 700 percent increase in the number of people arrested for meth since 2008, according to data from the Narcotics Suppression Bureau.&lt;ref name=AJ1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Presser|first1=Lizzie|title=Drug Addiction Grows on Thai Rubber Farms|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/11/drug-addiction-grows-thai-rubber-farms-2014113074454777879.html|accessdate=2014-12-02|agency=Al Jazeera|date=2014-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, authorities counted more than 33,000 meth-related arrests in the northeast. The rapid growth of ya ba use in [[Isan]] mirrors that which is occurring across Asia, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of global amphetamine-type stimulant users.
&lt;ref name=AJ1 /&gt;

On 16 June 2016, the [[National Council for Peace and Order]], the [[military junta]] ruling Thailand, stated that it was planning to decriminalise ya ba in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/justice-minister-ya-ba-excluded-list-narcotic-drugs/ | date = 2016-06-16 | accessdate = 2016-06-17 | publisher = [[Thai PBS]] | location = Bangkok | title = Justice Minister: ya ba should be excluded from list of narcotic drugs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Thailand is moving closer to decriminalizing meth|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-07/thailand-moving-closer-decriminalizing-meth|accessdate=30 October 2016|publisher=Public Radio International (PRI)|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==
In 2006, ya ba ma consumption became fashionable for the well{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Although the extent of ya ba abuse in [[Bangladesh]] is not precisely known, seizures of the drug by authorities are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanaul|first1=Islam Tipu|title=Bail rejected, 'Yaba king' Amyn Huda in jail|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/law-amp-rights/2013/jun/03/bail-rejected-%E2%80%98yaba-king%E2%80%99-amyn-huda-jail|accessdate=2014-11-13|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|date=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed those who use it on a regular basis are frequently involved in the distribution of the drug, either directly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnionline.net/index.php/feature/kaladan/12209-smuggling-of-yaba-tablets-increasing-day-by-day-in-bangladesh.html |title=Smuggling of Yaba tablets increasing day-by-day in Bangladesh |publisher=Bnionline.net |date=2011-12-04 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly known in Bangladesh as "khaon", "pill", "Laal", "BABA", "gari", "Chakka", "guti", and "bori", among other street names.&lt;ref name="unodc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/scientific/Global_SMART_UpdateV1_web.pdf|date=24 February 2009|title=Newsletter_Feb232009_final.pdf|author=Kunnen|accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugees are hired by Burmese drug dealers to smuggle yaba from Myanmar into Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairsthetroublewiththengarchar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kullab|first1=Samya|title=The Trouble With Thengar Char|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/bangladesh/2017-02-23/trouble-thengar-char?cid=nlc-fatoday-20170224&amp;sp_mid=53497385&amp;sp_rid=dmljdG9yLnN0ZXBpZW5AZ21haWwuY29tS0|work=Foreign Affairs|date=23 February 2017|accessdate=2017-02-25}} {{subscription required|via=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 359 Rohingyas were arrested on yaba-smuggling charges, and up to $29 million worth of yaba was seized by the Bangladeshi authorities.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairsthetroublewiththengarchar"/&gt;

In October 2018 Bangladesh government drafted a law which punishes a person up to capital punishment who carries minimum 200 gm ya ba.

In February 2010 it was reported that increasingly large quantities of ya ba were being smuggled into [[Israel]] by [[Thai people|Thai]] migrant workers, leading to fears that its use would spread to the Israeli club scene, where ecstasy use is already common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lappin|first1=Yaakov|title='Nazi speed' smuggled in huge amounts|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Nazi-speed-smuggled-in-huge-amounts|accessdate=2014-11-13|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has also been used by immigrant populations in the [[United States]], and occasionally as a club drug replacing [[MDMA|ecstasy]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Long-term effects==
{{main|Methamphetamine#Side effects}}
The majority of long term effects associated with ya ba are analogous with those of methamphetamine, as ya ba mainly consists of caffeine and methamphetamine.
