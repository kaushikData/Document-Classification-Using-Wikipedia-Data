'''''3D&amp;T''''', formerly known as "Defensores de Tóquio", is a [[Brazil]]ian [[tabletop role-playing game]], created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]]. It is designed to be a very simple, beginner-friendly game system.

==History==

=== Origin ===
The name of the game is a pun on the famous ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' or "D&amp;D"; the original version of the game – ''Defensores de Tóquio'' ("Defenders of Tokyo") – was a satire of [[tokusatsu]], [[fighting game]]s, and [[anime]] series. It was created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]] and published by Trama Editorial, later known as Editora Talismã. It spawned "AD&amp;T" - as implied by the name, an "advanced" edition (and a pun on [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]]). Finally, "3D&amp;T" means "Defenders of Tokyo 3rd edition". The major change on the 3rd edition was that it was turned into a [[generic game]], dropping its satire roots. It was a huge success, becoming as popular as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' among Brazilian roleplayers.

An even simpler version, like [[GURPS Lite]] called "3D&amp;T Fastplay", was made freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731015325/http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 July 2008|title=Dragão Brasil -- Site Oficial da Revista Dragão Brasil|date=31 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revision, "3D&amp;T Manual Revisado, Ampliado e Turbinado", was released in 2003.

Dissatisfied with the poor management at Talismã – also publishers of RPG magazine ''Dragão Brasil'', of which he was editor-in-chief – Marcelo Cassaro left to start a new RPG magazine, ''RPG Master'' for Mythos Editora, a magazine entirely dedicated to 3D&amp;T (although the news releases for other systems)&lt;ref&gt;Talu (June 27, 2005), [http://www.rederpg.com.br/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2864 RPGMaster #01 - Tópico a Tópico] RedeRPG&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after, ''Dragon Slayer'', fully devoted to the [[d20 System]]; meanwhile, Talismã kept publishing 3D&amp;T, despite ''not'' having the rights to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226213310/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=26 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ''Dragon Slayer'' was very successful and remains in print, while Talismã closed their doors.

===4D&amp;T===
As a successor to 3D&amp;T, a new system named 4D&amp;T was published in 2006 by [[Editora JBC]] (Brazilian publisher of manga). It completely dropped 3D&amp;T's own fast, in this the player uses 4 [[six-sided dice]]. The book was published under the [[Open Game License]]. This edition is itself a change of the [[d20 System]], but with six-sided dice.

Although it has succeeded on its own, it has been poorly received by 3D&amp;T players, given the original purpose of the system was to be as simple as possible.

===3D&amp;T Alpha===
In May 2008, Cassaro was told by Guilherme Dei Svaldi, editor-in-chief at Jambô Editora, that he found 3D&amp;T to remain very popular, despite being out of print for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115044514/http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This surprised Cassaro, and gave him the idea of bringing 3D&amp;T back; it was released again in September 2008, under the name "3D&amp;T Alpha"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223231244/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=23 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the new name inspired by ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', which Cassaro and [[Erica Awano]] had adapted into a 4-issue comic book series published by Trama in 1998/99&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fenixdown.com.br/2011/11/gamics-002/&lt;/ref&gt;). It is also available as a free [[e-book]] from Jambô's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724101436/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |archive-date=2010-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new version, the combat rules remain basically the same; the advantage/disadvantage system was fine-tuned; and, most importantly, the magic system was completely revamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122142930/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |archive-date=2008-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, now the book is printed in [[Page orientation|landscape]] format.

In 2010 the first major setting for 3D&amp;T Alpha was announced: '''Mega City,''' by Gustavo Brauner. It was finally published in mid-2012, bringing as setting a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] in which five different smaller settings coexist: 
*'''''Super Mega City''''' (featuring superheroes and supervillains, similar to characters from [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]])
*'''''Torneio das Sombras''''' (''Tournament of the Shadows'', featuring martial artists similar to the ones in video games like [[Street Fighter]], [[Tekken]] and [[The King of Fighters]])
*'''''Megadroide''''' (''Megadroid'', featuring characters equipped with futuristic technology inspired in Japanese pop culture like [[Mega Man]] and [[Astro Boy]]; a later handbook expanded this setting to include references to [[Mecha]] and [[Tokusatsu]] genres)
*'''''Crônicas de Nova Memphis''''' (''Nova Memphis Chronicles'', featuring supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves, angels and demons, similar to the [[World of Darkness]] RPG setting)
*'''''Mega City Contra-Ataca''''' (''Mega City Strikes Back'', featuring regular people such as police officers, scientists, athletes and journalists among several other occupations, for more realistic adventures)
'''Mega City''' allows to either choose one of the smaller settings to play, or to combine some of them (or even all of them), teaching how to balance the different kinds of characters.

A second major setting was released in the same year: '''Brigada Ligeira Estelar''' ''(Star Light Brigade),'' by Alexandre Lancaster. It's a [[mecha]]/[[space opera]]/[[swashbuckling]] setting, bringing an empire spread in seventeen solar systems that together form the '''Constellation of Sabre''' – main target of invaders from outer space called ''The Forsaken,'' while the empire itself is divided by political intrigue. ''Brigada'' brings a heavy influence of classic sci-fi anime like [[Mobile Suit Gundam]], [[Captain Harlock]], [[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]] and [[Star Blazers]], having as player characters [[mecha]] ace pilots, [[space pirates]], space [[condottieri]], swashbuckling [[noblemen]] and others.

== Overview ==
A game aimed at beginners, 3D&amp;T focus on simplicity and ease of play.

As in [[GURPS]], each character is built with a pre-determined number of "points" (typically 5) to distribute between the main stats, magic power and advantages and disadvantages.

There are 5 stats:
* "Força" - Strength (which does not only measures the physical might of the character but also skill in melee combat)
* "Habilidade" - Ability (which measures manual dextery, speed and mental abilities)
* "Resistência" - Resistance (which measures the "health" of the character, and defines its Hit Points)
* "Armadura" - Armor (which measures how well the character can protect him/herself)
* "Poder de Fogo" - Firepower (which measures skill with ranged attacks - anything from firearms to bows and throwing daggers)

The magical powers of characters are defined by "Elemental Paths" ("Caminhos Elementais", in the original), which measure how well the mage can control the elements - there are 6 "Elemental Paths": Fire ("Fogo"), Water ("Água"), Earth ("Terra"), Air ("Ar"), Light ("Luz") and Darkness ("Trevas").

Advantages and disadvantages are special powers which characters can possess; advantages cost points, and disadvantages ''give'' more points to spend. Finally, there is also a special kind of advantages, called "skills" ("Perícias"), which are things that your character can do, but with no relation to combat: "Animals","Arts", "Crime", "Investigation","Languages", "Machines","Manipulation", "Medicine", "Science","Sports" and "Survival."

'''Amoha''' (Sanskrit, Pali; Tibetan Wylie: ''gti mug med pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "non-delusion"  or "non-bewilderment". It is defined as being without delusion concerning what is true, due to discrimination; its function is to cause one to not engage in unwholesome actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 542-544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is non-deludedness? It is a thorough comprehension of (practical) knowledge that comes from maturation, instructions, thinking and understanding, and its function is to provide a basis for not becoming involved in evil behavior.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

[[Herbert Guenther]] states:
: It is a distinct discriminatory awareness to counteract the deludedness that has its cause in either what one has been born into or what one has acquired.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

A '''baronet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|r|ə|n|ɪ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|r|ə|ˌ|n|ɛ|t}};&lt;ref name="Collins 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/baronet?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Baronet|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviated '''Bart''' or '''Bt'''&lt;ref name="Collins 1"/&gt;) or the rare female equivalent, a '''baronetess''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|r|ə|n|ɪ|t|ɪ|s}},&lt;ref name="Randome House 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/baronetess|title=Baronetess|publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged|accessdate=15 August 2016|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|r|ə|n|ɪ|t|ɛ|s}},&lt;ref name="OED 1"&gt;{{Cite OED|baronetess}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|r|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|ɛ|s}};&lt;ref name="Collins 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/baronetess?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Baronetess|publisher=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation '''Btss'''), is the holder of a '''baronetcy''', a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by [[James VI and I|James I of England]] in 1611 as a means of raising funds.

A baronetcy is the only British hereditary honour that is not a [[peerages in the United Kingdom | peerage]], with the exception of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Knight of Glin|Black Knight]], [[White Knight (Fitzgibbon family)|White Knight]] and [[Knight of Kerry|Green Knight]] (of which only the Green Knight is extant). A baronet is addressed as "Sir" (just as is a [[knight]]) or "Dame" in the case of a baronetess but ranks above all knighthoods and damehoods in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]], except for the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]], and the dormant [[Order of St Patrick]]. Baronets are conventionally seen to belong to the lesser nobility even though [[William Thoms]] claims that "The precise quality of this dignity is not yet fully determined, some holding it to be the head of the ''nobiles minores'', while others, again, rank Baronets as the lowest of the ''nobiles majores'', because their honour, like that of the higher nobility, is both hereditary and created by patent."&lt;ref&gt;William J. Thoms (1844). The Book of the Court (2nd edition). London: Henry G. Bohn, York Street, Covent Garden, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons with continental titles and ranks are tenuous due to the British system of [[primogeniture]] and the fact that claims to baronetcies must be proven; currently the [[Official Roll of the Baronetage]] is overseen by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]. In practice this means that the UK Peerage and Baronetage consists of about 2000 families (some Peers are also Baronets), which is roughly 0.01% of UK families. In some continental countries the [[nobility]] consisted of about 5% of the population, and in most countries titles are no longer recognised or regulated by the state.

==History of the term==
The term ''baronet'' has medieval origins. [[Thomas de la Moore|Sir Thomas de La More]], describing the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]], mentioned that baronets took part, along with barons and knights.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, Vol. II, Part IV, p 303&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward III]] is known to have created eight baronets in 1328; further creations were made in 1340, 1446 and 1551. At least one, Sir William de La Pole in 1340, was created for payment of money.  Whether or not these early creations were hereditary, all have died out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baronetage.org/a-short-history/ "A Short History"], Standing Council of the Baronetage website&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day Baronets date from 1611 when [[James VI and I|James I]] granted [[Letters Patent]] to 200 gentlemen of good birth with an income of at least £1,000 a year; in return for the honour, each was required to pay for the upkeep of thirty soldiers for three years amounting to £1,095, in those days a very large sum. In 1619 James I established the [[Baronetage of Ireland]]; [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625 created the Baronetages of [[Baronetage of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[List of baronetcies in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia]]. The new baronets were each required to pay 2,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] or to support six colonial settlers for two years. Over a hundred of these baronetcies, now familiarly known as Scottish baronetcies, survive to this day. 

As a result of the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, all future creations were styled [[Baronetage of Great Britain|baronets of Great Britain]].  Following the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, new creations were styled as [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom|baronets of the United Kingdom]]. 

Under [[Warrant (law)|royal warrant]]s of 1612 and 1613, certain privileges were accorded to baronets. Firstly, no person or persons should have place between baronets and the younger sons of peers. Secondly, the right of [[knighthood]] was established for the eldest sons of baronets (this was later revoked by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1827), and thirdly, baronets were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the [[Coat of arms|Arms]] of [[Ulster]] on an [[inescutcheon]]: "in a field Argent, a Hand [[gules|Geules]] (or a bloudy hand)". These privileges were extended to baronets of Ireland, and for baronets of Scotland the privilege of depicting the Arms of Nova Scotia as an augmentation of honour. The former applies to this day for all baronets of Great Britain and of the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] created subsequently.

The title of baronet was initially conferred upon [[nobility|noblemen]] who lost the right of [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|individual summons to Parliament]], and was used in this sense in a [[statute]] of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. A similar title of lower rank was [[banneret]].

Since 1965 only one new baronetcy has been created, for [[Sir Denis Thatcher]] on 7 December 1990, husband of a former British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]] (''later'' Baroness Thatcher); their eldest son, [[Sir Mark Thatcher]], succeeded as 2nd Baronet upon his father's death in 2003.

==Conventions==
Like knights, baronets are accorded the style "[[Sir]]" before their first name. Baronetesses in their own right use "[[Dame (title)|Dame]]", also before their first name, while wives of baronets use "[[Lady]]" followed by the husband's (marital) surname only, this by longstanding courtesy. Wives of baronets are not baronetesses; only women holding baronetcies [[Suo jure|in their own right]] are so styled.

Unlike knighthoods&amp;nbsp;– which apply to the recipient only&amp;nbsp;– a baronetcy is hereditarily entailed. The eldest son of a baronet who is born in wedlock succeeds to a baronetcy upon his father's death, but will not be officially recognised until his name is recognised by being placed on the Official Roll. With some exceptions granted with special remainder by letters patent, baronetcies descend through the male line.

A full list of extant baronets appears in ''[[Burke's Peerage and Baronetage]]'', which also published a record of extinct baronetcies.

A baronetcy is not a peerage, so baronets like knights and junior members of peerage families are [[commoner]]s and not [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]] ([[Nota bene|N.B.]], in the UK, all people save the Sovereign and peers are considered commoners{{cn|date=March 2018}}). According to the Home Office there is a tangible benefit to the honour of baronet: according to law, a baronet is entitled to have "a pall supported by two men, a principal mourner and four others" assisting at his funeral. Originally baronets also had other rights, including the right to have the eldest son knighted on his 21st birthday. However, at the beginning of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]'s reign, these rights were eroded by Orders-in-Council on the grounds that Sovereigns should not necessarily be bound by [[Acts of Parliament|acts]] made by their predecessors. Baronets although never having been automatically entitled to heraldic [[supporter]]s, were allowed them in heredity in the first half of the 19th century where the title holder was also a Knight Grand Cross of a Crown order.

Baronets of Scotland or Nova Scotia were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the Arms of Nova Scotia and the privilege of wearing a neck badge signifying "of Nova Scotia", suspended by an orange-tawny ribbon. This consists of an escutcheon Argent with a Saltire Azure, an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland, with an Imperial Crown above the escutcheon, and encircled with the motto ''Fax Mentis Honestae Gloria''. This badge may be shown suspended by the ribbon below the escutcheon.

Baronets of England and Ireland applied to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] for permission to wear a badge. Although a badge was worn in the 17th century, it was not until 1929 that [[George V|King George V]] granted permission for all baronets (other than those of Scotland) to wear badges.

===Addressing a baronet and the wife of a baronet===
A baronet is referred to and addressed as, for example, "Sir &lt;Joseph&gt;" (using his forename). The correct style on an envelope for a baronet who has no other titles is "Sir &lt;Joseph Bloggs&gt;, Bt." or "Sir &lt;Joseph Bloggs&gt;, Bart."  The letter would commence: "Dear Sir &lt;Joseph&gt;".

The wife of a baronet is addressed and referred to as "Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;"; at the head of a letter as "Dear Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;". Her given name is used only when necessary to distinguish between two holders of the same title. For example, if a baronet has died and the title has passed to his son, the widow (the new baronet's mother) will remain "Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;" if he (the son) is unmarried or never marries, but if he is married or becomes married then his wife becomes "Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;" while his mother will be known by the style "&lt;Alice&gt;, Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;". Alternatively, the mother may prefer to be known as "The [[Dowager]] Lady &lt;Bloggs&gt;". A previous wife will also become "&lt;Alice&gt;, Lady Bloggs" to distinguish her from the current wife of the incumbent baronet. She would not be "Lady &lt;Alice&gt; &lt;Bloggs&gt;", a style reserved for the daughters of Dukes, Marquesses and Earls. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/baronet/family-of-a-baronet.aspx Debrett's Correct Form. Addressing the family of a Baronet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815141938/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/baronet/family-of-a-baronet.aspx |date=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The children of a baronet are not entitled to the use of any [[courtesy title]]s.

==Baronetess: History and forms of address==
For a baronetess one should write "Dame &lt;Daisy Smith&gt;, Btss" on the envelope. At the head of the letter, one would write "Dear Dame &lt;Daisy&gt;," and to refer to her, one would say "Dame &lt;Daisy&gt;" or "Dame &lt;Daisy Smith&gt;" (never "Dame &lt;Smith&gt;").

In history there have been only four baronetesses:

* [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Daisy Dunbar, 8th Btss]] of Hempriggs (1906–97), cr. 1706;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsD3.htm Leigh Rayment's baronetage: Draper to Dymoke]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Witham|Dame Mary Bolles, 1st Btss (''née'' Witham)]] (1579–1662); the only woman apparently to be ''created'' a baronetess (of Nova Scotia);&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924092524382 ''Cokayne's Complete Baronetage'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dalyell baronets|Dame Eleanor Dalyell, 10th Btss]] (1895–1972) (cr. 1685), whose title and estate of [[The Binns]] passed to her son, the former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Tam Dalyell|Tam Dalyell &lt;small&gt;MP&lt;/small&gt;]] (who chose not to use the title);
* [[Stirling-Maxwell baronets|Dame Anne Maxwell Macdonald, 11th Btss]] (1906–2011) was recognised by the [[Lyon Court]] in 2005 as 11th holder of the baronetcy (formerly Stirling-Maxwell) under the 1707 remainder and succeeded her father in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;(See page B 599 of the Baronetage section of the latest edition of Debrett.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 [[James Grant (officer of arms)|Lord Lyon King of Arms]] stated that, without examining the patent of every Scottish baronetcy, he was not in a position to confirm that only these four title creations could pass through female lines.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

{{As of|2016}}, there are no living baronetesses.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Territorial designations==
All baronetcies are created with a [[territorial designation|territorial sub-designation]], however only more recent creations duplicating the original creation require [[territorial designation]]s. So, for example, there are baronetcies Moore of Colchester, Moore of Hancox, Moore of Kyleburn, and Moore of Moore Lodge.

==Heraldic badges==

===Red Hand of Ulster===
Baronets of England, Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom (''i.e.'' all except [[Baronet of Nova Scotia|baronets of Nova Scotia]]) can display the [[Red Hand of Ulster]] ([[dexter and sinister|sinister]] (left) hand version) as a heraldic badge, being the arms of the ancient [[Kingdom of Ulster|kings of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 1741, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; This badge (or augmentation of honour) is [[blazon]]ed as follows: ''Argent a Hand sinister couped at the wrist extended in pale Gules''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Arthur, ''The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the English Baronets now Existing'', Volume 4, London, 1741, p.287 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KmUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=hand+sinister+couped+at+the+wrist+extended+in+pale+gules&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AcGmDGehFv&amp;sig=AoWv76JgaueM_lf797ujAIXnc30&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hand%20sinister%20couped%20at%20the%20wrist%20extended%20in%20pale%20gules&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; King James I of England established the hereditary Order of Baronets in England on 22 May 1611, in the words of [[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|''Collins' Peerage'']] (1741): "for the plantation and protection of the whole Kingdom of Ireland, but more especially for the defence and security of the Province of Ulster, and therefore for their distinction those of this order and their descendants may bear the badge (Red Hand of Ulster) in their [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] either in [[Canton (heraldry)|canton]] or an [[inescutcheon|escutcheon]] at their election".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 1741, vol.4, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1929 such baronets may also display the Red Hand of Ulster on its own as a [[badge (heraldry)|badge]], suspended by a ribbon below the shield of arms.&lt;ref name="Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1235"&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1235&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms of Nova Scotia===
Baronets of Nova Scotia, unlike other baronets, do not use the [[Red Hand of Ulster|Baronet's Badge (of Ulster)]], but have their own badge showing the [[Coat of arms of Nova Scotia|escutcheon of the arms of Nova Scotia]]: ''Argent, a Saltire Azure with an [[inescutcheon]] of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]]''. From before 1929 to the present it has been customary practice for such baronets to display this badge on its own suspended by the [[Honour|order's]] ribbon below the shield of arms.&lt;ref name="Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1235"/&gt;

The first publication listing all baronetcies ever created was C. J. Parry's ''Index of Baronetcy Creations'' (1967). This listed them in alphabetical order, other than the last five creations ([[Dodds baronets|Dodds of West Chillington]], [[Redmayne baronets|Redmayne of Rushcliffe]], [[Pearson baronets|Pearson of Gressingham]], [[Finlay baronets|Finlay of Epping]] and [[Thatcher baronets|Thatcher of Scotney]]). It showed the total number created from 1611 to 1964 to have been 3,482. They include five of [[Oliver Cromwell]], several of which were recreated by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Twenty-five were created between 1688 and 1784 by [[James II of England|James II]] in exile after his dethronement, by his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart ("The Old Pretender")]] and his grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward Stuart ("Bonny Prince Charlie")]]. These "Jacobite baronetcies" were never accepted by the English Crown, have all disappeared and should properly be excluded from the 3,482, making the effective number of creations 3,457. A close examination of Parry's publication shows he missed one or two,&lt;ref name="Lindsay Baronetage"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Baronetage, 2nd edition|author=Sir Martin Lindsay of Dowhill, Bt|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; so there may well have been some more.

As of 2000, including baronetcies where succession was dormant or unproven, there was a total of 1,314 baronetcies divided into five classes of creation included on ''The [[Official Roll of the Baronetage]]''&amp;nbsp;– 146 of England, 63 of Ireland, 119 of Scotland, 133 of Great Britain and 853 of the United Kingdom. 

The total number of baronetcies today is approximately 1,204, although only some 1,020 are on ''The Official Roll of the Baronetage''.&lt;ref name="Lindsay Baronetage"/&gt; It is unknown whether some baronetcies remain extant and it may be that nobody can prove himself to be the actual heir. Over 200 baronetcies are now held by peers and others, such as the Knox line, have been made tenuous due to internal family dispute.

===Baronetage decline since 1965===
There were 1,490 baronetcies extant on 1 January 1965. Since then there has been a loss of about 260 baronetcies through extinction or dormancy resulting in a gross decline of 17.5% or almost one-sixth over 50 years.

There have however been some exceptions to this trend &amp;ndash; a new creation ([[Thatcher baronets|Thatcher baronetcy, ''of Scotney'' (1990)]]) and five baronetcies dormant in 1965 and since revived &amp;ndash; [[Innes baronets|Innes baronetcy, ''of Coxton'' (1686)]], [[Nicolson baronets|Nicolson baronetcy of that Ilk and of Lasswade (1629)]], [[Hope baronets|Hope baronetcy, ''of Kirkliston'' (1698)]], [[St John-Mildmay baronets|St John (''later'' St John-Mildmay) baronetcy, ''of Farley'' (1772)]] and [[Maxwell Macdonald baronets|Maxwell-Macdonald baronetcy of Pollok (1682)]]

Thus the net loss is 254 or 17.1%.  Extant baronetcies number about 1,236 (as of 2015).&lt;ref name="Baronetage decline since 1965"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/peerage-news/NCaywWTirWw|title=Baronetage decline since 1965|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baronetcies with special remainders===
Baronetcies usually descend through [[Heirs of the body|heirs male of the body]] of the [[grantee]], and can rarely be inherited by females or collateral [[Kinship|kins]], unless created with [[Remainder (law)|special remainder]], for example:
* with remainder to heirs male forever ([[Broun baronets|Broun baronetcy, ''of Colstoun'' (1686)]], [[Hay baronets|Hay baronetcy of Alderston (1703)]], ''etc.'')
* with remainder to the sons of the grantee's daughters, and the heirs male of their bodies ([[North baronets|Hicking (''later'' North) baronetcy, ''of Southwell'' (1920)]], ''etc.'')
* with remainder to the grantee's daughter's son ([[Amcotts baronets|Amcotts baronetcy, ''of Kettlethorp'' (1796)]], ''etc.'')
* with remainder to the grantee's son-in-law ([[Earl of Gainsborough|Middleton (''later'' Noel) baronetcy, ''of The Navy'' (1781)]], [[Rich baronets|Rich baronetcy, ''of London'' (1676)]], ''etc.'')
* with remainder to the grantee's brother(s) ([[Chapman baronets|Chapman baronetcy, ''of Killua Castle'' (1782)]], [[Pigot baronets|Pigot baronetcy, ''of Patshull'' (1764)]], [[White baronets#White baronets.2C of Tuxford and Wallingwells .281802.29|White baronetcy of Tuxford and Wallingwells (1802)]] ''etc.'')
* with remainder, in default of male issue of the grantee, to the grantee's brothers and to the grantee's father’s second cousin, and the heirs male of their bodies ([[Baron Rokeby|Robinson baronetcy, ''of Rokeby Park'' (1730)]])
* with remainder to [[tailzie]] succeeding the grantee in the estate ([[Dalyell baronets|Dalyell baronetcy of The Binns (1685)]])
* with remainder specifically excluded the grantee's eldest son ([[Stonhouse baronets|Stonhouse baronetcy, ''of Radley'' (1628)]])

==Premier Baronet==

===England===

The Premier Baronet (of England) is the unofficial title afforded to the current holder of the oldest extant baronetcy in the realm. The Premier Baronet is regarded as the senior member of the Baronetage, and ranks above other baronets (unless they hold a [[peerage|peerage title]]) in the [[United Kingdom Order of Precedence]]. [[Sir Nicholas Bacon, 14th Baronet]], is the current Premier Baronet, whose family's senior title was created by [[James I of England|King James I]] in 1611.

===Scotland===
The Premier Baronets of Nova Scotia (Scotland) were the [[Gordon baronets|Gordon baronets of Gordonstoun and Letterfourie]] until the title's extinction in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, vol ii, pp277-280&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Premier Scottish Baronets are the [[Innes baronets|Innes baronets of that Ilk]] (cr. 28 May 1625),&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, vol ii, p 280&lt;/ref&gt; the present Premier Baronet being [[Guy Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe]].

===Ireland===
The Premier Baronetcy of Ireland was created for [[Dominick Sarsfield, 1st Viscount Sarsfield|Sir Dominic Sarsfield]] in 1619, and was held by his successors until the attainder of the [[Viscount Sarsfield|4th Viscount Sarsfield]] in 1691.&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, vol i, pp223-224&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the descendants of [[Francis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia|Sir Francis Annesley Bt.]], the [[Annesley baronets]], have been the Premier Baronets of Ireland;&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, vol ii, p 224&lt;/ref&gt; presently [[Viscount Valentia|Francis William Dighton Annesley, 16th Viscount Valentia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22517">'''Categorial grammar''' is a term used for a family of formalisms in [[natural language]] [[syntax]] motivated by the principle of [[compositionality]] and organized according to the view that syntactic constituents should generally combine as [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s or according to a function-argument relationship. Most versions of categorial grammar analyze sentence structure in terms of constituencies (as opposed to dependencies) and are therefore [[phrase structure grammar]]s (as opposed to [[dependency grammar]]s).

==Basics==
A categorial grammar consists of two parts: a lexicon, which assigns a set of types (also called categories) to each basic symbol, and some [[type inference]] rules, which determine how the type of a string of symbols follows from the types of the constituent symbols.  It has the advantage that the type inference rules can be fixed once and for all, so that the specification of a particular language grammar is entirely determined by the lexicon.

A categorial grammar shares some features with the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].
Whereas the [[lambda calculus]] has only one function type &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;,
a categorial grammar typically has two function types, one type which is applied on the left,
and one on the right. For example, a simple categorial grammar might have two function types &lt;math&gt;B/A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B&lt;/math&gt;.
The first, &lt;math&gt;B/A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the type of a phrase that results in a phrase of type
&lt;math&gt;B\,\!&lt;/math&gt; when followed (on the right) by a phrase of type &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
The second, &lt;math&gt;A\backslash B\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is the type of a phrase that results
in a phrase of type &lt;math&gt;B\,\!&lt;/math&gt; when preceded (on the left) by a phrase of type 
&lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  

The notation is based upon algebra. A fraction when multiplied by (i.e. concatenated with) its denominator yields its numerator. As concatenation is not [[commutative]], it makes a difference whether the denominator occurs to the left or right. The concatenation must be on the same side as the denominator for it to cancel out.

The first and simplest kind of categorial grammar is called a basic categorial grammar, or sometimes an AB-grammar (after Ajdukiewicz and Bar-Hillel).
Given a set of primitive types &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, let 
&lt;math&gt;\text{Tp}(\text{Prim})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the set of types constructed from primitive types.  In the basic case, this is the least set such that &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
and if &lt;math&gt;X, Y\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(X/Y), (Y\backslash X) \in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.
Think of these as purely formal expressions freely generated from the primitive types; any semantics will be added later.  Some authors assume a fixed infinite set of primitive types used by all grammars, but by making the primitive types part of the grammar, the whole construction is kept finite.

A basic categorial grammar is a tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, \text{Prim}, S, \triangleleft)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of symbols,
&lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of primitive types, and &lt;math&gt;S \in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation &lt;math&gt;\triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; is the lexicon, which relates types to symbols &lt;math&gt;(\triangleleft) \subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim}) \times \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the lexicon is finite, it can be specified by listing a set of pairs like &lt;math&gt;TYPE\triangleleft\text{symbol}&lt;/math&gt;.

Such a grammar for English might have three basic types &lt;math&gt;(N,NP, \text{ and } S)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, assigning [[count noun]]s the type &lt;math&gt;N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, complete noun phrases the type
&lt;math&gt;NP\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and sentences the type &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then an [[adjective]] could have the type &lt;math&gt;N/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, because if it is followed by a noun then the whole phrase is a noun. 
Similarly, a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] has the type &lt;math&gt;NP/N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
because it forms a complete noun phrase when followed by a noun.
Intransitive [[verb]]s have the type &lt;math&gt;NP\backslash S&lt;/math&gt;, and transitive verbs the type &lt;math&gt;(NP\backslash S)/NP&lt;/math&gt;.
Then a string of words is a sentence if it has overall type &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, take the string "the bad boy made that mess".  Now "the" and "that" are determiners, "boy" and "mess" are nouns, "bad" is an adjective, and "made" is a transitive verb, so the lexicon is
{&lt;math&gt;NP/N\triangleleft\text{the}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;NP/N\triangleleft\text{that}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N\triangleleft\text{boy}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N\triangleleft\text{mess}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;N/N\triangleleft\text{bad}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;(NP\backslash S)/NP\triangleleft\text{made}&lt;/math&gt;}.

and the sequence of types in the string is

&lt;math&gt;
{\text{the}\atop {NP/N,}}
{\text{bad}\atop {N/N,}}
{\text{boy}\atop {N,}}
{\text{made}\atop {(NP\backslash S)/NP,}}
{\text{that}\atop {NP/N,}}
{\text{mess}\atop {N}}
&lt;/math&gt;

now find functions and appropriate arguments and reduce them according to the two [[inference rule]]s
&lt;math&gt; X\leftarrow X/Y,\; Y&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; X\leftarrow Y,\; Y\backslash X&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; N/N,\; N,\; (NP\backslash S)/NP,\; \underbrace{NP/N,\; N}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; N/N,\; N,\; \underbrace{(NP\backslash S)/NP, \quad NP}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad NP/N,\; \underbrace{N/N,\; N}, \qquad (NP\backslash S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \underbrace{NP/N,\; \quad N},\; \qquad (NP\backslash S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \qquad\underbrace{NP,\; \qquad (NP\backslash S)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;.\qquad \qquad\qquad\quad\;\;\; S&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the result is &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; means that the string is a sentence, while the sequence of reductions shows that it must be parsed as ((the (bad boy)) (made (that mess))).

Categorial grammars of this form (having only function application rules) are equivalent in generative capacity to [[context-free grammar]]s and are thus often considered inadequate for theories of natural language syntax. Unlike CFGs, categorial grammars are [[lexicalized]], meaning that only a small number of (mostly language-independent) rules are employed, and all other syntactic phenomena derive from the lexical entries of specific words.

Another appealing aspect of categorial grammars is that it is often easy to assign them a compositional semantics, by first assigning [[interpretation type]]s to all the basic categories, and then associating all the [[derived category|derived categories]] with appropriate [[Function (mathematics)|function]] types. The interpretation of any constituent is then simply the value of a function at an argument. With some modifications to handle [[intensionality]] and [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantification]], this approach can be used to cover a wide variety of semantic phenomena.

==Lambek calculus==

A Lambek grammar is an elaboration of this idea that has a
concatenation operator for types, and several other inference rules.
Pentus has shown that these still have the generative capacity of
context-free grammars.

For the Lambek calculus, there is a type concatenation
operator &lt;math&gt;\star\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, so
that &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}\subseteq \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
and if &lt;math&gt;X, Y\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;(X/Y), (X\backslash Y), (X\star Y)\in \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})&lt;/math&gt;.

The Lambek calculus consists of several deduction rules, which specify
how type inclusion assertions can be derived.  In the following
rules, upper case roman letters stand for types, upper case Greek
letters stand for sequences of types.  A sequent of the form
&lt;math&gt; X \leftarrow \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;
can be read: a string is of type &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if it consists of the concatenation
of strings of each of the types in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  If a type is
interpreted as a set of strings, then the
&lt;math&gt;\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\supseteq\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, "includes as a subset". 
A horizontal line means that the inclusion above the line
implies the one below the line.

The process is begun by the Axiom rule, which has no antecedents and
just says that any type includes itself.

&lt;math&gt;
(Axiom)\quad
{{}\over X \leftarrow X}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Cut rule says that inclusions can be composed.

&lt;math&gt;
(Cut) \quad
{Z \leftarrow \Delta X \Delta' \qquad X \leftarrow \Gamma
   \over
 Z \leftarrow \Delta \Gamma \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;

The other rules come in pairs, one pair for each type construction
operator, each pair consisting of one rule for the operator in the
target, one in the source, of the arrow.
The name of a rule consists of the operator and an arrow, with the
operator on the side of the arrow on which it occurs in the conclusion.

&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow \backslash) \quad
{Z \leftarrow \Delta Y \Delta' \qquad X\leftarrow\Gamma
   \over
 Z \leftarrow \Delta \Gamma(X\backslash Y) \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;
(/\leftarrow) \quad
{Y\leftarrow \Gamma X
  \over
Y/X\leftarrow\Gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow/) \quad
{Z\leftarrow \Delta Y \Delta' \qquad X\leftarrow\Gamma 
  \over
 Z\leftarrow \Delta (Y/X)\Gamma \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;
(\star\leftarrow) \quad {X\leftarrow \Gamma \qquad Y \leftarrow \Gamma'
  \over
X \star Y \leftarrow \Gamma\Gamma'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;
(\leftarrow\star) \quad {Z\leftarrow \Delta X Y \Delta'
   \over
Z\leftarrow \Delta (X \star Y) \Delta'}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For an example, here is a derivation of "type raising", which says that
&lt;math&gt;(B/A)\backslash B \leftarrow A&lt;/math&gt;.  The names of rules and the substitutions used are to the right.

&lt;math&gt; 
\dfrac {\dfrac{}{B \leftarrow B} \qquad \dfrac{}{A \leftarrow A} }
       {\dfrac {B \leftarrow (B/A), \;\; A} 
               {(B/A)\backslash B \leftarrow A} }
\qquad
\begin{matrix}
  \mbox{(Axioms)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad{ }\\
  {(\leftarrow/)\,\,[Z=Y=B,X=A,\Gamma=(A),\Delta=\Delta'=()]}\\
  {(\backslash\leftarrow)\,\,[Y=B,X=(B/A),\Gamma=(A)]}\qquad\qquad\qquad{ }\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to context-free grammars===

Recall that a [[context-free grammar]] is a 4-tuple:

&lt;math&gt;G = (V,\, \Sigma,\, ::=,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
where

1. &lt;math&gt;V\, &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''non-terminals'' or ''variables''.

2. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''terminal symbols''.

3. &lt;math&gt;::=\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of production rules, that is, a finite relation
&lt;math&gt;(::=)\subseteq V \times (V \cup \Sigma)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

4. &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start variable.

From the point of view of categorial grammars, a context-free grammar
can be seen as a calculus with a set of special purpose axioms for
each language, but with no type construction operators and no
inference rules except Cut.

Specifically, given a context-free grammar as above, define a categorial
grammar 
&lt;math&gt;(\text{Prim},\, \Sigma,\, \triangleleft,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}=V\cup\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and   &lt;math&gt;\text{Tp}(\text{Prim})=\text{Prim}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. 
Let there be an axiom
&lt;math&gt;{x \leftarrow x}&lt;/math&gt; for every symbol 
&lt;math&gt;x \in V\cup\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
an axiom &lt;math&gt;{X \leftarrow \Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; 
for every production rule &lt;math&gt;X ::= \Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
a lexicon entry &lt;math&gt;{s \triangleleft s}&lt;/math&gt; for every terminal symbol 
&lt;math&gt;s \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and Cut for the only rule.
This categorial grammar generates the same language as the given CFG.

Of course, this is not a basic categorial grammar, since it has
special axioms that depend upon the language; i.e. it is not lexicalized.
Also, it makes no use at all of non-primitive types.

To show that any context-free language can be generated by
a basic categorial grammar, recall that 
any context-free language can be generated by a context-free grammar
in [[Greibach normal form]].

The grammar is in Greibach normal form if every production rule is
of the form
&lt;math&gt; A ::= s A_0 \ldots A_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;,
where capital letters are variables, &lt;math&gt;s \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;N\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, the right side of the production is a single terminal symbol
followed by zero or more (non-terminal) variables.

Now given a CFG in Greibach normal form,
define a basic categorial grammar with a primitive type
for each non-terminal variable
&lt;math&gt;\text{Prim}=V\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
and with an entry in the lexicon 
&lt;math&gt; A/A_{N-1}/ \ldots /A_0 \triangleleft s &lt;/math&gt;,
for each production rule
&lt;math&gt; A ::= s A_0 \ldots A_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
It is fairly easy to see that this basic categorial grammar
generates the same language as the original CFG.
Note that the lexicon of this grammar will generally
assign multiple types to each symbol.

The same construction works for Lambek grammars, since
they are an extension of basic categorial grammars.
It is necessary to verify that the extra inference rules
do not change the generated language.  This can be done
and shows that every context-free language is generated
by some Lambek grammar.

To show the converse, that every language generated by a
Lambek grammar is context-free, is much more difficult.
It was an open problem for nearly thirty years, from
the early 1960s until about 1991 when it was proven
by Pentus.

The basic idea is, given a Lambek grammar,
&lt;math&gt;(\text{Prim},\, \Sigma,\, \triangleleft,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
construct a context-free grammar
&lt;math&gt;(V,\, \Sigma,\, ::=,\, S)&lt;/math&gt;
with the same set of terminal symbols, the
same start symbol, with variables some (not all) types
&lt;math&gt;V\subset \text{Tp}(\text{Prim})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,
and with a production rule
&lt;math&gt;T::=\text{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
for each entry
&lt;math&gt;T\triangleleft\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;
in the lexicon,
and production rules &lt;math&gt;T::=\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
for certain sequents &lt;math&gt;T\leftarrow\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;
that are derivable in the Lambek calculus.

Of course, there are infinitely many types
and infinitely many derivable sequents, so in
order to make a finite grammar it is necessary
put a bound on the size of the types and sequents
that are needed.  The heart of Pentus's proof
is to show that there is such a finite bound.

===Notation===
The notation in this field is not standardized.  The notations used in
formal language theory, logic, category theory, and linguistics, conflict
with each other.  In logic, arrows point to the more general from the more particular,
that is, to the conclusion from the hypotheses.  In this article,
this convention is followed, i.e. the target of the arrow is the more general (inclusive) type.

In logic, arrows usually point left to right.  In this article this convention is
reversed for consistency with the notation of context-free grammars, where the
single non-terminal symbol is always on the left.  We use the symbol &lt;math&gt;::=&lt;/math&gt;
in a production rule as in [[Backus-Naur form]].  Some authors use an arrow, which
unfortunately may point in either direction, depending on whether the grammar is
thought of as generating or recognizing the language.

Some authors on categorial grammars write &lt;math&gt;B\backslash A&lt;/math&gt; instead of
&lt;math&gt;A\backslash B&lt;/math&gt;.  The convention used here follows Lambek and algebra.

==Historical notes==
The basic ideas of categorial grammar date from work by [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (in 1935) and [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]] (in 1953). In 1958, [[Joachim Lambek]] introduced a [[Lambek Calculus|syntactic calculus]] that formalized the function [[type constructors]] along with various rules for the combination of functions. This calculus is a forerunner of
[[linear logic]] in that it is a [[substructural logic]]. [[Montague grammar]] uses an ad hoc syntactic system for English that is based on the principles of categorial grammar. Although [[Richard Montague|Montague's]] work is sometimes regarded as syntactically uninteresting, it helped to bolster interest in categorial grammar by associating it with a highly successful formal treatment of natural language [[semantics]]. More recent work in categorial grammar has focused on the improvement of syntactic coverage. One formalism which has received considerable attention in recent years is [[Mark Steedman|Steedman]] and [[Anna Szabolcsi|Szabolcsi]]'s [[combinatory categorial grammar]] which builds on [[combinatory logic]] invented by [[Moses Schönfinkel]] and [[Haskell Curry]].

There are a number of related formalisms of this kind in linguistics, such as [[type logical grammar]] and [[abstract categorial grammar]].

==Some definitions==
;Derivation: A derivation is a binary tree that encodes a proof.
;Parse tree: A parse tree displays a derivation, showing the syntactic structure of a sentence.
;Functor and Argument: In a right (left) function application, the node of the type A\B (B/A) is called the functor, and the node of the type A is called an argument.
;Functor-argument structure{{what| where's the definition?|date=July 2015}}

==Refinements of categorial grammar==
A variety of changes to categorial grammar have been proposed to improve syntactic coverage. Some of the most common ones are listed below.

===Features and subcategories===
Most systems of categorial grammar subdivide categories. The most common way to do this is by tagging them with [[grammatical feature|features]], such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Sometimes only atomic categories are tagged in this way. In Montague grammar, it is traditional to subdivide function categories using a multiple slash convention, so ''A/B'' and ''A//B'' would be two distinct categories of left-applying functions, that took the same arguments but could be distinguished between by other functions taking them as arguments.

===Function composition===
Rules of function composition are included in many categorial grammars. An example of such a rule would be one that allowed the concatenation of a constituent of type ''A/B'' with one of type ''B/C'' to produce a new constituent of type ''A/C''. The semantics of such a rule would simply involve the composition of the functions involved. Function composition is important in categorial accounts of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and extraction, especially as they relate to phenomena like [[right node raising]]. The introduction of function composition into a categorial grammar leads to many kinds of derivational ambiguity that are vacuous in the sense that they do not correspond to semantic ambiguities.

===Conjunction===
Many categorial grammars include a typical conjunction rule, of the general form ''X CONJ X → X'', where ''X'' is a category. Conjunction can generally be applied to nonstandard constituents resulting from type raising or function composition..

===Discontinuity===
The grammar is extended to handle linguistic phenomena such as discontinuous idioms, gapping and extraction.

'''Dehumanization''' or an act thereof can describe a behavior or process that undermines individuality of and in others. Behaviorally, dehumanization describes a disposition towards others that debases the others' individuality as either an "individual" species or an "individual" object,  e.g. someone who acts inhumanely towards humans.  As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction, e.g. ''[[Automation|Technology revolutions]] cause the dehumanization of labor markets to the point of antiquation.''

In almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization.  As [[social norms]] define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane.  Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms.  This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization.  If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history.  However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a [[Type–token distinction|type-token ambiguity]] relative to both scales individual and societal.

Biologically, dehumanization can be described as an [[introduced species]] marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.

In [[political science]] and [[jurisprudence]], the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of [[human rights]] or [[denaturalization]] of [[natural rights]], a definition contingent upon presiding [[international law]] rather than [[social norms]] limited by [[human geography]]. In this context, specialty within species need not apply to constitute [[global citizenship]] or its inalienable rights; these both are inherit by human genome.

It is theorized to take on two forms: ''animalistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely intergroup basis, and ''mechanistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely interpersonal basis.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Dehumanization: An Integrative Review |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=252–264 |pmid=16859440 |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_4 |url=http://general.utpb.edu/FAC/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626110654/http://general.utpb.edu/fac/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehumanization can occur discursively (e.g., idiomatic language that likens certain human beings to non-human animals, [[verbal abuse]], erasing one's voice from discourse), symbolically (e.g., imagery), or physically (e.g., chattel [[slavery]], [[physical abuse]], refusing eye contact). Dehumanization often ignores the target's [[Individualism|individuality]] (i.e., the creative and interesting aspects of their personality) and can hinder one from feeling [[empathy]] or properly understanding a [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group of people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Dehumanization may be carried out by a social [[institution]] (such as a state, school, or family), interpersonally, or even within the self. Dehumanization can be unintentional, especially on the part of individuals, as with some types of ''de facto'' [[racism]]. State-organized dehumanization has historically been directed against perceived political, [[Race (human classification)|racial]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], national, or religious [[minority group]]s. Other minoritized and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] individuals and groups (based on [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], disability, [[Social class|class]], or some other organizing principle) are also susceptible to various forms of dehumanization. The concept of dehumanization has received empirical attention in the [[Psychology|psychological]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, A. C., &amp; Deci, E. L. (2010).

“Dehumanisation is viewed as a central component to intergroup violence because it is frequently the most important precursor to moral exclusion, the process by which stigmatized groups are placed outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goof|first=Phillip|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew|date=2008|title=Not yet human: implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences|url= http://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2008-NotYetHuman.pdf|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= American Psychology Association|volume=94|issue=2|pages=292–306|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292|pmid=18211178|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Livingstone Smith]], director and founder of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England, argues that historically, human beings have been dehumanizing one another for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others|last = Livingstone Smith|first = David|publisher = St. Martin’s Press,|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanness ==

In [[Herbert Kelman]]'s work on dehumanization, humanness has two features: "identity" (i.e., a perception of the person "as an individual, independent and distinguishable from others, capable of making choices") and "community" (i.e., a perception of the person as "part of an interconnected network of individuals who care for each other"). When a target's agency and community embeddedness are denied, they no longer elicit compassion or other moral responses, and may suffer violence as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (1976). "Violence without restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers". pp. 282-314 in G. M. Kren &amp; L. H. Rappoport (Eds.), ''Varieties of Psychohistory''. New York: Springer. {{ISBN|0826119409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalistic versus mechanistic ==

In Nick Haslam's review of dehumanization, he differentiates between uniquely human (UH) characteristics, which distinguish humans from non-human animals, and human nature (HN), characteristics that are typical of or central to human beings. His model suggests that different types of dehumanization arise from the denial of one sense of humanness or the other. Language, higher order cognition, refined emotions, civility, and morality are uniquely human characteristics (i.e., traits humans have that non-human animals do not). Cognitive flexibility, emotionality, vital agency, and warmth are central to human nature. Characteristics of human nature are perceived to be widely shared among groups (i.e., every human has these traits), while uniquely human characteristics (e.g., civility, morality) are thought to vary between groups.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

According to Haslam, the animalistic form of dehumanization occurs when uniquely human characteristics (e.g., refinement, moral sensibility) are denied to an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. People that suffer animalistic dehumanization are seen as amoral, unintelligent, and lacking self-control, and they are likened to animals. This has happened to Jewish people during [[The Holocaust]], and indigenous people subject to colonization and slavery. While usually employed on an intergroup basis, animalistic dehumanization can occur on an interpersonal basis as well.

The mechanistic form occurs when features of human nature (e.g., cognitive flexibility, warmth, agency) are denied to targets. Targets of mechanistic dehumanization are seen as cold, rigid, interchangeable, lacking agency, and likened to machines or objects. Mechanistic dehumanization is usually employed on an interpersonal basis (e.g., when a person is seen as a means to another's end).&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

== Related psychological processes ==

Several lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization. Infrahumanization suggests that individuals think of and treat [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] members as "less human" and more like animals;&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; while Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeld uses the term ''pseudo-speciation'', a term that he borrowed from the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, to imply that the dehumanized person or persons are being regarded as not members of the human species.&lt;ref name="eibl"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Biology of Peace and War: Men, Animals and Aggression | publisher=New York Viking Press | author=Eibl-Eibisfeldt, Irenäus | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, individuals associate secondary emotions (which are seen as uniquely human) more with the ingroup than with the outgroup. Primary emotions (those that are experienced by all sentient beings, both humans and other animals) and are found to be more associated with the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; Dehumanization is intrinsically connected with violence.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Often, one cannot do serious injury to another without first dehumanizing him or her in one's mind (as a form of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]].){{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Military training is, among other things, a systematic desensitization and dehumanization of the enemy, and servicemen and women may find it psychologically necessary to refer to the enemy as animal or other non-human beings. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has shown that without such desensitization it would be difficult, if not impossible for someone to kill another human, even in combat or under threat to their own lives.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{cite book | title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society | publisher=[[Back Bay Books]] | author=Grossman, Dave Lt. Col. | year=1996 | isbn=0-316-33000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegitimization is the "categorization of groups into extreme negative social categories which are excluded from human groups that are considered as acting within the limits of acceptable norms and/or values."&lt;ref name ="Bar-Tal, D, 1989" /&gt;

Moral exclusion occurs when outgroups are subject to a different set of moral values, rules, and fairness than are used in social relations with ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Opotow, S., 1990" /&gt; When individuals dehumanize others, they no longer experience distress when they treat them poorly. Moral exclusion is used to explain extreme behaviors like genocide, harsh [[Immigration policy|immigration policies]], and [[eugenics]], but can also happen on a more regular, everyday discriminatory level. In laboratory studies, people who are portrayed as lacking human qualities have been found to be treated in a particularly harsh and violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=31|issue=2|year=2002|pages=101–119|url=http://historicalunderbelly.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/bandura_moraldisengagement1.pdf|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Barbaranelli|first2=Claudio|last3=Caprara|first3=Gian Vittorio|last4=Pastorelli|first4=Concetta|title=Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=71|issue=2|year=1996|pages=364–374|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1996JPSP.pdf |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Underwood|first2=Bill|last3=Fromson|first3=Michael E|title=Disinhibition of aggression through diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization of victims|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=9|issue=4|year=1975|pages=253–269|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1975.pdf |doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]] (1999) identified seven components of objectification: "instrumentality", "denial of autonomy", "inertness", "fungibility", "violability", "ownership", and "denial of subjectivity".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha C.

In Psychology higher-order cognitive processes like social cognition may occur between a human and human, or human and non-human, human and object. The assigning that occurs in social cognition suggests a non-human target can have projected internal life, or conscious emotional and cognitive experiences. Mental states projected onto objects and non-human forms of life can occur without intention. Studies by Heberlein, Adolphs, Tranel &amp; Damasio, Heberlein AS, Adolphs R, Tranel D, Damasio H. Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from [[Biological motion perception|point-light walkers]] explore the constants of biological motion perception within areas of the human brain, where participants would infer intent among objects which do not have any emotion or cognitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from point-light walkers|date = Sep 16, 2004|publisher = Princeton University|last = Heberlein|first = AS|pmid = 15453970|doi=10.1162/0898929041920423|volume=16|issue = 7|journal=J Cogn Neurosci|pages=1143–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for subjects to anthropomorphize a spectrum of inanimate objects and non-human life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=VSY|date=2008|title=Missing links in social cognition: The continuum from nonhuman agents to dehumanized humans|url=|journal=Social Cognition|volume=26|issue=2|pages=125–128|doi=10.1521/soco.2008.26.2.125|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = Dec 7, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In children there is a common pattern of projecting the imaginary other, both humanlike and not, and a child is able to interact with the imaginary other without much effort as if the projected other exists. With the ease of anthropomorphic projection, children's lack of social cognition unto human counterparts is surprising. Dehumanized perception often means a cognitive bias experienced through lack of consideration for thoughts, feelings, and general mental contents of a social target's cognition. This dehumanized perception can occur when the target has elicited disgust or further negative responses when in contact with the dehumanizing subject. Humans seen as having certain lower social standings such as people suffering from addictions and homeless persons are often perceived as being low in cognitive warmth and low in social competency reliability. This often elicits more frequent disgust compared to certain higher social standings when projected cognitions by the dehumanizing subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A model of (often mixed) stereotype content: competence and warmth respectively follow from perceived status and competition|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = June 2002|journal = NCBI|volume = 82|issue = 6|pages = 878–902|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.878|pmid = 12051578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can  suddenly consider the mental cognitions of those persons who experience emotions of a social variety, linking in-groups of positive social figures to pride, connecting in-groups of wealthy and the upper class feelings of envy, and experiencing pity towards in-groups of the disabled and the elderly. Through a study by Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick in 2007, a [[stereotype content model]] showed that social targets such as the elderly and wealthy were trustworthy, friendly, and of capable ability due to perceived competence and warmth. However, in-groups of the disabled, poor, persons with addictions, and immigrants were recorded as disgust-inducing due to projected low warmth and incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = Feb 11, 2007|journal = Trends Cogn Sci|volume = 11|issue = 2|pages = 77–83|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.005|pmid = 17188552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilitating factors ==

While social distance from the outgroup target is a necessary condition for dehumanization, some research suggests that it is not sufficient.  Psychological research has identified high status, power, and social connection as additional factors that influence whether dehumanization will occur. If being an outgroup member was all that was required to be dehumanized, dehumanization would be far more prevalent. However, only{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} members of high status groups associate humanity more with ingroup than the outgroup.

Neuroimaging studies have discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex—a brain region distinctively involved in attributing mental states to others—shows diminished activation to extremely dehumanized targets (i.e., those rated, according to the [[stereotype content model]], as low-warmth and low-competence, such as drug addicts or homeless people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=L.

== Race and ethnicity ==

Dehumanization often occurs as a result of conflict in an intergroup context. Ethnic and racial others are often represented as animals in popular culture and scholarship. There is evidence that this representation persists in the American context with African Americans implicitly associated with apes. To the extent that an individual has this dehumanizing implicit association, they are more likely to support violence against African Americans (e.g., jury decisions to execute defendants).&lt;ref name="Goff, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Phillip Atiba|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa J.|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew Christian|title=Not yet human: Implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=94|issue=2|year=2008|pages=292–306|pmid=18211178|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, dehumanization is frequently connected to genocidal conflicts in that ideologies before and during the conflict link victims to rodents/vermin.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt; Immigrants are also dehumanized in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Gerald|title=Indigestible Food, Conquering Hordes, and Waste Materials: Metaphors of Immigrants and the Early Immigration Restriction Debate in the United States|journal=Metaphor and Symbol|volume=18|issue=1|year=2003|pages=33–47|url=http://www.uky.edu/~addesa01/documents/IndigestibleFood.pdf|doi=10.1207/S15327868MS1801_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, the Australian Constitution and British Government partook in an Act to federate the Australian states. Section 51 (xxvi) and 127 were two provisions that dehumanised Aboriginals.
51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:
(xxvi) The people of any race, other than the Aboriginal people in any state, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. 
127. In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a state or other part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted.
In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed, this categorically denied Aboriginals from the right to vote. Indigenous Australians were not allowed social security benefits e.g. Aged pensions and maternity allowances. However, these benefits were provided to other non-Indigenous Australians by the Commonwealth Government. Aboriginals in rural areas were discriminated and controlled as to where and how they could marry, work, live, and their movements were restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/auscurric/sampleunit/1967referendum/aboutreferendum.pdf|title=About the 1967 Referendum|date=2012|website=Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification==

Fredrickson and Roberts argued that the [[sexual objectification]] of women extends beyond [[pornography]] (which emphasizes women's bodies over their uniquely human mental and emotional characteristics) to society generally. There is a normative emphasis on female appearance that causes women to take a third-person perspective on their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=OBJECTIFICATION THEORY.|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258181826_Objectification_Theory_Toward_Understanding_Women%27s_Lived_Experiences_and_Mental_Health_Risks|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological distance women may feel from their bodies might cause them to dehumanize themselves. Some research has indicated that women and men exhibit a "sexual body part recognition bias", in which women's sexual body parts are better recognized when presented in isolation than in the context of their entire bodies, whereas men's sexual body parts are better recognized in the context of their entire bodies than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Sarah J.|last2=Vescio|first2=Theresa K.|last3=Förster|first3=Jens|last4=Maass|first4=Anne|last5=Suitner|first5=Caterina|title=Seeing women as objects: The sexual body part recognition bias|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=6|year=2012|pages=743–753|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who dehumanize women as either animals or objects are more liable to rape and sexually harass women and display more negative attitudes toward female rape victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=L.

== The role of nations and governments ==

[[Sociologist]]s and [[historian]]s often view dehumanization as essential to [[war]]. Governments sometimes represent "enemy" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Dictatorship]]s use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, [[sectarianism|sectarian]], or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting "enemies" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.

[[Anthropologist]]s [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered "the fifth [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman of the apocalypse]]" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley and Matson, Floyd W. (1983) ''The dehumanization of man'', McGraw-Hill, Preface, p. xi, "For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the 'Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.' Its more conventional name, of course, is dehumanization."&lt;/ref&gt; When people become things, the logic follows, they become dispensable, and any atrocity can be justified.

Dehumanization can be seen outside of overtly violent conflicts, as in political debates where opponents are presented as collectively stupid or inherently [[evil]]. Such "good-versus-evil" claims help end substantive debate (see also [[thought-terminating cliché]]).

== The role of terrorists and rebels ==

Non-state actors—terrorists in particular—have also resorted to dehumanization to further their cause and assuage pangs of guilt. The 1960s terrorist group [[Weather Underground]] had advocated violence against any authority figure, and used the "police are pigs" idea to convince members that they were not harming human beings, but simply killing wild animals. Likewise, rhetoric statements such as "terrorists are just scum", is an act of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=Cities and the 'War on Terror'|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=2|year=2006|pages=255–276|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematic destruction==

A study investigating racialized law enforcement violence is using virtual [[simulator]]s to investigate "shoot or don't shoot" responses. The studies conducted that participants' responses were affected by racial bias. When the simulator presented an armed Black man, participants shot faster and more accurately compared to an armed White man. In response to the "don't shoot", command of an unarmed Black man participant's reaction time was slower and less accurate compared to an unarmed White man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellawala|first=Themal.I|date=2016|title=Pulling the trigger: Dehumanization of African Americans and Police Violence|url=http://commons.clarku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=surj|journal=Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal|publisher=Clark|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center of Disease Control]] statistics on law enforcement killings between 1999 and 2011 showed that American youth of African ancestry between the ages of 15 and 19 are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than the national average of all races and age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113|title=Who are Police killing?|last=Males|first=Mike|date=26 August 2014|website=Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted with predominately White female undergraduates as well as predominately White male law enforcement found that participants overestimated the age of American children of African ancestry by 4.59 years, translating to boys of thirteen and a half years of age would be misperceived as legal adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goff|first=Phillip Atiba|last2=Jackson|first2=Matthew Christian|last3=Di Leone|first3=Brooke Allison Lewis|last4=Culottal|first4=Carmen Marie|last5=Di Tomasso|first5=Natalia Ann|date=2014|title=The essence of innocence: Consequences of dehumanizing Black children|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/4/526/|journal=Personality and social psychology|volume=106|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1037/a0035663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, 250,000 children are processed through to adult correctional facilities; this is at the impairment of their physical and mental health. In comparison to children at juvenile facilities, children sentenced as adults are, five times as likely to be sexually assaulted, twice as likely to be assaulted by a correctional officer, and eight times as likely to commit suicide. Implied dehumanization estimated the inclination of excessive force used by law enforcement against American suspect of African ancestry compared to other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/justice-for-some.pdf|title=And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of Youth of Color in the Justice System|last=Hartney|first=Christopher|last2=Silva|first2=Fabiana|date=1 January 2007|website=National Council on Crime and Delinquency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Herbert Kelman, "Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizes", illustrates how the above dehumanization of Americans with African ancestry is occurring. The apprehension towards murdering human beings is so overwhelming that the victim must be removed from their human status if systematic murdering is to occur. The victims are then dehumanized by placing them "outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply", the principle of mortality is no longer applicable. To establish others as entirely human, signify the sorrow from their death, despite racial background, as well as our individual relationship with the person. When referring to identity, the death is individualized; when referring to community, the death is experienced personally. The involvement of the bureaucratic apparatus is one of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=Herbert|date=1973|title=Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Violence_1973.pdf|journal=Journal of Social Issues|publisher=Harvard University|volume=29|issue=4|pages=25–61|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human anatomy ==

In the United States of America, Americans of African ancestry were dehumanised via the classification of being deemed as a primate, not a human.  The United States of America Constitution that took place in 1787 stated when collecting census data "all other persons" in reference to enslaved Africans will be counted as three-fifths of a human being. In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved. A California police officer who was also involved in the [[Rodney King]] beating described a dispute between an American couple with African ancestry as "something right out of gorillas in the mist". [[Franz Boas]] and [[Charles Darwin]] hypothesized that there may be an evolution process among primates. Monkeys and apes were least evolved, then savage and/ or deformed anthropoids which referred to people of African ancestry, to Caucasians as most evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goof|first=Phillip|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew|date=2008|title=Not yet human: implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences|url= http://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2008-NotYetHuman.pdf|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= American Psychology Association|volume=94|issue=2|pages=292–306|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292|pmid=18211178|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In science, medicine, and technology ==
Relatively recent history has seen the relationship between dehumanization and science result in unethical scientific research. The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] and the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently [[institutional review board]]s exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.

In a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (see [[History of anatomy]]), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted. Dehumanization has been associated with modern medicine generally, and specifically, has been suggested as a coping mechanism for doctors who work with patients at the end of life.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulman-Green|first1=Dena|title=Coping mechanisms of physicians who routinely work with dying patients|journal=OMEGA: the Journal of Death and Dying|volume=47|issue=3|year=2003|pages=253–264|doi=10.2190/950H-U076-T5JB-X6HN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified six potential causes of dehumanization in medicine: deindivudating practices, impaired patient agency, dissimilarity (causes which do not facilitate the delivery of medical treatment), mechanization, empathy reduction, and moral disengagement (which could be argued, do facilitate the delivery of medical treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haque|first1=O. S.|last2=Waytz|first2=A.|title=Dehumanization in Medicine: Causes, Solutions, and Functions|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=2|year=2012|pages=176–186|doi=10.1177/1745691611429706|pmid=26168442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the patient point of view, in some states in America, controversial legislation requires that a woman view the ultrasound image of her fetus before being able to have an abortion. Critics of the law argue that simply seeing an image of the fetus humanizes it, and biases women against abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanger | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Seeing and believing: Mandatory ultrasound and the path to a protected choice | url = | journal = [[UCLA Law Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 351–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a recent study showed that subtle humanization of medical patients appears to improve care for these patients. Radiologists evaluating X-rays reported more details to patients and expressed more empathy when a photo of the patient's face accompanied the X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Y., &amp; Hadas-Halpern, I. (2008, December 3). [http://archive.rsna.org/2008/6008880.html "The effects of including a patient's photograph to the radiographic examination"]. Paper presented at [[Radiological Society of North America]], Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that inclusion of the photos counteracts the dehumanization of the medical process.

Dehumanization has applications outside traditional social contexts. [[Anthropomorphism]] (i.e., perceiving in nonhuman entities mental and physical capacities that reflect humans) is the inverse of dehumanization, which occurs when characteristics that apply to humans are denied to other humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waytz|first1=A.|last2=Epley|first2=N.|last3=Cacioppo|first3=J. T.|title=Social Cognition Unbound: Insights Into Anthropomorphism and Dehumanization|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=1|year=2010|pages=58–62|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/19_1_inpress/Waytz_final.pdf|doi=10.1177/0963721409359302|pmid=24839358|pmc=4020342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse of the factors that facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should facilitate anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or electronics than a high-status, high-power, socially connected person.

Researchers have found that engaging in violent video game play diminishes perceptions of both one's own humanity and the humanity of the players who are targets of the violence in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Brock|last2=Jetten|first2=Jolanda|last3=Radke|first3=Helena R.M.|title=Cyber-dehumanization: Violent video game play diminishes our humanity|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=2|year=2012|pages=486–491|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the players are dehumanized, the video game characters that play them are likely anthropomorphized.

Dehumanization has occurred historically under the pre-tense of "progress in the name of science". During the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's fair in 1904]] human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes around the globe, most notably a young Congolese man, [[Ota Benga]].  Benga's imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing “a degraded and degenerate race”. During this period religion was still the driving force behind much political and scientific action, and because of this, eugenics were widely supported among the most notable US scientific communities, political figures, and industrial elites. After allocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The man who was caged in a zoo {{!}} Pamela Newkirk|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/the-man-who-was-caged-in-a-zoo|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Pamela|last = Newkirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and colonialism ==
In Martin Luther King Jr.'s book on civil rights ''[[Why We Can't Wait]]'', he explains "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race."

[[Mi'kmaq]] elder and human rights activist [[Daniel N. Paul]] has researched written extensively of historic accounts of atrocious acts of violence against First Nations peoples in North America. His work states European colonialism in Canada and America was a subjugation of the indigenous peoples and is an unequivocal violent series of crimes against humanity which has been unparalleled historically. Tens of millions First Nations died at the hands of European invaders in an attempt to appropriate the entirety of the land. Those hundreds of diverse civilizations and communities who thrived across North America millions of years before the exploits of Christopher Columbus were ultimately destroyed. Dehumanization occurred in the form of barbaric genocidal processes of murder, rape, starvation, enslavement, allocation, and germ warfare. Of the myriad of ways the English performed ethnic cleansing, one of the most frequent was the practice of bounty hunting and scalping—where colonial conquerors would raid communities and remove the scalps of children and adults. This war crime of scalping was most prevalent when maritime colonialists repeatedly attempted to eradicate Daniel N. Paul's ancestors, the Mi'kmaq. Scalping was common practice in many United States areas all the way until the 1860s in attempt to completely wipe out the remaining First Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN INDIANS DEHUMANIZED BY DEMONIZING PROPAGANDA|url = http://www.danielnpaul.com/NativeAmericansDemonized.html|website = www.danielnpaul.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Compton's cafeteria riot]] predates the [[Stonewall riots|stonewall riots of 1969]] and marks one of the first times in American history that non-hetero-normative peoples denied their oppressors taking agency by demanding human rights. This incident was a result of the rampant discrimination, abuse, and ultimately, dehumanizing acts of violence against the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT]] community in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. Up until the Compton cafeteria riot, the act of dressing in non-gender binary clothing was considered a criminal offence, and police would respond to "cross-dressers" with frequent violence and misconduct. Accounts of frequent sexual assault, police brutality, abuse of power, and constant arrests by local law enforcement towards those seeking refuge in the ghettos of the tenderloin have been told in the documentary ''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria.''&lt;ref&gt;''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria''. Dir. Susan Stryker and Victor Silverman, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and "dignity of man" ==

German philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the "[[techniques of neutralization]]" (David Matza/[[Gresham Sykes]]) and to the obedience aspects of the [[Milgram experiment]] and in a wider sense with [[Philip Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Montenbruck continues that—in light of our common [[Western civilization]]—dehumanization is based on political [[Humanism]], in terms of both [[human rights]] and Western democracy. Each of them are grounded in the "dignity of man" aspect. Therefore, its "negation" might be seen as dehumanization in our common Western sense. Furthermore, in light democracy, criminal law might be reduced to the simple formula: violating a person means an act of dehumanization by taking "freedom, unfairly and inhumanely". The reaction of a civilized Western society ought to be "taking freedom as well, but fair and humane".&lt;ref&gt;Montenbruck, Axel (2010) [http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001194/Western_Anthropology,_2nd_ed.pdf?hosts= ''Western Anthropology: Democracy and Dehumanization'']. 2nd edition,, Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin, pp. 60-66,74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Dehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, and political alignment. Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often [[Light skin|light-skinned]] people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, "immigrant" is a word that can be paired with "illegal", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. "Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal. There is no other classification that I’m aware of where the individual is being rendered as illegal as opposed to the actions of that individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Mawuna Remarque|last = Koutonin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of examinations of language sought to find if there was a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., ''faggot'') were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Not "just words": Exposure to homophobic epithets leads to dehumanizing and physical distancing from gay men|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2148/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 46|issue = 2|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = n/a–n/a|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2148|first = Fabio|last = Fasoli|first2 = Maria Paola|last2 = Paladino|first3 = Andrea|last3 = Carnaghi|first4 = Jolanda|last4 = Jetten|first5 = Brock|last5 = Bastian|first6 = Paul G.|last6 = Bain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art  ==
[[Francisco Goya]], famed Spanish painter and printmaker of the romantic period often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization. In the romantic period of painting martyrdom art was most often a means of deifying the oppressed and tormented, and it was common for Goya to depict evil personalities performing these unjust horrible acts. But it was revolutionary the way the painter broke this convention by dehumanizing these martyr figures. "…one would not know whom the painting depicts, so determinedly has Goya reduced his subjects from martyrs to meat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Death and Afterlife of the North American Martyrs|last = Anderson|first = Emma|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9780674726161|location = United States|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S.

{{Other uses}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''embedding''' (or '''imbedding'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}} suggests that "the English" (i.e. the British) use "embedding" instead of "imbedding".&lt;/ref&gt;) is one instance of some [[mathematical structure]] contained within another instance, such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is a [[subgroup]].

When some object ''X'' is said to be embedded in another object ''Y'', the embedding is given by some [[Injective function|injective]] and structure-preserving map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}. The precise meaning of "structure-preserving" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which ''X'' and ''Y'' are instances. In the terminology of [[category theory]], a structure-preserving map is called a [[morphism]].

The fact that a map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a "hooked arrow" ({{unichar|21AA|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK|ulink=Unicode}});&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus: &lt;math&gt; f : X \hookrightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt; (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for [[inclusion map]]s.)

Given ''X'' and ''Y'', several different embeddings of ''X'' in ''Y'' may be possible. In many cases of interest there is a standard (or "canonical") embedding, like those of the [[natural number]]s in the [[integer]]s, the integers in the [[rational number]]s, the rational numbers in the [[real number]]s, and the real numbers in the [[complex number]]s. In such cases it is common to identify the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''X'' with its [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''X'') contained in ''Y'', so that {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ ''Y''}}.

==Topology and geometry==
===General topology===

In [[general topology]], an embedding is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|1988|page=73}}. {{harvnb|Sharpe|1997|page=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More explicitly, an injective [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] map &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; between [[topological space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''topological embedding''' if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; yields a homeomorphism between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; carries the [[subspace topology]] inherited from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). Intuitively then, the embedding &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; lets us treat &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Every embedding is injective and [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. Every map that is injective, continuous and either [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]] is an embedding; however there are also embeddings which are neither open nor closed. The latter happens if the image &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is neither an [[open set]] nor a [[closed set]] in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the existence of an embedding &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological invariant]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This allows two spaces to be distinguished if one is able to be embedded in a space while the other is not.

===Differential topology===

In [[differential topology]]:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be smooth [[manifold]]s and &lt;math&gt;f:M\to N&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] if its [[pushforward (differential)|derivative]] is everywhere injective. An '''embedding''', or a '''smooth embedding''', is defined to be an injective immersion which is an embedding in the topological sense mentioned above (i.e. [[homeomorphism]] onto its image).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bishop|Crittenden|1964|page=21}}. {{harvnb|Bishop|Goldberg|1968|page=40}}. {{harvnb|Crampin|Pirani|1994|page=243}}. {{harvnb|do Carmo|1994|page=11}}. {{harvnb|Flanders|1989|page=53}}. {{harvnb|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|page=12}}. {{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1963|page=9}}. {{harvnb|Kosinski|2007|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lang|1999|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lee|1997|page=15}}. {{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}}. {{harvnb|Warner|1983|page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other words, an embedding is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to its image, and in particular the image of an embedding must be a [[submanifold]]. An immersion is a local embedding (i.e. for any point &lt;math&gt;x\in M&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;x\in U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f:U\to N&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding.)

When the domain manifold is compact, the notion of a smooth embedding is equivalent to that of an injective immersion.

An important case is &lt;math&gt;N = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The interest here is in how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be for an embedding, in terms of the dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitney H., ''Differentiable manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''37''' (1936), pp. 645–680&lt;/ref&gt; states that &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; is enough, and is the best possible linear bound. For example the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a power of two, requires &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; for an embedding. However, this does not apply to immersions; for instance, '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be immersed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; as is explicitly shown by [[Boy's surface]]&amp;mdash;which has self-intersections. The [[Roman surface]] fails to be an immersion as it contains [[cross-cap]]s.

An embedding is '''proper''' if it behaves well with respect to [[Topological_manifold#Manifolds_with_boundary|boundaries]]: one requires the map &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; to be such that

*&lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) = f(X) \cap \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;, and
*&lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to &lt;math&gt;\partial Y&lt;/math&gt; in any point of &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The first condition is equivalent to having &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) \subseteq \partial Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X \setminus \partial X) \subseteq Y \setminus \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;. The second condition, roughly speaking, says that ''f''(''X'') is not tangent to the boundary of ''Y''.

===Riemannian geometry===

In [[Riemannian geometry]]:
Let (''M,g'') and (''N,h'') be [[Riemannian manifold]]s.
An '''isometric embedding''' is a smooth embedding ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' which preserves the  [[Riemannian metric|metric]] in the sense that ''g'' is equal to the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of ''h'' by ''f'', i.e. ''g'' = ''f''*''h''. Explicitly, for any two tangent vectors 

:&lt;math&gt;v,w\in T_x(M)&lt;/math&gt;

we have 

:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w)=h(df(v),df(w)).&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, '''isometric immersion''' is an immersion between Riemannian manifolds which preserves the Riemannian metrics.

Equivalently, an isometric embedding (immersion) is a smooth embedding (immersion) which preserves length of [[curve]]s (cf. [[Nash embedding theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nash J.,  ''The embedding problem for Riemannian manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''63''' (1956), 20–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebra==
In general, for an algebraic category ''C'', an embedding between two ''C''-algebraic structures ''X'' and ''Y'' is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''e'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} that is injective.

===Field theory===

In [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], an '''embedding''' of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''E'' in a field ''F'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''σ'' : ''E'' → ''F''}}.

The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''σ'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''E'' which cannot be the whole field ''E'', because of the condition {{nowrap|1=''σ''(1) = 1}}. Furthermore, it is a well-known property of fields that their only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole field itself. Therefore, the kernel is 0, so any embedding of fields is a [[monomorphism]]. Hence, ''E'' is [[isomorphic]] to the subfield ''σ''(''E'') of ''F''. This justifies the name ''embedding'' for an arbitrary homomorphism of fields.

===Universal algebra and model theory===
{{further|Substructure (mathematics)|Elementary equivalence}}
If σ is a [[signature (logic)|signature]] and &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are σ-[[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] (also called σ-algebras in [[universal algebra]] or models in [[model theory]]), then a map &lt;math&gt;h:A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a σ-embedding [[iff]] all of the following hold:
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is injective,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;h(f^A(a_1,\ldots,a_n))=f^B(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n))&lt;/math&gt;,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;R \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A \models R(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;B \models R(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n)).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;A\models R (a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a model theoretical notation equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in R^A&lt;/math&gt;. In model theory there is also a stronger notion of [[elementary embedding]].

==Order theory and domain theory==
In [[order theory]], an embedding of [[partial order]]s is a function F from X to Y such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1,x_2\in X: x_1\leq x_2\Leftrightarrow F(x_1)\leq F(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[domain theory]], an additional requirement is: 

:&lt;math&gt; \forall y\in Y:\{x: F(x)\leq y\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Directed set|directed]].

==Metric spaces==

A mapping &lt;math&gt;\phi: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; of [[metric spaces]] is called an ''embedding''
(with [[stretch factor|distortion]] &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) if 
:&lt;math&gt; L d_X(x, y) \leq d_Y(\phi(x), \phi(y)) \leq CLd_X(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
for some constant &lt;math&gt;L&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Normed spaces ===

An important special case is that of [[normed spaces]]; in this case it is natural to consider linear embeddings. 

One of the basic questions that can be asked about a finite-dimensional [[normed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; is, ''what is the maximal dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\ell_2^k&lt;/math&gt; can be linearly embedded into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with constant distortion?''

The answer is given by [[Dvoretzky's theorem]].

==Category theory==

In [[category theory]], there is no satisfactory and generally accepted definition of embeddings that is applicable in all categories. One would expect that all isomorphisms and all compositions of embeddings are embeddings, and that all embeddings are monomorphisms. Other typical requirements are: any [[monomorphism#Related concepts|extremal monomorphism]] is an embedding and embeddings are stable under [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]]s.

Ideally the class of all embedded [[subobject]]s of a given object, up to isomorphism, should also be [[small class|small]], and thus an [[ordered set]]. In this case, the category is said to be well powered with respect to the class of embeddings. This allows defining new local structures in the category (such as a [[closure operator]]). 

In a [[concrete category]], an '''embedding''' is a morphism ''ƒ'':&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' which is an injective function from the underlying set of ''A'' to the underlying set of ''B'' and is also an '''initial morphism''' in the following sense:
If ''g'' is a function from the underlying set of an object ''C'' to the underlying set of ''A'', and if its composition with ''ƒ'' is a morphism ''ƒg'':&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'', then ''g'' itself is a morphism.

A [[factorization system]] for a category also gives rise to a notion of embedding. If (''E'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') is a factorization system, then the morphisms in ''M'' may be regarded as the embeddings, especially when the category is well powered with respect to&amp;nbsp;''M''. Concrete theories often have a factorization system in which ''M'' consists of the embeddings in the previous sense. This is the case of the majority of the examples given in this article.

As usual in category theory, there is a [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept, known as quotient. All the preceding properties can be dualized.

An embedding can also refer to an [[Subcategory#Embeddings|embedding functor]].

Fisheries-induced evolution '''(FIE)''' is the [[microevolution]] of an exploited aquatic organism's population, brought on through the artificial selection for biological traits by [[Fishing techniques|fishing practices]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fishing, of any severity or effort, will impose an additional layer of mortality to the natural population equilibrium and will be selective to certain genetic traits within that organism's gene pool. This removal of selected traits fundamentally changes the population [[Allele frequency|gene frequency]], resulting in the artificially induced microevolution by the proxy of the survival of untargeted fish and their propagation of heritable biological characteristics. This artificial selection often counters natural [[Life history theory|life-history pattern]] for many species, such as causing early sexual maturation, diminished sizes for matured fish, and reduced fecundity in the form of smaller egg size, lower sperm counts and viability during reproductive events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These effects can have prolonged effects on the adaptability or fitness of the species to their environmental factors.  

Fisheries-induced evolution differ to the norm [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution model by the direct human factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Stephanie M.|last2=Edeline|first2=Eric|last3=Asbjørn Vøllestad|first3=L.|last4=Haugen|first4=Thrond.

== Causes ==
Fishing practices that permanently remove animals from their population (i.e. not [[catch and release]]) drive direct fisheries-induced evolution by removing the genetic materials of those animals from the population. Individuals that are untargeted, through the selection bias of fishing gears and/or legislation, are allowed to reproduce and proliferate their genetic materials. As fishing pressures persist, traits belonging to non-selected organisms are preserved through survival and become more dominant in frequency within the gene pool. Additionally, fishing on a targeted species incur knock-on effects to those around it by its disturbance of their natural interactions. In these situations, specific traits of the untargeted species may be favourable under the diminutive presence, or absence, of the targeted species, and therefore indirectly selected for.      

=== Direct selection ===
The direct selection for biological traits through fishery practices is the result of fishery management regulations, and gear restrictions and selectivities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heino|first=Mikko|last2=Díaz Pauli|first2=Beatriz|last3=Dieckmann|first3=Ulf|date=2015-12-04|title=Fisheries-Induced Evolution|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=461–480|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054339|issn=1543-592X|url=http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11318/1/HeinoEtAl2015-Fisheries-induced%20evolution%20IIASA%20AnnRevEcolEvolSyst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious artificial selection for traits through management legislation can be observed in the imposed regulations on size, sex, seasonality, and locations.  

Catch size regulations vary with specificity to the targeted species and is often used to prevent exploitation during a specific part of the life cycle for the organism. Such regulations arose in response to the effects of FIE observed by the fisheries of Atlantic Cod (''[[Atlantic cod|Gadus morhua]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakobsdóttir|first=Klara B.|last2=Pardoe|first2=Heidi|last3=Magnússon|first3=Árni|last4=Björnsson|first4=Höskuldur|last5=Pampoulie|first5=Christophe|last6=Ruzzante|first6=Daniel E.|last7=Marteinsdóttir|first7=Guðrún|date=2011-01-05|title=Historical changes in genotypic frequencies at the Pantophysin locus in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Icelandic waters: evidence of fisheries-induced selection?|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=562–573|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00176.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352422|pmid=25568005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the fishing technological revolution that has lead to the species moratorium, the exploitation of Atlantic Cod have been selective towards larger-sized fish since the 1500s. Catch data for the species have quantitatively shown that this selectivity for larger fish for over 500 years have shifted the life-history patterns, resulting in earlier sexual maturation and smaller sizes at said maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Esben M.|last2=Heino|first2=Mikko|last3=Lilly|first3=George R.|last4=Morgan|first4=M.

Sexual selectivity by a fishery works on the theoretical foundation that the preservation of females allows their reproductive input to offset the fishing mortality. Fisheries of species with low fecundity such as mud crabs (''Scylla serrata'') and blue swimmer crabs (''Portunus armatus'') often adopt this method and only allow the harvesting of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/fisheries/species-identification/inshore-estuarine-species/mud-crab|title=Mud crab (mangrove crab)|website=www.daf.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct selection for traits, with respect to sex selectivity, occurs when specific characteristics or behaviours increase the susceptibility of the organisms for harvest. For example, corking wrasses (''[[Corkwing wrasse|Symphodus melops]]'') are harvested as a biological control for sea lice within farmed salmon facilities of the northern hemisphere. Male fish dominate these wild fisheries in both catch per unit effort and weight owing to their strong nesting behaviour and territorial nature, which differentiate them from females and sneaker males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/40796/19/Hanssen--Master-2014.pdf|title=Consequences of Selective Harvesting a Small Temperate Fish Species Displaying Strong Male Dimorphism, the Corking Wrasse (Symphodus melops)|last=Hanssen|first=Benjamin|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent fishing pressures over the years have reduced maturation age and size for these nesting males, in addition to increasing the density of sneaker males to the detriment of the localised population.    

=== Indirect selection ===
Indirect fishery-induced evolution occurs when a species with some level of ecological significance is targeted by a fishery, and their diminished presence within the ecology causes a flow on effect to other untargeted species. [[Keystone species|Keystone]] or [[Umbrella species|umbrella]] species provide many ecological services to the environment which they belong to, ranging from the provision of habitat and food, to the control of biodiversity by preventing any one organism from dominating. Removal or reduction of these organisms often cause significant changes to the behaviours and physiology of the organisms which were once controlled. 

Non-migratory reef sharks (''[[Blacktip reef shark|Carcharhinus melanopterus]], [[Grey reef shark|C. amblyrhynchos]],'' and ''[[Whitetip reef shark|Triaenodon obesus]]'') play the vital role in weeding out sick and ill-adapted individuals from within a population, in addition to controlling the abundance of larger size fish. Thus, these sharks are an ever-present mortality factor for many reef organisms. Fisheries targeting these apex predators inherently allow for the proliferation of medium-sized predatory fishes (e.g. barracudas, juvenile groupers, trevallies, snappers) at the expense of the cohabiting smaller species. When this happen, the FIE responses observed from smaller species have been consistent with their increasing egg production and shifted life-history for early sexual maturation.

Another example of FIE that is instigated indirectly can be seen in the ornamental or aquarium trade industry. In particular, [[Coral|corals]] and [[Sea anemone|anemones]] are highly prized ornamental commodities and are often harvested at unsustainable rates for profit within the Malay archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Craig S.|last2=Hodgson|first2=Gregor|last3=Ambrose|first3=Richard F.|date=2005-09-07|title=Population impacts of collecting sea anemones and anemonefish for the marine aquarium trade in the Philippines|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=564–573|doi=10.1007/s00338-005-0027-z|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of anemones at rates higher than their resettlement into the reefs, as observed in the Philippines, is known to have caused drastic reduction in the localised population of clownfish or anemonefish (''[[Amphiprioninae|Amphiprion sp.]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madduppa|first=Hawis H.|last2=von Juterzenka|first2=Karen|last3=Syakir|first3=Mohammad|last4=Kochzius|first4=Marc|date=November 2014|title=Socio-economy of marine ornamental fishery and its impact on the population structure of the clown anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris and its host anemones in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|volume=100|pages=41–50|doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.07.013|issn=0964-5691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, anemone fish observed on reefs that were subjected to intense and prolonged anemone fishing were significantly smaller, even for mature adult pairs, than those found living with an anemone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisch|first=Ashley J.|last2=Rizzari|first2=Justin R.|last3=Munkres|first3=Katherine P.|last4=Hobbs|first4=Jean-Paul A.|date=2016-01-21|title=Anemonefish depletion reduces survival, growth, reproduction and fishery productivity of mutualistic anemone–anemonefish colonies|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=375–386|doi=10.1007/s00338-016-1401-8|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This size reduction is attributed to their need to hide in small coral crevices in the absence of a host.

== Evidence ==
Outside of observational data collected from active fisheries, the evidence for fisheries-induced evolution, or its symptoms, may be discerned through both commercial and recreational anecdotes. These stories often articulate the diminishing catch, reduction in their weight and length records, in addition to the mandatory increase to fishing efforts over time to attain similar fishing quotas to their historical references. However, experimental data was needed to clarify two fundamental questions regarding FIE, so that the aforementioned ramifications of smaller sizes and early maturation may not be attributed to non-anthropogenic factors such as population flux. The two evidentiary questions: a) Is fishing pressure capable of changing the gene frequency of a population to cause microevolution within such a short time frame? b) How can non-selective fishing gears (gill nets and trawlers) be selective for certain traits?  

=== Experimental evidence ===
The implementation of aquaculture experimental designs afford the possibility of isolating different biological traits and observing their impacts and heredity within a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Roger W.|date=June 1986|title=An approach to the quantitative analysis of domestication selection in aquaculture|journal=Aquaculture|volume=33|issue=1–4|pages=167–185|doi=10.1016/0044-8486(83)90398-8|issn=0044-8486}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study by Solberg et al. (2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solberg|first=Monica Favnebøe|last2=Skaala|first2=Øystein|last3=Nilsen|first3=Frank|last4=Glover|first4=Kevin Alan|date=2013-01-31|title=Does Domestication Cause Changes in Growth Reaction Norms? A Study of Farmed, Wild and Hybrid Atlantic Salmon Families Exposed to Environmental Stress|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e54469|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054469|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3561353|pmid=23382901}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that with sufficient fishing pressure and selectivity, a substantial change to a population genotype may be achieved without the geological time-frame often associated with evolution. In this study, Atlantic salmon (''[[Atlantic salmon|Salmo salar]]'') were subjected to a modified '[[Transplant experiment|common garden]]' design, and the researchers isolated stress as an abiotic independent variable to the growth rates of salmon. By selecting for fish with a lower biological response to stress, a domesticated population was created within 10 generations of breeding, which exhibited a threefold increase in growth rate over its wild counterpart. Thus, the difference between the absence of larger fish, which can be misattributed to overfishing, and FIE lies in the inherited biological characteristics that were untargeted by fishing.   

Fishing techniques such as [[Gillnetting|gill nets]] and [[Trawling#Environmental%20effects|trawling]] are often associated with a lack of selectivity within the environment which they are operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milton|first=David A.|last2=Die|first2=David|last3=Tenakanai|first3=Charles|last4=Swales|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Selectivity for barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the Fly River, Papua New Guinea: implications for managing gill-net fisheries on protandrous fishes|url=https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF98065|journal=Marine and Freshwater Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=6|pages=499|doi=10.1071/mf98065|issn=1323-1650}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish whether selectivity can occur under these practices, when fishing data suggest that an entire localised population may be caught or up to 80% of the effort to go to bycatches and not the targeted species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=R.W.D.|last2=Cripps|first2=S.J.|last3=Nickson|first3=A.|last4=Porter|first4=G.|date=July 2009|title=Defining and estimating global marine fisheries bycatch|journal=Marine Policy|volume=33|issue=4|pages=661–672|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2009.01.003|issn=0308-597X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment by Biro and Post (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biro|first=Peter A.|last2=Post|first2=John R.|date=2008-02-26|title=Rapid depletion of genotypes with fast growth and bold personality traits from harvested fish populations|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/8/2919|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=105|issue=8|pages=2919–2922|doi=10.1073/pnas.0708159105|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2268560|pmid=18299567}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that despite being mechanically unselective of gill nets, behavioural variation in certain fish species can indeed affect the likelihood of them being caught and therefore be a function for selectivity. Using a ‘[[Experimental evolution|selection experiment]] in the field’ model, two genotypes of rainbow trouts (''[[Rainbow trout|Oncorhynchus mykiss]]'') were transplanted into identical artificial lake habitats and subjected to matching gill net fishing pressures. The net in question were designed to capture all size variability within the simulated populations. Trouts exhibiting the genotypes for faster growth rates and therefore a more active lifestyle were found to have a 60% increase chance to be caught in comparison to those characterised by the more sedentary genotype. Therefore, for 'non-selective' fishing methods, the selecting factor rests not on the gear itself but on the inherent behavioural variations within the population.

== Implications ==
Fisheries-induced evolution is a function of the fishing-induced genetic drift, and to some extent represent the reduction of genetic diversity within the targeted population. For many exploited population, this reduction in genetic diversity has been predicted to reduce their adaptability to both environmental variability and ecological competitiveness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuparinen|first=Anna|last2=Hutchings|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=2012-07-07|title=Consequences of fisheries-induced evolution for population productivity and recovery potential|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1738/2571|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1738|pages=2571–2579|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0120|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3350703|pmid=22398166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the commonly observed fisheries-induced adaptation of younger and smaller size at sexual maturation counter specific life-history characteristics that would enable interspecies competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marty|first=Lise|last2=Dieckmann|first2=Ulf|last3=Ernande|first3=Bruno|date=January 2015|title=Fisheries-induced neutral and adaptive evolution in exploited fish populations and consequences for their adaptive potential|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310581/|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=8|issue=1|pages=47–63|doi=10.1111/eva.12220|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4310581|pmid=25667602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biological model by Kindsvater and Palkovacs (2017) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindsvater|first=Holly K.|last2=Palkovacs|first2=Eric P.|date=September 2017|title=Predicting Eco-evolutionary Impacts of Fishing on Body Size and Trophic Role of Atlantic Cod|journal=Copeia|language=en-US|volume=105|issue=3|pages=475–482|doi=10.1643/ot-16-533|issn=0045-8511}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that FIE Atlantic cod, due to their smaller sizes, actually belong to a lower trophic level irrespective of their original position prior to the species moratorium. Furthermore, the FIE effect of reducing egg counts and their viability have weakened the number of recruitments back into the population after spawning, thereby reducing the localised population density. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enberg|first=Katja|last2=Jørgensen|first2=Christian|last3=Dunlop|first3=Erin S.|last4=Heino|first4=Mikko|last5=Dieckmann|first5=Ulf|date=2009-07-31|title=ORIGINAL ARTICLE: Implications of fisheries-induced evolution for stock rebuilding and recovery|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=394–414|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2009.00077.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352485|pmid=25567888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Luis M.|last2=Riveros|first2=Marcela P.|last3=Fuentes|first3=Juan Pablo|last4=Pinochet|first4=Ramona|last5=Cárdenas|first5=Carla|last6=Sainte-Marie|first6=Bernard|date=2017-05-13|title=High fishing intensity reduces females' sperm reserve and brood fecundity in a eubrachyuran crab subject to sex- and size-biased harvest|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/9/2459/3823336|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=74|issue=9|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fsx077|issn=1054-3139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the reduced population abundance and smaller sizes, the increase in ''per capita'' resource has been stipulated to counteract the effects of competitions between different species by reducing intraspecific interactions, which can allow for maximal density-dependent growth to happen. This also means that for harvesting to be sustainable, yearly or seasonal assessment of viable reproductive stocks and their recruitment rates must be performed to account for the compromised fecundity and recovery statuses.   

There is limited data on the interactions between FIE affected species and their robustness to environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For many species, the additional mortality rate and the frequency of harvesting exerted by the fisheries make it difficult to elucidate how environmental factors such as temperatures, salinity and currents can be beneficial or detrimental for stocks, since their effects on deaths or recruitment gains are diminutive in comparison. However, with the rapidly evolving climates stemming from the anthropogenic inputs, an understanding of how FIE affects the adaptability of these aquatic population will be necessary, not only for future stock assessments, but also sustainable harvesting.

'''Florian Pumhösl''' (born 1971) is an artist based in [[Vienna]], mainly known for his works that employ abstract visual language to reflect on the diverse manifestations of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moussemagazine.it/florian-pumhosl-andrea-viliani-2008/|title=Florian Pumhösl •Mousse Magazine|website=moussemagazine.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Florian Pumhösl’s work is constituted by a constellation of historical references encoded within a visual language that appears purely formal. The apparent abstraction of his paintings, films, and installations is anchored by specific archival sources: 17th-century kimono designs, avant-garde typography, WWI military uniform patterns, cartography, Latin American textiles, and early dance notations. Through the selection, reduction, rearrangement, and reproduction of his source materials—unsystematic and subjective modes of transcription—the artist arrives at a vocabulary that is at once abstract and semiotically motivated.

Pumhösl’s compositions establish points of contact with realms traditionally consigned to the margins of modern art. Through attention to the social, political, and geographic genealogy of given forms, his works reveal that the modernist fantasy of complete self-referentiality was always already haunted by irreducible specificity and cultural instability. “I am calling into question to what extent it is possible to act within a space defined by the artist himself – a space that emerges from the hierarchy between my own authorship and its research sources, between historical references or concrete borrowings and what I can depict,” Pumhösl states. “My medium is the physical and historical space that I create using painting, architecture, film or photography.”

'''Fractal art''' is a form of [[algorithmic art]] created by calculating [[fractal]] objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and [[Algorithmic composition|media]]. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a genre of [[computer art]] and [[digital art]] which are part of [[new media art]]. The [[mathematical beauty]] of fractals lies at the intersection of [[generative art]] and [[computer art]].  They combine to produce a type of [[abstract art]].

Fractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Elysia Conner |date=February 25, 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Julia set]] and [[Mandelbrot set]]s can be considered as [[icon]]s of fractal art.&lt;ref name="hema"&gt;{{cite book |title=The heart of mathematics: an invitation to effective thinking |last=Burger |first=Edward B. |author2=Michael P. Starbird |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-931914-41-9 |page=475 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-qK8anbZmwC |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the [[calculation|calculative]] capabilities they provide.&lt;ref name="dima"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Mantras: The languages of abstract and virtual worlds |last=Steven R. |first=Holtzman |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-58143-4 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc5hnRuABy0C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fractals are generated by applying [[Iteration|iterative]] methods to solving non-linear equations or [[polynomial equation]]s. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fractal Fractal - Definition].

There are many different kinds of fractal images and can be subdivided into several groups. 
* Fractals derived from standard geometry by using iterative transformations on an initial common figure like a straight line (the Cantor dust or the [[Koch snowflake|von Koch curve]]), a triangle (the [[Sierpinski triangle]]), or a cube (the [[Menger sponge]]). The first fractal figures invented near the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries belong to this group.
* IFS ([[iterated function systems]])
* [[Strange attractors]]
* [[Flame fractals|Fractal flame]]
* [[L-system]] fractals
* Fractals created by the iteration of complex [[polynomial]]s:  perhaps the most famous fractals.
* [[Newton fractal]]s, including [[Nova fractal]]s
* [[Quaternionic]] and (recently) hypernionic{{clarify||date=January 2014}} fractals&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/ Quaternion Julia Fractals]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fractal terrain]]s generated by random fractal processes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fractalus.com/fractal-art-faq/faq03.html#3a Fractal Art FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mandelbulb]]s are a kind of three dimensional fractal.

[[Fractal Expressionism]] is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as [[self-similarity]] for example.  Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripped patterns.  They have been analysed and found to contain a [[fractal dimension]] which has been attributed to his technique.&lt;ref name="coex"&gt;{{cite book |title=Complexity explained |last=Érdi |first=Péter |authorlink=Péter Érdi|year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-35777-7 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgpLvknc8wC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Electricsheep-14525.jpg|thumb|Fractal image generated by [[Electric Sheep]]]]
{{main|Fractal-generating software}}
Fractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s.  Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from [[mainstream]] culture.&lt;ref name="ciem"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical issues in electronic media |last=Penny |first=Simon |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=0-7914-2317-4 |pages=81–82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzFJnyBjaLMC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation and landscape generation.

Fractals are sometimes combined with [[evolutionary algorithms]], either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the [[Electric Sheep]] project, where people use [[fractal flame]]s rendered with [[distributed computing]] as their [[screensaver]] and "rate" the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.

Many fractal images are admired because of their perceived [[Principles of art#Harmony|harmony]]. This is typically achieved by the [[pattern]]s which emerge from the [[Principles of art#Balance|balance]] of order and [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Similar qualities have been described in [[Chinese painting]] and [[Penjing|miniature trees and rockeries]].&lt;ref name="caftc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaos, complexity, curriculum and culture |editor1-first=William E. |editor1-last=Doll, Jr |editor2-first=Jayne |editor2-last=Fleener |editor3-first=Donna |editor3-last=Trueit |editor4-first=John |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=St. Julien |last=Wang |first=Hongyu |chapter=Chinese aesthetics, Fractals and the Tao of Curriculum |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8204-6780-1 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fROt7Yjz3xgC |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{main|Fractal landscape}}
The first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of ''[[Scientific American]]'', August 1985. This image showed a [[landscape]] formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) [[Mandelbrot set]]. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a [[plateau]] atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in ''[[The Beauty of Fractals]]'' by [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Michael M. Richter]]. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form &lt;math&gt;z^{2} + az^{4} + c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Artists==
Notable fractal artists include [[Desmond Paul Henry]], [[Hamid Naderi Yeganeh]] and musician [[Bruno Degazio]].  The British artist [[William Latham (computer scientist)|William Latham]], has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works.&lt;ref name="fpc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractals: The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink=John Briggs (author) |year=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-27693-5 |page=169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Sams]] has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts and textiles. American [[Vicky Brago-Mitchell]] has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. [[Scott Draves]] is credited with inventing flame fractals. [[Carlos Ginzburg]] has explored fractal art and developed a concept called "homo fractalus" which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal.&lt;ref name="cagi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html |title=Carlos Ginzburg |year=2001 |work=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |publisher=[[Leonardo,_The_International_Society_of_the_Arts,_Sciences_and_Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art.&lt;ref name="hfn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Heaven's fractal net: retrieving lost visions in the humanities, Volume 1 |last=Jackson |first=William Joseph |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21620-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0rJz7FC2z8C |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kerry Mitchell]] wrote a "Fractal Art Manifesto", claiming that&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |author=Mitchell, Kerry |authorlink=Kerry Mitchell |date= |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as [[Printmaking|prints]], bringing fractal artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into Fractal Art's digital realm. Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, Fractal Art is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

According to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, "fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;

More recently, American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]].

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD. December, 1997. "Gender Identity", ''The Nurse Practitioner''. Vo. 22, No. 12, P. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and continues into young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/factors-influencing-gender-identity/|title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Michael, "Cultural Identity, Language Identity, Gender Identity", "The English Academy of South Africa", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social learning theory]] posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way,&lt;ref name=myers&gt;Myers, David G. (2008). ''Psychology''. New York: Worth.&lt;/ref&gt; thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C.

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intersex people====
{{Main|Intersex}}
A survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that more than one in every hundred individuals may have some [[intersex]] characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2&lt;151::AID-AJHB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-F| issn = 1520-6300| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 151–166| last1 = Blackless| first1 = Melanie| last2 = Charuvastra| first2 = Anthony| last3 = Derryck| first3 = Amanda| last4 = Fausto-Sterling| first4 = Anne| last5 = Lauzanne| first5 = Karl| last6 = Lee| first6 = Ellen| title = How sexually dimorphic are we?

A 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised [[46,XY]] persons with [[penile agenesis]], [[cloacal exstrophy]] of the bladder, or penile [[ablation]], found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=423–38 |pmid=16010465 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4342-9 |title=Gender identity outcome in female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation |last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first=HF |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concludes: "The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens."

A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="furtado"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furtado P.

A study by Reiner &amp; Gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with [[cloacal exstrophy]] are sexually assigned female and raised as girls,&lt;ref name="Rosario" /&gt; according to an 'optimal gender policy' developed by [[John Money]]:&lt;ref name="swissnek" /&gt; in a sample of 14 children, follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests,&lt;ref name="Rosario"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isna.org/node/564|title=Reiner &amp; Gearhart's NEJM Study on Cloacal Exstrophy – Review by Vernon Rosario, M.D., Ph.D|website=[[Intersex Society of North America]]|last=Rosario|first=Vernon|authorlink=Vernon Rosario}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization.

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oswalt |first=Angela |title=Factors Influencing Gender Identity |url=http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415234240/http://www.sevencounties.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=37697&amp;cn=1272 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |publisher=Seven Countries Services, Inc. |accessdate=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental factors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-identity-disorder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306075726/http://www.genderdysphoria.org/genderdysphoria_medical.html Gender Dysphoria Organization Research and Education - About Gender Dysphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."&lt;ref name="GID" /&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example [[gender identity disorder in children]] (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|date=May 2003|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Prime Minister of Samoa|Samoan Prime Minister]] is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_5233232"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/5233232/Transsexuals-hailed-by-Samoan-PM |title=Transsexuals hailed by Samoan PM |author=Field, Michael |date=5 July 2011 |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated literally, fa'afafine means "in the manner of a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Pual L. Vasey, Nancy H. Bartlett, "What Can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" Teach Us About the Western Concept of Gender Identity Disorder in Childhood?", ''Biology and Medicine'', 50.4 (2007) 481-490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Розочка белое стекло.jpg|thumb|A broken bottle ready for glassing.]]
'''Glassing''' is a physical attack using a [[Drinking glass|glass]] or [[Beer bottle|bottle]] as a weapon. Glassings can occur at bars or pubs where alcohol is served and such items are readily available. The most common method of glassing involves the attacker smashing an intact glass in the face of the victim. However, the glass may be smashed before the attack, and then gripped by the remaining base of the glass or neck of the bottle with the broken shards protruding outwards. Glassing is easily prevented by using containers made from plastic or [[Toughened glass|tempered glass]] instead, but they suffer from unpleasant feel (plastic) and higher expense (for tempered glass). These alternative containers are slowly being adopted in areas with a high frequency of glassing, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. In New Zealand, a similar phenomenon is referred to as "bottling".

Common injuries resulting from glassings are heavy blood loss, permanent scarring, disfigurement and loss of sight through ocular injury. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year,&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1248571/Shatter-proof-pint-glasses-trialled-pubs-fight-drunken-violence.html |title=Shatter-proof pint glasses to be trialled in pubs to fight drunken violence |work=Daily Mail |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in over 5,000 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calling time on pub pint glasses|work=Manchester Evening News|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/22/22330_calling_time_on_pub_pint_glasses.html|date=2002-10-22|author=Ian Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glassing is a relatively small portion of all alcohol-related violence, constituting 9% of injuries from alcohol-related violence in New South Wales, from 1999 to 2011, for instance.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-109695.html Alcohol-related violence: Is “glassing” the big issue?], October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, following a series of glassing attacks in [[Manchester]], [[Greater Manchester Police]] and the [[Manchester Evening News]] launched a campaign ''Safe Glass Safe City'' promoting the use of [[toughened glass]] in pubs and clubs to prevent such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modifying Criminogenic Products: What Role for the Government?|journal=Crime Prevention Studies|volume=18|pages=49&amp;ndash;51|author=Ronald V.

===Australia===
At least three states in Australia are addressing glassing incidents by introducing regulations for liquor-licensed venues.

==== New South Wales ====
New South Wales introduced many restrictions in 2008, including the removal of glass after midnight for high-risk venues. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of glassings.&lt;ref name="wiley"/&gt;

==== Western Australia ====
In response to glassing violence, the [[government of Western Australia]] in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry on the use of tempered glass in hotels.&lt;ref name="perthnow"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Cordingley |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/wa-leads-in-fight-against-glassing-with-tempered-glassware-in-perth-pubs-and-bars/story-e6frg13u-1226012509118 |title=WA leads in fight against glassing with tempered glassware in Perth pubs and bars |publisher=PerthNow |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of tempered glass in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to tempered beer glasses in six to 12 months.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt; Royal Perth Hospital's head of plastic surgery Mark Duncan-Smith described it as an important step in protecting the public.&lt;ref name="perthnow" /&gt;

==== Queensland ====
In relation to continuing glassing incidents despite limited glass bans in [[Queensland]], Australia, state Liquor Licensing Minister Paul Lucas in 2011 predicted that almost all Queensland pubs and clubs would be (standard) glass-free in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alison Sandy |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/all-pubs-set-to-become-glass-free/story-fn6ck51p-1226020075518 |title=All pubs set to become glass-free |publisher=The Courier-Mail |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human Rights Day''' is celebrated annually across the world on 10 December every year.

The date was chosen to honour the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s adoption and proclamation, on 10 December 1948, of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first global enunciation of [[human rights]] and one of the first major achievements of the new [[United Nations]]. The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A/RES/423(V) |session=5 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |resolution_number=423(V) |url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&amp;DS=A/RES/423(V)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION |accessdate=29 October 2009 |date=4 December 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HumanRightsDay.aspx |title=The History of Human Rights Day |accessdate=29 October 2009 |author=Office of the High Commission for Human Rights |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addition it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] are awarded. Many [[international organization|governmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]] active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organizations.

==History==
[[File:Turkish journalists protesting imprisonment of their colleagues in 2016.jpg|thumb|Turkish journalists protesting [[Turkey's media purge after the failed July 2016 coup d'état|imprisonment]] of their colleagues, 10 December 2016]]
Human Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.in/human-rights-day-best-quotes-by-famous-personalities-mark-un-day-658792|title = Human Rights Day: Best Quotes By Famous Personalities to Mark UN Day|last = James|first = Anu|date = 9 December 2015|work = International Business Times|access-date = 9 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organizations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Human Rights|last = Lawson|first = Edward|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 1996|isbn = 9781560323624|location = |pages = 722–724|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J-SrdFtSuDUC&amp;lpg=PA723&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA723#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false|edition = 2nd|others = Research and contributing editor, Jan K. Dargel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the [[United Nations Postal Administration]] in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = United Nations and Human Rights|last = Green|first = James Frederick|publisher = The Brookings Institution|year = 1956|isbn = |location = |pages = 676|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wI58IE-n4H0C&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;pg=PA676#v=onepage&amp;q=%22human%20rights%20day%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USSR_stamp_1963_CPA_2963.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A 1963 [[postage stamp]] from [[Soviet Union]], [[commemorative stamp|commemorating]] the 15th [[anniversary]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].]]

When the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations", towards which individuals and societies should "strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance". The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as "being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|last = Cohen|first = G.

Although the Declaration with its broad range of [[civil and political rights|political, civil]], [[economic, social and cultural rights]] is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our{{who|date=December 2017}} daily lives.{{according to whom|date=December 2017}}

The High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official, and his Office play a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:

{{quote|Today, poverty prevails as the gravest human rights challenge in the world.

[[poverty reduction|Poverty eradication]] is an achievable goal.|[[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Louise Arbour]], 10 December 2006}}

'''Impunity''' means "exemption from punishment or loss or escape from fines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/impunity |title=Free Dictionary |publisher=Free Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[international law]] of [[human rights]], it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of [[human rights violations]] to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to [[justice]] and [[Legal remedy|redress]]. Impunity is especially common in countries that lack a tradition of the [[rule of law]], suffer from [[Political corruption|corruption]] or that have entrenched systems of [[patronage]], or where the [[judiciary]] is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special [[jurisdiction]]s or [[immunity from prosecution|immunities]].

The amended ''Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity'', submitted to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] on 8 February 2005, defines impunity as:
:"the impossibility, ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'', of bringing the perpetrators of violations to account – whether in criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings – since they are not subject to any inquiry that might lead to their being accused, arrested, tried and, if found guilty, sentenced to appropriate penalties, and to making reparations to their victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html |title=Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity |publisher=Derechos.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Principle of that same document states that:
:"Impunity arises from a failure by States to meet their obligations to investigate violations; to take appropriate measures in respect of the perpetrators, particularly in the area of justice, by ensuring that those suspected of criminal responsibility are prosecuted, tried and duly punished; to provide victims with effective remedies and to ensure that they receive reparation for the injuries suffered; to ensure the inalienable right to know the truth about violations; and to take other necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of violations."

[[Truth and reconciliation commission]]s are frequently established by nations emerging from periods marked by human rights violations – [[coup d'état|coups d'état]], [[military dictatorship]]s, [[civil war]]s, etc. – in order to cast light on the events of the past. While such mechanisms can assist in the ultimate prosecution of crimes and punishment of the guilty, they have often been criticised for perpetuating impunity by enabling violators to seek protection of concurrently adopted [[amnesty law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-next-international-justice "What Next for International Justice?"]''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of the Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]], adopted on 17 July 1998 and entered into force on 1 July 2002, is "to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators" [...] "of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;[Preamble, Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Abolitionist Federation''' ('''IAF'''; {{lang-fr|Fédération abolitioniste internationale}}), founded in Liverpool in 1875, aimed to abolish state regulation of [[prostitution]] and fought the international [[human trafficking|traffic in women]] in prostitution. It was originally called the '''British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution'''.{{efn|Sources disagree about the original name. One source says it was the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice".{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}} Another calls it the "British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution".{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}
Others call it the "British and Continental (later International) Federation for the Abolition of Governmental (later State) Regulation of Vice".{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=32}} }}

The federation was active in Europe, the Americas, and the European colonies and mandated territories. It felt that state regulations encouraged prostitution while having the effect of enslaving women in prostitution.
It felt that the solution lay in [[moral education]], [[empowerment]] of women through the right to acquire skills and work, and marriage.
The federation experienced opposition from the authorities in Europe and the colonies, who were unwilling to relinquish control, and from reformers who wanted to suppress traffic of women but were less concerned with their welfare.
After [[World War I]] (1914–18), the IAF was involved in discussions about [[League of Nations]] conventions on the issues, and after [[World War II]] (1939–45), about [[United Nations]] conventions.
In later years, the main focus was on eliminating unjust regulations that violated [[women's rights]].

==Background==

Regulation of prostitution in the 19th century typically consisted of policing, brothel licenses, red light districts, registration and forced medical examination of women in prostitution, and forced hospitalization of women in prostitution suffering from sexually transmitted diseases.
Abuses included police corruption, registration of underage girls, forced registration of vulnerable women, debt bondage and other ways in which women in brothels were exploited, as well as regulations and other practices that prevented women from leaving prostitution. In the colonies and mandated territories, the regulations were often related to military conquest and control.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}

[[File:Josephine Butler.jpg|thumb| [[Josephine Butler]], founder of the IAF]]
The English feminist [[Josephine Butler]] (1828–1906), who came from a family involved in the abolition of slavery, believed that forced vaginal examination of women suspected of prostitution violated their basic legal rights. She argued that women lacked sexual autonomy because they were excluded from higher education, professional training, and paid employment and therefore had to choose between marriage or prostitution. Either way, their condition was no different from that of a slave. 
Butler published many articles on the subject.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=32}}
She toured Europe in 1874 and 1875 to raise support for an international abolitionist movement.
In Italy she was able to talk with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=216}}

==Beliefs==

Butler and the pastors and friends who joined her at first campaigned for the "freedom and purity of our English Commonwealth", with which  
they alluded to the liberty of women and to morality and the family. They were against extra-marital sex but also against celibacy, which they felt leads to depravity.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}
The solution was marriage.
In 1882, Butler said, "The best of the restrictions imposed by law is that which encourages and, if necessary, forces citizens of both sexes to practice self-respect."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}

The abolition campaign rested on two main arguments. The first was "scientific evidence" that state regulation was ineffective and even harmful.
The second was that regulation was unacceptable even it were effective in terms of administration and health because it violated human liberty.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
The abolitionists supported the civil rights of women in prostitution and denied that the state had the right to organize prostitution.
Abolitionists were against the abuses inherent in state regulations and against restrictions on the basic freedoms of women in prostitution, such as their right to freedom of movement and to voluntary medical examination.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Butler asserted that regulation deprived women of the rights bestowed by the [[Magna Carta]] and the writ of [[habeas corpus]].{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}

The abolitionists pointed out the double standard of contemporary sexual morality due to which women's bodies were policed and controlled but their male customers were not regulated.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
They pointed out that this resulted in a double injustice "because it is unjust to punish the sex who are the victims of a vice, and leave unpunished the sex who are the main cause both of its vice and its dreaded consequences". Men both caused prostitution and enforced the system that shamed and punished the women who were its victims.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=37}}
The IAF said, "The social rehabilitation of prostitutes cannot solve the problem of prostitution unless other factors influence the causes of prostitution ... Too often prostitutes are subjected to a disguised form of imprisonment, on the pretext of rehabilitation, in spite of laws which do not state prostitution to be an offence."{{sfn|Roth|2011|p=51}}
The IAF felt that treating prostitution as a legal or tolerated institution was "a hygienic mistake, a social injustice, a moral outrage, and a judicial crime".{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=53}}

The abolitionists also thought the trafficking of women would be reduced by the abolition of state-regulated prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=8}}
They were uneasy about cooperating on measures against the white slave traffic with governments that regulated prostitution because they saw the governments as hypocritical in maintaining a system that created demand for the trafficked women.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=64}}

In the late 19th century, most IAF activists did not have the right to vote because [[women's suffrage]] only existed in very few countries.
They faced disapproval of open discussion of sexual matters by women. Their efforts to organize were sometimes countered by police repression.
The movement struggled to maintain coherence despite the different priorities and beliefs of its members and despite the continued expansion of the colonial and imperial system.
The IAF tried to be independent of any particular political, philosophical, religious, or ethnic ties but was in practice dominated by Europeans.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
The federation often looked to socialists for support, stressing the economic causes of prostitution among women unable to find other employment.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=64}}

==International meetings==
[[File:James Stansfeld, Vanity Fair, 1869-04-10.jpg|thumb|[[James Stansfeld]], general secretary of the federation]]
Various groups in different countries agitated against sexual slavery in the 1870s.
They formed an international federation thanks to the activity of Josephine Butler and a few other feminist leaders.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=148}}
The first meeting of the British branch was held in Liverpool in March 1875 and was attended by Italian representatives.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=216}}
The movement soon spread to other European countries, to European colonies or client states (India, Egypt, and the Dutch East Indies), and to the Americas.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
A pan-European international congress with six or seven hundred attendees was held in Geneva from 17 to 22 September 1877.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice was established at this meeting.{{sfn|Picarelli|2008|p=148}}

The supporters of the federation included a range of women including doctors, religious reformers, and feminists who were also active in organizations such as the [[International Council of Women]] and the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The federation was also supported by liberal or socialist men.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
It was one of the first unofficial international societies for social and legal reform.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
The resolutions stressed the importance of self-control, denied that debauchery was inevitable, decried impurity in both men and women, and called for the police to ensure that decency be respected in the street. They also said that "[c]ompulsory registration is an affront to liberty and to common law". There was thus tension between the disapproval of extramarital relations and the demand for women's liberty.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The International Union of Friends of Young Women was founded at this congress. This was a Protestant association that gave assistance to emigrating girls and women in an effort to prevent their sexual exploitation.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=44}}

The federation helped the national abolitionist organizations to communicate and make connections, but activity at the international level was difficult due to the profound differences between the different countries. These included "[t]he differences of language, of national and social traditions, of the state of public opinion and of the laws—and above all, the differences in the status of women".{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
At the international level, the focus had to be strictly on the repeal of state laws and regulations regarding prostitution.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}

The first annual conference of the federation was held in Paris from 24 to 25 September 1878 in a mood of optimism.
[[James Stansfeld]] (1820–1898), the general secretary, had been received by [[Émile Deshayes de Marcère]], the French minister of the interior.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The second congress of the federation, held in Genoa from 27 September to 4 October 1880, was attended by [[Yves Guyot]] and Emilie and Auguste de Morsier. The resolutions of this congress show that the liberal position had triumphed. 
There was no mention of repression of illicit sexuality, only demands for guarantees of individual liberty, the rule of law, and the abolition of the regulation of prostitution.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=219}}
The British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of Regulated Prostitution held its fifth conference in Geneva in 1889, where it solemnly denounced the international white slave trade.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=278}}{{efn|The term "white slave trade" was generally used before [[World War I]] and implied a primary concern with European women in prostitution.
The more general term "traffic in women" only came into widespread use in the inter-war period.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}} }}
The federation moved its headquarters to Geneva in 1898.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
It became the International Abolitionist Federation in 1902.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=490}}

==Local abolitionist movements==

===Britain===
[[File:Alison Neilans (1884-1942).jpg|thumb|[[Alison Neilans]] was the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH) general secretary in the 1920s.]]
In the 1870s Butler helped organize the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. 
The [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] had extended British regulations of women in prostitution in military areas to cover the whole country.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=44}}
The British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution: British Branch was formed in Liverpool on 19 March 1875.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}
The reformers used the name "abolition" as a reference to the earlier movement to abolish slavery, since they considered that state-regulated prostitution was a form of slavery of women.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
The British branch was based in Liverpool and had an office in Westminster, London.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=26}}
[[James Stansfeld]] was president, Josephine Butler secretary and Henry Wilson corresponding secretary. 
Later William Crosfield was made treasurer and James Stuart replaced Wilson.{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=25}}

The British association saw prostitution as part of the larger issue of social morality and the position of women.
Butler was also active in the suffrage movement.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
The concept that regulation was acceptable in the colonies but not in Europe was completely rejected since the arguments against regulation were considered to be based on universal principles. British reformers also worked in Australia, Ceylon, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, India, Malta, Singapore and South Africa.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=36}}
In 1886 the British Contagious Diseases Act was repealed, a victory for the abolitionists.{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}
This was followed by a large meeting to which delegates came from Europe and America to "consolidate the attack on regulation throughout the world".{{sfn|Berkovitch|1999|p=35}}

After the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed the branch concentrated on eliminating regulation of prostitution in the British Empire, and in India in particular. In 1890 it changed its name to the British Committee for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice in India and throughout the British Dominions.
In 1897 the branch re-launched the ''Shield'', a periodical that had supported repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act, after this act was re-enacted in India. In 1915 the branch merged with the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to form the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH).{{sfn|Doughan|Gordon|2014|p=26}}
The international abolitionist [[Alison Neilans]] (1884–1942)  was the AMSH general secretary in the 1920s.{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=53}}
The AMSH was a member of the IAF.{{sfn|Gorman|2012|p=71}}

===Netherlands===

Protestant reformers in the Dutch Réveil movement were concerned about the spread of municipal regulation between 1852 and 1877. They published translations of Butler's writings, and ran asylums for women in prostitution. Their main leader was the Reverend [[Hendrik Pierson]]. He met Butler at the 1877 congress in Geneva and was persuaded to join the IAF despite his misgivings about the secular nature of the organization and the influence of socialist feminists.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=96}}
In 1889 the Dutch Women's Union, which considered itself an offshoot of the IAF, had 3,000 members working for abolition of regulation and trying to prevent prostitution by assisting young women who were traveling. By the end of the 19th century the Dutch Women's Union had 5,000 members.
The feminist and physician [[Aletta Jacobs]] signed up to the cause of abolition.
Later she was one of the founders of the [[International Women's Suffrage Alliance]], 
Pierson became president of the IAF in 1898.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=98}}

===France===
[[File:Deraismes.jpg|thumb|[[Maria Deraismes]] (1828–1894) was an early Abolitionist leader in France]]
On 15 November 1876 Albert Caise, a founder of the ''Journal des femmes'', launched a petitition that called for brothels to be closed, the vice squad abolished, laws passed against provocation on public streets, more dispensaries and the return of women in prostitution to the rule of common law. The petition also called for free, compulsory education and new regulation of women's work.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=231}}
Butler saw Paris as "the great Babylon."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=217}}
In January 1877 Butler traveled to Paris with the main IAF representatives to launch a campaign against the actions of the vice squad, and spoke at various meetings. In her view the French Contagious Diseases Act, and the resulting "French system," caused enslavement of women and encouraged male immorality. She was against the "fetishism of socialist State worship" as well as "medical domination and legislative tyranny."{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=216}}

In an ordinance of 16 June 1879 the police authorized establishment of a French section of the British and Continental Federation, called the ''Association pour l'abolition de la prostitution réglementée'', with [[Victor Schœlcher]] (1804–1893) as president. The association included feminists, radicals and abolitionists.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}
The most active organizers of the French Association for the Abolition of Official Prostitution were the feminist leaders [[Maria Deraismes]], [[Emilie de Morsier]] and [[Caroline de Barrau]].{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=231}}
Josephine Butler visited Paris in April 1880. A meeting on 10 April 1880 was attended by about 2,000 people, mostly of the lower classes, including leaders of the extreme left in Paris. 
The speeches reflected the growing influence of the feminist movement.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=218}}

By the end of 1896 the abolitionist movement on France was moribund. Some of the members left the British and Continental Federation and formed a new ''Ligue française pour le relèvement de la moralité publique''. The new league called for abolition of the vice squad and the regulations that dishonored the police, compromised the magistrates and established inequality between men and women. The league was also concerned with fighting alcoholism, the white slave trade, immoral literature and license on the streets.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}

In 1897 Butler visited France, and a group led by Auguste de Morsier initiated re-foundation of a French branch of the IAF. 
The new organization was represented officially at the international abolitionist conference in London in 1898.
Between 1898 and 1907 the abolitionist movement in France revived, led first by Auguste de Morsier and then by [[Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix]] (1855–1939).{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}{{efn|Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix, a secular feminist and journalist, remained active in the movement until the mid-1930s.
She had met Butler at the 1898 IAF congress in London. She became secretary-general of the French branch of the IAF in 1900.
She later became chairperson of the committee on trafficking of the [[International Council of Women]].{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=116}} }}
In this period the IAF gained fresh support from periodicals. The ''Revue de morale sociale'' was dedicated to abolition.
A major conference was held in Lyons in 1901 at the height of the campaign.{{sfn|Corbin|1996|p=312}}

===Germany===
The first effective chapter of the IAF in Germany was organized in 1880 in Berlin, led by [[Gertrude Guillaume-Schack]].
Liberal Protestant activists in Germany were in close contact with the IAF, and [[Ludwig Weber (pastor)|Ludwig Weber]] (1846–1922) was on the IAF executive commission until 1887. However, the conservative Protestants had difficulty with the dominant liberal view that an individual had the right to do whatever they wanted with their body as long as they did not harm or affect the rights of others.
The liberals thought the state should defend the rights of citizens but should not impose any particular religious or moral values, while the conservatives thought "the state is the guardian of God's commandments." Conservatives were also unable to accept the outspoken role that women played in the IAF, feeling it was for men to take the initiative.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=16}}

[[File:Anna Pappritz in 1904.jpg|thumb| [[Anna Pappritz]] of Germany in 1904]]
In 1898 local associations of the IAF were formed by German women in several cities to fight against brothels and police control over women in prostitution.{{sfn|Janz|Schonpflug|2014|p=203}}
In 1899 [[Anna Pappritz]] (1861–1939) of Berlin met Butler at the International Women's Congress in London.{{sfn|Pappritz|1984|p=58}}
That year she founded and became chairperson of the Berlin branch of the IAF.{{sfn|Reinert|2001|pp=55ff}}
Anna Pappritz and [[Katharina Scheven]] became the two most influential leaders of the German branch of the IAF (DZIAF).{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=88}}
From 1902 to 1914 Pappritz and Scheven edited the DZIAF magazine ''Der Abolitionist''.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=78}}

The pre-war campaign of the DZIAF was largely ineffective. 
Attempts to revise the laws related to prostitution were abandoned with the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914–18).{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=125}}
Eventually the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33) passed the 1927 Law to Combat Venereal Disease, which abolished state regulation of prostitution.
The Berlin chapter of the IAF, later called the League for Protection of Women and Youth (''Bund für Frauen- und Jugendschutz''), was dissolved in 1933.{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=78}}

===Colonies and mandated territories===

By the mid 1920s Australia had in practice been regulating prostitution in Queensland and Western Australia for decades, and was under growing international pressure to abolish these regulations. 
The IAF significantly affected Australian policy and policing, although the country would resist signing the United Nations abolitionist conventions until the 1970s.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=116}}
The question of trafficking was raised in Australia in 1927, with foreigners blamed. 
The Attorney General's Department recommended deporting any foreign women in prostitution.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=115}}
However, although the IAF would not object to measures against men involved in trafficking, their position on excluding or repatriating foreign women in prostitution was less clear cut.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=116}}
Repressive measures meant "The prostitute was being considered as a special class which could be driven from place to place." 
The effect of forced repatriation was to cause considerable economic loss to the women, who arguably would have to work longer in prostitution as a result.{{sfn|Boris|Janssens|1999|p=117}}

In some areas under the control of the European powers there were high levels of foreign women among the women in prostitution, but after [[World War I]] the number of European women declined in areas such as Indochina and the Levant. When the IAF secretary visited Beirut in 1931 she reported that 14% of registered women in prostitution were foreign.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=31}}
The British branch of the IAF showed the clear connection between regulation and trafficking when it quoted the governor of Somaliland saying in 1936, "It will be necessary to regulate in all centers of the Italian African colonies a sufficiently large and often renewed supply of white women of another quality than honest women. They must be white women but not Italian—Italian women of that class should never be allowed to pass the frontiers of our Empire: it is an elementary question of prestige in relation to the natives."{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=34}}

==After World War II==

After [[World War II]] (1939–45) anti-slavery organizations such as the IAF continued to document the traffic in women and girls for the purpose of prostitution or marriage, but operated at the "bottom of the UN human rights hierarchy".{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=93}}
In December 1947 representatives of the IAF were among those who provided input into drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].{{sfn|Morsink|2011|p=9}}
The United Nations' 1949 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was only ratified by a few states since most would have had to first change their laws related to prostitution.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=93}}

In 1954, the British put forward a draft convention on slavery for the United Nations, which formed the basis for the 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]], the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.{{sfn|Allain|2008|p=249}}
The IAF was involved in discussions of the wording, as were other NGOs such as the Women's International Organization and the [[Anti-Slavery Society]]. The IAF was generally opposed to efforts that might weaken the language, which called for abolition of slavery as soon as possible.{{sfn|Allain|2008|pp=251ff}}
In 1974, the UN Commission of Human Rights set up the Working Group on Slavery, in which the IAF participated.{{sfn|Harrington|2013|p=94}}
The working group discussed female genital mutilation, which the IAF argued fitted the definition of slavery since the women affected had lost control of their bodies.
Since the main support for the practice came from the mothers of the women, who were certainly not slaves, the working group eventually dropped the issue.{{sfn|Miers|2003|p=416}}
In 1985, the IAF provided information to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.{{sfn|Ramcharan|1989|p=195}}

The federation held its 29th international congress in September 1987 in Vienna, Austria.{{sfn|Barry|1996|p=358}}
In France it was associated with organizations that gave shelter and retraining to women in prostitution so they could enter a new occupation.{{sfn|Barry|1996|p=289}}
The IAF was involved in the formulation of the United Nations 2000 protocol on trafficking in persons, joining with organizations such as the US-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Persons and the [[European Women's Lobby]]. A compromise had to be made with anti-abolitionist NGOs and supporters of sex workers' rights, and the agreed formula therefore restricted the definition to cases involving coercion or deception. 
It was extended to cover trafficking for other purposes, marking a shift from women's sexuality and morality to a focus on crime and working conditions.{{sfn|Territo|Kirkham|2010|p=351}}

==Opposing views==
[[File:Lady Henry Somerset.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Henry Somerset]] of the WCTU favored regulation in India]]
Authorities in the European countries and their colonial territories often saw abolition of regulations as a threat to their authority.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Male-led "purity reformers" also saw no need to protect the rights of women in prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
In 1899 the purity reformers founded the International Bureau for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (later Traffic in Women and Children, then Traffic in Persons).
These later changes in name reflected shifts in focus to include non-white women and boys being trafficked for prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=6}}
The International Bureau felt the state should have control over the sexual activities of which they disapproved, but avoided the question of regulation. Each national committee of the Bureau wanted to protect the women of their own country from export to foreign brothels, and to criminalize women imported from other countries.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=8}}
The state authorities preferred to work with the International Bureau, which did not challenge their authority to prosecute unregistered women in prostitution and brothels, to import voluntary prostitutes and to deport foreign women in prostitution.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=9}}

The movement also had to address women who thought regulations should be reformed rather than abolished. 
These women, often from the upper classes, thought greater control of prostitution would reduce the health risks from sexually transmitted diseases, both for the men buying sex and for their wives, and reduced the risk of women being attacked by men unable to find an outlet for their sexual urges.
Thus [[Lady Henry Somerset]], first vice-president of the [[World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], advocated reforming regulations in India rather than abolishing them. 
IAF activists in all countries were consistently opposed to such a position.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2013}}
Supporters of regulation were able to show statements from women in prostitution that they felt safer in brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had a clean bill of health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation. Abolitionists said these were exceptional cases. Interviews by IAF and Women's Christian Temperance Union reformers in India in the late 19th century showed that women in prostitution serving the troops detested the compulsory medical checks.{{sfn|Limoncelli|2010|p=27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29295">'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].

Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.

In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.

==Theory of judicial independence==
[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865. In ''[[Federalist No. 78|The Federalist No. 78]]'', published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: "The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution."]]

===Importance===
Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] encroachment upon those rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexander Hamilton|authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|contribution=The Federalist No. 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-7DDxR-3KQC&amp;pg=PA524|editor=Jacob E. Cooke, ed.|title=The Federalist|location=Middletown, Conn.|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|year=1982|origyear=1961|pages=521–530 at 524|isbn=978-0-819-53016-5|quote=The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ... Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a foundation for the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]]. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom, ed.|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183–224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roger K. Warren|title=The Importance of Judicial Independence and Accountability|url=https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Center for State Courts]]|date=January 2003 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111072722/https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |archive-date=11 November 2018 |ref=CITEREFWarren (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 93A, and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=204A|ed=2007}}, ss. 71–80; and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2007}}, ss. 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2–3}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3–5}}

Also, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}

==Economic basis==
[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.

==Development of the concept==

===National and international developments===

The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009&gt;S Shetreet, ‘The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges’ (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009/&gt;

A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was evident when England’s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu’s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;See Baron de Montesquieu, The Sfdfsdfpirit of the Laws (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution’s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Article III of the US Constitution provides that “the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.”&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;UK Human Rights Act - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&gt; (visited Mar 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161–74 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55–68 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him&lt;/ref&gt; marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country’s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, “The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.”&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International standards===
The [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Scopus Approved Revised International Standards of Judicial Independence Approved March 19, 2008|url=http://www.jiwp.org/#!mt-scopus-standards/c14de|publisher=International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace - International Project of judicial independence|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The justice system===

In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Shetreet, Fundamental Values of the Justice System, 23 THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW 61-76, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Canada]] has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.

The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.
There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.

== Hong Kong ==
In [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_4 "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 4, Section 4], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
{{main|Judicial independence in Singapore}}
Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the [[Constitution of Singapore]], statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the [[common law]]. To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.

The [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.

During the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary usage====
Under the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in "good order," they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="legal_serves_act_2007"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

===Federal courts===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

The Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] "by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]." Once appointed, federal judges:

{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}

Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase "during good behavior" predates the Declaration of Independence. [[John Adams]] equated it with ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' in a letter to the [[Boston Gazette]] published on 11 January 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, Vol 3|last=Adams|first=John|year=1851|publisher=Little and Brown|place=Boston|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] in England.

The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the [[American Bar Association]], whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee "Well Qualified," "Qualified" or "Not Qualified."

===State courts===
[[State court (United States)|State courts]] deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both [[trial court]]s and [[appellate court]]s (including [[state supreme court]]s), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12977">In mathematics, '''Kostant's convexity theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Bertram|last=Kostant|year=1973|authorlink=Bertram Kostant}},  states that the projection of every [[coadjoint orbit]] of a connected [[compact Lie group]] into the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] is a [[convex set]]. It is a special case of a more general result for [[symmetric space]]s. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of {{harvtxt|Schur|1923}}, {{harvtxt|Horn|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Thompson|1972}} for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all ''n'' by ''n'' complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.

Kostant used this to generalize the [[Golden–Thompson inequality]] to all compact groups.

==Compact Lie groups==
Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with [[maximal torus]] ''T'' and [[Weyl group]] ''W'' = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/''T''. Let their Lie algebras be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''P'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the Weyl group.

==Symmetric spaces==
Let ''G'' be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with ''K'' a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the [[identity component]] of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus ''G''/''K'' is a [[symmetric space]] of compact type. Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let ''Q'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad(''K'')-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, ''Q''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices the ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the [[restricted Weyl group]] (the normalizer of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' modulo its centralizer).

The case of a compact Lie group is the special case where ''G'' = ''K'' × ''K'', ''K'' is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of ''G'' interchanging the two factors.

==Proof for a compact Lie group==
Kostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1984}}. There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to {{harvtxt|Wildberger|1993}}: it is based on a generalization of the [[Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm]] to compact Lie groups.

Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into ''K''. A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if  ''Y'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''k'' varies in this image of SU(2), then ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') traces a straight line between ''P''(''Y'') and its reflection in the root α.  In particular the component in the α root space—its "α off-diagonal coordinate"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from ''P''(''Y'') to ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of ''Y''. Let ''m'' be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of ''K''/''T''. Starting from an arbitrary ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Continue in this way, to get a sequence (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P^\perp(Y_{n+1})\|^2\le \left({m-1\over m}\right)\|P^\perp(Y_n)\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to 0 and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P(Y_{n+1}-Y_n)\|\le \|P^\perp(Y_n)\|.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence, so  tends to ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊕ ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''X''. On the other hand, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies on the line segment joining ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and its reflection in the root α. Thus ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. These convex polytopes are thus increasing as ''n'' increases and hence ''P''(''Y'') lies in the polytope for ''X''. This can be repeated for each ''Z'' in the ''K''-orbit of ''X''. The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of ''X'' and hence ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is contained in the convex polytope defined by ''W''(''X'').

To prove the opposite inclusion, take ''X'' to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points ''Y'' in the convex hull of ''W''(''X'') can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality ''X'' corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of ''K'' with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) Each part of the path from ''X'' to ''Y'' can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'').

==Other proofs==
{{harvtxt|Heckman|1982}} gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in {{harvtxt|Hilgert|Hofmann|Lawson|1989}}. For compact groups, {{harvtxt|Atiyah|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Guillemin|Sternberg|1982}} showed that if ''M'' is a [[symplectic manifold]] with a Hamiltonian action of a torus ''T'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, then the image of the [[moment map]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{t}^*}&lt;/math&gt;

is a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' (the image is a finite set). Taking for ''M'' a coadjoint orbit of ''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the moment map for ''T'' is the composition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{k}^*\rightarrow \mathfrak{t}^*.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Ad-invariant inner product to identify &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the map becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(K)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{t},}&lt;/math&gt;

the restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, the fixed points of ''T'' in the orbit Ad(''K'')⋅''X'' are just the orbit under the Weyl group, ''W''(''X''). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices. {{harvtxt|Ziegler|1992}} gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.

{{harvtxt|Duistermaat|1983}} showed that a generalization of the convexity properties of the moment map could be used to treat the more general case of symmetric spaces. Let τ be a smooth involution of ''M'' which takes the symplectic form ω to −ω and such that ''t'' ∘ τ = τ ∘ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''M'' and the fixed point set of τ (assumed to be non-empty) have the same image under the moment map. To apply this, let ''T'' = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, a torus in ''G''. If ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; as before the moment map yields the projection map

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(G)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{a}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let τ be the map τ(''Y'') =  − σ(''Y''). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad(''K'')⋅''X''. Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' on Ad(''G'')⋅''X'', i.e. the points ''w''(''X'') for ''w'' in ''W'' = N&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/C&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'').

==Further directions==
In {{harvtxt|Kostant|1973}} the convexity theorem is deduced from a more general convexity theorem concerning the projection onto the  component ''A'' in the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] ''G'' = ''KAN'' of a real semisimple Lie group ''G''. The result discussed above for compact Lie groups  ''K'' corresponds to the special case when ''G'' is the [[complexification]] of ''K'': in this case the Lie algebra of ''A'' can be identified with &lt;math&gt; i \mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The more general version of Kostant's theorem has also been generalized to semisimple symmetric spaces by {{harvtxt|van den Ban|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Kac|Peterson|1984}} gave a generalization for infinite-dimensional groups.

Several authors have put forth arguments concerning the '''[[legality]] of the [[War on Drugs]]'''. In his essay ''The Drug War and the Constitution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulhager.org/libertarian/drug_con.html |title=The Drug War and the Constitution |last=Hager |first=Paul |year=1991 |work=The Libertarian Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian philosopher Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

==Federalism argument==
In her dissent in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' (a case argued by [[Randy Barnett]]), [[Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that drug prohibition is an improper usurpation of the [[commerce clause|power to regulate interstate commerce]], and the power to prohibit should be [[states rights|reserved by the states]]. In the same case, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a stronger dissent expressing a similar idea. Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] joined O'Connor's dissent.

==Substantive due process==
Another argument against drug prohibition is based on the notion that its practice violates implicit rights within the [[substantive due process]] doctrine. It has been suggested that anti-drug laws do not achieve enough reasonable benefit to State interests to justify arbitrarily restricting basic individual liberties that are supposed to be guaranteed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the US Constitution. One proponent of this notion is attorney [[Warren Redlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |title=A Substantive Due Process Challenge to the War on Drugs |last=Redlich |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Redlich |date=2005-02-05 |format=PDF |quote=It is true that the approach suggested in this paper would limit police power. Constitutional protection of individual rights exists for that very purpose. We face coercive government action, carried out in a corrupt and racist manner, with military and paramilitary assaults on our homes, leading to mass incarceration and innocent deaths. We can never forget the tyranny of a government unrestrained by an independent judiciary. Our courts must end the War on Drugs. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217035034/http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the U.S. State of Florida attempted to eliminate criminal intent as an element of the crime of drug possession. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that the Florida law was unconstitutional, saying that the elimination of the element of intent was "atavistic and repugnant to the common law". Nellie King, president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, explained the ruling in terms of due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/federal-judge-rules-floridas-drug-law-unconstitutional-1665859.html |title=Federal judge rules Florida's drug law unconstitutional |last=Spencer-Wendel |first=Susan |date=July 28, 2011 |work=Palm Beach Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is subject to appeal.

The substantive due process argument is sometimes used in [[medical marijuana]] cases. [[NORML]] once wrote in an [[amicus brief]] on ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' that the right to use [[medical marijuana]] to save one's life is within the rights established by the substantive due process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=4950 Amicus brief] NORML&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found against the medical [[marijuana dispensary]] and for the United States in the aforementioned case. Some&lt;!--as in some Wikipedia editors--&gt; apparently believe that this invalidates the substantive due process argument against the [[Controlled Substances Act]].

However, the Supreme Court expressly ''declined'' to rule on the issue of substantive due process in the aforementioned case, ruling against the medical [[marijuana dispensary]] in question on grounds of statutory construction, as the Court found that there was no standalone medical necessity defense in the Controlled Substances Act. Justice Clarence Thomas' majority opinion clearly explains that the Court did not consider any Constitutional arguments in coming to the conclusion that it reached. As Justice Thomas expressly states in his majority opinion: "Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statute exceeds Congress’ Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]], and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth]] Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do so in the first instance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-151.ZO.html United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative, Majority Opinion of Justice Thomas] United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the question of the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act under the doctrine of substantive due process remains an open one, undecided by the Supreme Court, and debated by the citizens of the United States. Even some opponents of the substantive due process argument who support the War on Drugs have noted that the doctrine could potentially lead to the invalidation of anti-drug laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boalt.org/bjcl/v8/v8tennenprint.htm Is the Constitution in Harm's Way? Substantive Due Process and Criminal Law] Eric Tennen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule of law==

It is argued that the reverse [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in drug-possession cases is incompatible with the [[rule of law]] in that the power to convict is effectively taken from the courts and given to those who are willing to plant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.indymedia.org/local/universally-unconstitutional-war-drugs-3rd-ed |title=The universally unconstitutional war on drugs (3rd Ed.) |last=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion and conscience==

{{further|Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal|Cognitive liberty}}

A special problem is created by government prohibition of [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]], [[peyote]], [[magic mushrooms|psilocybin mushrooms]], [[cannabis]], and [[ayahuasca]].  Some people use such substances with definite cognitive, spiritual or religious motives. Use of [[peyote]] and [[ayahuasca]] is currently legal in the US for members of certain recognized religions (e.g., [[Native American Church]]).  However nothing in the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment]] implies that sincere and responsible exercise of freedom of religion or conscience requires formal affiliation with an established religious denomination.

Engel|Stephen Engel]] in an effort to explain the [[Social change|partiality of political change]], he described it as membership in a social/racial/ethnic group "not having [[Civil and political rights|full legal protections]] against workplace, housing, family, and other kinds of discrimination."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Less-than-whole citizenship, as a term, can be used to distinguish [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship|nationality from citizenship]] and also to establish restrictions on rights of [[Jus sanguinis|inheritance of nationality]] of children from parents (as was the case of [[Italian nationality law#Legislative History of Italian Citizenship|Italy for mothers]]).

The term is in contrast to Cornell Law professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]]'s designation of these types of citizenships as also "second class" in his text, however, he also uses the [[Obergefell v. Hodges|2015 ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' Supreme Court case]] and the civil rights of the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ community]] to illustrate a compartmentalization of citizenry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorf|first=Michael C.|date=January 1, 2011|title=SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP, AND LAW'S SOCIAL MEANINGS|jstor=41261549|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1267–1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas]]''. As of June 26, 2015, all states license and recognize [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|marriage between same-sex couples]] on account of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''. However, the United States has no federal law outlawing discrimination nationwide, leaving residents in some states without protection from discrimination, other than from federal executive orders which have a more limited scope than from protections through federal legislation. There is no federal statute addressing employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Protections at the national level are limited. Some regulations protect government employees but do not extend their protections to the private sector. Twenty-two states, the [[Washington, DC|District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], and over 140 cities and counties have enacted bans on discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=586–626|jstor=10.1086/661653|author=András Tilcsik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physiology]], [[psychology]], or [[psychophysics]], a '''limen''' or a '''liminal point''' is a [[sensory threshold|threshold]] of a physiological or psychological response. It is the boundary of perception. On one side of a limen (or threshold) a stimulus is perceivable, on the other side it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jameson K. |last1=Holden|first2= Eric M. |last2=Francisco|first3= Zheng |last3=Zhang|first4=Cristina |last4=Baric|first5= Mark |last5=Tommerdahl|title=An Undergraduate Laboratory Exercise to Study Weber’s Law|journal=Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71-74|date=2011|pmid=23493843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liminal''', as an adjective, means situated at a sensory threshold, hence barely perceptible. Subliminal means below perception.
The [[absolute threshold]] is the lowest amount of sensation detectable by a sense organ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2914">In [[mathematics]], '''Lindelöf's lemma''' is a simple but useful [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] in [[topology]] on the [[real line]], named for the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[mathematician]] [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]].

==Statement of the lemma==

Let the real line have its standard topology. Then every [[Open set|open]] [[subset]] of the real line is a [[Countable set|countable]] [[Union (set theory)|union]] of open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s.

==Generalization ==

Lindelöf's lemma is also known as the statement that every open cover in a [[second-countable space]] has a countable [[cover (topology)|subcover]] (Kelley 1955:49). This means that every [[second-countable space]] is also  a [[Lindelöf space]].

In order to see this, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; be an open cover of a topological space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; which has a countable [[Base (topology)|basis]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U=\bigcup\{ B\in \mathcal{B}\mid B\subseteq U\}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;U\in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. Especially, the system &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\colon=\bigcup_{U\in \mathcal{U}}\{B\in \mathcal{B} \mid B\subseteq U\}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty. As &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup \mathcal{U}=\bigcup_{U\in \mathcal{U}}\left(\bigcup\{B\in \mathcal{B}\mid B\subseteq U\}\right)=\bigcup\left(\bigcup_{U\in \mathcal{U}}\{B\in \mathcal{B}\mid B\subseteq U\}\right)=\bigcup \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt;, the system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; as well. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\subseteq \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt; is countable. Since for every &lt;math&gt;B\in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{U\in \mathcal{U}\mid B\subseteq U\}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty by definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal U}&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u\in \prod_{B\in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}}\{U\in \mathcal{U}\mid B\subseteq U\}&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Axiom of choice|axiom of (at least countable) choice]]. The system &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{V}\colon=u(\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal U})=\{u(B)\mid B\in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subsystem of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; by construction. It is countable because &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt; is. And since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}&lt;/math&gt; covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{V} &lt;/math&gt;, the system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is also a cover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; has a countable subcover.

'''Mabel Vernon''' (September 19, 1883 – September 2, 1975) was a U.S. suffragist, pacifist, and a national leader in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|United States suffrage movement]]. She was a [[Quakers|Quaker]] and a member of the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]]. Vernon was inspired by the methods used by the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] in Britain. Vernon was one of the principal members of the [[Congressional Union for Women Suffrage]] (CUWS) alongside [[Olympia Brown]], [[Inez Milholland]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Lucy Burns]], and [[Alice Paul]], and helped to organize the [[Silent Sentinels]] protests that involved daily picketing of Woodrow Wilson's [[White House]].

==Early life and education==
Mabel Vernon was born on September 19, 1883 in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. She graduated from [[Wilmington Friends School]] in 1901. She went on to attend [[Swarthmore College]] where she was a year ahead of Alice Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardini 1986|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon graduated from Swarthmore in 1906. She then became a teacher at [[Radnor High School]] in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]] where she taught [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

==Organizing for woman suffrage==
Vernon attended the 1912 convention of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], where she was an usher. She was the first paid organizer that Alice Paul recruited. Vernon joined Lucy Burns and Paul as part of NAWSA's Congressional Committee to organize the [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913]] that was to occur the following March where it would coincide with the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. During the Summer of 1913, Vernon and Edith Marsden campaigned for suffrage in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillmore 1921|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Vernon organized for the [[Congressional Union]], travelling through the [[Southwestern United States]] and making her way north through California before arriving in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillmore 1921|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accomplished fundraiser,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walton 2010}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAWbMy0IvkkC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=mabel%20vernon&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 99] "[s]he would make her pitch and ask for a thousand dollars. A plant in the audience would volunteer the money. Next, recalled fellow organizer Hazel Hunkins, 'She'd say, 'Now the next thousand.' ...Before long she'd have $5,000, sometimes $10,000. Then we small-fry would go up and down the aisles to collect silver by the bushel. I never saw a woman bleed an audience as Mabel did."&lt;/ref&gt; she assisted [[Anne Henrietta Martin|Anne Martin]] in Nevada, who was working for NAWSA on a referendum campaign. After Martin got into a debate with Senator [[Key Pittman]], [[Anna Howard Shaw]] wrote her an angry letter accusing her of being duped by Vernon and the CU.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardini 1986|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1915, Vernon organized greeting parades ahead of [[Sara Bard Field]], who was driving a petition with 500,000 signatures across the United States to be presented to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillmore|1921}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HRdgL0Or2vYC&amp;dq=mabel%20vernon&amp;pg=PA328#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholten|first=Catherine M.|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|chapter=FIELD, Sara Bard|year=1993|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ.

At a June 1916 convention in Chicago, women from states that had granted them the right to vote gathered to form the [[National Woman's Party]]. The Democratic Party had adopted a suffrage plank that advocated state's rights to choose suffrage, but continued to block national suffrage. Frustrated with the situation, Vernon interrupted President Woodrow Wilson during a speech he was giving at the dedication of the Labor Temple in Washington on July 4, querying, "Mr. President, if you sincerely desire to forward the interests of all the people, why do you oppose the national enfranchisement of women?" Wilson dismissed the question and when Vernon repeated the question again later, police ordered her to leave the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens 1995|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernon was a key organizer of the campaign of the [[Silent Sentinels]] that began in January 10, 1917. She was responsible for ensuring that there were enough volunteers each day to picket the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardini 1986|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon and Paul organized themed days for the picket where all of the volunteers were from certain states or from certain professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardini 1986|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their strategy ensured consistent press coverage and the eighteen-month campaign saw thousands of women participate and culminated in the arrests of many picketers and the "[[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walton|2010|pp=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a convention in March 1917, it was decided to merge the Congressional Union and the [[National Woman's Party]]. Following the vote, Vernon was selected to be Secretary of the NWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardini 1986|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; After President Wilson announced the [[American entry into World War I]], a committee was able to secure an audience with Wilson on the issue of suffrage. [[Doris Stevens]], in her memoir ''Jailed for Freedom'', wrote that the President was moved when Mabel Vernon said "If the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government is so sacred a cause to foreign people as to constitute the reason for our entering the international war in its defense, will you not, Mr. President, give immediate aid to the measure before Congress demanding self-government for the women of this country?"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens 1995|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernon was among the first six women who were arrested while picketing the White House, under charges of "obstructing the traffic." They were tried and found guilty on June 26, 1917 and each was ordered to pay a 25 dollar fine or spend three days in jail. All of the women insisted they were innocent and refused to pay the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens 1995|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], during the 1920s, Vernon supported women candidates for Congress and lobbied on behalf of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Kristina|title=Mabel Vernon (1883-1975)|url=http://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/mabel-vernon/|publisher=National Women's History Museum|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernon went to [[Columbia University]] where she earned a master's degree in political science in 1924.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Officers and National Organizers T-Z: Mabel Vernon (1883-1975)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles9.html|work=American Memory|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

In 1930, Vernon turned her attention from the women's movement to focus on international relations and peace. She was a proponent of Latin American rights and [[disarmament]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; Vernon joined the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in 1930. She was director of the Peoples Mandate Committee for Inter-American Peace and Cooperation in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JUSTICE STRESSED IN PEACE FORMULA: Pan-American Women Press Free Choice of Rule and Bill of Rights on Paris Parley Approved Unanimously Temporary Compromise Seen|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 March 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the Inter-American delegation to the foundation of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Carol Hurd|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ.

Beginning in 1951, Vernon lived with her companion [[Consuelo Reyes-Calderon]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mabel Vernon (1883-1975)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles9.html|work=Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vernon died on September 2, 1975.

In the 2004 film ''[[Iron Jawed Angels]]'' she was portrayed by [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooke Smith as Mabel Vernon|url=http://iron-jawed-angels.com/castphotos_brooke.htm|work=Iron Jawed Angels|publisher=HBO Films|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film doesn't depict her being arrested and imprisoned: instead, she is shown managing the NWP during Alice Paul's incarceration, including working with lawyers on appeals for the suffragettes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">The '''marginal propensity to save''' ('''MPS''') is the fraction of an increase in [[income]] that is not spent on an increase in [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. That is, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for [[saving]]. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.

The MPS plays a central role in [[Keynesian economics]] as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to [[Keynes]] it reflects the [[fundamental psychological law]]. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]].

==Calculation==

MPS can be calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{\text{Change in Savings}}{\text{Change in Income}}&lt;/math&gt;

Or mathematically, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) function is expressed as the derivative of the savings (S) function with respect to [[disposable income]] (Y).

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{dS}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;  where, dS=Change in Savings and dY=Change in income.

===An example===

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width=20%| 
!! width=40%| Saving
!! width=40%| Income
|-
| align="center" | A
| align="center" | 200
| align="center" | 1000
|-
| align="center" | B
| align="center" | 400
| align="center" | 1500
|}

Now, MPS can be calculated as follows:

: '''Change in savings''' = (400-200) = 200

: '''Change in income''' = (1500-1000) = 500

MPS = (Change in savings) / (Change in income)
  
: so, MPS = 200/500 = '''0.4'''

This implies that for each additional one unit of income, the savings increase by 0.4.

There are different implications of this above-mentioned formula.

* First it quantifies induced savings.Induced saving is the portion of saving that responds to changes in income.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marks,  [http://www.agsm.edu.au/bobm/teaching/MM/lect04.pdf "Macroeconomics for manager"], Lecture Series, March 1997, Australian Graduate School of Management, University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, induced saving can be defined as the household saving that depends on income or production (especially disposable income, national income, or even gross domestic product).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=induced+saving "Induced Savings"], AmosWEB LLC, Economic WEB*pedia,2010-2011.[Accessed: November 8, 2011] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, it is a measure of slope of the savings function.

====Value====

Since MPS is measured as ratio of change in savings to change in income, its value lies between 0 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, marginal propensity to save is opposite of marginal propensity to consume.

Mathematically, in a closed economy, '''MPS + MPC = 1''',&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahuja, H. L. (2008). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (14th ed., pp. 125-126). Delhi: S.Chand and Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; since an increase in one unit of income will be either consumed or saved.

In the above example, If MPS = 0.4, then MPC = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Generally, it is assumed that value of marginal propensity to save for the richer is more than the marginal propensity to save for the poorer. If income increases for both parties by $1, then the propensity to save for a richer person would be more than that for the poorer person.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C. (2000) Why do the rich save so much, in Does Atlas Shrug? Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich, Slemrod, J. (Ed.), Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slope of saving line==

Marginal propensity to save is also used as an alternative term for slope of saving line.
The slope of a saving line is given by the equation S = -a + (1-b)Y,&lt;ref&gt;Froyan, R. T. (2005). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (Eighth ed., p. 123,130). Pearson Education Inc. Pvt. Ltd. and Dorling Kindersley Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, D. N. (2005). Macroeconomics: Theory and policy. (2nd ed., p. 73). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; where -a refers to autonomous savings and (1-b) refers to marginal propensity to save (here b refers to marginal propensity to consume but as MPC + MPS = 1, so (1-b) refers to MPS).

In this diagram, the savings function is an increasing function of disposable income i.e. savings increase as income increases.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, R., Fischer, S., &amp; Startz, R. (2004). Macroeconomics. (Ninth ed., pp. 217,221-23). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The savings function.png|thumb|The savings function]]

==Multiplier effect==

An important implication of marginal propensity to save is measurement of the multiplier. A multiplier measures the magnified change in aggregate product i.e. the gross domestic product, resulting from a change in an autonomous variable (for example, government expenditure, investment expenditures, etc.).

The  effect of a change in production creates a multiplied impact because it creates income which further creates consumption. However, the resulting consumption is also an expenditure which thus, generates more income, which creates more consumption. This next round of consumption leads to a further change in production, which generates even more income, and which induces even more consumption.

And thus, as it goes on and on, it results in a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by a change in autonomous variable, but amplified by the creation of more income and increase in consumption.

===Mathematical implication===
Mathematically, the above effect can be stated as:

* In round 1, there is a change in an autonomous variable (say the government invests in a bridge making project for which it approaches a construction company) by an amount $1 (just an assumption for simplification). Now let the marginal propensity to consume for the construction company be 'c'. Thus, the construction company would spend an amount c×$1 i.e. $c.
* In round 2, the construction company incurs expenditure ($c) by procuring raw materials, say cement, steel, gravel, mortar, etc. from respective companies and thus, this amount $c becomes income for these companies. Now again the marginal propensity to consume for these companies is same as the construction company at 'c' and thus, their consumption becomes c×$c i.e. $c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
And it goes on and on.
We can express this as:

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
!width=20% |Round
!!width=40% |Change in income 
!!width=40% |Amount consumed
|-
| align="center"|Round 1 
| align="center"|$1 
| align="center"|$c
|-
| align="center"|Round 2
| align="center"|$c 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center"|Round 3 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-

:: And so on.

The end result is a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by the change in investment, but amplified by the change in consumption i.e. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume).

The MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, but more consumption is induced, with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=marginal%20propensity%20to%20save&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production  due to change in an autonomous variable by $1
                  = &lt;math&gt;1 + c + c^2 + \cdots
                  =\frac{1}{1-c}
                  =\frac{1}{1-MPC} = \frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

===Measuring the multiplier===

The effect of a [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]] can be measured as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Spending Multiplier} =\frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, and more consumption is induced with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if MPS = 0.2, then multiplier effect is 5, and if MPS = 0.4, then the multiplier effect is 2.5. Thus, we can see that a lower propensity to save implies a higher multiplier effect.

'''''Marxism and Morality''''' is a 1985 book by the political and social theorist [[Steven Lukes]]. The book was praised by commentators, who credited Lukes with showing the paradoxes inherent within Marxist approaches to morality. It has been called a classic introduction.

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Marxism and Morality'' was reviewed by the philosopher [[Arthur Danto]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Danto|1985|page=1052}}

===Academic journals===
''Marxism and Morality'' received positive reviews from Michael Perelman in the ''Southern Economic Journal'' and Alan Swingewood in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]''.{{sfn|Perelman|1986|page=293}}{{sfn|Swingewood|1988|pages=134–135}} The book was also reviewed by Michael Donnelly in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' and May Ellen Batiuk in ''[[Humanity &amp; Society]]'',{{sfn|Donnelly|1987|pages=716–718}}{{sfn|Batiuk|1990|pages=89–91}} and discussed by David Bankhurst in ''Praxis International''.{{sfn|Bankhurst|1985|pages=209–223}}

Perelman described the book as "a work of disarming simplicity that brings together much of the far reaching literature on the subject of marxism and morality." He credited Lukes with "bringing both scholarship and intelligence to his subject matter", finding Lukes's discussion of the wage/labor relationship especially successful. He disagreed with Lukes that [[Karl Marx]] underestimated the importance of values such as freedom of the press, writing that "the effective use of such freedom rarely extended beyond the privileged strata of society", and criticized Lukes for neglecting Marx's insight that capitalists and workers both behave through "character masks." He concluded that, "Despite its shortcomings, Lukes offers us a useful, though idiosyncratic vision of Marx's theory of morality."{{sfn|Perelman|1986|page=293}}

Swingewood described the book as "a notable contribution to current debates on the problems of socialist ethics and moral theory". He credited Lukes with offering "a concise and cogently argued analysis of the many paradoxes within [[Marxism]] on ethics and moral theory." He called Lukes's chapter on the "means-ends debate" "brilliant", writing that Lukes showed how "the possibility of alternative means (and thus the need to argue for them outside the framework of historical necessity) was largely ignored." He concluded that, "Lukes's book is an important contribution to the contemporary debate on the renewal of democratic socialism."{{sfn|Swingewood|1988|pages=134–135}}

Bankhurst praised Lukes for his "honesty and responsibility" in confronting the issue of whether Marxism suffers from a "deep-rooted theoretical incoherence" that accounts for its "terrible record" in political life, commenting that, "In the realm of morality" Marx's thought "does seem to abound in paradoxes and peculiarities." He credited Lukes with correctly characterizing Marx's basic outlook on morality as an analysis of it "as an expression of class struggle" combined with "the dismissal of the prevailing moral orthodoxy as the embodiment of the interests of the dominant class."{{sfn|Bankhurst|1985|pages=209–223}}

===Evaluations in books===
The political theorist [[Terrell Carver]] called ''Marxism and Morality'' a classic introduction to its subject in an appendix to the 1995 edition of the philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s ''[[Karl Marx: His Life and Environment]]''.{{sfn|Carver|Berlin|1995|page=214}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10564">'''Psychopolitical validity''' was coined by Isaac Prilleltensky in 2003 as a way to evaluate [[community psychology]] research and interventions and the extent to which they engage with [[Power (social and political)|power dynamics]], structural [[level of analysis]], and promotion of [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="P2003"&gt;Prilleltensky 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluative series of criteria developed by Prilleltensky may be used within any critical social science research and practice model, but can specifically be defined within community psychology research as advocating for a focus on [[well-being]], [[oppression]], and [[Emancipation|liberation]] across collective, relational, and personal domains in both research and practice.

An example of research that maintains psychopolitical validity is Bennett's study of [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] in [[Canada]] and their relationship with the state via cultural differences and industrial agriculture policies.&lt;ref name="B2003"&gt;Bennett 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's research investigates power dynamics between the state, mainstream culture, society, and the Amish community. This research looks at oppression and liberation at individual and community levels, and leads to local change as well as change in public policy.&lt;ref name="B2003"/&gt;

== Overview ==

The [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] of psychopolitical validity runs in opposition to "mainstream psychology's traditions [that] reinforce oppressive institutions even when individual psychologists have no such goal in mind,".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher &amp; Sonn 2008, 262&lt;/ref&gt; In addition this evaluation technique questions mainstream [[positivism]]. Psychopolitical validity asks the researcher and activist to think about power and how it affects fundamental epistemological and transformational values.
*What are the political and psychological implications for the researcher and the researched?
*What is the value of a given research question?
*What are the implications of a community intervention developed from said research question?
*How and why is research put into practice?

Prilleltensky describes one component of psychopolitical validity as "the degree to which research and action take into account power dynamics operating in psychological and political domains and in the interaction between them".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson &amp; Prilleltensky 2005, 136&lt;/ref&gt; This inclusion of power and political dynamics is hypothesized to have the ability to move clinical and community psychology beyond helping the afflicted to helping change the systemic, structural sources of inequality that affect the population.&lt;ref name="P2003"/&gt; Investigation and discussion of psychological and political dynamics may have the "power to promote wellness, resist oppression, and foster liberation".&lt;ref&gt;Prilleltensky 2008, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The interdisciplinary nature of psychopolitical validity lends itself to [[empowerment]] studies and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Speer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Prilleltensky and Fox suggest that psychopolitical validity should be institutionalized as a method of preventing wellness and justice from being discussed in isolation. This type of validity brings the two concepts together and politicizes the concept of wellness promotion.&lt;ref name="PF2007"&gt;Prilleltensky &amp; Fox 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''Definition'': "Psychopolitical validity refers to the extent to which studies and interventions in the community integrate (a) knowledge with respect to multidisciplinary and multilevel sources, experiences, and consequences of oppression, and (b) effective strategies for promoting psychological and political liberation in the personal, relational, and collective domains."&lt;ref name="P2003-199"&gt;Prilleltensky 2003, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemic and transformative components ==

Psychopolitical validity is divided into two components: ''epistemic validity'' and ''transformational validity''.

=== Epistemic validity ===

Epistemic validity uses both psychological and political dynamics when investigating social phenomena. Epistemic validity considers systemic factors and power in development and investigation of research questions and in thinking about the subsequent knowledge produced.  When evaluating studies based on epistemic validity there is a focus on whether or not there is an effort to understand and take into account structural forces impacting a given issue. To be valid in this way, it is imperative that there is an understanding of how "global, political, economic forces and social norms influence the perceptions and experiences of individuals and groups".&lt;ref name="P2003-199"/&gt;

''Definition'': "Epistemic validity is concerned with the degree to which community research and action is attuned to issues of power at multiple levels of analysis (personal, relational, collective). The more systematic the analysis of the phenomenon of interest in terms of psychological and political power, the more valid is the critical research and action."&lt;ref name="NP2005-285"&gt;Nelson &amp; Prilleltensky 2005, 285&lt;/ref&gt;

Prilleltensky and Fox emphasize that epistemic psychopolitical validity measures the extent to which psychology research investigating wellness and justice imagines positive and negative political and psychological dynamics. ''Positive'' psychological dynamics can include qualities that vary on an individual level, i.e.: "hope, empathy, optimism, attachment, and social support".&lt;ref name="PF2007-801"&gt;Prilleltensky &amp; Fox 2007, 801&lt;/ref&gt; ''Negative'' forces include, for example, "verbal abuse, stigmatization, or affective distortions".&lt;ref name="PF2007-801"/&gt; Positive political forces are equitable resource distribution, human rights, maintenance of democracy, and access to civic participation, whereas negative forces include "oppression, exploitation", each of these being dependent on institutionalized power inequalities.&lt;ref name="PF2007-801"/&gt;

=== Transformational validity ===

Transformational validity measures the extent to which interventions use both politics and psychology to create structural change within society. Studies and interventions with high transformational validity are, for example, ones that promote psychopolitical literacy, educate on overcoming oppression, empower individuals and groups take action against injustice, and advocate for coalition building.&lt;ref name="P2003"/&gt;

Transformative validity also takes into account how positive and negative political and psychological forces can be changed through action.&lt;ref name="PF2007"/&gt;

''Definition'': "Transformational validity … is concerned with the degree to which community research and action strives to transform social structures. The more transformative and the less ameliorative the intervention, the greater the transformational validity of the critical research and action."&lt;ref name="NP2005-285"/&gt;

== Critiques ==

Fisher and Sonn (2008) suggest that Prilleltensky fails to take cultural differences and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] into account.&lt;ref name="FS2008"&gt;Fisher &amp; Sonn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts imperative to any discussion of the importance of psychopolitical validity, such as "wellness", may not be useful across cultures, even across western cultures. They may not be easily conceptualized in cross-cultural context. In addition, they are skeptical of an uncritical rhetoric of democracy, which may fail to recognize other ways of social functioning or the ways democracy could potentially be flawed or misrepresented.&lt;ref name="FS2008"/&gt; Finally, Fisher and Sonn add that a strict and sole adherence to investigation and alleviation of oppression and promotion of liberation might prevent other areas of community psychology from growing.&lt;ref name="FS2008"/&gt;

{{wiktionary}}
A '''rabbit punch''' is a [[punch (strike)|blow]] to the back of the head or to the base of the [[skull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/rabbit-punching-boxing-3702.html |title=What Is Rabbit Punching in Boxing? |first=Matthew |last=Lee |publisher=AZCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered especially dangerous because it can damage the [[cervical vertebrae]] and subsequently the [[spinal cord]], which may lead to serious and irreparable [[spinal cord injury]].  A rabbit punch can also detach the victim's brain from the brain stem,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} which can kill instantly.

The punch's name is derived from the use of the technique by [[hunter]]s to kill [[rabbit]]s with a quick, sharp [[strike (attack)|strike]] to the back of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langer |first=Richard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501011125/http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |title=Extract from "Grow it!" |publisher=''www.motherearthnews.com'' |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |archivedate=2004-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2014, soccer referee John Bieniewicz was punched in the neck by Baseel Abdul Amir Saad, an upset player in an amateur match he was officiating in [[Livonia, Michigan]], a suburb of Detroit.

'''''Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Sonny Perdue''''' (No. 4:16-cv-00041-BMM) is a case in which plaintiffs allege that checkoff dollars are being used to support Canadian and Mexican beef. [[Commodity checkoff program|Checkoffs]] are mandatory contributions, from beef producers in this case, which are used for generic industry advertising and research.&lt;ref name="Docket 47"&gt;{{cite web|title=Order|url=https://www.publicjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Checkoff-2017.06.21-Dkt.-No.-47-Decision-on-FR.pdf|publisher=D. Mont.|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This case is distinguished from '''''Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. USDA''''' (No. 2:17-cv-00223), a challenge to USDA rules that allow Mexican and Canadian beef to be labelled as domestic beef. &lt;ref name="Docket 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint|url=https://www.r-calfusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170619-COOL-Complaint.pdf|publisher=E.D. Wash.|accessdate=24 August 2017|date=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Facts and prior history==
In 2016 the United States Department of Agriculture rescinded regulations requiring Mexican and Canadian beef be marked as imported. Checkoff advertising does not distinguish between domestic and imported beef.  Plaintiff disagrees with advertising that promotes imported beef to its detriment. It claims [[compelled speech]] in violation of the First Amendment.  This matter had been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'' (2005).

== Latest developments and next steps ==

In June 2017, the court issued a preliminary injunction that stopped the Montana Beef Board from using beef producers' checkoff contributions for advertising, unless the producers approve in advance.&lt;ref name="Docket 47" /&gt;  The decision hung on the distinction between [[commercial speech]] and [[government speech]]. Compelled commercial speech is a [[First Amendment]] violation. This is in contraposition to ''[[Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association]]'' (2005).

In September, the court stayed further proceedings until the [[Ninth District Court of Appeals]] rules on the USDA appeal.&lt;ref name="Docket 52"&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket 52|url=https://ecf.mtd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11112162418|publisher=District Court for the District of Montana|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''''Raptio''''' (in [[Archaic English|archaic]] or [[literary English]] rendered as '''''rape''''') is a [[Latin]] term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. [[kidnapping]] for [[marriage]] or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The equivalent term '''''Frauenraub''''', originally from [[German language|German]], is used in English in the field of [[art history]].

[[Bride kidnapping]] is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.

{{Wiktionary|rape}}

==Terminology==
The English word ''rape'' retains the Latin meaning in [[literary language]], but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of "sexual violation". The word is akin to ''rapine'', ''[[rapture]]'', ''[[wikt:raptor|raptor]]'', ''rapacious'' and ''ravish'', and referred to the more general violations, such as [[looting]], destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during [[war]], e.g. the [[Rape of Nanking]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the definition "the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force" besides the more general "the act of taking anything by force" (marked as ''obsolete'') and the more specific "violation or ravishing of a woman".

English ''rape'' was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an [[Old French]] legal term for "to seize", in turn from [[Latin]] ''rapere'' "seize, carry off by force, abduct". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as "[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).

Though the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word "rape" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', the title means "the theft of a lock [of hair]", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the word with its old meaning of "seizing and taking away" in his ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]] ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' has [[The Fantasticks#Controversy|a controversial song]] ("It Depends on What You Pay") about "an old-fashioned rape". Compare also the adjective "rapacious" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of rape}}

The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the [[nubile]] females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122819/http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduction of women is a common practice in [[tribal warfare|warfare]] among [[tribal societies]], along with [[cattle raiding]]. In [[historical human migrations]], the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s compared to [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s. 
[[Image:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Rape of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], Rome, 1637-38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
The [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] is an important part of the [[Founding of Rome|foundation legends]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (8th century BC). [[Romulus]] had established the settlement on the [[Palatine Hill]] with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the [[Sabines]], without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. [[Livy]] claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, "and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html Livy: The Rape of the Sabines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311040505/http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer [[Saki]] in ''The Schartz-Metterklume Method''.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as the main plot of the movie [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'']].

In [[Sanskrit literature]], the practice is known as ''[[Rakshasa]] Vivaha'' ("devil marriage"), mentioned e.g. by [[Kautilya]]. It is one of the eight forms of [[Hindu marriage]], the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives ([[Manu Smrti]] 3.33).

In the 3rd century, [[Gothic Christianity]] appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the [[Goths]] in [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]]: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor [[Decius]], and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf, ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen'' (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam]] is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law]] ([[Sura 4]]:25).

Mutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the [[Balkans under Ottoman rule]], and is a frequent theme in the [[Hajduk]] songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. Simiczijev, ''Pieśń hajducka Słowian południowych'' ("the Hajduk songs of the South Slavs") 1985; review by Christo Vasilev, Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rationalist Association of New South Wales''' was founded in around 1912 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, as a branch of the Rationalist Press Association, London. Its first secretary was [[William John Miles]], a businessman and father of the future eccentric, [[Bea Miles]]. He left the Association in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miles-william-john-7576|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Chris|last=Cunneen|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Association's aims and objectives, as stated in its bi-annual journal, ''The New Liberator'', are to promote:

* a philosophical and scientific approach to life, free from superstition and dogmatism,
* secular education in government schools, 
* the separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Liberator'', Winter 2017, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">'''Regulatory mode theory''', along with [[regulatory focus theory]] was developed by [[E. Tory Higgins]] and [[Arie Kruglanski]] who are interested in the development of goal-pursuit as well as motivation. The theory depicts two main approaches to situations using locomotion and assessment.

==Background==

The '''regulatory mode theory''' depicts how people approach situations to achieve the goal. This theory is part of [[E. Tory Higgins]] research in motivation theories and goal pursuit theories.  People can either use the locomotion or the assessment method for goal-pursuit. [[E. Tory Higgins]] states, "When people self-regulate they decide what they want that they don’t currently have. They then figure out what they need to do to get what they want, and then they do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Tory|title=Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who are geared towards the locomotion mode are focused on moving and getting things done. In contrast, those that are strong in assessment will compare different goals and analyze different options.

==Locomotion and assessment==

A study done by Pierro, Giacomantonio, Pica, Kruglanski, and Higgins (2011) examined the ways locomotion and assessment affects procrastination and how people manage time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierro|first=Antonio|author2=Giacomantonio, Mauro |author3=Pica, Gennaro |author4=Kruglanski, Arie W. |author5= Higgins, E. Tory |title=On the psychology of time in action: Regulatory mode orientations and procrastination.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2011|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1317–1331|doi=10.1037/a0025943 |pmid=22103579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that assessment is positively related to procrastination and locomotion is negatively related to procrastination. To reach a certain goal, assessors have to analyze and compare a large amount of work. However, the locomotors were generally quicker to make decisions and act on them. The study emphasized that assessment orientation evaluates and analyzes in such detail that they delay making the decision quickly. Yet for the assessment-oriented individuals, they were more accurate in their decisions even though they took a longer time. These two regulatory modes reflect motivational styles for goal-pursuit. The motivation behind the assessment mode is accuracy and for locomotion mode it is action.

==Promoting value==
A person's regulatory mode is correlated with [[Regulatory focus theory|regulatory fitness]]. They display their optimal level of performance in addition to valuing the end goals. In Avnet and Higgin's study (2004), the participants paid more for the book-light when their decisions were based on their regulatory orientation—either locomotion or assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avnet|first=Tamar|author2=Tory Higgins, E|title=Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from "how" to "what"|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 September 2003|volume=39|issue=5|pages=525–530|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They demonstrated that the value of the book-light is dependent on their approach systems.

==Motivation==
Consequently, locomotion can be very efficient in maintaining attitude, creating intention, and facilitating behavior. Mannetti, Pierro, Higgins, and Kruglanski (2012) investigated peoples' commitment to exercising at the gym and how regularly they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannetti|first=Lucia|author2=Pierro, Antonio |author3=Higgins, E. Tory |author4= Kruglanski, Arie W. |title=Maintaining Physical Exercise: How Locomotion Mode Moderates the Full Attitude–Intention–Behavior Relation|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1 July 2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=295–303|doi=10.1080/01973533.2012.693442}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They evaluated the participants' regulatory mode using a questionnaire and then their attendance was recorded in a 6-month period. Results show that when the people had high locomotion concerns and they had positive attitudes about physical exercise, their intentions to engage in physical exercise were high. They would proceed to actually engage in physical exercise within the 6-month period. Since locomotion runs on the motivation to do and to act, the positive effects of making a behavior happen can be expanded to other areas.

'''Repetition compulsion''' is a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] or its circumstances over and over again. This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This "re-living" can also take the form of [[dream]]s in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even [[hallucination]].

The term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a "key component in Freud's understanding of mental life, 'repetition compulsion' ... describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life".&lt;ref&gt;Jan Clark and Jim Crawley, ''Transference and Projection: Mirrors to the self.'' (Buckingham 2002). p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s use of the concept of "repetition compulsion" ({{lang-de|Wiederholungszwang}})&lt;ref name="LP"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Compulsion to Repeat (Repetition Compulsion) (pp. 78-80) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Compulsion+to+Repeat+(Repetition+Compulsion)+=+D.:+Wiederholungszwang%22 |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 'articulated ... for the first time, in the article of 1914, ''Erinnern, Wiederholen und Durcharbeiten'' ("Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through")'.&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lacan |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Lacan |editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Jacques-Alain |editor-link=Jacques-Alain Miller |others=Translated from the 1973 French original by [[Alan Sheridan]] |title=[[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=1977 1977] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-0-429-90659-6 |id={{ISBN|0-42990659-5}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=z0ZaDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22he+articulated+it+for+the+first+time,+in+the+article+of+1914,+Erinnern,+Wiederholen+und+Durcharbeiten%22%22(Remembering,+Repeating+and+Working-Through%22 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he noted how 'the patient does not ''remember'' anything of what he has forgotten and repressed, he ''acts'' it out, without, of course, knowing that he is repeating it ... For instance, the patient does not say that he remembers that he used to be defiant and critical toward his parents' authority; instead, he behaves in that way to the doctor'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, quoted in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He explored the repetition compulsion further in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', describing four aspects of repetitive behavior, all of which seemed odd to him from the point of view of the mind's quest for pleasure/avoidance of unpleasure.

The first was the way 'dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident' rather than, for example, 'show[ing] the patient pictures from his healthy past'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987). pp. 282-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second came from children's [[Play (activity)|play]]. Freud reported observing a [[child]] throw his favorite toy from his crib, become upset at the loss, then reel the toy back in, only to repeat this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=|first= |title=Literary Encyclopedia: Repetition Compulsion |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=947 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud theorized that the child was attempting to master the sensation of loss 'in allowing his mother to go away without protesting', but asked in puzzlement 'How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third was the way (noted in 1914) that the patient, exploring in therapy a repressed past, 'is obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in ''every'' way'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. pp. 288, 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth was the so-called "destiny neurosis", manifested in 'the life-histories of men and women ... [as] an essential character-trait which remains always the same and which is compelled to find expression in a repetition of the same experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

All such activities appeared to Freud to contradict the organism's search for pleasure, and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides':&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; 'a daemonic current/trait',&lt;ref name="Penguin" &gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=daemonic |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-141-93166-1 |id={{ISBN|0-14193166-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/276/ ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''] (C.

Following this line of thought, he would come to stress that '''an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''&lt;nowiki/&gt;';&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the [[death drive]].

Along the way, however, Freud had in addition considered a variety of more purely psychological explanations for the phenomena of the repetition compulsion which he had observed. Traumatic repetitions could be seen as the result of an attempt to retrospectively "master" the original trauma, a child's play as an attempt to turn passivity into activity: 'At the outset he was in a ''passive'' situation ... but by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an ''active'' part'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the repetition of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]}} and simultaneously satisfaction for the other {{bracket|[[Id, ego and super-ego|the id]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Beyond''. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions 'are of course the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.&lt;ref name="Freud, Beyond p. 292"/&gt;

Five years later, in ''Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety'', he would quietly revise his earlier definition—'There is no need to be discouraged by these emendations ... so long as they enrich rather than invalidate our earlier views'—in his new formula on 'the power of the compulsion to repeat—the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987). p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later psychoanalytic developments==
It was in the latter, psychological form that the concept of the repetition compulsion passed into the psychoanalytic mainstream. [[Otto Fenichel]] in his "second generation" compendium ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' stressed two main kinds of neurotic repetition.

On the one hand, there were '''Repetitions of traumatic events for the purpose of achieving a belated mastery'' ... seen first and most clearly in children's games',&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946). p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; although the 'same pattern occurs in the repetitive dreams and symptoms of traumatic neurotics and in many similar little actions of normal persons who ... repeat upsetting experiences a number of times before these experiences are mastered.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Such traumatic repetitions could themselves appear in active or passive forms. In a passive form, one chooses his or her most familiar experiences consistently as a means to deal with problems of the past, believing that new experiences will be more painful than their present situation or too new and untested to imagine. In the active, participatory form, a person actively engages in behavior that mimics an earlier stressor, either deliberately or unconsciously, so that in particular events that are terrifying in childhood become sources of attraction in adulthood. For instance, a person who was spanked as a child may incorporate this into their adult sexual practices; or a victim of sexual abuse may attempt to seduce another person of authority in his or her life (such as their boss or therapist): an attempt at ''mastery'' of their feelings and experience, in the sense that they unconsciously want to go through the same situation but that it ''not'' result negatively as it did in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| title =Roberta Satow - Psychoanalyst| url =http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| publisher =| date =| accessdate =6 July 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100117153938/http://www.robertasatow.com/psych.html| archivedate =17 January 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there were '''Repetitions due to the tendency of the repressed to find an outlet''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"&gt;Fenichel, ''Neurosis''. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the drive of the repressed impulse to find gratification brought with it a renewal of the original defence: 'the anxiety that first brought about the repression is mobilized again and creates, together with the repetition of the impulse, a repetition of the anti-instinctual measures'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt; Fenichel considered that 'Neurotic repetitions of this kind contain no metaphysical element', and 'even the repetition of the most painful failure of the Oedipus complex in the transference during a psychoanalytic cure is not "beyond the pleasure principle"'.&lt;ref name="Fenichel, Neurosis p. 542"/&gt;

Later writers would take very similar views. [[Eric Berne]] saw as central to his work 'the repetition compulsion which drives men to their doom, the power of death, according to Freud ... [who] places it in some mysterious biological sphere, when after all it is only the voice of seduction'&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say after You Say Hello?'' (London 1975). p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;—the seduction of the repressed and unconscious id.

[[Erik Erikson]] saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Middlesex 1973). p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ego psychology]] would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive ... the same mistake over and over again'.&lt;ref&gt;"Aaron Green" in Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]], stressing the way 'the transference is a live relationship ... in the here-and-now of the analysis, repeating the way that the patient has used his objects from early in life' considered that 'this newer conception reveals a purpose ... [in] the repetition compulsion':&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006). pp. 149, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; thus 'unconscious hope may be found in repetition compulsion, when unresolved conflicts continue to generate attempts at solutions which do not really work ... [until] a genuine solution is found'.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997). p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern formulations==
By the close of the twentieth century, the psychoanalytic view of repetition compulsion had come into increasing dialogue with a variety of other discourses, ranging from [[attachment theory]] through brief psychodynamic therapy to [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].

Attachment theory saw early developmental experiences leading to 'schemas or mental representations of relationship ... [which] become organized, encoded experiential and cognitive data ... that lead to self-confirmation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Jan |last2=Crawley |first2=Jim |title=Transference and Projection |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2002 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-335-20314-7 |id={{ISBN|0-33523164-0}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22schemas+or+mental+representations+of+relationship%22%22become+organized,+encoded+experiential+and+cognitive+data%22%22that+lead+to+self-confirmation%22 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Core Conflictual Relationship Theme]]—'core wishes that the individual has in relation to others'—was seen in brief psychodynamic therapy as linked to the way in 'a repetition compulsion, the client will behave in ways that engender particular responses from others that conform with previous experiences in interpersonal relationships'.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22core+wishes+that+the+individual+has+in+relation+to+others%22%22a+repetition+compulsion,+the+client+will+behave+in+ways+that+engender+particular+responses+from+others+that+conform+with+previous+experiences+in+interpersonal+relationships%22 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 'psychological schemas' described in social psychology or cognitive-behavioural psychology ... 'an enduring symbolic framework that organizes constellations of thought, feeling, memory, and expectation about self and others" (Knapp 1991: 94)',&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jan; Crawley, Jim (2002). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=hIREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22an+enduring+symbolic+framework+that+organizes+constellations+of+thought,+feeling,+memory,+and+expectation+about+self+and+others'+(Knapp+1991:+94)%22 5].&lt;/ref&gt; further parallels may be seen to the role of early unconscious fixations in fueling the repetition compulsion.

A '''round''', in the [[esoteric cosmology]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Rosicrucianism]], is a cosmic cycle or sequence by which an evolving reincarnating being passes through the various stages of existence as the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]] or the [[Cosmos]] comes into and passes out of [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]].

==Theosophy==
In Theosophy, the whole process is very simple. A round is a process in a [[planetary chain]], according to which a life cycle or [[life-wave]] of [[souls]] or [[Monad (Theosophy)|monads]] begins its evolutionary journey on the first and most subtle or spiritual of the series of seven globes; then finishing its evolution there, proceeds to the next, and so on, to the densest or most manifest globe (usually called globe D), which in our case is the gross, physical [[Earth]]. From there it proceeds on the [[ascending arc]], through increasingly more ethereal globes. Each of these globes are in coadunition with the physical earth, though they are not in consubstantiation with it. Each of these stages is called a ''round'', and during this time the reincarnating life wave has passed through seven [[Root Race]]s.

When the life wave has gone through all seven globes of the planetary chain, it has completed one ''planetary round'' or ''globe manvantara''. This is followed by the dissolution of the planetary chain in a nirvana (which is not the same as what [[Buddhism]] calls [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]] because it is not permanent); this period between physical manifestation is called [[pralaya]] in [[Hinduism]].  Finally, a new round begins, in which consciousness is now more developed than in the preceding round.

Seven such planetary rounds (or forty-nine globe rounds) represents one [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]] or ''manvantara'' or ''day of Brahma''. This is followed by a higher "nirvana" or pralaya, which is the pralaya of that planetary chain. This lasts until a new planetary chain forms with its various life waves.

Seven such planetary chains and their pralayas constitute a solar manvantara, after which the solar system is dissolved in a cosmic pralaya, before the cycle begins anew.

This elaborate cosmology, first formulated by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Blavatsky]], was also taught by [[Gottfried de Purucker|de Purucker]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater]], and [[Alice Bailey]].

==Anthroposophy==
[[Rudolf Steiner]] retained the basic concept of root races and sevenfold cycles within cycles, but his description is considerably simpler, concentrating only on the seven cycles of the present [[Solar System]]. Each of these cycles constitutes a coming into being and passing out of being of the solar system, and each is divided into seven rounds, upon which [[Human|man]] passes through seven root races. Each of Steiner's seven rounds is related to a metamorphosis of the Earth:
* Ancient Saturn
:During the Ancient Saturn round, the life wave of human beings underwent the mineral stage, endowed only with a physical vehicle.
* Ancient Sun
:During the Ancient Sun round, human beings underwent the plant stage, being endowed with a physical and an etheric vehicle.
* Ancient Moon
:During the Ancient Moon round, human beings underwent the animal stage, endowed with a physical, an etheric, and an astral vehicle. Meanwhile, the present Angels were undergoing the human stage, while the present Archangels were undergoing the Angel stage, and so on.
* Earth
:During the Earth round, human beings undergo the man stage.
* Jupiter
:During the Jupiter round, human beings will undergo the soul man stage.
* Venus
:During the Venus round, human beings will undergo the higher soul man stage.
* Vulcan
:During the Vulcan round, human beings will undergo the spiritual man stage.
For Steiner, the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms represent "cast off" elements of the human entity from previous rounds. These teachings have been incorporated into the [[Anthroposophical Society]] that Steiner founded.

==Rosicrucian==
According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings about the scheme of evolution, in the beginning of a ''Day of Manifestation'' a certain collective Great Being, [[God]], limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a [[Solar System]] for the evolution of added [[self-consciousness]]. In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of [[consciousness]], from [[omniscience]] to an [[unconsciousness]] deeper than that of the deepest [[altered state of consciousness|trance condition]].
During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained to the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.

The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called "[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine [[omniscience]], is called "[[Spiritual evolution|Evolution]]". Every evolving being has within him a "force" within which makes evolution not to be a mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called "Epigenesis" provides the element of [[originality]] and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a [[God]].

Heindel states that in the [[Solar system]], God's Habitation, there are [[Rosicrucian Fellowship#The Seven Worlds &amp; the Seven Cosmic Planes|seven Worlds]] differentiated by [[God]], within Himself, one after another. These Worlds have each a different "measure" and rate of [[oscillation|vibration]] and are not separated by [[space]] or [[distance]], as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of [[matter]], of varying [[density]] and vibration (as are the [[solids]], [[liquids]] and [[gases]] of the [[Earth|physical Earth]]). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin [[spirit]] becomes first [[human]] and, then, a [[God]].
The highest Worlds are created first, and as [[Involution (metaphysics)|involution]] is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually [[condense]] and new Worlds are differentiated within [[God]] to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the [[nadir]] of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, [[God]] ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.

'''Secret Santa''' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[Christmas]] tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a [[gift]].  The identity of the gift giver is a secret not to be revealed until after the gift is opened. 

Deriving from the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, the ritual is known as ''Secret Santa'' in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; as ''Kris Kringel'' or ''Kris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]; as ''Wichteln, Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', ''Chris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') or Engerl-Bengerl in parts of [[Austria]]; as ''Secret Santa'' or ''Kris Kringle'' in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]; as ''Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', or ''Monito-monita'' in the [[Philippines]]; as ''Angelito'' in the [[Dominican Republic]]; and as "Wichteln" in Germany. "Wichteln" is what a "Wichtel", a wight, does, a good deed. In [[Poland]], the tradition is celebrated on the day of 6 December (Mikołajki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obliczakultury.pl/publicystyka/obyczaje-swiata/1506-mikolajki-6-grudnia|title=Oblicza Kultury - Mikołajki - 6 grudnia - Obyczaje świata|author=Magda Goetz|work=Oblicza Kultury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mowimyjak.pl/styl-zycia/uroczystosci/kim-jest-sw-mikoaj-skad-sie-wzia-zwyczaj-kupowania-prezentow-na-6-grudnia,87_34412.html|title=Mikołajki.

Exceptions are the UK (where the traditional gift-bringer is [[Father Christmas]]) and the Philippines (which has the [[Three Kings]]). [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most places in [[Latin America]] use ''amigo secreto'' (secret friend) or ''amigo invisible/invisível'' (invisible friend). In [[Israel]], this game is called ''גמד וענק'' (A Dwarf and a Giant) and is mostly played during [[Purim]].

The term ''Pollyanna''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sassysanta.com/pollyanna/|title=Pollyanna Gift Exchange|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]] and [[South Jersey]].

==Variations==

=== Thieving Secret Santa/Stealing Secret Santa/White Elephant/Yankee Swap ===

{{main|White elephant gift exchange}}
In this version, participants (players) bring one gift each which is potentially suitable or interesting to any of the other participants. The gifts should be wrapped in such a way as to disguise their nature. Ideally, the provider of each gift should not be disclosed when setting up the game. Players take turns, and can either open a new gift, or steal a previously opened gift. This game is more commonly known as the [[white elephant gift exchange]], or Yankee Swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071223/NEWS/712230338 |title=Yankee Swappers play gift game |publisher=CapeCodOnline.com |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=December 2013}}

===Guessing===

Each participant brings a gift for their assigned person, with a letter. This letter may or may not have hints on who the giver might be, depending on the rules participants have established. Each receiver must guess who made the gift.

===Secret Casino Santa===
In this version, each person buys a gift for specific amount, not for anyone specifically. Each person also puts in a specific amount of money into a pot. Who goes first in gift selection can be determined by random selection. The options are:

*Option A: Choose a gift
*Option B: Do not choose a gift, and go for Money.
*Option C: Put your name in to win all the unwanted gifts by those who went for Option B.

At the end, the gifts that were chosen are opened and the winner of the money and leftover gifts are drawn.

===Conspiracy Santa===
In this version, participants engage in a "conspiracy" where all participants work together to select a gift for a single participant without that participant's direct involvement or knowledge. Many such individual "conspiracies" run concurrently, one for each participant. Email threads or web apps are commonly used to manage each "conspiracy" until a consensus is made, wherein the gift is purchased by a decided upon participant and given at a later date. A common theme of Conspiracy Santa is collectively learning about participants, making it popular for workplaces and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2472555,00.asp |title=Sick of Secret Santa? Try Conspiracy Santa |publisher=PCMag.com |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secret Santa Online ===
The tradition of Secret Santa is becoming increasingly popular in online communities. 

On the one hand there are several ''Secret Santa Generators'' that tell every participant in a group for whom to buy a gift. This is especially useful for groups who can't meet in person to draw the names from a hat or bowl before the Secret Santa event. Popular ''Secret Santa Generators'' are:
* [https://www.drawnames.com/ DrawNames]: a simple email based Secret Santa Generator (supports multiple languages)
* [https://www.elfster.com/ elfster]: a combination of a Secret Santa Generator and an online shop to buy the Secret Santa gift (products on the US shop of Amazon.com). This also lets people RSVP to the invitations that are sent out to their name
* [https://www.pikkado.com/ Pikkado]: a free and very complete tool to successfully organize a Secret Santa gift exchange. (supports multiple languages: EN, ES, FR, PT)
*[https://wichtelmania.com/en/ Wichtelmania]: a Secret Santa Generator without email registration (based on secret links that can be sent to the participants using WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, ... or email)
* [https://www.easysanta.com Easy Santa]: a Secret Santa Generator available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[IOS]] where users register through the mobile phone and the draws are made and consulted also through the mobile phone. It supports 25 languages and works in most countries.
* [https://www.my-secret-santa.org My Secret Santa]: a full mobile Secret Santa Generator (no installation) to manage from 3 to thousands of participants and providing functionalities like: 1 to 5 draws per participant, custom design, anonymous messages exchanges between participants, vocal message to santa / whishlist sharing, gif ideas.
* [https://www.partylabz.com/secretsanta PartyLabz]: a Secret Santa Generator within online RSVP website. You can create an event and add a Secret Santa tab there. To be able to play, participants need to [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] to the event. Then the host initiates Secret Santa game (the service randomly draws names and sends emails). The participants can anonymously send message or notify the host about sending or receiving a gift.
* [https://secret-santa.team Secret-Santa.team]: a Secret Santa application to start a Secret Santa with your team. Connect your application (Slack and Discord supported at the moment), select the participants and validates. The service will randomly draw users and send them a private message in their application to inform them of their peer name. Totally free, without ads, and no privacy data storage nor usage.
On the other hand there are communities like [https://www.redditgifts.com/ redditgifts] where you don't know the person for whom you buy a gift or from whom you receive a gift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34953">A '''self-serving bias''' is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance [[self-esteem]], or the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D.G. (2015). ''Exploring Social Psychology'', 7th Edition. New York: McGraw Hill Education.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief that individuals tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts, but ascribe failure to external factors.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides"/&gt; When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures, or take more responsibility for their group's work than they give to other members, they are protecting their ego from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self's need for esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson|entry=Self-Serving Bias|chapter-url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~dforsyth/pubs/forsyth2008selfserving.pdf|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|isbn=9780028661179|edition=2nd|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a student who [[Attribution (psychology)|attributes]] earning a good grade on an exam to their own intelligence and preparation but attributes earning a poor grade to the teacher's poor teaching ability or unfair test questions might be exhibiting the self-serving bias.

Both motivational processes (i.e. [[self-enhancement]], [[self-presentation]]) and cognitive processes (i.e. [[locus of control]], self-esteem) influence the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=Shepperd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepperd|first=James |author2=Malone, Wendi |author3=Sweeny, Kate|title=Exploring Causes of the Self-serving Bias|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|pages=895–908|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00078.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are both cross-cultural (i.e. [[individualistic]] and [[collectivistic]] culture differences) and special clinical population (i.e. [[Depression (mood)|depression]]) considerations within the bias.&lt;ref name=Hooghiemstra&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooghiemstra|first=Reggy|title=East-West Differences in Attributions for Company Performance: A Content Analysis of Japanese and U.S. Corporate Annual Reports|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=618–629|doi=10.1177/0022022108321309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Jeff |author2=Pyszczynski, Tom |author3=Burling, John |author4=Tibbs, Karyn|title=Depression, self-focused attention, and the self-serving attributional bias|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=1992|volume=13|issue=9|pages=959–965|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(92)90129-D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research on the self-serving bias has used participant self-reports of attribution based on experimental manipulation of task outcomes or in naturalistic situations.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; Some more modern research, however, has shifted focus to physiological manipulations, such as emotional inducement and neural activation, in an attempt to better understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name="Krusemark et al"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Attributions, deception, and event related potentials: An investigation of the self-serving bias|journal=Psychophysiology|year=2008|volume=45|issue=4|pages=511–515|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00659.x|pmid=18282197|last1=Krusemark|first1=E. A.|last2= Campbell|first2=W. Keith|last3=Clementz|first3=B. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackwood-2003" /&gt;

==History==
The theory of self-serving biases first came to attention in the late 1960s to early 1970s. As research on this topic continued to grow some people saw concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Dale|author2=Michael Ross|date=1975|title=Self-serving Biases in the Attribution of Causality: Fact or Fiction?|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/82_Psychological_Bulletin_213_(Miller).pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=82|issue=2|pages=213–225|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, fear emerged that the hypothesis would prove to be incorrect much like the perceptual defense hypothesis by Dixon. However, the theory now holds strong. When this theory was still being developed it was during the research of [[attribution bias]]. [[Fritz Heider]] found that in ambiguous situations people made attributions based on their own needs and in order to maintain a higher self-esteem and viewpoint. This specific tendency became what we now know as self-serving. Miller and Ross conducted a study in 1975 that was one of the earliest to assess not only self-serving bias but they looked at the attributions for successes and failures within this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=James|author2=Rutger U |author3=Douglass Coll |title=Evidence for a self-serving bias in the attribution of causality|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=45|issue=3|pages=430–441|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1977.tb00162.x |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the self-serving bias people create is rational and not dependent on one's need for self-esteem. This means that if the outcome of an event is consistent with the person's expectation, then they will make dispositional (internal) factors. On the other hand, if the outcome of the event doesn't match the person's expectations, they will make situational attributions by blaming their surroundings instead of themselves.

==Methods==

===Laboratory testing===
Investigations of the self-serving bias in the laboratory differ depending on the experimental goals, but have basic fundamental aspects. Participants perform some task, often of intelligence, social sensitivity, teaching ability, or therapy skills.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; Participants may be asked to work alone, in pairs, or in groups. After task completion, participants are given randomized bogus feedback. Some studies employ emotion-induction mechanisms to investigate moderating effects on the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Finally, participants make attributions for the given outcomes. These attributions are assessed by the researchers to determine implications for the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt;

===Neural experimentation===
Some more modern testing employs neural imaging techniques to supplement the fundamental self-serving bias laboratory procedures. Neural correlates of the self-serving bias have been investigated by [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),&lt;ref name="Blackwood-2003" /&gt; as well as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref name="Krusemark et al" /&gt; These procedures allow for insight into brain area activity during exhibition of a self-serving bias, as well as a mechanism to differentiate brain activity between healthy and clinical populations.&lt;ref name="Seidel-2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Eva-Maria|author2=Satterthwaite, Theodore D. |author3=Eickhoff, Simon B. |author4=Schneider, Frank |author5=Gur, Ruben C. |author6=Wolf, Daniel H. |author7=Habel, Ute |author8=Derntl, Birgit |title=Neural correlates of depressive realism — An fMRI study on causal attribution in depression|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|year=2011|volume=138|issue=3|pages=268–276|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.01.041|pmid=22377511 |pmc=3565123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalistic investigation===
Retrospective performance outcomes can be used in investigation of the self-serving bias. An example of this is reported company performance followed up by self-report of outcome attributions.&lt;ref name=Hooghiemstra /&gt; These self-report attributions can then be used to assess how successes and failures are viewed by company employees and executives. This method can be used for numerous outcome variables to determine the presence or absence of the self-serving bias.

==Factors and variables==

===Motivation===
Two types of [[motivation]] affect the self-serving bias: self-enhancement and self-presentation.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt; Self-enhancement aims to uphold one's own self-worth, and attributing successes internally and failures externally helps individuals in their self-enhancement. Self-presentation refers to the drive to convey a desired image to others and make self-serving attributions to manage impressions.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt; For example, they claim personal responsibility for successes but not failures in an attempt to influence how others perceive them. Motivation works in conjunction with cognitive factors to produce personally satisfying and self-preserving attributions for outcomes.&lt;ref name=Shepperd /&gt;

===Locus of control===
[[Locus of control]] is one of the main influences of attribution style. Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they have personal control over situations and that their actions matter. Those with an external locus of control believe that outside forces, chance, and luck determine situations and that their actions cannot change anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M. |author2=Zhang, Liqing |author3=Im, Charles|title=It's Beyond My Control: A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Increasing Externality in Locus of Control, 1960-2002|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=308–319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_5|pmid=15454351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with an external locus of control are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias following failure than those with an internal locus of control.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=W. Keith|author2=Sedikides, Constantine |title=Self-threat magnifies the self-serving bias: A meta-analytic integration.|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=1999|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23–43|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.3.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wichman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wichman|first=Harvey|author2=Ball, James |title=Locus of control, self-serving biases, and attitudes towards safety in general aviation pilots|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|year=1983|volume=54|issue=6|pages=507–510|pmid=6882309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in attribution style between individuals with internal and external loci of control, however, is not as marked in successful outcomes, as individuals with both types attribution style have less need to defend their [[self-image]]s in success. Airplane pilots with an internal locus of control were likely to exhibit a self-serving bias in regard to their skill and levels of safety.&lt;ref name=Wichman /&gt;

===Gender===
Studies have shown a slight discrepancy in males' and females' use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, men tended to attribute negative interactions to their partners more than women did.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christensen|first=A.|author2=Sullaway, M.|author3=King, C. E.|date=|year=1983|title=Systematic error in behavioral reports of dyadic interaction: Egocentric bias and content effects|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1983-31566-001|journal=Behavioral Assessment|volume=5|issue=2|pages=129–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias more than women, although the study did not look at positive interaction attributions.

===Age===
Older adults have been shown to make more internal causal attributions for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lachman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lachman|first=M.|title=When Bad Things Happen to Older People: Age Differences in A ttributional Style|journal=Psychology and Aging|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=607–609|doi=10.1037/0882-7974.5.4.607|pmid=2278689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differential attribution style at different ages indicates that the self-serving bias may be less likely in older adults. These older adults who attributed negative outcomes to more internal factors also rated themselves to be in poorer health, so negative emotional factors may confound the found age effects.

===Culture===
There is evidence of cross-cultural differences in the tendency to exhibit the self-serving bias, particularly when considering individualistic (Western) versus collectivistic (non-Western) societies.&lt;ref name=Al-Zah&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Zahrini|first=S.|author2=Kaplowitz, S. |title=Attributional Biases in Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultures: A Comparison of Americans with Saudis|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1993|volume=56|issue=3|pages=223–233|doi=10.2307/2786780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family and group goals are important in collectivistic cultures. In contrast, the individual goals and identity focused on in individualistic societies increases the need for people within those cultures to guard and boost their personal self-esteem. While differences have been shown, conflicting literature has cited similarity in causal attributions across both individual and collective cultures, specifically between Belgium, West Germany, South Korea, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=B.|author2=Forsterlung, F. |author3=Weiner, B. |title=Perceiving the Causes of Success and Failure: A Cross-Cultural Examination of Attributional Concepts|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=1989|volume=20|issue=2|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/0022022189202005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation and information comparing United States and Japanese companies outcome attributions shows that the meaning and psychological function of internal versus external attributions are similar across cultures but that the difference is in the strategy of attribution.&lt;ref name=Hooghiemstra/&gt; No consensus has been reached on cross-culture influences on the self-serving bias, though some systematic differences do seem to be present, especially between Western and non-Western cultures. For example, a study conducted by Kudo and Numuzaki named “Explicit and Direct Self-Serving Bias in Japan Reexamination of Self-Serving Bias for Success and Failure” showed that the participants in the success condition provided more internal attributions than the participants in the failure condition even though past research has constantly shown that Japanese people don’t tend to show a self-serving bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudo|first=Eriko|last2=Numazaki|first2=Makoto|title=Explicit and Direct Self-Serving Bias in Japan|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.db19.linccweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022022103256475|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=5|pages=511–521|doi=10.1177/0022022103256475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, another study conducted by Hugten and Witteloostuijn named “The foreign language effect on the self-serving bias: A field experiment in the high school classroom” displayed the results that student participants between the ages of 13-15 who mainly process feedback in a non-native English tend to show more self-serving bias than those who process feedback in their native Dutch language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The foreign language effect on the selfserving bias: A field experiment in the high school classroom|last=van Hugten|first=Joeri|last2=van Witteloostuijn|first2=A|date=9 February 2018|website=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0192143|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role===
Investigations of self-serving bias distinguish between the role of participants as the actor of a task or as the observer of someone else performing a task, relating closely to [[actor–observer asymmetry]]. Actors of a task exhibit the self-serving bias in their attributions to their own success or failure feedback, whereas observers do not make the same attributions about another person's task outcome.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; Observers tend to be more objective in their tendency to ascribe internal or external attributions to other people's outcomes. This may be due to the fact that the self-image of actors is challenged directly and therefore actors feel the need to protect their own self-image, but do not feel the same inclination to do so when the self-image of others is threatened.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterHeatherton1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=Roy F.|last2=Heatherton|first2=Todd F.|last3=Tice|first3=Dianne M.|title=When ego threats lead to self-regulation failure: Negative consequences of high self-esteem|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|year=1993|pages=141–156|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.1.141|pmid=8421250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-esteem and emotion===
Emotions can influence feelings of [[self-esteem]], which in turn alters the need to protect one's self-identity. Individuals with higher self-esteem are thought to have more to protect in their self-image, and therefore exhibit the self-serving bias more often than those individuals with lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Campbell &amp; Sedikides" /&gt; In a study, participants who were induced to feel the [[emotion]]s of guilt or revulsion were less likely to make self-serving attributions for success and less likely to make self-protecting attributions for failure.&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Martin D.|title=Emotion and the Self-Serving Bias|journal=Current Psychology|year=2011|volume=30|issue=4|pages=345–354|doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman concluded that the two emotions of guilt and revulsion lead to a drop in self-esteem, and thus a reduction in the use of the self-serving bias.

===Self-awareness and probability of improvement===

The relationship between individuals' awareness levels and perceived probability of improvement also influences the activation of the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name= Duval&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duval|first=Thomas|author2=Paul Silvia |title=Self-Awareness, Probability of Improvement, and the Self-Serving Bias|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2002|volume=82|issue=1|pages=49–61|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.1.49|pmid=11811633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with high self-awareness attribute failure internally when they perceive a high probability of improvement. However, they will engage in self-serving bias, attributing failure externally when they perceive a low probability of improvement. Individuals low in self-awareness will attribute failure externally regardless of their perceived probability of improvement.

==Real-world implications==

===Interpersonal relations===
Whether the self-serving bias is exhibited may depend on interpersonal closeness, relationships in a social context. When working in pairs to complete interdependent outcome tasks, relationally close pairs did not show a self-serving bias while relationally distant pairs did.&lt;ref name="Campbell et al." /&gt; A study on self-serving bias in relational context suggests this is due to the idea that close relationships place limits on an individual's self enhancement tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedikides|first=Constantine|author2=Keith Campbell |author3=Glenn Reeder |author4=Andrew Elliot |title=The Self-Serving Bias in Relational Context|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=74|issue=2|pages=378–386|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.2.378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The individual becomes more modest, when in a close relationship, and is less likely to use that relationship for his or her own benefit. Understanding why partners refrain from the self-serving bias is still in question but can partially be explained by favorable impression those in close relationships have for one another. A similar result was shown when looking at pairs of friends and strangers. Pairs performed an interdependent outcomes creativity test and were then given a bogus pipeline for a success or failure outcome. Strangers exhibited the self-serving bias in responsibility attributions, but friends tended to make joint attributions for both success and failure. Researchers have taken this as evidence for "boundaries on self-enhancement".&lt;ref name="Campbell et al." /&gt; In another study conducted in 2016, the implicit and explicit evaluation of 108 partners and exes as parents who were either married, separated or divorced was researched to investigate if the self-serving bias influenced them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Self-Serving Bias in the Implicit and Explicit Evaluation of Partners and Exes as Parents: A Pilot Study|last=Verrastro|first=Valeria|authorlink=|date=February 1, 2016|website=|publisher=Psychological Reports|pages=251–265|doi=10.1177/0033294115626819|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using two Implicit Association tests, one measuring Self vs Partner and the other measuring Self vs Ex, results showed that most of the time, men and women consider their exes or partners as less suitable parents which demonstrates the self-serving bias as they “ascribe more easily successes to internal factors” and failures towards their partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, another result demonstrated that “women revealed a higher self-serving bias than men on both implicit and explicit measures, but only toward exes and not toward current partners” because they consider their exes as an out-group and their partners as an in-group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Workplace===
The self-serving bias can be found in several aspects of the workplace. Research shows that the self-serving bias is used to explain employment: being hired for a job is attributed to personal factors, whereas failure to obtain a job is attributed to external factors.&lt;ref name=Furnham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham, A.|title=Explanations for Unemployment in Britain|journal=Journal of European Social Psychology|year=1982|volume=12|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420120402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental investigation of the explanations for unemployment through asking participants to imagine particular job opportunities and likelihood of getting those jobs, however, did not show such a self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=Pal /&gt; Researchers claim that this may be due to the actor-observer role differences in the self-serving bias. Within the workplace, victims of serious occupational accidents tend to attribute their accidents to external factors, whereas their coworkers and management tend to attribute the accidents to the victims' own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gyekye|first=Seth Ayim|author2=Salminen, Simo |title=The self-defensive attribution hypothesis in the work environment: Co-workers' perspectives|journal=Safety Science|year=2006|volume=44|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2005.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpersonal dynamics of the self-serving bias in the previous section have implications for attributions for outcomes in the workplace. In an investigation of [[group dynamics]], virtual group members had to complete a decision-making task via computer-mediated communication. Results showed that the self-serving bias was present in negative outcomes, and that greater interpersonal distance from group members increased blame for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Walther&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=J. B.|author2=Bazarova, N. N. |title=Misattribution in virtual groups: The effects of member distribution on self-serving bias and partner blame|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narcissism====
Studies revealed that [[narcissism]] was related to enhanced self-ratings of leadership, even when controlling for the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five traits]]. Another study showed that narcissism was related to enhanced leadership self-perceptions; indeed, whereas narcissism was significantly positively correlated with self-ratings of leadership, it was significantly negatively related to other ratings of leadership. This study also revealed that narcissism was related to more favorable self-ratings of [[workplace deviance]] and contextual performance compared to other (supervisor) ratings.&lt;ref name=JAP&gt;{{cite journal|title=Loving Yourself Abundantly: Relationship of the Narcissistic Personality to Self- and Other Perceptions of Workplace Deviance, Leadership, and Task and Contextual Performance|url=http://www.timothy-judge.com/Judge,%20LePine,%20and%20Rich%20JAP%202006.pdf|work=Journal of Applied Psychology|publisher=|date=2006|volume= 91|issue=4|pages= 762–776|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.762 |last1=Judge|first1=Timothy A.|last2=Lepine|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Rich|first3=Bruce L.|pmid=16834504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because narcissism broadly reflects strong self-admiration and behavioral tendencies which may not be viewed positively by others it is possible that narcissism influences self- and other perceptions differently, and insight into this possibility may be important given that differences in perceptions are the foundation for certain types of performance management and development practices.&lt;ref name=JAP/&gt;

===Classroom===
Studies in both lab and field settings have shown both teachers and students hold self-serving biases in regard to outcomes in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAllister|first=Hunter A.|title=Self-serving bias in the classroom: Who shows it? Who knows it?|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1996|volume=88|issue=1|pages=123–131|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.88.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributions hold the potential for conflict between teacher and student since neither will take personal responsibility, as the student may blame the teacher while the teacher holds the student accountable. However, both teachers and students also reported being aware of the others' bias, which indicated there may be a feasible conflict resolution mechanism.

===Computer technology===
Computers have become an integral part of everyday life, and research has shown that individuals may subconsciously treat interactions with computers as they would treat a social situation.&lt;ref name="Moon 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moon|first=Youngme|title=Intimate exchanges: Using computers to elicit self-disclosure from consumers|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=324–340|doi=10.1086/209566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding combined with what is known about the self-serving bias in interpersonal relations indicates that consumers that use a computer to buy products will take personal credit for successful purchases but blame the computer for negative purchase experiences. It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have "intimate [[self-disclosure]]" with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the discloser feel vulnerable.&lt;ref name=Moon /&gt; Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serenko|first= A.|year=2007|title= Are interface agents scapegoats? Attributions of responsibility in human-agent interaction|journal= Interacting with Computers |volume= 19|issue= 2|pages=293–303|url=http://www.aserenko.com/papers/IwC_Published_Scapegoats_Serenko.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2006.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Individuals have been shown to exhibit the self-serving bias in regard to sports outcomes. In one study, collegiate wrestlers at the Division I level made self-reported attributions of the outcomes in their preseason matches. Winners were more likely than losers to attribute the match outcome to internal causes.&lt;ref name=DeMichele /&gt; The researchers note that wrestling is a one-on-one sport and has clearly defined winners. Therefore, other sports of this nature may show similar results, but other team sports or sports with more ambiguous outcomes may not show the same pattern for the self-serving bias.&lt;ref name=DeMichele /&gt; In another study conducted in 1987, the research focused on comparing the self-serving attributions made by individuals who played single sports and those who played in teams. The study gathered 549 statements that were coded for attributional content from lone performers such as tennis and golf players and team performers such as baseball, football or basketball players.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaccaro|first=Stephen J.|last2=Peterson|first2=Christopher|last3=Walker|first3=Steven|date=1987|title=Self-Serving Attributions for Individual and Group Performance|jstor=2786826|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=50|issue=3|pages=257–263|doi=10.2307/2786826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that “lone performers made more self-serving attributions than team performers” because their performance outcomes have a greater effect on their individual esteem unlike for group outcomes where it “must often be distributed among all participants.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To expand upon self-serving attributions made by team sports, a study conducted in 1980 coded “newspaper accounts of baseball and football for attributional content.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Richard|last2=Russel|first2=Dan|date=1980|title=Attributions in the Sports Pages|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|pages=29–38|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.1.29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coding of the newspaper accounts showed that there was a “tendency to make internal attributions for success and external attributions for failure” which supports the self-serving bias as about 75% of the attributions from winning teams were internal while about 55% of attributions from losing teams were internal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Depression===
{{See also|Depressive realism}}

Clinically depressed patients tend to show less of a self-serving bias than individuals in the general population.&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al" /&gt; In a study exploring the effects of mood on the self-serving bias, the moods of participants were manipulated to be either positive or negative. Negative mood participants were less likely to attribute successful outcomes to the self than positive mood participants, attributing success to external factors.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=R.|author2=Holley, P. |author3=Shaffer, C. |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=130|issue=4|pages=565–567|pmid=2232740|title=Effect of transient mood state on the self-serving bias|doi=10.1080/00224545.1990.9924621}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the negative mood within depressed individuals as well as their self-focused attention explains why clinically depressed populations are less likely to exhibit the self-serving bias than normal populations.&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al" /&gt;

==Neural research outcomes==

===Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)===
The self-serving bias has been investigated by the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI method]] in normal populations. Attributions using the bias show activation in the [[dorsal striatum]], which plays a role in motivated behavior, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulate.&lt;ref name="Blackwood-2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwood|first=NJ|author2=Bentall RP |author3=Fytche DH |author4=Simmons A |author5=Murray RM |author6=Howard RJ. |title=Self-responsibility and the self-serving bias: an fMRI investigation of causal attributions|journal=NeuroImage|year=2003|volume=20|issue=2|pages=1076–85|doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(03)00331-8|pmid=14568477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Eva-Maria|author2=Eickhoff, Simon B. |author3=Kellermann, Thilo |author4=Schneider, Frank |author5=Gur, Ruben C. |author6=Habel, Ute |author7=Derntl, Birgit |title=Who is to blame? Neural correlates of causal attribution in social situations|journal=Social Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=335–350|doi=10.1080/17470911003615997|pmid=20162490}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] patients, there appear to be weaker connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and limbic areas of the brain, so this connection may play a role in self-serving attributions.&lt;ref name="Seidel-2011" /&gt;

===Electroencephalography (EEG)===
In a study employing the [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] method of examining brain activation, participants were given bogus outcome feedback that indicated either success or failure and told to make attributions. Different from non-self-serving responses, self-serving responses did not show increased dorsomedial frontal cortex activity preceding attribution decisions. Such lack of brain activity implies that self-control, which is controlled by the dorsomedial frontal cortex, is not as prominent in self-serving attributions as non-self-serving ones.&lt;ref name="Krusemark et al" /&gt;

'''Sustainable gardening''' includes the more specific sustainable landscapes, sustainable landscape design, [[sustainable landscaping]], [[sustainable landscape architecture]], resulting in sustainable sites. It comprises a disparate group of [[Horticulture|horticultural]] interests that can share the aims and objectives associated with the international post-1980s [[sustainable development]] and [[sustainability]] programs developed to address the fact that humans are now using natural biophysical resources faster than they can be replenished by nature.&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005).

Included within this compass are those home gardeners, and members of the landscape and nursery industries, and municipal authorities, that integrate environmental, social, and economic factors to create a more sustainable future.

[[Organic gardening]] and the use of [[native plants]] are integral to sustainable gardening.&lt;ref name="cornucopia"&gt;[http://www.cornucopianetwork.org/Spring_2009.pdf "Sustainable Gardening: The New Generation of Eco-Friendly Gardening!", ''Cornucopia Network of New Jersey, Inc.

==Historical development==
{{Main|Sustainability|Sustainable development|}}
After the establishment of [[sustainable agriculture]] in the early 1980s it was some time before the emergence of Sustainable Horticulture (as sustainable ''production'' horticulture) at the International Society of Horticultural Science's First International Symposium on Sustainability in Horticulture held at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. This symposium produced "conclusions ... on Sustainability in Horticulture and a Declaration for the 21st Century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/638/638_65.htm] Bertschinger, L. et al.

Many of the eco-friendly principles and ideas espoused by sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites perpetuate sustainable practices established as a reaction to resource-intensive [[industrial agriculture]]. These practices were established as movements for self-sufficiency and small-scale farming based on a holistic systems approach and ecological principles. Included here would be: [[biodynamic agriculture]], [[no-till farming]], [[agroecology]], [[Fukuoka farming]], [[forest gardening]], [[organic gardening]] and others. On a larger scale there is the more recent "whole farm planning"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015654/http://landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119 |date=2009-02-19 }} ''Outline of the Whole Farm Planning philosophy and application''.

==Definition==
The American Sustainable Sites Initiative&lt;ref name=SS&gt;[http://www.sustainablesites.org] American Society of Landscape Architects, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas at Austin United States Botanic Garden. The sustainable sites initiative. ''Guidelines and performance benchmarks''. The sustainable sites initiative. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interdisciplinary approach used by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]] to create voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices: it was founded in 2005. Using the United Nations [[Brundtland Report]]’s definition of sustainable development as a model, it defines sustainability within its own sphere of reference as:&lt;blockquote&gt; … ''design, construction, operations and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'' &lt;/blockquote&gt; by attempting to: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...''protect, restore and enhance the ability of landscapes to provide [[ecosystem services]] that benefit humans and other organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. American Society of Landscape Architects, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas at Austin United States Botanic Garden. pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Principles and concepts==
Managing global biophysical cycles and ecosystem services for the benefit of humans, other organisms and future generations has now become a global human responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. 1987.[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm "Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development."] General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. Retrieved: 2009-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; The method of applying sustainability to gardens, landscapes and sites is still under development and varies somewhat according to the context under consideration. However, there are a number of basic and common underlying biological and operational principles and practices in the sustainable sites literature.

===Biological principles===
Sustainable management of man-made landscapes emulates the natural processes that sustain the biosphere and its ecosystems. First and foremost is the harnessing the energy of the Sun and the cycling of materials thereby minimising waste and energy use.

Running within, and dependent on, the natural economy there is the production and consumption of goods and services in the “human economy” which has now significantly altered, in a detrimental way, natural biogeochemical cycles (notable here are the [[water cycle]], [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]] so sustainable practices maximise support for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="MEA" /&gt;

====Native plants====
The use of [[native plants]] in a garden or landscape can both preserve and protect natural ecosystems, and reduce the amount of care and energy required to maintain a healthy garden or landscape. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and geology, and often require less maintenance than exotic species. Native plants also support populations of native birds, insects, and other animals that they [[coevolved]] with, thus promoting a healthy [[Community (ecology)|community]] of organisms.&lt;ref name="cornucopia" /&gt;

Plants in a garden or maintained landscape often form a [[Source-sink dynamics|source population]] from which plants can colonize new areas. Avoiding the use of [[invasive species]] helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations. Similarly, the use of native species can provide a valuable source to help these plants colonise new areas.

Some non-native species can form an [[ecological trap]] in which native species are lured into an environment that appears attractive but is poorly suited to them.

However, in Britain research by the University of Sheffield as part of the BUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) [http://www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk] has revealed that for many invertebrates - the majority of wild animals in most gardens - it is not just native plants which can sustain them. The findings were published in popular form in Ken Thompson's book 'No Nettles Required: The truth about wildlife gardening'[https://web.archive.org/web/20100602032208/http://www.rbooks.co.uk/product.aspx?id=1905811144]. He confirms the approach which Chris Baines had promoted in 'How to Make a Wildlife Garden' [http://www.franceslincoln.co.uk/en/C/0/Book/213/How_to_Make_a_Wildlife_Garden.html].

===Operational principles===
Enhancement of ecosystem services is encouraged throughout the lifecycle of any site by providing clear design, construction, (operations), and management criteria.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; To be sustainable over the long term requires environmental, social and economic demands are integrated to provide intergenerational equity by providing regenerative sustainable systems. Operational guidelines will link to and supplement existing guidelines for the built environment (supplementing existing green building and landscape guidelines),&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; the wider environment, and they will include metrics (benchmarks, audits, criteria, indexes etc.) that give some [[sustainability measurement|measure of sustainability]] (a rating system) by clarifying what is sustainable or not sustainable or, more likely, what is more or less sustainable.

====Scale====
Impacts of a site can be assessed and measured over any spatio-temporal scale or context.

====Direct and indirect environmental impact====
Impacts of a site may be ''direct'' by having direct measurable impacts on biodiversity and ecology at the site itself or ''indirect'' when impacts occur away from the site.

===Site principles===
[[File:Compost heap, Kew Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 215033.jpg|thumb|[[Compost]] heap at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]]]
The following are some site principles for sustainable gardening:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;
* Do no harm
* Use the [[Precautionary principle]]
* Design with nature and culture
* Use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration
* Provide regenerative systems as [[intergenerational equity]]
* Support a living process
* Use a system thinking approach
* Use a collaborative and ethical approach
* Maintain integrity in leadership and research
* Foster environmental stewardship

==Measuring site sustainability==
One major feature distinguishing the approach of sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites from other similar enterprises is the quantification of site sustainability by establishing performance benchmarks. Because sustainability is such a broad and inclusive concept the environmental impacts of sites can be categorised in numerous ways depending on the purpose for which the figures are required. The process can include minimising negative environmental impacts and maximising positive impacts. As currently applied the environment is usually given priority over social and economic factors which may be added in or regarded as an inevitable and integral part of the management process. A home gardener is likely to use simpler metrics than a professional landscaper or ecologist.

Three methodologies for measuring site sustainability include [[BREEAM]] developed by the BRE organisation in the UK, Leed, developed in America and the Oxford 360 degree sustainability Index used in Oxford Park and developed by the Oxford Sustainable Group in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The ''Sustainable Sites Initiative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/ |title=Sustainable Sites Initiative |publisher=Sustainablesites.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is producing recommendations for the American Landscape Industry. The standards and guidelines finally adopted will lead to a uniform national standard, which does not currently exist. Sustainable Sites is currently in the pilot program stage, and will formally introduce its first rating system by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Sites FAQs|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/faqs/|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Green Building Council supports the project and plans to adopt the Sustainable Sites metrics into future versions of its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System. Sites are rated according to their impact on ecosystem services:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; The following ecosystem services have been identified by the study group:

'''''The Power Elite''''' is a 1956 book by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]], in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the [[military]], [[corporate]], and [[political]] elements of [[society]] and suggests that the ordinary [[citizen]] is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.

==Background==
The book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]'', which examines the then-growing role of [[Middle management|middle managers]] in American society. A main inspiration for the book was [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book ''[[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]'' in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. ''Behemoth'' had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the "tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy".&lt;ref&gt;C.Wright Mills: ''Power, Politics and People'', (New York, 1963 p.174)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff 1949.jpg|thumb|275px|left|The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], pictured here in 1949, are four of six ruling elites Mills identified.]]
According to Mills, the eponymous "power elite" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, "the underlying populations of the world." The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) "two or three hundred giant corporations" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from "a decentralized set of several dozen states" and "now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure," and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of "distrust fed by state militia," but now an entity with "all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain."

Importantly, and in distinction from modern American [[conspiracy theory]], Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that "often they are uncertain about their roles" and "without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide." Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at [[east coast of the United States|eastern]] establishment universities like [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. But, Mills notes, "Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?" Mills identifies two classes of [[Ivy League]] alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]] or [[final club]], such as [[Porcellian]] and [[Fly Club]], and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private [[University-preparatory school#United States|preparatory academies]], where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. 
[[File:Joseph and Rose Kennedy 1940.JPG|thumb|275px|right|Historically prominent families, such as the Kennedy family, form the "Metropolitan 400." Shown here are Rose and Joseph Kennedy in 1940.]]
The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: 
* the "Metropolitan 400" - members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the [[Social Register]]
* "Celebrities" - prominent entertainers and media personalities
* the "Chief Executives" - presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector
* the "Corporate Rich" - major landowners and corporate shareholders
* the "Warlords" - senior military officers, most importantly the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]
* the "Political Directorate" - "fifty-odd men of the executive branch" of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the [[Executive Office of the President]], sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] parties but usually professional government [[bureaucrat]]s

Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: "Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociological Imagination|last=Mills|first=C. Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
Commenting on ''The Power Elite'', [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] derisively said, "I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again."&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Summers |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Deciders |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/books/review/14summers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=14 May 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Berle]] noted the book contained "an uncomfortable degree of truth", but Mills presented "an angry cartoon, not a serious picture".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY" /&gt;  [[Dennis Wrong]] described ''The Power Elite'' as "an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Wrong |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Power Elite, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-power-elite-by-c-wright-mills/ |work=Commentary Magazine |publisher= |date=September 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the book in the ''Louisiana Law Review'' bemoaned that the "practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Calvin |last=Woodard |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=THE POWER ELITE, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2448&amp;context=lalrev |work=Louisiana Law Review |publisher= |date=December 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, [[G. William Domhoff]] wrote, "Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=G. William|last=Domhoff|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mills's The Power Elite, 50 Years Later |work=Contemporary Sociology |publisher= |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that ''The Power Elite'' was "vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering" but declared that its historical value "seems assured".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"/&gt; In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.&lt;ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Episode 5 of the [[Netflix]] [[TV series]] ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]'' contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah "Debbie" Mitford, writes a paper on [[C. Wright Mills]]'s ''The Power Elite''.

{{IPA notice}}

'''Tone letters''' are [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] that represent the [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] of a language, most commonly in languages with [[Tone contour|contour tones]].

==Chao tone letters (IPA)==
[[Image:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|150px|The tone contours of Mandarin Chinese. In the convention for Chinese, 1 is low and 5 is high. The corresponding tone letters are {{IPA|˥ ˧˥ ˨˩˦ ˥˩}}.]]
A series of [[iconicity|iconic]] tone letters based on a [[musical staff]] was devised by [[Yuen Ren Chao]] and adopted into the [[International Phonetic Alphabet#Suprasegmentals|International Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Chao|1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the contour had been drawn without the staff, making the height of the tone difficult to read. 

Combinations of these tone letters are schematics of the [[pitch contour]] of a tone, mapping the pitch in the letter space and ending in a vertical bar. For example, {{IPA|[ma˨˩˦]}} represents the mid-dipping pitch contour of the Chinese word for horse, 馬/马 ''mǎ''. Single tone letters differentiate up to five pitch levels: {{IPA|˥}} 'extra high' or 'top', {{IPA|˦}} 'high', {{IPA|˧}} 'mid', {{IPA|˨}} 'low', and {{IPA|˩}} 'extra low' or 'bottom'. No language is known to depend on more than five levels of pitch.

These letters are most commonly written at the end of a syllable.&lt;ref name="Chao1956"&gt;{{Harv|Chao|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chao1968"&gt;{{Harv|Chao|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Standard Mandarin]] has the following four tones in syllables spoken in isolation:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto"
! Tone&lt;br&gt;name !! Tone&lt;br&gt;letter !! Chao tone&lt;br&gt;numerals || Tone&lt;br&gt;number !! Traditional&lt;br&gt;Chinese !! Simplified&lt;br&gt;Chinese !! Gloss
|-
|High level
| {{IPA|ma˥}}
| ma55
| ma1
| 媽
| 妈
| mother
|-
|Mid rising 
| {{IPA|ma˧˥}}
| ma35
| ma2
| 麻
| 麻
| hemp
|-
|Low dipping 
| {{IPA|ma˨˩˦}}
| ma214
| ma3
| 馬
| 马
| horse
|-
|High falling
| {{IPA|ma˥˩}}
| ma51
| ma4
| 罵
| 骂
| scold
|}
However, they are sometimes written before the syllable, in accordance with writing stress and [[downstep]] before the syllable. For example, the following passage transcribes the prosody of [[European Portuguese]] using tone letters alongside stress, [[upstep]], and downstep in the same position before the syllable:&lt;ref&gt;"Portuguese (European)", IPA ''Handbook'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{IPA|[u ꜛˈvẽtu ˈnɔɾtɯ kumɯˈso ɐ suˈpɾaɾ kõ ˈmũitɐ '''˩˧'''fuɾiɐ {{!}} mɐʃ ꜛˈku̯ɐ̃tu maiʃ su'''˩˧'''pɾavɐ {{!}} maiz ꜛu viɐꜜˈʒɐ̃tɯ si ɐkõʃꜜˈɡava suɐ '''˧˩'''kapɐ {{!}} ɐˈtɛ ꜛkiu ˈvẽtu ˈnɔɾtɯ '''˧˩'''d̥z̥ʃtiu ǁ]}}

:''O vento norte começou a soprar com muita fúria, mas quanto mais soprava, mais o viajante se aconchegava à sua capa, até que o vento norte desistiu.''

[[Diacritic]]s may also be used to transcribe tone in the IPA. For example, [[tone number|tone 3]] in Mandarin is a low tone between other syllables, and can be represented as such [[phoneme|phonemically]]. The four Mandarin tones can therefore also be transcribed {{IPA|[má, mǎ, mà, mâ]}}. (Note that these conflict with the convention of [[Pinyin]], and so in this case IPA diacritics may be confusing. In pinyin these would be transcribed mā, má, mǎ, mà respectively)

===Modified Chao tone letters===
Sinologists sometimes use reversed Chao tone letters to indicate [[tone sandhi]], with the IPA left-facing letters on the left for the underlying tone, and reversed right-facing letters on the right for the surface tone. For example, the Mandarin phrase ''nǐ'' {{IPA|[ni˨˩˦]}} + ''hǎo'' {{IPA|[xaʊ˨˩˦]}} &gt; ''ní hǎo'' {{IPA|[ni˧˥xaʊ˨˩˦]}} would be transcribed:
:{{IPA|[ni˨˩˦꜔꜒xaʊ˨˩˦]}}

== Numerical values ==
Tone letters are often transliterated into numerals, particularly in Asian and Mesoamerican tone languages. Until the spread of [[OpenType]] computer fonts starting in 2000–2001, tone letters were not practical for many applications. A numerical substitute has been commonly used for tone contours, with a numerical value assigned to the beginning, end, and sometimes middle of the contour. For example, the four Mandarin tones are commonly transcribed as "ma55", "ma35", "ma214", "ma51".&lt;ref&gt;The Mandarin high tone is usually written as "ma55" instead of as "ma5" to both avoid confusion with ''[[tone number]]'' 5, and to show this is not an "abrupt" tone.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such numerical systems are ambiguous. In Asian languages such as Chinese, convention assigns the lowest pitch a 1 and the highest a 5, corresponding to [[fundamental frequency]] (f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Conversely, in Africa the lowest tone is assigned a 5 and the highest a 1, barring a few exceptional cases with six tone levels, which may have the opposite convention of 1 being low and 6 being high. In the case of Mesoamerican languages, the highest tone is 1 but the lowest depends on the number of contrastive pitch levels in the language being transcribed. For example, an [[Otomanguean]] language with three level tones will denote them as 1 (high {{IPA|/˥/}}), 2 (mid {{IPA|/˧/}}) and 3 (low {{IPA|/˩/}}). (Three-tone systems occur in [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtecan]], [[Chinantecan languages|Chinantecan]] and [[Amuzgoan languages|Amuzgoan]] languages.) A reader accustomed to Chinese usage will misinterpret the Mixtec low tone as mid, and the high tone as low. Because tone letters are iconic, and musical staves are internationally recognized with high tone at the top and low tone at the bottom, tone letters do not suffer from this ambiguity.

|}

== Division of tone space ==
The [[International Phonetic Association]] suggests using the tone letters to represent [[phoneme|phonemic contrasts]]. For example, if a language has a single falling tone, then it should be transcribed as {{IPA|/˥˩/}}, even if this tone does not fall across the entire pitch range.&lt;ref name="IPAHanbook"&gt;(International Phonetic Association 1999, p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of a precise linguistic analysis there are at least three approaches: linear, exponential, and language-specific. A linear approach is to map the tone levels directly to [[fundamental frequency]] (f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), by subtracting the tone with lowest f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the tone with highest f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and dividing this space into four equal f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; intervals. Tone letters are then chosen based on the f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; [[tone contour]]s over this region.&lt;ref name="Vance1977"&gt;{{Harv|Vance|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Du1988"&gt;{{Harv|Du|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This linear approach is systematic, but it does not always align the beginning and end of each tone with the proposed tone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cheng|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chao's earlier description of the tone levels is an exponential approach. Chao proposed five tone levels, where each level is spaced two [[semitone]]s apart.&lt;ref name="Chao1956" /&gt; A later description provides only one semitone between levels 1 and 2, and three semitones between levels 2 and 3.&lt;ref name="Chao1968" /&gt; This updated description may be a language-specific division of the tone space.&lt;ref name="Fon2004"&gt;{{Harv|Fon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IPA tone letters in Unicode ==
In Unicode, the IPA tone letters are encoded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U02B0.pdf Unicode chart Spacing Modifying Letters] (U+02B0.., pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{unichar|02E5|MODIFIER LETTER EXTRA-HIGH TONE BAR|html=}}
* {{unichar|02E6|MODIFIER LETTER HIGH TONE BAR|html=}}
* {{unichar|02E7|MODIFIER LETTER MID TONE BAR|html=}}
* {{unichar|02E8|MODIFIER LETTER LOW TONE BAR|html=}}
* {{unichar|02E9|MODIFIER LETTER EXTRA-LOW TONE BAR|html=}}
These are combined in sequence for contour tones. Unicode includes other tone letters, such as [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet|UPA]] and extended tone marks for [[bopomofo]] (see).

The reversed tone letters are:

: {{angbr|{{IPA|꜒ ꜓ ꜔ ꜕ ꜖}}}}.

The dotted tone letters are: {{angbr|{{IPA|꜈ ꜉ ꜊ ꜋ ꜌}}}} and reversed {{angbr|{{IPA|꜍ ꜎ ꜏ ꜐ ꜑}}}}.

== Non-IPA systems ==
Although the phrase "tone letter" generally refers to the Chao system, there are also orthographies with letters assigned to individual tones, and these may also be called tone letters.

In several systems, [[tone number]]s are integrated into the orthography, so that they are technically letters even though they continue to be called "numbers". However, in the case of [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]], the 1957 Chinese orthography modified the digits to make them graphically distinct from digits used numerically; two letters were adopted from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: {{angbr|з}} and {{angbr|ч}}, replacing the similar-looking tone numbers {{angbr|3}} and {{angbr|4}}. In 1982 these were replaced with Latin letters, one of which, {{angbr|h}}, now pulls double-duty as a consonant letter for {{IPA|/h/}} and as a tone letter for mid tone.

The Hmong [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] was devised in the early 1950s with Latin tone letters. Two of the 'tones' are more accurately called [[register (phonology)|register]], as tone is not their distinguishing feature. Several of the letters pull double duty representing consonants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36908">'''Transformative learning''' theory says that the process of "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self; transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed processes such as appreciatively accessing and receiving the symbolic contents of the unconscious and critically analyzing underlying premises.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, 1997, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. [[Jack Mezirow]] believes that it usually results from a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a [[identity crisis (psychology)|life crisis]] or major life transition—although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1995, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher, also promote transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Torosyan, 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of transformative learning is for individuals to change their frames of reference by critically reflecting on their assumptions and beliefs and consciously making and implementing plans that bring about new ways of defining their worlds. This process is fundamentally rational and analytical.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997"&gt;Mezirow, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grabove 1997, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Mezirow==
[[Jack Mezirow]] developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2014/october/jack-mezirow-who-transformed-the-field-of-adult-learning-d/|title=Jack Mezirow, Who Transformed the Field of Adult Learning, Dies at 91|website=Teachers College - Columbia University|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the theory has evolved "into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and reformulate the meaning of their experience."&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), "they must engage in critical reflection on their experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation."&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1991, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning schemes that make up meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning.

{{quote|A defining condition of being human is that we have to understand the meaning of our experience. For some, any uncritically assimilated explanation by an authority figure will suffice. But in contemporary societies we must learn to make our own interpretations rather than act on the purposes, beliefs, judgements, and feelings of others. Facilitating such understandings is the cardinal goal of adult education. Transformative learning develops autonomous thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1997, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A perspective transformation leading to transformative learning, however, occurs much less frequently. Mezirow believes that this less frequent transformation usually results from a "disorienting dilemma", which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition, although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1995, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective is explained by Mezirow as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Imel |first=Susan |title=Transformative Learning in Adulthood. ERIC Digest No. 200. |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED423426 |date=1998 |website=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] |access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitchenham|first=Andrew|date=2008-04-01|title=The Evolution of John Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1541344608322678|journal=Journal of Transformative Education|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=104–123|doi=10.1177/1541344608322678|issn=1541-3446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other perspectives==
A number of critical responses to Mezirow's theory of transformative learning have emerged over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See Cranton (1994) and Taylor (1998) for a full discussion of these critiques.&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of Mezirow's theory is its emphasis upon rationality. Some studies support Mezirow. Others conclude that Mezirow grants rational critical reflection too much importance.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1998, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward W. Taylor&lt;ref name="Transformative Learning Theory"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Taylor |author2=Edward W. |title= Transformative Learning Theory: A Neurobiological Perspective of the Role of Emotions and Unconscious Ways of Knowing|journal= International Journal of Lifelong Education |date=May–June 2001 |volume=20|issue=3|pages=218–236|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ627580 |doi=10.1080/02601370110036064}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since suggested neurobiological research as a promising area that may offer some explanation about the role emotions play, closing the gap between rationality and emotion in the transformative learning process. Taylor implies that, with available modern technology such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), these once obscure factors can now be examined through determining which neurological brain systems are at work during disorienting dilemmas and the journey of recovery that follows.  This neurobiological research also stresses the importance of the role of [[implicit memory]], from which emerge habits, attitudes and preferences that are related to unconscious thoughts and actions.

While the learning process is certainly rational on some levels, it is also a profound experience that can be described as a spiritual or emotional transformation as well. The experience of undoing racist, sexist, and other oppressive attitudes can be painful and emotional, as these attitudes have often been developed as ways to cope with and make sense of the world. This type of learning requires taking risks, and a willingness to be vulnerable and have one's attitudes and assumptions challenged.

Other theorists have proposed a view of transformative learning as an intuitive and emotional process. John M. Dirkx, Robert D. Boyd, J. Gordon Myers, and Rosemary R. Ruether link Mezirow's rational, cognitive and analytical approach to a more intuitive, creative and holistic view of transformative learning.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; This view of transformative learning is based primarily on the work of Robert Boyd,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who has developed a theory of transformative education based on [[analytical psychology|analytical (or depth) psychology]].

For Boyd, transformation is a "fundamental change in one's personality involving [together] the resolution of a personal dilemma and the expansion of consciousness resulting in greater personality integration".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, 1989, p. 459, cited in Taylor 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This calls upon extra-rational sources such as [[symbol]]s, [[image]]s, and [[archetype]]s to assist in creating a personal vision or meaning of what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988; Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

First, an individual must be receptive or open to receiving "alternative expressions of meaning", and then recognize that the message is authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Grieving, considered by Boyd to be the most critical phase of the discernment process, takes place when an individual realizes that old patterns or ways of perceiving are no longer relevant, moves to adopt or establish new ways, and finally integrates old and new patterns.  More recent research has specifically explored the process of transformative learning as it occurs in bereaved elders,&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly" &gt;{{cite journal |last= Moon |first= Paul J.|title= Bereaved elders: Transformative Learning Late in Life.  Adult Education Quarterly |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2011 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=22–39|url=http://aeq.sagepub.com/content/61/1/22.abstract |doi=10.1177/0741713610363020}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that the "disorienting dilemma" deemed necessary by Mezirow is present in the loss of a loved one, with an additional devastating factor being the isolation that the elderly in particular are likely to face. Another study considers transformative learning in the context of suicide bereavement.&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly b" &gt;{{cite journal | last= Sands |first= Diana. |author2=Tennant, Mark |title= Transformative Learning in the Context of Suicide Bereavement |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2010 |volume=60  |issue=2|pages=99 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/47875269/transformative-learning-context-suicide-bereavement |doi=10.1177/0741713609349932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the dilemma is compounded by the questioning of conceptions or misconceptions that were held about the relationship with the deceased, and the resolving of the meaning of that relationship during the grieving process.

Unlike Mezirow, who sees the ego as playing a central role in the process of perspective transformation, Boyd and Myers use a framework that moves beyond the ego and the emphasis on reason and logic to a definition of transformative learning that is more [[Social psychology#Psychosocial theory|psychosocial]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"&gt;Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of transformative learning was put forward by Edmund O'Sullivan:&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;O'Sullivan, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. It is a shift of consciousness that dramatically and irreversibly alters our way of being in the world. Such a shift involves our understanding of ourselves and our self-locations; our relationships with other humans and with the natural world; our understanding of relations of power in interlocking structures of class, race and gender; our body awareness, our visions of alternative approaches to living; and our sense of possibilities for social justice and peace and personal joy.}}

Positing that understanding transformative learning may have been hindered by perspectives of rational thought and Western traditions, Kathleen P. King&lt;ref name="OS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; provides an alternate model grounded in a meta-analysis of research, the "Transformative Learning Opportunities Model".

Recent considerations of these varying perspectives seem to indicate that one perspective does not need to exclude the other. For example, Mezirow and Dirkx discussed their views on transformative learning at a 2005 International Transformative Learning Conference. This dialogue, facilitated by Patricia Cranton, continued via email after the conference and the overview was published in the ''[[Journal of Transformative Education]]''.  Dirkx focuses on subjectivity, in the power of the inner world in one's shift in view of the outer world.  Mezirow emphasizes critical assessment of assumptions.  Although their approaches are different, they agree that their perspectives are similar in several aspects. This includes transforming frames of reference that have lost meaning or have become dysfunctional, and fostering enhanced awareness and consciousness of one's being in the world. Both perspectives are required to deepen understanding and to incorporate these ways of learning into transformative education.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, Mezirow &amp;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the difficulties in defining transformative learning is that it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as "[[meaning making]]" or "[[critical thinking]]".

The term "meaning making" (i.e., constructing meaning) is found most frequently in [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approaches to education, based on the work of educators such as [[John Dewey]], [[Maria Montessori]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]]. In the constructivist view, meaning is constructed from knowledge.

John Dirkx views transformational learning as a [[meaning-making]] process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision of society and self-actualization of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1998). Transformative learning theory in the practice of adult education: An overview. ''PAACE Journal of Lifelong Learning, 7,'' 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning ''is'' life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment to focus on the here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language for helping us learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1997). Nurturing soul in adult education. Retrieved from https://www.msu.edu/~dirkx/DIRKX.CHP.htm#N_1_ on October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.

Mezirow&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; posits that all learning is change but not all change is transformation. There is a difference between transmissional, transactional and transformational education.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Seller, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student. In transactional education, it is recognized that the student has valuable experiences, and learns best through experience, inquiry, critical thinking and interaction with other learners. It could be argued that some of the research regarding transformative learning has been in the realm of transactional education, and that what is seen as transformative by some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cragg et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is in fact still within the realm of transactional learning.

According to Stephen D. Brookfield, learning can only be considered transformative if it involves a fundamental questioning or reordering of how one thinks or acts; a challenge to hegemonic  implications.&lt;ref&gt;Brookfield, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, reflection alone does not result in transformative learning unless the process involves a critical reflection, a recognition and analysis of taken-for-granted assumptions.

==In practice==
On the surface, the two views of transformative learning presented here are contradictory. One advocates a rational approach that depends primarily on critical reflection whereas the other relies more on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[emotion]]. However, the differences in the two views may best be seen as a matter of emphasis. Both utilize rational processes and incorporate imagination as a part of a creative process. The two different views of transformative learning described here as well as examples of how it occurs in practice&lt;ref&gt;see Cranton, 1997 &amp; Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that no single model of transformative learning exists.

When transformative learning is the goal of [[adult education]], fostering a learning environment in which it can occur should consider the following:

===The role of the educator===
Transformative learning cannot be guaranteed.  Teachers can only provide an opportunity to transformatively learn.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Fullerton, James Roderick. ''Transformative learning in college students: A mixed methods study''. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to foster transformative learning, the educator's role is to assist learners in becoming aware and critical of assumptions. This includes their own assumptions that lead to their interpretations, beliefs, habits of mind, or points of view, as well as the assumptions of others. Educators must provide learners practice in recognizing frames of reference. By doing so, educators encourage practice in redefining problems from different perspectives.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; The goal is to create a community of learners who are "united in a shared experience of trying to make meaning of their life experience".&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin, 1993, pp. 320–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators need to provide learners with opportunities to effectively participate in discourse.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Discourse involves assessing beliefs, feelings, and values.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006"&gt;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view. Learners are able to validate how and what they understand, as well as develop well-informed judgments regarding a belief. Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator must encourage equal participation among students in discourse. One strategy is to encourage procedures that require group members to take on the roles of monitoring the direction of dialogue and ensuring equal participation. Educators can also encourage dialogue from different perspectives through controversial statements or readings from opposing points of view. It is necessary that the educator avoids shaping the discussion.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;

The role of educators is also to set objectives that include autonomous thinking.  By fostering learners' critical reflection and experience in discourse, autonomous thinking is possible. The foundations to thinking autonomously begin in childhood and continue in adulthood. The educator assists adult learners in becoming more critical in assessing assumptions, better at recognizing frames of references and alternate perspectives, as well as effective at collaborating with others to assess and arrive at judgments in regards to beliefs.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

It is the role of the educator to promote discovery learning through the implementation of classroom methods such as learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations. These methods facilitate transformative learning by helping learners examine concepts in the context of their lives and analyze the justification of new knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator's role in establishing an environment that builds trust and care and facilitates the development of sensitive relationships among learners is a fundamental principle of fostering transformative learning.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt; The educator also serves as a role model by demonstrating a willingness to learn and change.&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should provide the environment to allow students to reflect on their transformative learning experiences, but to also allow them to reflect on their own.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;King, Kathleen P. "Both sides now: Examining transformative learning and professional development of educators." ''Innovative higher education'' 29.2 (2004): 155-174.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, professional development is important to assist educators in becoming authentic and critically reflective.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003"&gt;Cranton &amp; King, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Mezirow outlines three ways in which experience is interpreted through reflection:&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, P., &amp; King, K.P. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Content reflection is the investigation of the content. A question that we might ask ourselves is “what did I do that led to the outcome?
* Process reflection includes checking on the problem-solving strategies that are used in the  classroom. For example, “do I understand the needs of my students?”
* Premise reflection is the question of the problem itself. A question might be "“why do I feel responsible for this situation”.

===The role of professional development for the educator===
Transformative learning about teaching occurs when educators critically examine their practice and develop alternative perspectives of understanding their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996"&gt;Cranton, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that fostering this critical examination become the role of professional development. The role of professional development is to assist educators in gaining awareness of their habits of mind regarding teaching.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; As this professional development occurs, educators critically examine the assumptions that underlie their practice, the consequences to their assumptions, and develop alternative perspectives on their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996" /&gt;

Teachers need education and professional development that will help them to question, challenge and experience critical discussions on school improvement. Transforming teachers so they see themselves as agents of social change can be a challenge within education.&lt;ref&gt;Lysaker &amp; Furuness, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strategies for transformative professional development ====
Strategies for transformative professional development include action plans, reflective activities, case studies, curriculum development, and critical-theory discussions. Action plans and reflective activities provide the practice and modelling of critical reflection on the profession of education, and provide guidance for the teaching and learning experience.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Through the use of real-life examples, case studies provide the opportunity to analyze assumptions, as well as the consequences of choices and actions. The use of case studies focuses on practice, and on the philosophical and practical aspects of educators' practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Curriculum development creates the opportunity to connect theory and practice. In addition to introducing new teaching techniques, educators can test and compare new concepts and practices with previous techniques. This testing and comparison moves away from uncritically accepting new teaching methods. Critical-theory discussions can be implemented to guide educators in questioning the meaning and purpose of information, encouraging educators to question the selection of the information they provide to their students.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt;

====Examples in educator professional development====
Mentoring is another strategy for transformative professional, personal and organizational development. By creating a supportive culture, mentoring can provide the environment for transformative learning to occur. Through this experience mentoring becomes a transformative relationship in which individuals reconstruct possible selves. As a two-way process, mentoring is a learning tool for both the mentor as well as the person being mentored.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"&gt;Fletcher, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent study, Karen Weller Swanson, applying theories of critical reflection, incorporating a critical incident model, and positing a learning partnership, designed a program for practicing teachers, for the purpose of transformative teacher development. Experiences were created to get teachers to reflect on their assumptions, asking them to consider alternative perspectives and to develop a language for making connections between theory and practice. Over the studies' two-year period, teachers were able to develop ownership of theory and transfer this knowledge into their practice. To be effective, transformative teacher development must value what teachers bring from their personal and professional experience, and acknowledge that learning is both an individual and a social experience.  The process involved: achieving transparency through negotiation of curriculum, finding a common language through discussion of individual assumptions, getting continuous feedback through critical-incident questions, and testing by teacher application of the program within their classrooms. Autobiography and journaling were additional techniques used within this learning partnership. Both teachers and faculty participating in the program were transformed as beliefs were challenged and knowledge was co-constructed throughout the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

New teachers often find expectations ambiguous, and they lack the self-awareness and understanding to navigate the educational environment. A transformative learning framework was used in a Foundations course, for participants to build on individual and collective analysis of teaching experiences, and to help them re-frame their practice. Giedre Kligyte investigated "transformation narratives" that emerged from written reflection of participants' teaching practice, based on individual reflection and group discussion. By using Mezirow's work, along with Robert Kegan's [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructive developmental theory]], Kligyte found the following themes: a move from non-reflective habitual action to a more conscious practice; a change in perspective to a more sophisticated view of teaching; an increased sense of agency, including the concept that academic practice is an object which can be controlled and shaped, rather than something externally imposed; increased confidence to take risks and experiment; and a more multifaceted idea of what it means to be an academic. The conducive environment allowed for transformative experiences to occur. Through creation of a safe social context where "disorienting dilemmas" can be examined, questioned, and explored, participants were able to develop a new "frame of reference" and reintegrate learning into practice. Kligyte cautions that there are limitations to the framework, such as the possibility that participants will conform to expectations in their reflections. She notes that the "transformation narratives" examined are not a single, final narrative of the self, but a snapshot for further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Kligyte, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kligyte's findings are similar to S. Fletcher's: that transformative learning helps to make sense of a complex and often ambiguous work environment, which requires multiple selves.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"/&gt;

===The role of the learner===
The educator becomes a facilitator when the goal of learning is for learners to construct knowledge about themselves, others, and social norms. As a result, learners play an important role in the learning environment and process.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;  Learners must create norms within the classroom that include civility, respect, and responsibility for helping one another learn. Learners must welcome diversity within the learning environment and aim for peer collaboration.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

Learners must become critical of their own assumptions in order to transform their unquestioned frame of reference. Through communicative learning, learners must work towards critically reflecting on assumptions that underlie intentions, values, beliefs, and feelings.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Learners are involved in objective re-framing of their frames of reference when they critically reflect on the assumptions of others. In contrast, subjective re-framing occurs when learners critically assess their own assumptions.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The role of the learner involves actively participating in discourse. Through discourse, learners are able to validate what is being communicated to them. This dialogue provides the opportunity to critically examine evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view, which fosters collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

===The role of the rational and the affective===
Transformative learning has two components that at times seem to be in conflict: the cognitive, rational, and objective and the intuitive, imaginative, and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Both the rational and the affective play a role in transformative learning. Although the emphasis has been on transformative learning as a rational process, teachers need to consider how they can help students use feelings and emotions both in critical reflection and as a means of reflection.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kegan, Robert (2000) What "form" transforms? A constructive-developmental approach to transformative learning. In Mezirow &amp; Associates Learning as Transformation: Critical Perspectives on a Theory in Progress. San Francisco: Jossey Bass&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of educational and research institutions that are based on the principles of transformative learning. Some examples include the [[Transformative Studies Institute]] and The Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) of the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence is emerging on the applicability of transformative theory in new educational programmes, in business and industry education, health professional education, community education such as courses offered by YMCA, and informal settings such as self-help groups. Phil Bamber and Les Hankin describe how students in a service-learning section experienced perspective transformation and shifts of their world-view when their training was influenced by transformative learning theory.&lt;ref name= "Transformative learning through service-learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bamber |first= Phil. |author2=Les Hankin |title= Transformative learning through service-learning: no passport required |journal= Transformative learning through service-learning|year=2011 | volume=53|issue=2/3|pages=190–206|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1917978 |doi=10.1108/00400911111115726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Imel states that transformative learning may not always be a goal of education, but its importance should not be overlooked. Educators should strive to understand it, even if they choose not to foster it.&lt;ref&gt;Imel, 1997.pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[File:Marocaster coronatus MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2 (Close up).jpg|thumb|right|Type specimen for ''[[Marocaster coronatus]]'' - [[Muséum de Toulouse]]]]
In biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock/&gt;

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251–255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, &amp; standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type specimen==
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.&lt;ref name="MarshallEvenhuis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117–127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.

This process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.

Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

Note that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CANBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant names – a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]].

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word "type" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first ''Laws of Botanical Nomenclature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.P.|year=1867|title=Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée à la congrès|publisher=J.-B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fr|Ce seul caractère permet de distinguer ce type de toutes les autres espèces de la section. … Après avoir étudié ces diverses formes, j'en arrivai à les considérer comme appartenant à un seul et même type spécifique.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{anchor|botany|Botany}}In botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached." (article 7.1)&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny "plant" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the "plant" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).

Note that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "big" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "small" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.
# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).
# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).

The ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

* holotype
* lectotype
* isotype
* syntype
* paratype
* neotype
* epitype

Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the ''ICN'': for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==
[[File:JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lycaenidae|gossamer-winged butterfly]], ''[[Jamides elioti]]'':&lt;br&gt;1) [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] and 2) ventral aspect of holotype,&lt;br&gt;3) dorsal and 4) ventral aspect of paratype]]
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens.  The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "name-bearing type" is a specimen or image that "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined."

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].
* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===
[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]
Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930–993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====
{{main|Holotype}}
When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====
{{main|Paratype}}
When the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"/&gt; The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====
{{Main|Syntype}}
A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.
In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

A notable example is that [[Carl Linnaeus]] is the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W. T. 1959. "The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology", ''Systematic Zoology'' 8 (1): 4-22, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707–711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hapantotype====
A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.

==== '''Iconotype''' ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, ''[[Burmese python|Python bivittatus]],'' is one of many species that are based on illustrations by [[Albertus Seba]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/62760#/summary|title=Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium Thesauri accurata Descriptio, et Iconibus artificiosissimus Expressio, per universam Physices Historiam.

The Complete Plates in Colour, 1734-1765. 2001.|url=|journal=International Society for the History and Bibliography of Herpetology|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in [[hymenopteran]]s which have polymorphic castes.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawksworth |first=D.L. |title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature.

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion parakeet]], which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|ISSN=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
{{Main|Type species}}
[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Type genus===
{{Main|Type genus}}
A type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

'''United States customary units''' are a [[Units of measurement|system of measurements]] commonly used in the [[United States]]. The '''United States customary system''' ('''USCS''' or '''USC''') developed from [[English units]] which were in use in the [[British Empire]] before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the [[imperial system]], changing the definitions of some units.  Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant [[comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems|differences between the systems]].

The majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the [[metre|meter]] and the [[kilogram]] with the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 and, in practice, for many years before.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall"&gt;[[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|T.C. Mendenhall]], Superintendent of Standard Weights and Measures. [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf Order of April 5, 1893] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930180925/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf |date=September 30, 2012}}, published as Appendix&amp;nbsp;6 to the Report for 1893 of the [[US Coast and Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]].&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions were refined by the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442"&gt;Astin, A.V., Karo, H.A. and Mueller, F.H. (June 25, 1959). Doc 59-5442, "[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound]." ''[[Federal Register]]''. When reading the document note that 999,998 = 3937 × 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Americans primarily use customary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social use. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, metric units are used. The [[International System of Units]] (SI), the modern form of the [[metric system]], is preferred for many uses by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/index.cfm Laws and Metric Program]. U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For newer units of measure where there is no traditional customary unit, international units are used, sometimes mixed with customary units, such as [[electrical resistance]] of wire expressed in [[ohm]]s (SI) per thousand feet.

==History==
{{See also|Imperial and US customary measurement systems|Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems}}

The United States system of units is similar to the British [[Imperial units|imperial system]].&lt;ref&gt;"English units of measurement". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' 6th ed. 2001-2007. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080714214207/http://www.bartleby.com/65/en/Englsh-u.html archived copy].&lt;/ref&gt; Both systems are derived from [[English units]], a system which had evolved over the millennia before American independence, and which had its roots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units.

The customary system was championed by the U.S.-based International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late 19th century. Advocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary, or metric, system as atheistic.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0HCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13162-7|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An auxiliary of the Institute in Ohio published a poem with wording such as "down with every 'metric' scheme" and "A perfect inch, a perfect pint".&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; One adherent of the customary system called it "a just weight and a just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord".&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

The U.S. government passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which made the [[metric system]] "the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce".  The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it ''voluntarily'' converts to the metric system, i.e., [[Metrication in the United States|metrification]]. This is most evident in U.S. labeling requirements on food products, where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary units.  According to the [[CIA Factbook]], the United States is one of three nations (along with [[Liberia]] and [[Burma]]) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures.&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter=Appendix G - Weights and Measures |date= |accessdate= August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, as well as many sectors of industry and government, including the [[U.S. armed forces|military]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook/&gt; There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters,&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Williams (February 8, 1998) [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/trouble-with-the-metric-system/3552102 "Trouble with the Metric System"]. Australian ''Radio National'', Ockham's Razor.&lt;/ref&gt; or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel to the foot.&lt;ref name="Tenner"&gt;Ed Tenner, (May 2005).

For measuring length, the U.S. customary system uses the [[inch]], [[Foot (length)|foot]], [[yard]], and [[mile]], which are the only four customary length measurements in everyday use. Since July 1, 1959, these have been defined on the basis of 1&amp;nbsp;yard&amp;nbsp;= 0.9144&amp;nbsp;meters except for some applications in surveying.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442" /&gt; The U.S., the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries agreed on this definition, and so it is often termed ''international measure''.

When international measure was introduced in the English-speaking countries, the basic [[geodetic datum]] in North America was the [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by [[triangulation]] based on the definition of the foot in the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, that is 1&amp;nbsp;foot&amp;nbsp;= {{sfrac|1200|3937}}&amp;nbsp;meters: this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the ''US survey foot'' to distinguish it from the international foot.&lt;ref name="FR59-5442" /&gt; For most applications, the difference between the two definitions is insignificant&amp;nbsp;– one international foot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about {{sfrac|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) per mile&amp;nbsp;– but it affects the definition of the [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#Feet |title= Frequently Asked Questions about the National Geodetic Survey |year= |work= [[National Geodetic Survey]] |accessdate= May 16, 2009 |contribution= What are the 'official' conversions that are used by NGS to convert 1) meters to inches, and 2) meters to feet?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAD27 was replaced in the 1980s by the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which is defined in meters. The SPCSs were also updated, but the [[National Geodetic Survey]] left the decision of which (if any) definition of the foot to use to the individual states. All SPCSs are defined in meters, but seven states also have SPCSs defined in US survey feet and an eighth state in international feet: the other 42&amp;nbsp;states use only meter-based SPCSs.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

State legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (2&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the US survey foot, eight have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and eighteen have not specified the conversion factor from metric units.&lt;ref name="NGS-FAQ" /&gt;

The [[cubic inch]], [[cubic foot]] and [[cubic yard]] are commonly used for measuring volume. In addition, there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids, and one for measuring [[dry volume|volumes of dry material]].

Other than the cubic inch, cubic foot and cubic yard, these units are differently sized from the units in the [[imperial system]], although the names of the units are similar. Also, while the U.S. has separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, the imperial system has one set of units for both.

One US fluid ounce is {{frac|1|16}} of a US pint, {{frac|1|32}} of a US quart, and {{frac|1|128}} of a US gallon. The teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup are defined in terms of a fluid ounce as {{frac| 1|6}}, {{frac|1|2}}, and 8 fluid ounces.  The fluid ounce derives its name originally from being the volume of one ounce [[avoirdupois]] of water, but in the US it is defined as {{frac|1|128}} of a US gallon. Consequently, a fluid ounce of water weighs about 1.041 ounces avoirdupois.

The saying "a pint's a pound the world around" refers to 16 US fluid ounces of water weighing approximately (about 4% more than) one pound avoirdupois. An imperial pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter (20&amp;nbsp;oz).

[[File:Metric shampoo bottle.jpg|thumb|right|A 23.7 US fl oz (700 mL) bottle displaying both US and metric units.]]
There are varying standards for [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] for some specific commodities, including 31 gal for beer, 40 gal for whiskey or kerosene, and 42 gal for petroleum.  The general standard for liquids is 31.5 gal or half a hogshead.  The common 55 gallon size of [[drum (container)|drum]] for storing and transporting various products and wastes is sometimes confused with a barrel, though it is not a standard measure.

In the U.S., single servings of beverages are usually measured in fluid ounces. Milk is usually sold in half pints (8 fluid ounces), pints, quarts, half gallons, and gallons. Water volume for sinks, bathtubs, ponds, swimming pools, etc., is usually stated in gallons or cubic feet.  Quantities of gases are usually given in cubic feet (at one atmosphere).

Minims, drams and gill are rarely used currently. The gill is often referred to as a "half-cup".

[[Dry volume]] is measured on a separate system, although many of the names remain the same. Small fruits and vegetables are often sold in dry pints and dry quarts. The US dry gallon is less commonly used, and was not included in the handbook that many states recognize as the authority on measurement law.&lt;ref name=HB44&gt;101st Conference on Weights and Measures 2016.

There have historically been five different English systems of mass: [[Pound (mass)#Tower pound|tower]], [[apothecaries' system|apothecaries']], [[troy weight|troy]], [[avoirdupois system|avoirdupois]], and [[metric system|metric]]. Of these, the avoirdupois weight is the most common system used in the U.S., although Troy weight is still used to weigh precious metals. Apothecaries weight—once used by pharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell out of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and was never used in the U.S. The [[imperial units|imperial]] system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations from U.S. customary units larger than a pound.

The pound avoirdupois, which forms the basis of the U.S. customary system of mass, is defined as exactly {{val|453.59237|u=[[gram]]s}} by agreement between the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries in 1959. Other units of mass are defined in terms of it.

The avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of [[mass]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/AppendC-09-HB44-FINAL.pdf NIST Handbook 44, Appendix C, ''General Tables of Units of Measurement'', page C-6 ''Avoirdupois Units of Mass''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018070228/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/AppendC-09-HB44-FINAL.pdf |date=2011-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name pound is also applied to measures of [[Force (physics)|force]]. For instance, in many contexts, the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] avoirdupois is used as a unit of mass, but in some contexts, the term "pound" is used to refer to "[[pound-force]]". The [[slug (unit)|slug]] is another unit of mass derived from pound-force.

Troy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries' weight are all built from the same basic unit, the grain, which is the same in all three systems. However, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure (all have ounces and pounds), the relationship between the grain and these other units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and troy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce (apothecaries' has scruple and [[dram (unit)|dram]], troy has [[pennyweight]], and avoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled ''drachm'').  The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries'. The [[fluid dram]] unit of volume is based on the weight of 1 dram of water in the apothecaries' system.

To alleviate confusion, it is typical when publishing non-avoirdupois weights to mention the name of the system along with the unit. Precious metals, for example, are often weighed in "troy ounces", because just "ounce" would be more likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce.

For the pound and smaller units, the U.S. customary system and the British imperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound. The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial system is identical to that in the U.S. customary system.

In the U.S., only the ounce, pound and short ton&amp;nbsp;– known in the country simply as the ton&amp;nbsp;– are commonly used, though the hundredweight is still used in agriculture and shipping. The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant and projectiles in small arms [[ammunition]]. It was also used to measure medicine and other very small masses.

===Grain measures===
In agricultural practice, a [[bushel]] is a fixed volume of 2150.42 cubic inches. The mass of grain will therefore vary according to density. Some nominal weight examples are:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* 1 bushel (corn)  = 56&amp;nbsp;lb = 25.4012&amp;nbsp;kg
* 1 bushel (wheat)  = 60&amp;nbsp;lb = 27.2155&amp;nbsp;kg
* 1 bushel (barley) = 48&amp;nbsp;lb = 21.7724&amp;nbsp;kg

In trade terms a bushel is a term used to refer to these nominal weights, although even this varies. With oats, Canada uses 34&amp;nbsp;lb bushels and the US uses 32&amp;nbsp;lb bushels.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The most common practical cooking measures for both liquid and dry ingredients in the U.S. are the teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup, along with halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths of these.  Pounds, ounces, fluid ounces, and common sizes are also used, such as can (presumed size varies depending on product), jar, square (e.g., 1 oz of chocolate), stick (e.g., 4 oz butter), or fruit/vegetable (e.g., a half lemon, two medium onions).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Units of temperature==
Degrees [[Fahrenheit]] are used in the U.S. to measure [[temperature]]s in most non-scientific contexts. The [[Rankine scale]] of [[absolute temperature]] also saw some use in [[thermodynamics]]. Scientists worldwide use the [[kelvin]] and [[degree Celsius]]. Several U.S. technical standards are expressed in Fahrenheit temperatures and American medical practitioners often use degrees Fahrenheit for body temperature.

The relationship between the different temperature scales is [[linear function|linear]] but the scales have different zero points, so conversion is not simply multiplication by a factor. Pure water freezes at 32&amp;nbsp;°F = 0&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 212&amp;nbsp;°F = 100&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].  The conversion formula is:

&lt;math&gt;[^\circ \text{F}] = \frac{9}{5} [^\circ \text{C}] + 32&lt;/math&gt; or inversely as &lt;math&gt;[^\circ \text{C}] = \frac{5}{9}([^\circ \text{F}] - 32)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other units==
* 1 [[board-foot]] = 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1&amp;nbsp;ft × 1&amp;nbsp;in = {{val|2.360|ul=dm3}}
* 1 [[British thermal unit]] (Btu) ≈ 1055&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 [[ton of refrigeration]] (12,000 Btu/h) = 3.517&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1 [[calorie]] (cal) = 4.184&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 food calorie ([[kilocalorie]], large calorie) (kcal, Cal) = 4.184&amp;nbsp;kJ
* 1 [[foot-pound (energy)]] ≈ 1.356&amp;nbsp;J
* 1 [[hand (unit)|hand]] = 4&amp;nbsp;in = 10.16&amp;nbsp;cm
* 1 [[horsepower]] ≈ 745.7&amp;nbsp;W
* 1 [[R-value (insulation)|''R''-value]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;sdot;°F&amp;sdot;h/Btu) ≈ 0.1761&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt; (K&amp;sdot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W)
* 1 [[slug (unit)|slug]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[pound-force|lbf]]&amp;sdot;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ft
* 1 U ([[rack unit]]) = 1.75&amp;nbsp;in = 44.45&amp;nbsp;mm
* Various combination units are in common use, including the [[foot-pound]] (ft&amp;sdot;lbf), the [[acre-foot]], and the [[pound per square inch]] (psi); these are straightforwardly defined based on the above basic units.

Sizing systems are used for various items in commerce, several of which are U.S.-specific:
* [[US standard clothing size]]
* [[American wire gauge]] is used for most metal wire.
* [[Scoop (utensil)]] sizes, numbered by scoops per quart
* Thickness of [[leather]] is measured in ounces, 1&amp;nbsp;oz equals 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Larry J.|title=Makin' Leather: A Manual of Primitive and Modern Leather Skills|date=1981|publisher=Cedar Fort|isbn=0882908359|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bolts and screws follow the [[Unified Thread Standard]] rather than the [[ISO metric screw thread]] standard.
* [[Knitting needles]] in the United States are measured according to a [[Knitting needle#Needle sizes and conversions|non-linear unitless numerical system]].
* [[Aluminium foil]] is measured in ''mils'' (1/1000 of an inch, or 0.0254&amp;nbsp;mm) in the United States.
* Cross-sectional area of electrical wire is measured in [[Circular mil]]s in the U.S. and Canada, one circular mil (cmil) being equal to {{val|5.067|e=−4|u=mm2}} (or {{val|7.854|e=−7|u=in2}}). Since this is so small, actual wire is commonly measured in thousands of a cmil, called either kcmil or MCM.
* The ''mil'' or ''thou'' is also sometimes used to mean [[thousandth of an inch]].
* [[Sheet metal]] in the U.S. is commonly measured in [[Sheet metal#Gauge|gauge]] (not to be confused with the American wire gauge), which is derived from weight and thus differs by material.
* [[Nominal Pipe Size]] is used for the outside diameter of pipes. Below NPS14, the NPS number is not consistent with the pipe diameter in inches.
* [[Copper tubing]], however, is measured in [[Copper tubing#United States|nominal size]], 1/8 inch less than the outside diameter.
* The [[Nominal Pipe Size#NPS tables for selected sizes|Schedule]] system is used for standard pipe thicknesses.
* Alcohol content is frequently given in [[Alcohol proof|proof]].
* The [[Cord (unit)|cord]] is used for volume of firewood.
* The [[Square (unit)|square]] is used to mean 100 square feet in construction.
* [[Heat flux]] in the U.S. is measured in [[Langley (unit)|Langleys]].

==Other names for U.S. customary units==
The United States Code refers to these units as "traditional systems of weights and measures".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|205b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common ways of referring to the system in the U.S. are: "Customary", "Standard", or, erroneously: "English", or "Imperial" (which refers to the post-1824 reform measures used throughout the British Empire). Another term is the [[foot–pound–second system|foot–pound–second]] (FPS) system, as opposed to [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimeter–gram–second]] (CGS) and [[MKS system of units|meter–kilogram–second]] (MKS) systems.

Tools and fasteners with sizes measured in inches are sometimes called "SAE bolts" or "SAE wrenches" to differentiate them from their metric counterparts.  The [[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) originally developed fasteners standards using U.S. units for the U.S. auto industry; the organization now uses metric units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/SAE%20Metric%20Users%20Guide.pdf |title= Rules for SAE Use of SI (Metric) Units |date= May 1999 |publisher= Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc |accessdate= July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wen-Ying Tsai''' (October 13, 1928 – January 2, 2013) was an American pioneer [[cybernetic]] sculptor and [[kinetic art]]ist best known for creating sculptures using electric motors, stainless steel rods, [[stroboscope|stroboscopic light]], and audio [[feedback control]]. As one of the first Chinese-born artists to achieve international recognition in the 1960s, Tsai was an inspiration to generations of Chinese artists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Shao Dazhen, ''Perfect Union of Art, Science and Technology: the cybernetic sculpture of Tsai Wen-Ying'', Cybernetic Sculptures: the world of Tsai Wen-Ying, exhibition catalog, [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing, 1997, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' (1964)]] 
Wen-Ying Tsai was born in 1928 in [[Xiamen]], [[Fujian Province]],&lt;ref name="Sullivan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Sullivan|title=Modern Chinese Artists: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lg_-RQ3t3dYC&amp;pg=PA7|date=3 April 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24449-8|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; China and emigrated to the United States in 1950, where he attended the [[University of Michigan]], receiving a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) in 1953.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2006"/&gt; Moving to New York City after graduation, Tsai embarked on a successful career as an [[architectural engineer]] working for clients such as [[Walter Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], Synergetics, and [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]].&lt;ref&gt;Joann Cerrito, Editor, ''Contemporary Artists,'' St. James Press, 1993, p. 1183&lt;/ref&gt; While working as an engineer by day, Tsai pursued artistic studies at the [[Art Students League]] at night, while also taking courses in political science and economics at the [[New School for Social Research]]. Tsai also attended modern dance classes with [[Erick Hawkins]].

In 1963, Tsai won a John Hay Whitney Fellowship for Painting, after which he decided to leave engineering and devote full-time to the arts.&lt;ref name="GalleryKrane1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albright Knox Art Gallery|author2=Susan Krane|author3=Robert Evren|author4=Helen Raye |author5=Karen Lee Spaulding|title=Albright-Knox Art Gallery: The Painting and Sculpture Collection : Acquisitions Since 1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENPpAAAAMAAJ|date=1 December 1987|publisher=Amber|isbn=978-0-933920-36-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a three-month trip in Europe, he returned to New York and began to make three-dimensional constructions using [[optical phenomenon#Optical effects|optical effects]], [[luminous paint|fluorescent paints]], and [[ultra-violet light]].  These wary works were later selected for ''[[Op Art#The Responsive Eye|The Responsive Eye]]'', an exhibition curated by William Seitz at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="N.Y.)Seitz1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.)|author2=William Chapin Seitz|title=The Responsive Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3pPAAAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--At around this time,(when?) Tsai also began taking modern dance classes with [[Erick Hawkins]].--&gt;
[[File:Tsai multi-kineticwall2 1965.jpg|thumb|upright|''Multikinetic Wall'' (1965)]]
Unsatisfied with his static sculptures, Tsai began to introduce movement using motors. He created ''Multi-kinetic Wall'' in 1965, which was exhibited in ''Art Turned On'' at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]].  Art historian [[Sam Hunter]] described the work:

{{quote|Tsai's Multi-kinetics were dynamically integrated multiple constructions, employing thirty-two kinetic units, each of which contains a configuration of multi-colored gyroscopic forms. With these elements he created an active environmental field that could, apparently, be infinitely extended. Each motorized unit was a self-sufficient entity, and when it was combined with other similar units produced a large-scale kinetic work that joined visual intensity with mechanical power. By controlling the time sequence of each unit in skillful compositions, Tsai used engineering principles to achieve aesthetic ends.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;[[Sam Hunter]], ''The Cybernetic Sculpture of Tsai Wen-Ying'', exhibition catalogue, National Museum of History, Taipei, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66–67}}}}

But it was ultimately during a fellowship at the [[MacDowell Colony|Edward MacDowell Colony]] in 1965 that Tsai had his "Eureka!" moment. While contemplating the sunlight shimmering in the trees, he had a sudden insight to use his engineering background to create art work that replicates natural phenomena. Finding a starting point in the work of constructivist artist [[Naum Gabo]], Tsai took a quantum leap deciding that "the shimmering was not enough" and that what was needed was a way that the viewer could interact with the work. It was that inspiration that eventually lead him to the idea to use a stroboscope coupled with a feedback control system.:&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;{{rp|67}}

{{quote|He had come there dissatisfied with his work, even though his multi-kinetic work was admired and winning him professional recognition. However, at that moment,
other ideas were gestating and he wanted to add what he called a "fifth dimension" to his art - that of artificial intelligence. [...]

[At the colony,] he was able to turn his thoughts inward, hoping to discover the new methods and direction that would more deeply satisfy his creative needs. It was at this point, while watching the motions and patterns of sun on leaves in the New Hampshire woods one morning, that Tsai finally achieved the revelatory breakthrough that changed his art and liberated his creative energies. As he put it, he wanted to create "natural movements in dynamic equilibrium, with intelligence," and he found his solution in an unlikely combination of natural phenomenon, the
precedent of [[Naum Gabo|Gabo]]'s singular (and unrepeated) kinetic sculpture, and the new resource of contemporary analog and digital technology.

Speaking of this moment of revelation, Tsai said that he had quite deliberately turned himself into "a sort of plant": facing his chair into the sunshine in the morning, he turned his body in stages throughout the day, mulling over ways of make an "art that presented the observer with natural movements in dynamic equilibrium, and art that could convey the awe I felt while watching sunbeams shimmer through forest leaves." But a work that would "shimmer" simply did not do enough either for the artist or viewer, Tsai concluded. It must also respond in some way to
the observer; it would have to work on a new feedback principle and actually engage the observer directly. In short, a cybernetic sculpture was required. To create such radically participatory works, he understood, would require that he draw on his engineering skills rather than suppress
them, as he had been trying to do in his period of oil painting.}}

Sam Hunter writes:

{{quote|For the next three years, Tsai worked steadily toward his new goals. His first "feedback" pieces were shown in an important and original show in 1968 at the [[Electronic Arts Intermix#Howard Wise|Howard Wise Gallery]] in New York, an exhibition called ''Cybernetic Sculpture''. In the same year, Tsai's ''Cybernetic Sculpture System No.1'' won the second prize in an [[Experiments in Art and Technology|E.A.T.]] competition, and was selected by [[Pontus Hulten]], the guest curator, for his mammoth international exhibition entitled ''Machine as seen at the End of the Mechanical Age'' held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;{{rp|67}}}}

[[File:Tsai system1MoMA.jpg|thumb|upright|''Cybernetic Sculpture System No. 1'' (1968)]]  
During this time, along with international friends including [[Takis]], Tsai was a founding member of the [[Art Workers' Coalition]] that sought to implement museum reform and underscore "issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community."

In 1969, Tsai was invited by [[György Kepes]] to the [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] at MIT. There, amongst the "first Fellows", a lively group of like-minded artists (including [[Jack Burnham]], [[Otto Piene]], [[Takis]], [[Harold Tovish]], [[Stan VanDerBeek]]), Tsai met [[Harold Edgerton|Harold "Doc" Edgerton]], the engineer who developed the modern electronic stroboscope.

In the early 1970s, Tsai moved with his family to Paris and showed with the [[Denise René]] Gallery and had extensive exhibitions in Europe. During these years, he befriended fellow Chinese artists residing in Paris including [[Peng Wants]] and [[Chu Teh-Chun]] and became very passionate about cultural exchange between China and the West. In 1979, Tsai and his friend the composer [[Wen-chung Chou]] were part of the first delegation of artists from the US to the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;Shao Dazhen, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually lead Tsai and his wife Pei-De to establish [[The Committee for Chinese Artists Intercultural Movement]] (CCAIM), a pioneering non-profit organization that brought mainland Chinese artists to exhibit in the United States in the 1980s. After Paris, Tsai settled permanently in New York City. In 2006, Tsai and Pei-De established the [[Wen-Ying Tsai#Foundation|Tsai Art and Science Foundation]] to support and bring awareness to endeavors that are at the intersection of the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name="FanZhang2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Di'an Fan|author2=Ga Zhang|title=He Cheng Shi Dai : Mei Ti Zhongguo 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJjrAAAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2013/12/shimmering-was-not-enough-12-m-is-another-story-chinese-artists-flatiron-home-sells-well-above-ask/|title=Shimmering Was Not Enough; $12 M.

==Works==
[[File:Tsai harmonic sculpture69.jpg|thumb|''Harmonic Sculpture'' (1969)]]
Tsai's cybernetic sculpture works have always been a challenge for writers to describe. Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] evokes them vividly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A grove of slender stainless-steel rods rises from a plate. This vase vibrates at 30 cycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set in a dark room, they are lit by strobes. The pulse of the flashing lights varies--they are connected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one approaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods appear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an eerie ballet of metal, whose apparent movements range from stillness to jittering, and back to a slow, indescribably sensuous undulation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], ''Shaped by Strobe'', [[Time Magazine|Time]], October 2, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rods appear to defy the laws of matter and occupy two places at the same time; or one can put a finger into an apparently empty patch of air and feel it hammered by an invisible solid.--&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Tsai squaretops1969.jpg|thumb|upright|''Square Tops'' (1969)]]
[[File:Tsai semisphere72.jpg|thumb|''Semisphere'' (1972)]] 
The philosopher [[Vilem Flusser]] wrote of Tsai's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt; There can be no doubt that Tsai's phenomena (whether they be works of art in the strict sense, or whether they be fantastic artifices) are extremely important. They show what promises and dangers may be in here in a "play," if it is proposed by a great artist. Because, even if Tsai's phenomena be considered artifices, there can be no doubt that Tsai is a great artist. Not because what he does is pleasant, or because he proposes a play, or because he represents the spirit of our times, but because he reveals to us, through artifice or works of art, the concrete experience of a future full of promise or abysmal danger.&lt;ref name=Flusser&gt;[[Vilem Flusser]], ''Aspects and Prospects of Tsai's Work'', [[Art International]], March 1974&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--[[Jonathan Benthall]] writes: Benthall's evocative description--&gt;
Jonathan Benthall was one of the first to appreciate Tsai's sculpture. In 1968, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of art may be regarded as a machine programmed by the artist to produce a deferred output. Its objective is survival--by survival I mean not continued acclamation but a continued ability to stand intact as the organized system that the artist originally intended. To survive it must operate within a culturally accepted genre of some kind. ... That is why an artist like Tsai is likely to be so valuable; not because he is an innovator (all his techniques taken separately have been used before) but because he has the kind of authority that establishes a stylistic tradition.&lt;ref name=Benthall&gt;Jonathan Benthall, ''Artists and Technicians,'' [[Times Literary Supplement]], October 31, 1968, 1229&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tsai's interactive sculpture marked a major step in the development of kinetic art:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A major portion of luminist and kinetic art originated in Europe, beginning with the formation in 1960 of GRAV ([[Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel]])
&lt;!--Need to figure out how to link this to Le GRAV in this French wiki article: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_cin%C3%A9tique--&gt; 
by eleven artists of different nationalities, all resident in Paris. Wen-Ying Tsai is an [American] associate who showed with that group at the Galerie [[Denise Rene]], which made its reputation on technology art. Tsai is a Chinese-born sculptor now living in New York. The slender, stainless steel "cybernetic" rods of his sculpture vibrate in different patterns in response to electronic impulses, to the clapping of human hands, or to the flashes of a strobe light. In the artist's words, they are designed to simulate "the intensity of a living creature." While the contemporary interest in light and kinetic sculpture is in a sense traditional, and dates back at least to [[Naum Gabo]], to [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Moholy-Nagy]] and the [[Bauhaus]], only in the postwar era has the artist tried consciously to use available computer and electronic technology to create robot works of art which can be activated environmentally.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Hunter, Jacobus, Rosenblum, and Sokol, ''American Art'', Abrams, 1979, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Frank Popper]] elaborates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as the sensory experience of the spectator goes, the most outstanding American kinetic artist is unquestionably the Chinese-born Wen-Ying Tsai. His pieces, which are perfect on the technological level, serve the primary purpose of giving a complete visual experience to the spectator, whose sound solicitations provoke a choreographic, chromatic and rhythmic response in the 'cybernetic sculptures'. [...]

[[György Kepes]] has commented enthusiastically on the 'magic rhythms emanating from this swaying, dancing steel trembling with life', and he has also noted the sense of 'an instant fellowship, a spontaneous celebration' which is re-created in their presence. As he concludes: 'Rhythm is friendship and in Tsai's work there is friendship of light, sound and our own heart-beats.'
If this appraisal testifies to the success with which Tsai affects the sensory and emotional responses of the spectator, we must not neglect the fact that he is also addressing himself to reason and the scientific element in his audience. In effect, the observer can enter an almost mathematical relationship with these works, and sharpen his perceptual powers through the exact assessment of the various aesthetic parameters of vibration, sound, colour, wave movement, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Popper, ''Art--Action and Participation'', New York University Press, 1975, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Tsai doublediffraction1973.jpg|thumb|''Double Diffraction'' (1973)]]

[[Richard Kostelanetz]] writes about Tsai's cybernetic water works:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of his other kinetic sculptures, ''Upward-Falling Fountain'' (1979) is the most impressive, creating an illusion that must be seen to be believed. As the water falling from a vibrating shower head is illuminated by a strobe, the droplets are caught dancing in response to sound; at certain strobe speeds, the droplets appear to be moving upwards, violating all rules of gravity. ''Living Fountain'' (1980-88) is a yet larger water sculpture, incorporating a showerhead three feet in diameter, plus three concentric circles of water jets, all installed above a basin twelve by sixteen feet. Here the strobe is designed to respond to combinations of changes in audible music, random sensors, audio-feedback controls, and a computer program.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kostelanetz, ''Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes, Second Edition'', Routledge, 2001, pp. 621-622.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In conclusion, Frank Popper writes in his "Electra" exhibition catalog about Tsai's essential contribution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The role played by Tsai, the American artist of Chinese origin, in this context cannot be overestimated, in his most varied cybernetic sculptures in the ''Electra'' exhibition are perfect examples of an artistic comment, perhaps an artistic solution to one of the principal problems raised in this show: the situation of the artist between technology, at a critical point of its passage from the mechanical to the electronic era, and man's natural or artificial environment...

This transition from the stage of the electro-mechanical period and its art to the electronic era with its cultural manifestations is
accompanied by a new assessment of the machine. If Oswald Sprengler rebelled against the fact the "lord of the world"
became the slave of the machine, that civilization itself has become a machine which does everything mechanically, George Friedmann has observed that the worker has stopped being the servant of the machine to become its overseer. It is up to man's political intelligence, and to his intelligence alone, to decide to what ends he will use the power put at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Popper, ''L'électricite et L'électronique dans l'art au XXe siècle'', Electra, exhibition catalogue, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], Paris, 1983, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Frank Popper, ''Art of the Electronic Age'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1993, pp. 20-23. &lt;blockquote&gt; Important among the artists who, through their practical and theoretical researches, established the passage from the mechanical to the electronic in art were [[Yvaral]], [[Yaacov Agam]], [[Nicolas Schoeffer]], [[Liliane Lijn]], [[Piotr Kowalski]], Wen-Ying Tsai and Stephen Antonakos.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==East and West==
[[Vilem Flusser]]'s analysis of Tsai's work delves into his place in both the Eastern and Western traditions.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Possibly Tsai himself does not stand within Western tradition. The analysis of his phenomena seems to reveal this. In that case the arguments just advanced cannot touch him. Possibly he stands within an Oriental tradition, for which (so at least it looks like to a Western observer) man is not a being radically separated form all others. For such a tradition man may feel deeply united with animals, plants, and other types of beings. He can therefore, conceive of them much more as "others" than we can. And the phenomena Tsai produces are then, in their naive, plant-like Gestalten, "true others" If I can dialogue with a plant (and Oriental tradition seems to suggest this), then a fortiori, I can dialogue with the phenomena Tsai is producing. Such an hypothesis of Tsai's position would explain his approach to the problem posed by the series "thing-other." He could then still see others (even in a stone), where we no longer can see them. In this case Tsai may say that his is an important Oriental contribution to the Western (and bankrupt) attempt to free man from the determining effects of objects of culture. He may say that he is using Western models and Western methods from an Oriental approach, in order to try and solve the universally human problem of freedom from determination. And he will be completely correct in thus answering the above advanced objections.&lt;ref name="Flusser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tsai and Taoism==
Art historian [[Donald Kuspit]] finds in Tsai's art a [[Taoism|Taoist]] outlook:

{{quote|Previous discussions of Tsai's work have concentrated on its technology and its place in the development of modern art/ I want to concentrate on its [[World view|Weltanschauung]] or inner point of view, which has been completely neglected in every discussion, not doubt because it transcends modernity, indeed, subverts it by subsuming it. Tsai's ultramodern technology is a means of expressing a consistent, fundamental attitude to life, which his cybernetic sculptures literally embody. Without the understanding of this attitude, they make only technological sense. With the understanding of his Weltanschauung, which I think is Taoist, his sculptures make extraordinary emotional sense. Indeed, they quintessentialize the Taoist attitude to nature, and offer it as a model for psychic health. [...]

And it is no accident that Tsai emphasizes the "healthful" use of engineering, remarking that "the danger for the engineer is to have no feeling for humanity because of his limited and specialized training. Tsai is an engineer - a very inventive, paradoxical one, as his 1981 patent for an upward falling fountain indicates - but he is also an artist, that is, a person of feeling, indeed, a visionary of feeling. His work fuses art and engineering in a synthesis made all the more unique by its Taoist underpinnings - the Taoist conviction that subliminally informs it. The attempt to unite opposites motivates all ofTsai's work. It is evident from the start, in the conception of the work, and the structure that results from the conception, and in the perceptual and emotional experience that are its human - one should say humane, therapeutic - goal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Kuspit]], ''Tsai's Cybernetic Vision: technology in the service of the Tao'', Cybernetic Sculptures: the world of Tsai Wen-Ying, exhibition catalog, [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing, 1997, p. 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==
Tsai met his wife, Pei-De Chang, in New York City in 1967. They were married in London in 1968 during the [[Cybernetic Serendipity]] exhibition in which Tsai participated. The couple had twin sons two years later when Tsai was a Fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] at MIT; their friend [[Otto Piene]] is fond of recalling that the Tsais' twins were the first of the "Center babies."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Piene, ''The Tsai Ballet: Trembling without Fear'', Cybernetic Sculptures: the world of Tsai Wen-Ying, exhibition catalog, [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing, 1997, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsai family spent part of the 1970s in Paris before settling down permanently in [[SoHo, New York]] where they lived in a loft space that they renovated themselves. [[Richard Kostelanetz]] has written about the Tsais in SoHo in his book ''SoHo: The Rise and Fall of an Artists' Colony''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kostelanetz]], ''SoHo: The Rise and Fall of an Artists' Colony'', Routledge, 2003, p. 181-185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Tsai died in [[Manhattan, New York]], on January 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://act.mit.edu/cavs/person/rK2x6kntSczQ7pTNwGrpUV|title=Wen-Ying Tsai|website=act.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife Pei-De; sons and spouses Lun-Yi London (Michelle) and Ming-Yi Gyorgy (Marloes); grandchildren Sakhaya, Kelsyn, and Lina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=wen-ying-tsai&amp;pid=162142442&amp;fhid=2058|title=WEN-YING TSAI's Obituary on New York Times|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Otto Piene]] and composer [[Wen-chung Chou]] were among those who spoke at Tsai's funeral service.

'''Wish fulfillment''' is the satisfaction of a desire through an involuntary thought process. Wish fulfillment can occur in dreams or in daydreams, in the symptoms of [[neurosis]], or in the [[hallucinations]] of [[psychosis]]. This satisfaction is often indirect and requires [[Dream interpretation|interpretation]] to recognize.

[[Sigmund Freud]] coined the term ({{lang|de|Wunscherfüllung}}) in 1900 in an early text titled ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''. {{Wikisourcehas|Freud's original book about wish fulfillment|[[wikisource:The Interpretation of Dreams|The Interpretation of Dreams]]}} According to Freud, wish fulfillment occurs when [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] desires are repressed by the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[superego]]. This repression often stems from guilt and [[taboo]]s imposed by [[society]]. Dreams are attempts by the unconscious to resolve some repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sigmund |first1=Freud |authorlink1=Sigmund Freud |title=Die Traumdeutung |trans-title=The Interpretation of Dreams |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams |origyear=1899 |publisher=Franz Deuticke |location=Leipzig, Vienna |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yves Peintures''''' (Eng: ''Yves Paintings'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]], originally published in [[Madrid]], 18 November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Stich, p42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html According to the Klein Archive, the book was published May 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This publication was Klein’s first public gesture as an artist, featuring pages of 'commercially printed papers &lt;ref name="tate"&gt;Tate Liverpool, text taken from the 'Reinventing Colour' exhibition, May-Sept, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;' that were seemingly reproductions of paintings that, in fact, didn't exist. Using a practice started by [[Marcel Duchamp]], this use of [[readymade]] objects to represent nothing but themselves has been referred to as an early example of [[Postmodernism]],&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley, T. Yves Klein: Messenger of the Age of Space. Artforum 20, no.5. January 1982. pp. 38-51&lt;/ref&gt; using a series of carefully executed strategies to undermine its own authority, and as a precursor to [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; 'The simplicity of his [[Found object|readymade]]s is at once sublime and mischievous.' &lt;ref name="tate"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The booklet asserts its character straightaway in the preface: a wordless text of unbroken horizontal lines with the same two paragraph indentations on each page.... a homogenous continuum with no real beginning, middle, or end, and no content - at least insofar as there are no descriptions, analyses, or personalized utterances. The colour plates are similarly presented as anonymous entities, each a flat spatial field of an uninflected hue: turquoise, brown, purple, green, pink, gray, yellow, ultramarine, mint, orange, or red.  Here, too, there is no attempt to represent or symbolize anything....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The booklet thus offers an utterly pared down presentation. Unlike most art books, it provides no reverential prose about the artist or the art, and no embellishing descriptions meant to convey meaning or context. Instead the booklet itself is made into a work of art that shares the same spirit of nothingness exemplified by the monochrome paintings that it features." Sidra Stich &lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p43&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The origins of the Monochrome==

===Zen Philosophy and Kōdōkan Judo===
[[Image:YvesPeinturesNice.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Yves Peintures'', showing 'Nice, 1951']]
Klein had painted his first monochromes - paintings consisting of a single colour - whilst working in a framing shop in London in late 1949 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_us.html Yves Klein Archives, Biography&lt;/ref&gt; which he exhibited in his room privately, inviting only friends. Initially influenced by his readings of [[Max Heindel|Max Heindel's]] ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity'', which taught that 'space equals spirit and life, that matter is inert form, [and] that sponges and water symbolize the saturation of matter with spirit,&lt;ref name="Berggruen"&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Cantz, p216&lt;/ref&gt; he later rejected these teachings for a more rigorous study of the philosophy behind [[Judo]], which involved long periods of meditation with his friends [[Arman]] and Claude Pascal.

His second private exhibition of monochromes took place whilst Klein was in [[Tokyo]], late 1953, around the same time as he earned a diploma from the [[Kodokan|Kōdōkan Institute]], as a fourth degree [[Dan (rank)|Dan]], achieving the highest level possible for a European.&lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The philosophy of [[Zen]], which is essentially prevalent in Kōdōkan judo, being primarily concerned with an increased sensitivity for the present and an extended concept of space and time, [meant] a new form of spirituality for Klein, and [had] a direct effect upon his artistic activities.' &lt;ref name="Berggruen" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Upon his return to Paris in February 1954, he was deeply upset to discover that his diploma would not be officially recognised by the French Federation of Judo, meaning he could not officially teach or effectively participate in French Judo activities.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p39&lt;/ref&gt; He responded by publishing a book, ''Les Fondements du Judo'', (see [http://www.theeverydaypress.net/]), studying six Katas formulated by [[Kanō Jigorō]] in the 19th century, in an attempt to establish a reputation in France by circumventing the federation. Unable to teach in France, he took a post in [[Madrid]] in May. It was whilst he was in Spain that he formulated and published his first public gesture as an artist: ''Yves Peintures''.

===The Book Itself===
''Yves Peintures'' is a small booklet, 24.4&amp;nbsp;cm by 19.7&amp;nbsp;cm, containing 16 sheets of unbound paper, each printed on one side only and 10 containing tipped-in sheets of coloured paper. Starting with a preface of 3 pages consisting entirely of horizontal black lines designed to parody a traditional introduction credited to ‘Pascal Claude’, (Claude Pascal, a close friend of Klein’s), the introduction was actually designed by Klein himself, persuading Pascal to sign it to ‘certify the production’.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p42&lt;/ref&gt;
10 vivid monochromatic plates follow, mechanically signed ‘Yves’, each given unspecified numerical dimensions and assigned a large city.

If, as is usual in exhibition catalogues, the dimensions refer to centimetres, the plates would represent medium-sized easel paintings; if metres, large [[frescoes]]; if millimetres, then the plates are life size, leading to the conclusion that, rather than illustrations, they are the work itself. Klein would later create work in all three categories.

The cities are all places Klein had lived and worked in the preceding 4 years, implying either that the idea for each work had come to him in the relevant city, or that the work was an abstract representation of the city’s atmosphere. There are three versions of the book; one in which the plates have the name Yves next to the cities with a date; one with additional information about the size of each work, and one in which the entire work is credited to 'Haguenault'.

''Haguenault Peintures'' is basically the same book, and was published at the same time, but attributed to a different, unknown, artist. Curiously, some of the plates are still mechanically signed ‘Yves’, part of a series of deliberate strategies to undermine the works’ integrity, leading some critics, such as Pierre Restany, to call Klein an early post-modernist.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, quoted in Yves Klein, Jean-Paul Ledeur, Editions Guy Pieters, p66&lt;/ref&gt; The main structural difference was the accrediting of ownership in the captions (Collection Particuliere, Collection Orickson, Collection Raymond Hains, etc.).&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46"&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p46&lt;/ref&gt; This implies the (fictional) artist was a painter of some stature, with work collected in major collections. 
According to [[Raymond Hains]], a close friend of Klein's at the time, Klein had named his pseudonym after a brand of gingerbread.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, 1928-1962, Selected Writings, Tate Gallery p82&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“ The fact that there were two different monochrome artists featured in two nearly identical booklets augmented the manifestations of doubling, duplication and duplicity that lay at the core of the project.” Sidra Stich&lt;ref name="Yves Klein 1995, p46" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influences ==

===Lettrism and the Readymade===
Klein was in contact at this time with key advocates of [[Lettrism]], a group of French avant garde artists who were challenging the assumed authority of texts by creating ‘an experiential language that was to be the basis of (the) new culture.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html Lettrism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509090049/http://cotati.sjsu.edu/spoetry/folder4/ng441.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, he had seen various works by key members of the group, including [[Isidore Isou]], and by Dufrêne, [[Gil J. Wolman]] &amp; [[Guy Debord]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery p31&lt;/ref&gt; and had become a close friend of Dufrêne in particular. The lettrists advocated challenging textual authority, and would serve as a direct reference point for the introduction. He was also familiar with the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]], having given a copy of the 1947 artist's book ''Le Surrealisme'', designed by Duchamp with a famous cover of a 3D breast, to his friend [[Arman]]. Duchamp's theories about the [[readymade]], and his belief in the viewer making the meaning of a work of art, would be central to ''Yves Peintures''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm Tate Liverpool, Colour Chart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627220435/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/klein.shtm |date=June 27, 2009 }}, retrieved 08-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'[Klein] dismissed line as a ‘tourist walking across the space’. For him lines were a ‘prison grating’, whereas the fine individual particles of colour were an expression of ‘total freedom’. He attempted to free himself from all materiality through the totality of colour. In gold, red and especially dark, deep ultramarine blue he found colours that corresponded adequately to his visions of the immaterial and the infinite. He wanted to induce independent sensations, feelings and reactions in viewers without giving them a depicted object or an abstract sign as a starting-point, just by means of the state and effect of the colour. He saw monochrome as an ‘open window to freedom, as the possibility of being immersed in the immeasurable existence of colour’ Ulrike Lehmann &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Lehmann, Yves Klein, Grove Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The book seems to have had a small but influential impact on the Parisian Art scene; using ''Yves Peintures'' to gain entry into the Parisian art world,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery 1995, p57&lt;/ref&gt; he managed to secure an exhibition of monochromes at the Club Des Solitaires, Paris, opening on October 15, 1955.

'Yesterday night, Wednesday, we went into an abstract café… the abstractionists were there. They are easy to recognize because they give off an atmosphere of abstract painting, plus you see their paintings in their eyes. Maybe I’m delirious, but I have the impression I see things like that. In any event, we sat down with them. Then we began speaking of the book ''Yves Peintures''. Later, I went to get it from the car and I laid it down on the table. At the very first few pages the abstractionists’ eyes began to change. Their eyes lit up and in the depths, pure, beautiful single colors appeared.'
