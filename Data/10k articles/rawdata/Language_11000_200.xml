'''Alka Saraogi''' ({{lang-hi|अलका सरावगी}}, born 17 November 1960, [[Kolkata]]) is an Indian novelist and short story writer in the [[Hindi]] language. She is a recipient of the 2001 [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Hindi|Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi]] for her novel ''Kalikatha: Via Bypass''.

==Biography==
Alka Saraogi was born in a [[Marwari people|Marwari]] family of [[Rajasthan]]i origin in Kolkata.{{sfn|Singh|2006}} She studied at [[Calcutta University]], receiving a PhD for her thesis on the poetry of [[Raghuvir Sahay]].{{sfn|Parson|2012|p=116}}

Following her marriage and the birth of two children, Saraogi began to write short stories.{{sfn|Stobinsky}} Her first published work was ''Āp kī haṁsī'' (''Your laughter''), a story taking its title from one of Raghuvir Sahay's poems. Saraogi's mentor, Ashok Seksaria, sent it to Vartaman Sahitya, a Hindi literary journal, where it received favourable notice. She then published ''Kahānī kī talāś meṁ'' in 1996, a collection of short stories.

Her first novel, ''Kalikatha: Via Bypass'', came out in 1998. It was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Hindi literature in 2001. She followed this up with four further novels, the latest &amp;ndash; ''Jānkidās Tejpāl mansion'' &amp;ndash; published in 2015.{{sfn|Parson|2012|p=116}}

==Critical commentary==

===Language and culture===
Marwaris and Bengalis, despite coexisting in Kolkata for many generations, have led largely disjoint lives. In Bengali literature and art, the Marwari appears typically as a stereotype, a money-making reactionary. Saraogi's writing is in Hindi, albeit neither overly Sanskritised, nor informed by the popular Hindi film industry.{{sfn|Consolaro|2007|p=9}} Though she often uses Bengali expressions in her novels, especially in the speech of Bengali characters,{{sfn|Mukherjee|2008|p=218}} even in her oeuvre the breach between the Hindi- and Bengali-speaking communities remains unbridged.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2008|p=216}}

===''Kalikatha: Via Bypass''===
Saraogi's first novel, ''Kalikatha: Via Bypass'', is a work of historical fiction. It examines the Marwari community, long established in Kolkata as a merchants yet still exploring its position among the Bengali culture. It is written from the point of view of a male protagonist, Kishore Babu, who following an operation for a head injury, begins to wander around the city, observing its economic life and histories. He compares its majoritarian society against the patriarchal mores of his Marwari community, contrasts his own memories with popular memory, and experiences the ways in which Kolkata of the 1940s melds into that of the 1990s. As Kishore Babu wanders across the city and his own memories, pondering the loves and lives of his ancestors and descendants, his ruminations enliven the entire community, and the narrative structure of the novel too flips between the ages.{{sfn|Gokhale|2002}}{{sfn|Parson|2012|pp=119-121}} Saraogi's unflinching prose does not flatter the Marwaris, though the privations of a community on the margin are described evocatively. Kolkata Marwaris have often been accused of making money at the expense of the Bengalis, but this is not addressed in the novel. Rather, it sets in stark contrast the ostensible nobility of their spirit against the parochiality of their lives.{{sfn|Gupta|2003}}

===''Shesh Kadambari''===
The protagonist of this novel, Ruby Gupta, is a Marwari woman who faces the dichotomy of two social values: the wealth and enterprise of her Marwari father versus the austere and intellectual nature of her mother's family.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2008|p=216}} Saraogi addresses the nuances of cultural differences through Ruby's eyes. Once again, the narrative oscillates between periods of Ruby's childhood and her old age. Having been wealthy in a city of poverty is a stigma she finds hard to atone. Discovering the source of her father's wealth - the opium trade - adds further discomfort. Meanwhile, she recognises the innate hypocrisy of her mother's relatives who disparage her father and his business, yet continue to live off him.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2008|p=217}}

Following the male-dominated viewpoint of her first novel, Saraogi's switch to a female perspective offers further reinforcement of the weight of cultural expectation. Despite being a patriarch, Kishore Babu in ''Kalikatha: Via Bypass'' was unable to step outside his social mores to ameliorate his widowed sister-in-law's life. In ''Shesh Kadambari'', seeking an understanding of self for all her seventy years of life, Ruby Gupta comes to realise that her social work has not resulted in any social justice for herself.{{sfn|Pandey|2008|p=206}}

===''Jankidas Tejpal Mansion''===
The story of a US-educated engineer who returns to India and gets embroiled in the [[Naxalite]] movement, Saraogi's novel sweeps across the early optimism of India's freedom to the broken dreams of the present. Jaygovind's life follows the disappointments of the first post-Independence generation, mirrored in the social schisms of America, from the [[Vietnam war]] to Wikileaks.{{sfn|Kumar|2015}}

{{Incubator|code= ami}}
'''Amis''' is the [[Formosan language]] of the [[Amis people|Amis]] (or Ami), an [[indigenous people]] living along the east coast of [[Taiwan]] (see [[Taiwanese aborigines]]). Currently the largest of the Formosan languages, it is spoken from [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in the north to [[Taitung City|Taitung]] in the south, with another population near the southern end of the island, though the northern varieties are considered to be separate languages.

Government services in counties where many Amis people live in Taiwan such as the Hualien and Taitung train stations broadcast in Amis alongside Mandarin. However, few Amis under the age of 20 in 1995 spoke the language, and it is not known how many of the 138,000 ethnic Amis are speakers.

==Dialects==
Amis is a [[dialect cluster]]. There are five dialects, Southern Amis, Tavalong-Vataan, Central Amis, Chengkung-Kwangshan, and Northern Amis (Nanshi Amis, which includes [[Nataoran]]).

[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]] is a moribund language spoken among the northernmost ethnic Ami but is mutually unintelligible with the Northern Amis dialect.

==Phonology==
The following discussion covers the central dialect of Amis (Maddieson &amp; Wright).

===Consonants===
{| class="IPA wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!  !! [[Labial consonant|Labial]] !! [[Dental consonant|Dental]] !!  [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]  !! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] !! [[Velar consonant|Velar]] !! [[Epiglottal consonant|Epiglottal]] !! [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|-
! [[Nasal stop|Nasals]]
| m || n̪ || || || ŋ || ||
|-
! [[Plosives]] and&lt;br/&gt;[[Affricate consonant|affricate]]
| p || t̪ || t͡s || || k || ʡ ~ ʢ || ʔ
|-
! [[Fricative consonant|Fricatives]]
| v || ð̪ ~ ɮ̪ || s || || (ɣ) || ʜ || h
|-
! [[Trill consonant|Trill]]
| || || r || || || ||
|-
! Lateral [[flap consonant|flap]]
| ||  || ɺ̠ || || || ||
|-
! [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]]
| w || || || j || || ||
|}

The voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k ʡ/}} and the affricate {{IPA|/t͡s/}} are [[Unreleased stop|released]] in clusters, so that ''cecay'' "one" is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡sᵊt͡saj]}}; as is {{IPA|/s/}}: ''sepat'' "four" is {{IPA|[sᵊpatʰ]}}. The glottal stop is an exception, frequently having no audible release in final position. The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] fricatives, {{IPA|/v ɮ ɣ/}} (the latter found only in loanwords) are devoiced to {{IPA|[f ɬ x]}} in utterance-final and sometimes initial position. {{IPA|/ɮ/}} may be [[interdental]] or post-dental. The sibilants, {{IPA|/t͡s s/}}, are optionally palatalized ({{IPA|[t͡ɕ ɕ]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in word-initial position. {{IPA|/ɺ/}} is often post-alveolar, and in final position it is released: {{IPA|[ʡuʡuɺ̠ᵊ]}} "fog".

{{IPA|/ɮ/}} shows dramatic dialectical variation. In [[Fengbin, Hualien|Fengbin]], a town in the center of Amis territory, it is pronounced as a [[Central consonant|central]] dental fricative, {{IPA|[ð̪]}}, whereas in the town of Kangko, only {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away, it is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[ɮ̪]}}. In Northern Amis, it is a plosive {{IPA|[d̪]}}, which may be laxed to {{IPA|[ð̪]}} intervocalically. The epiglottals are also reported to have different pronunciations in the north, but the descriptions are contradictory. In Central Amis, {{IPA|/ʜ/}} is always voiceless and {{IPA|/ʡ/}} is often accompanied by vibrations that suggest it involves an epiglottal trill {{IPAblink|ʢ}}. Edmondson and Elsing report that these are true epiglottals initially and medially, but in utterance-final position they are [[epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto–pharyngeal]].

Sakizaya, considered to be a separate language, contrasts a voiced {{IPA|/z/}} with voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}.

In the practical orthography, {{IPA|/ts/}} is written {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/ʡ/}} {{angle bracket|'}}, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} {{angle bracket|^}}, {{IPA|/ɮ/}} {{angle bracket|d}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}} {{angle bracket|ng}}, and {{IPA|/ʜ/}} {{angle bracket|x}}.

===Vowels===
{| class="IPA wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!  !! Front !! Central !! Back
|-
! Closed
| i ||   || u
|-
! Mid
|   || (ə̆) || 
|-
! Open
|  || a ||
|}

Amis has three common vowels, {{IPA|/i a u/}}. Despite the fact that a great deal of latitude is afforded by only needing to distinguish three vowels, Amis vowels stay close to their cardinal values, though there is more movement of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} toward each other (tending to the {{IPA|[o]}} range) than there is in front-vowel space (in the {{IPA|[e]}} range).

A voiceless epenthetic schwa optionally breaks up consonant clusters, as noted above. However, there are a small number of words where a short schwa (written ''e)'' may be phonemic. However, no contrast involving the schwa is known, and if it is also epenthetic, then Amis has words with no phonemic vowels at all. Examples of this ''e'' are ''malmes'' "sad", pronounced {{IPA|[maɺə̆mːə̆s]}}, and ''’nem'' "six", pronounced {{IPA|[ʡnə̆m]}} or {{IPA|[ʡə̆nə̆m]}}.

Asynergy is most likely to occur during complex movements, where several individual [[muscle contractions]] are needed to act in unison. Asynergy may be caused by [[cerebellar]] disorders. In severe cases of asynergy, the result in the patient is decomposition of movement. In order to complete the simplest tasks, a person needs to perform it in a series of individual tasks.

The '''Baining''' or '''East New Britain languages''' are a possible small [[language family]] spoken by the [[Baining people]] on the island of [[New Britain]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. They were classified as [[East Papuan languages]] by Wurm, but this does not now seem tenable. 

The languages are:
*Baining proper: [[Mali language|Mali]], [[Qaqet language|Qaqet]], [[Kairak language|Kairak]], [[Simbali language|Simbali]], [[Ura language (Papua New Guinea)|Ura]], ?[[Makolkol language|Makolkol]] (extinct?)
*Taulil: [[Taulil language|Taulil]], [[Butam language|Butam]] (extinct)

''Glottolog'' does not accept that a connection between the two branches has been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Glottolog2" /&gt;

==Pronouns==

The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Baining are,

:{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''I''' || ''*ŋa'' || '''we two''' || ''*(ŋ)un'' || '''we''' || ''*udu''
|-
| '''thou''' || ''*ŋi'' || '''you two''' || ''*yu'' || '''you''' || ''*ŋan''

|-
| '''she''' || ''*(k)e'' || '''they two (F)''' || ?
|}

The possessive pronouns ''his'' and ''her'' are ''*vat'' and ''*vet.''

A '''battler''' is an [[Australian English|Australian]] [[colloquialism]] referring to "ordinary" or [[working class]] individuals who persevere through their commitments despite adversity.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Oxford Dictionary'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/aewords/aewords_ab.php#battler |title=Australian National Dictionary Centre, Australian Words: A-B, Battler |publisher=Anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100805135834/http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/aewords/aewords_ab.php| archivedate= 5 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this adversity comprises the challenges of low pay, family commitments, environmental hardships and lack of personal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sekiya|first=Noriko|title=Aussie `battler’ as a cultural keyword in Australian English|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/72903/Issue1-noriko-sekiya-battler-in-ause.pdf|publisher=Griffith University|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a term of respect and endearment intended to empower and recognize those who feel as though they exist at the bottom of society. The term has seen recent use in mainstream [[politics]] to describe a [[demographic]] section of the Australian people.

==Definition==
The term "Aussie Battler" generally refers to working class Australians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/australia/strine/a-8.php |title=Joyzine: Australia Decoded |publisher=Artistwd.com |date=2 September 1912 |accessdate=2010-07-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720074015/http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/australia/strine/a-8.php |archivedate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt; specifically, those who feel they must work hard at a low paying job to earn enough money,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodonyamate.com/b-slang.html Goodonyamate: A dictionary of Australian Slang] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121203/http://www.goodonyamate.com/b-slang.html |date=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is actually well respected by Australian society at large as they stoically face perceived financial hardships, in spite of Australian workers being among some of the highest paid and resourceful in the western world. The concept of an "Aussie battler" is an example of self-aggrandizing language, designed to counter feelings of stigma or inadequacy, and to bolster confidence in being a member of the Australian underclass. It refers to an Australian who continues to struggle in the face of hardship. It is a term of respect and endearment, not simply used to assess someone's financial situation; the ordinary working-man earning a living against the odds.
The common variation '''little Aussie battler''' further adds to the notion that the battler is at the bottom of society, working under bigger things above.&lt;ref name="ANDC"/&gt;

In [[Australian English]], the concept of a "battler" is a [[power word]] similar to the concept of the "[[hardworking family]]". It is used by various political personages and entities for their own purposes. Where in one context a person may use the term to refer to people of low socioeconomic status to call for greater welfare, others may use it to refer to a family saving for a private education to call for government payments to private schools.

==Middle-class battlers==
Some individuals are self-defined "battlers" without fitting the above definition because of their own interpretations of "earning enough money." Social scientist and author [[Michael Pusey]] has described this as "Middle Class Battler syndrome"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/spiritofthings/stories/2003/868280.htm |title=ABC Radio National: The Spirit of Things - Hope and Happiness |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Experience-Middle-Australia-Economic-Reform/dp/0521651212 |title=The Experience of Middle Australia: The Dark Side of Economic Reform |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; because these "battlers" earn more than the average wage but see expensive homes and consumer goods as necessities. As a result, they have very little disposable income after servicing debts for these items. Despite the self-inflicted hardship, the myth of the "battler" remains.

==Use in political rhetoric==
Following the election of the [[conservatism|conservative]] coalition government under the leadership of [[John Howard]] in 1996, the phrase was adapted and widely adopted within Australian public discourse.  Howard scored a sweeping victory at the 1996 elections, an achievement some commentators explained by reference to his winning over many traditional [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] voters, whom they now termed "Howard's battlers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/jas/jas.cgi?issue=55 Journal of Australian Studies, Issue 55, 1997, Abstract] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200642/http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/jas/jas.cgi?issue=55 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Exclusive |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22199916-5001021,00.html |title="Rudd Labor battlers dump Howard", The Daily Telegraph, 7 August 2007 |publisher=News.com.au |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The term was allegedly popularised by [[Andrew Robb]], the 1996 [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] campaign director, who used it to describe those blue-collar voters who felt ignored by Labor and who were successfully targeted by the Liberals during the election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,15353312-12854,00.html "Reform dressed up in greasy overalls", ''The Australian'', 21 May 2005]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a radio interview in 2004, Howard was asked what he thought a 'battler' was and replied that:

{{cquote|... it's not an exclusive definition, the battler is somebody who finds in life that they have to work hard for everything they get... normally you then look at it in terms of somebody who's not earning a huge income but somebody who is trying to better themselves, and I've always been attracted to people who try to better themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/18/1084783513331.html?from=storylhs |title=Brendan Nicholson and Jason Koutsoukis, "Howard's battlers a broad church", ''The Age'', 19 May 2004 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 2004-05-19|accessdate=2010-07-02 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) summit in [[Sydney]] in September 2007, [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] referred to Howard himself as being a 'battler'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/howard-bushs-battler/2007/09/07/1188783458603.html |title=Jane Holroyd, "Howard Bush's 'battler'", ''The Age'', 7 September 2007 |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Bilingual Books, Inc. was founded in 1981 by [[Kristine Kershul|Kristine K. Kershul]],&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt; a language scholar and teacher planning a career in academia and working towards a doctorate in Medieval German Languages and Literature.  While teaching at the university level, she observed that the majority of her students were learning a foreign language for personal reasons such as an upcoming trip abroad, researching family history, or dating someone who spoke the language.  Seeing that the traditional academic methods, designed for those majoring in the language, were not best suited to help her students achieve their goals she decided to develop a way to learn, in a short amount of time, practical and relevant conversation skills they could use.&lt;ref name=Luce&gt;Luce, Beth. "Do you speak...?  Language books translate in to success", ''[[Costco Connection]]'', June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bilingual Books German in 10 Minutes a Day.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|alt=The cover of the first edition, German in 10 Minutes a Day|First edition, published 1981.]]

Kershul authored her first book, ''German in 10 Minutes a Day'', with the intention to return to her academic career, but the success of the publication became the catalyst for more books in other languages and within a year, the Seattle company began worldwide distribution with five titles, adding [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Luce/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gulick&gt;Gulick, Alan.  "Unknown to many, Bilingual Books is worldwide operation", ''[[Ballard News-Tribune]]'', 3 April 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rumley&gt;Rumley, Larry.  "Linguists have quick method to improve Americans' image", ''[[Seattle Times]]'', January 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was sold to Sunset Books and Magazine in 1988 and seven years later, in 1995, Kershul reacquired it.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;

In 1999, the first Language Maps were published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], as an alternative to traditional phrase guides.

In 2004, the company continued its expansion by publishing audio programs for its [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] titles.

Beginning in 2007, Bilingual Books developed computer software as a complement to the 10 Minutes a Day books.

By 2011, the company had published more than 50 titles in 20 languages.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite news| last=Robinson Newspaper Staff | first=| title=Local company's product aids troops in Afghanistan | work=[[Ballard News-Tribune]] | date=2 September 2010 | url=http://www.ballardnewstribune.com/2010/09/02/news/local-companys-product-aids-troops-afghanistan | accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support to military===
In 2003, as part of the company's commitment to support [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military forces]] deployed to [[Iraq]], ''Arabic a Language Map'' was released.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

In 2010, a [[Pashto language|Pashto]] version of the Language Map was released for troops serving in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;  A [[Dari (Persian)|Dari]] version followed in 2011.

===Registered trademarks===
In April 1986, the "10 minutes a day" [[trademark]] was registered in the [[United States]] to Bilingual Books.&lt;ref name=USPTO10MAD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:jf29bp.2.4|title=10 minutes a day Trademark, United States|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offices ==
Bilingual Books, Inc. is headquartered in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the Nordby Building at Seattle's Fishermen's Terminal.  All employees speak more than one language, have taught or tutored a language and have traveled abroad.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gulick/&gt;

===Consultants===
The company hires native speakers, educators, and professional translators from various countries for each project to collaboratively review all aspects of the language, including grammar, spelling, pronunciation and artwork.&lt;ref name=Butterworth&gt;Butterworth, Beverly H.  "Fast Accent", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', 10 May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production, warehouse and distribution===
All production is executed wholly in the United States.  Warehouses are maintained in Canada, England, Seattle, Washington and Jackson, Tennessee.  Key distributors for the company include [[Raincoast Books]] in Vancouver, BC, Canada,&lt;ref name=Raincoast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.raincoast.com/scripts/b2b.wsc/search_results.htm?ht_orig_from=raincoast&amp;ht_search=Kristine+Kershul&amp;sa.x=0&amp;sa.y=0&amp;sa=Search|title=Raincoast Catalog for Bilingual Books|publisher=[[Raincoast Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gazelle Books in Lancaster, England&lt;ref name=Gazelle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/Marketing/Publisher%20Pages/Trade%20publishers/BILINGUAL%20BOOKS%20(US).htm |title=Gazelle Catalog for Bilingual Books |publisher=Gazelle Book Services Ltd. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930211904/http://www.gazellebookservices.co.uk/Marketing/Publisher%20Pages/Trade%20publishers/BILINGUAL%20BOOKS%20%28US%29.htm |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Publishers Group West]] in California.&lt;ref name="Publishers Group West"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/manufacturing/article/54784-distribution-bilingual-books-moving-to-pgw.html|title=Distribution: Bilingual Books Moving to PGW|publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', 6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The '''''10 minutes a day''''' method teaches the basics of the language in 10-minute daily chunks.&lt;ref name=Luce/&gt;  As the program progresses, it gradually incorporates more of the foreign language, building step-by-step, until the program is almost completely taught in the foreign language.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite news | last=Field| first=Christine| title=A Review of Spanish in 10 Minutes a Day Audio CD | work=The Old Schoolhouse Magazine | date= | url=http://thehomeschoolmagazine.com/Homeschool_Reviews/reviews.php?rid=519 | accessdate = 1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method differs from the intensive grammar method of traditional language textbooks required in classroom study.  It teaches patterns instead of complicated grammar rules and uses colorful visuals along with various study tools.&lt;ref name=Luce/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dhyan&gt;Dhyan, Lee. "Language for Travelers Earns Praise and Profits for Ex-Teacher Kris Kershul", ''Northwest Women in Business'', Nov/Dec 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bossick&gt;Bossick, Karen. "Workbooks make game of language", ''[[The Idaho Statesman]]'', 19 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawings of countries' currencies, signs and everyday items from food to clothing are among the visual associations constructed into the program.&lt;ref name=Bossick/&gt;

The method engages different learning styles ([[visual learning|visual]], [[auditory learning|auditory]] and [[kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic]]) with computer software games, audio CDs, sticky labels (peel-off stick-on vocabulary labels), cut-out menu guides, flashcards and word games.&lt;ref name=Dhyan/&gt;

== Products ==
The company publishes 50 titles, 20 languages and three product lines, including the 10 Minutes a Day Book Series, the 10 Minutes a Day Audio CD Series and the Language Map Series.&lt;ref name=Languages/&gt;&lt;ref name=Catalog/&gt;

'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the [[biology]] and [[evolution]] of [[language]].  It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[biologist]]s, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[psychologists]], [[Mathematician|mathematicians,]] and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language.

==Origins==
The biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid-twentieth century, among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first= Noam|year= 2004|title= Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity. Lecture delivered at MTA, Budapest, May 17, 2004|url= http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20040517.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Lenneberg|Eric Lenneberg’s]] ''Biological Foundations of Language'' remains a basic document of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, Eric. 1967. ''Biological Foundations of Language''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1= Cedric |first2= Massimo |last2=Piattelli-Palmarini |year=2005|title= Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science. Linguistic Review 22: 447–466 |url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].

==Hypothesis==
It is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&amp;mdash;an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Soschen, Alona. 2006. Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in the Minimalist Program. DEAL. Linguistics in Potsdam 25. {{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.

==Critiques==
David Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of "inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization", arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015. ''[https://www.academia.edu/19749424/Biosemiotic_Perspectives_on_Language_and_Linguistics Biosemiotic Perspectives on Language and Linguistics]''. (Biosemiotics 13.) Cham: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s evaluation of his or her own body tends to drive various behaviors, including clothing choices and weight management, and the existence of a universal ideal for certain dimensions of body type is, in many cases, a source of anxiety and insecurity.

While the body has been studied by psychologists from numerous different viewpoints, few recent reports of systematic empirical research into feelings about the body exist.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jourard|first=Sidney M.|last2=Secord|first2=Paul F.|date=1955-05-01|title=Body-Cathexis and Personality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1955.tb00531.x/abstract|journal=British Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=130–138|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1955.tb00531.x|issn=2044-8295}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, body cathexis is of crucial importance to understanding personality, since feelings about the body closely correspond to feelings about the self and produce marked behavioral consequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the substantial amount of attention individuals devote to the grooming and concern for bodily appearance, body cathexis is believed to be intrinsically related to the self-concept, with high self-esteem and self-acceptance serving as preventative factors against body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secord, P. F. &amp; Jourard, S. M. (1953). The appraisal of body cathexis: Body cathexis and the self. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 17(5), 343-347. doi: 10.1037/h0060689&lt;/ref&gt;

Among females in particular, one’s general attitude about the body is a significant personality variable with mental health implications.&lt;ref&gt;Kyung Song, H., &amp; Ashdown, S. P. (2013). Female apparel consumers’ understanding of body size and shape: Relationship among body measurements, fit satisfaction, and body cathexis. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 31(3), 143-146. doi: 10.1177/0887302X13493127&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have examined the effects of bodily attitudes on consumer dissatisfaction or satisfaction with fit of apparel, disordered eating, and participation in weight loss programs.&lt;ref&gt;LaBat, K. L., &amp; DeLong, M. R. (1990). Body cathexis and satisfaction with fit of apparel. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 8(''2''), 43-48. doi: 10.1177/0887302X9000800206&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body Cathexis Scale ==
First introduced by Secord and Jourard in 1953, the Body Cathexis Scale provides an objective measure of one’s feelings towards various aspects of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Originally composed of 46 items, the questionnaire asks individuals to indicate the strength and direction of feeling he or she has about certain bodily parts and functions according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1, “strongly negative,” to 5, “strongly positive.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tucker, L. (1981). Internal structure, factor satisfaction, and reliability of the body cathexis scale. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 53(''3''), 891-896. doi: 10.2466/pms.1981.53.3.891&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cathexis items used in the scale include body characteristics such as “width of shoulders,” “facial complexion,” and “body build.”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals are to consider each of the items listed and assign a numerical score that best represents his or her feelings about the various body aspects. Total body cathexis (BC) is obtained by summing the ratings for each of the 46 characteristics and dividing by total number of items.

== Body Image and the Self ==
[[Body image]] is one of the most significant components of an individual’s self-concept. One's perception of his or her body and the feelings associated with this perceived image greatly influence overall satisfaction with the self and can predict levels of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The relationship between body image and the self-concept has been investigated extensively by Secord and Jourard, and as their research indicates, self-esteem scores and personal identification are highly correlated with body cathexis, acceptance, and overall satisfaction with physical body traits and functions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Among the few empirical studies relevant to the relatedness of the body and the self is that of Schilder, who – through a series of self-report questionnaires – procured evidence suggesting that negative feelings, associations, and memories about the body can probe higher levels of dissatisfaction with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, P. ''Psychotherapy''. New York: Norton, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In approaching the problem of body cathexis appraisal, Secord and Jourard adapted Shilder’s methods to test their hypothesis that feelings about the body are correlated with overall feelings about the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their study, the researchers developed a method for assessing an individual’s feelings towards his or her bodily features in order to ascertain whether or not the variables attained through these methods are relevant to personality theory. Using scales of body cathexis and self cathexis, the Maslow Test of Psychological Security-Insecurity, and an anxiety-related body cathexis homonym test, Secord and Jourard concluded that the body and self tend to be cathected to the same degree. Consequently, as suggested by the results of both the body cathexis and self cathexis scales (which represent attitudes about conceptual aspects of the self in correlation to the body), low body cathexis is significantly associated with anxiety, insecurity, and negative perceptions of the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Likewise, an individual’s perception of self-worth is a fluctuating attitude that can rise and fall with changing components of the physical self. This attitude, coined [[self-esteem]], is an evaluative component of the psychological self that is partially dependent upon one’s satisfaction with physical appearance. As various studies indicate, changes in body composition, perceptions of physical attractiveness, and overall body condition provide inferential support for the claim that body image is related to an individual’s self-esteem and perceived worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, M. J., &amp; Mookerjee, S. (1991). Effects of advanced weight-training on body cathexis and self-esteem. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 72(''3''), 1335-1345. doi: 10.2466/pms.1991.72.3c.1335&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex Differences ==
Because body image and body weight are a high priority in western culture, men and women alike face gender-based societal pressures to achieve an ideal body image, which in turn influences feelings about the body and preoccupation with size, shape, weight, and appearance.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; According to Salusso-Deonier and Schwarzkopf, gender is a salient factor in body image development, and due to sex differences in the management and enhancement of appearance, females tend to exhibit more negative cathexis responses to the body and self as compared to men.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Salusso-Deonier, C. J., &amp; Schwarzkopf, R. J. (1991). Sex differences in body cathexis associated with exercise involvement. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 73, 139-145. doi: 10.2466/pms.1991.73.1.139&lt;/ref&gt;

As their study suggests, body cathexis scores among females tend to decrease as body type varies from the ideal thin, while body cathexis scores among males show similar trends when one’s perceived body is fatter or thinner than the muscular ideal.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; However, though previous literature demonstrates that both men and women are concerned with weight and appearance, men generally have higher body cathexis than women. Cultural scripting, particularly male socialization that fosters exercise involvement and physical fitness, may be partially responsible for higher body cathexis scores among males, since participation in fitness activities tends to yield significant improvement in body satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Similarly, dysphoric body image experiences often mediated by specific contextual cues also promote sizable sex differences in body cathexis and the occurrence of negative body image emotions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muth|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|date=1997-08-01|title=Body-Image Attitudes: What Difference Does Gender Make?1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01607.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|language=en|volume=27|issue=16|pages=1438–1452|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01607.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to men, women are more strongly invested in their looks and tend to report a more negative overall body image evaluation. As the findings of their study confirm, Muth and Cash suggest that the gender-differential societal and personal standards of body attractiveness place women at a higher predisposition for less favorable, more invested, and more distressing body image attitudes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Associated Behaviors ==
Feelings about the body have marked behavioral consequences, and as both casual and clinical observations suggest, body cathexis and body perceptions play a significant role in garment fit satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;LaBat, K. L., &amp; DeLong, M. R. (1990). Body cathexis and satisfaction with fit of apparel. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 2, 43-48. doi: 10.1177/0887302X9000800206&lt;/ref&gt; While the physical dimensions and product design of apparel are partially responsible for consumers’ dissatisfaction with clothing fit, consumers are often quick to blame themselves and their body type when a product does not work. For females in particular, fashionable clothing is often designed to fit a specific body type; thus, when a clothing article does not fit properly, the consumer tends to blame the poor fit on their body and not the design of the apparel – a result of the individual’s low body cathexis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Similarly, social stimuli may play a reciprocal role in anticipating behavior, contributing to the formation of negative feelings about the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since consumers often rely on social information and preconceived notions of the ideal body image when shaping their self-concept, apparel fit may contribute to body cathexis and overall feelings about the self. Therefore, dissatisfaction with the fit of garments can lead to lower body cathexis and negative attitudes regarding overall appearance, body dimensions, and weight.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Along with garment fit satisfaction, research also indicates that body image attitudes and emotions may be correlated with [[disordered eating]] behaviors.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paxton, S. J., &amp; Franko, D.L. (2009). Body image and eating disorders. In M. A. Cucciare &amp; K. R. Weingardt (Eds.), ''Using Technology to Support Evidence-Based Behavioral Health Practices: A Clinician’s Guide'' (pp. 151-165). New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group. '' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Body dissatisfaction, especially negative attitudes about weight, is a significant risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms and low self-esteem, as well as unhealthy weight control strategies, such as skipping meals, fasting, crash dieting, and self-induced purging. Low body cathexis and preoccupation can contribute to the development of [[eating disorder]]s among female adolescents in particular, often a result of societal pressures and expectations to achieve the ideal, thin body type.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Both the expression of individual lesbians of butch and femme identities and the relationship of the lesbian community in general to the notion of butch and femme as an organizing principle for sexual relating varied over the course of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmon|first=Lori|title=Gender Identity, Minority Stress, And Substance Use Among Lesbians|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=0549398058|pages=5–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0KhKXJxitoC&amp;dq=butch-femme+70s&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[lesbian feminist]]s have argued that butch–femme is a replication of [[heterosexual]] relations while other commentators argue that, while it resonates with heterosexual patterns of relating, butch–femme simultaneously challenges it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Nikki|title=Critical Introduction to Queer Theory|year=2003|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748615970|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eB6meILZ4toC&amp;dq=Sheila+Jeffries+butch+femme+heterosexual&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the 1990s in the United States showed that "95% of lesbians are familiar with butch/femme codes and can rate themselves or others in terms of those codes, and yet the same percentage feels that butch/femme was 'unimportant in their lives{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caramagno|first=Thomas C.|title=Irreconcilable Differences?

==Etymology and symbology==
The word ''femme'' is taken from the [[French language|French]] word for woman. The word ''butch'', meaning "masculine", may have been coined by abbreviating the word ''butcher'', as first noted in George Cassidy's nickname, ''[[Butch Cassidy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Ja'nina|date=March 2012|title=Butch Bottom–Femme Top? An Exploration of Lesbian Stereotypes.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10894160.2011.557646?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=wjls20|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|doi=10.1080/10894160.2011.557646|pmid=|access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact origin of the word is still unknown.

The butch web designer Daddy Rhon created a symbol of a black triangle intersecting a red circle to represent butch/femme sexuality, which was first used at the beginning of the 21st century on the website ''butch-femme.com'' and has started to be used elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindstrom|first=Isaac|title=To Fight, Live, and Love at the Gender Border in Trans People in Love|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0789035715|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPYHJSJ3IBEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=butch-femme+symbol+black+triangle+red+circle&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=butch-femme%20symbol%20black%20triangle%20red%20circle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
There is debate about to whom the terms butch and femme can apply, and particularly whether transgender individuals can be identified in this way. For example, [[Jack Halberstam]] argues that [[trans man|FTM]] [[transgender]] persons cannot be considered butch since it constitutes a conflation of [[male]]ness with butchness. He further argues that butch–femme is uniquely geared to work in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caramagno|first=Thomas C.|title=Irreconcilable Differences? Intellectual Stalemate in the Gay Rights Debate|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0275977218|pages=137–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIHQH001Bc8C&amp;dq=faggot+butch&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes and definitions of butch and femme vary greatly, even within tight-knit [[LGBT]] communities.

Scholars such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] suggest that butch and femme are not attempts to take up "traditional" gender roles. Instead, they argue that gender is socially and historically constructed, rather than essential, "natural", or biological. The femme lesbian historian [[Joan Nestle]] argues that femme and butch may be seen as distinct genders in and of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nestle|first=Joan|title=The Persistent Desire: A Femme–Butch Reader|year=1992|publisher=Alyson Publications|isbn=1555831907|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3u9ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+persistent+desire&amp;dq=The+persistent+desire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ChIkUbnFN8SytAaizYGQBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butch===
"Butch" can be used as an adjective or a noun&lt;ref name="Bergman 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=S.

===Femme===

{{main article|Femme}}
Like the term "butch," femme can be used as an adjective or a noun.&lt;ref name="Bergman 2006"/&gt; Femmes are not "read" as lesbians or [[queer]] unless they are with a butch partner, because they conform to traditional standards of femininity. Because they do not express masculine qualities, femmes were particularly vexing to sexologists and psychoanalysts who wanted to argue that all lesbians wished to be men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faderman|first1=Lilian|title=Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America|publisher=Penguin|location=1991|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpBdCl-I_oUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=odd+girls+and+twilight+lovers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0x0dVYOaGcGyggTUn4LYDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=odd%20girls%20and%20twilight%20lovers&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, the femme in a butch-femme couple was expected to act as a stereotypical feminine woman and provide emotional support for her butch partner.  In the first half of the twentieth century, when butch-femme gender roles were constrained to the underground bar scene, femmes were considered invisible without a butch partner - that is, they could [[passing (sociology)|pass as]] straight because of their gender conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Arlene|title=Sex and Sensibility: Stories of a Lesbian Generation|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|pages=17–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOxzdjIYL7wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sex+and+sensibility&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eBodVcGOMYekgwTw-YLwBw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20and%20sensibility&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Joan Nestle]] asserts that femmes in a butch-femme couple make both the butch and the femme exceedingly visible.  By daring to be publicly attracted to butch women, femmes reflected their own sexual difference and made the butch a known subject of desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vance|first1=Carol|title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|date=1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTjBQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=pleasure+and+danger+exploring+female+sexuality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JxwdVd31G4zCggT1sYC4CQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[separatist feminist]] movement of the late 1960s and 1970s forced butches and femmes underground, as radical lesbian feminists found lesbian gender roles to be a disappointing and oppressive replication of heterosexual lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faderman|first1=Lilian|title=Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America|publisher=Penguin|location=1991|page=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpBdCl-I_oUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=odd+girls+and+twilight+lovers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0x0dVYOaGcGyggTUn4LYDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=odd%20girls%20and%20twilight%20lovers&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the 1980s saw a resurgence of butch and femme gender roles.  In this new configuration of butch and femme, it was acceptable, even desirable, to have femme-femme sexual and romantic pairings. Femmes gained value as their own lesbian gender, making it possible to exist separately from butches.  For example, [[Susie Bright]], the founder of [[On Our Backs]], the first lesbian sex periodical of its kind, identifies as femme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Susie|title=How A Teenage Femme Snuck Her Way Into the Mineshaft— NY's Legendary Men's S/M Club|url=http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2012/03/the-meatpacking-district-in-new-york-city-was-once-ironic-shorthand-for-the-patch-of-west-village-blocks-centered-roughly-at.html|website=Susie Bright Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond depictions in pornography, the neo-butch and neo-femme aesthetic in day-to-day life helped add a sense of visual identity to lesbians who had abandoned these roles in the name of political correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faderman|first1=Lilian|title=The Return of Butch and Femme|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=1992|volume=3|issue=4|pages=578–596|jstor=3704264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Negotiating Dyke Femininity", lesbian scholar [[Wendy Somerson]], explains that women in the lesbian community who are more feminine and do not fit into the "butch" stereotype can pass as straight. She believes the link between appearance and gender performance and one's sexuality should be disrupted, because the way someone looks should not define their sexuality. In her article, Somerson also clearly talks about how within the lesbian community some are considered more masculine than others.&lt;ref&gt;Somerson, Wendy (2004) "On complications of Negotiating Dyke Femininity" In Kirk and Okawaza-Rey ''Women's Lives and Multicultural Perspectives.'' p. 201. {{ISBN|978-0-07-351234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Femmes still combat the invisibility their presentation creates and assert their sexuality through their femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Camilleri|first1=Anna|title=Brazen Femme: Queering Femininity|date=2002|publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Brazen_Femme.html?id=R3gfAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dismissal of femmes as illegitimate or invisible also happens within the queer community itself, which creates the push for femmes to self-advocate as an empowered identity not inherently tied to butches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowrey|first=Sassafras|title=Visible: A Femmethology, Vol 1|year=2009|publisher=Homofactus Press|isbn=0978597346|page=162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5850VM21VIC&amp;dq=butch+femme+erotica+community&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other terms ===
Some  women in lesbian communities eschew butch or femme classifications, believing that they are inadequate to describe an individual, or that labels are limiting in and of themselves. Other people within the queer community have tailored the common labels to be more descriptive, such as "soft stud," "hard butch," "gym queen," or "tomboy femme." Comedian [[Elvira Kurt]] contributed the term "fellagirly" as a description for queer females who are not strictly either femme or butch, but a combination. In the 1950s and 1960s the term chi-chi was used to mean the same thing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Those who identify as butch and femme today often use the words to define their presentation and gender identity rather than strictly the role they play in a relationship, and that not all butches are attracted exclusively to femmes and not all femmes are exclusively attracted to butches, a departure from the historic norm. Besides the terms "butch" and "femme", there are a number of other terms used to describe the dress codes, the sexual behaviours and/or the gender identities of the sexual subcultures who use them. The meanings of these terms vary and can evolve over time.

"[[Lipstick lesbian]]s" are feminine lesbians. A woman who likes to receive and not give sexually is called a "pillow queen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvhWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Pillow+queen+lesbian&amp;dq=Pillow+queen+lesbian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n7QbUf3MAZTa0QXfvoG4Dg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg|title=Tribades, Tommies and Transgressives: Histories of Sexualities|last=McAuliffe|first=Mary|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub|year=2008|isbn=1847185924|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a butch woman may be described as a "[[stone butch]]", "diesel dyke"&lt;ref name="The Other Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theotherteam.com/common-lesbian-slang-and-terminology/|title=Common lesbian slang and terminology|publisher=The Other Team|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "bulldyke", "bull bitch" or "bulldagger"&lt;ref name="haggerty"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvt8el4QtPwC&amp;dq=Bulldyke&amp;q=Bull%20bitch+%2Bbulldyker#v=onepage&amp;q=Bulldagger%20Also%20bulldyke&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian And Gay Histories and Cultures, Vol 1|last=Haggerty|first=George E.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=0815333544}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}} or simply just as a "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]".

Lesbians who are unisex and neither butch nor femme are called "androgynous" or "andros".&lt;ref name="The Other Team" /&gt;

Another common term is "Stud". A stud is a dominant lesbian, usually butch.

But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut off from the rest of the gay and lesbian community.

==History==
[[File:WellBuiltForIt1903.JPG|right|thumb|1903 depiction of women in "femme" and "butch" apparel]]

Prior to the middle of the 20th century in Western culture, homosexual societies were mostly underground or secret, making it difficult to determine how long butch and femme roles have been practiced by women.

===Early 20th century===
It is known that butch–femme dress codes date back at least to the beginning of the 20th century as photographs have survived of butch–femme couples in the decade of 1910–1920 in the United States; they were then called "transvestites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sappho.com/vintage/index_photos.html |publisher=Isle of Lesbos |title=Vintage Photographs}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the ''Routledge International Encyclopaedia of Women'', although [[upper-class]] women like [[Radclyffe Hall]] and her lover [[Una Troubridge]] lived together in unions that resembled butch–femme relationships, "The term butch/femme would have been categorically inconsequential, however, and incomprehensible to these women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415920892|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCKLHBXeyyYC&amp;dq=Lesbian+relations+can+not+be+accurately+described+in+these+terms+butch+femme&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-20th century===
Butch and femme lesbian genders were only starting to become apparent in the 1940s, since it started to become common  to allow women to enter bars without men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Heidi|date=February 2003|title=The Misunderstood Gender: A Model of Modern Femme Identity|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225274019_The_Misunderstood_Gender_A_Model_of_Modern_Femme_Identity_Butch-Femme_History|journal=Sex Roles|doi=10.1023/A:1022453304384|pmid=|access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s in the U.S., most butch women had to wear conventionally feminine dress in order to hold down jobs, donning their starched shirts and ties only on weekends to go to bars or parties as "Saturday night" butches.

The 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of butches who refused to live double lives and wore butch attire full-time, or as close to full-time as possible. This usually limited them to a few jobs, such as factory work and cab driving, that had no dress codes for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Elizabeth Lapovsky |author2=Madeline D.

Although femmes also fought back, it became primarily the role of butches to defend against attacks and hold the bars as gay women's space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Elizabeth Lapovsky |author2=Madeline D.

Although butch–femme wasn't the only organizing principle among lesbians in the mid-20th century, it was particularly prominent in the working-class lesbian bar culture of the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, where butch–femme was the norm, while butch–butch and femme–femme relationships were taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Theophano |first=Teresa |title=Butch–Femme |work=[[glbtq.com]] |publisher= |year=2004 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/butch_femme_ssh.html |accessdate=2007-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219033604/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/butch_femme_ssh.html |archivedate=2007-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who switched roles were called ''ki-ki'', a [[pejorative]] term, and they were often the butt of jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Elizabeth Lapovsky |author2=Madeline D. Davis |title=Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold: The History of a Lesbian Community |publisher=Penguin |year=1994 |location=New York |isbn=0-14-023550-7 |pages=212–213 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0T8F0daflZ4C&amp;dq=Boots+of+leather&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SQgkUf7gIIOKhQeEuoCIAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, in an early piece of [[Queer studies|lesbian studies]], the gay rights campaigning organisation [[ONE, Inc.]] assigned Stella Rush to study "the butch/femme phenomenon" in gay bars. Rush reported that women held strong opinions, that "role distinctions needed to be sharply drawn," and that not being one or the other earned strong disapproval from both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern |title=Before Stonewall: Activists in lesbian and gay rights in historical context |publisher=Harrington Park Press |year=2002 |location=New York |isbn=1-56023-192-0 |pages=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that, at least in part, kiki women were unwelcome where lesbians gathered because their apparent lack of understanding of the butch–femme [[dress code]] might indicate that they were policewomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Dawn|title=Looking Queer: Body Image and Identity in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Communities|year=1998|publisher=Routedge|isbn=0789004631|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd31TPHaxdEC&amp;dq=Butch/butch&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, such as the Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch-femme roles and identities. This was especially true in relation to the butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was the goal of the homophile movement. Gender expressions outside of the norm prevented assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1989|others=|title=Butches, Femmes, and Feminists: The Politics Of Lesbian Sexuality|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=8652739&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=1|issue=3|page=398|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the development of lesbian feminism pushed butch-femme roles out of popularity. Lesbian separatists such as [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argued that all forms of masculinity, including masculine butch women, were negative and harmful to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|publisher=Cambridge:Polity Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of radical lesbians often credited with sparking lesbian feminism, Radicalesbians, called butch culture “male-identified role-playing among lesbians”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies: A Reader|last=Ponse|first=Barbara|work=|publisher=Routlegde|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encouraged the emergence of androgyny in lesbian feminist circles, with many women wearing clothing like T-shirts, jeans, flannels, and boots. This dress was very similar to butch dress, weakening a key identifier of butch lesbians.&lt;ref name="Faderman 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faderman|first=Lillian|year=1992|title=The Return of Butch and Femme: A Phenomenon in Lesbian Sexuality of the 1980s and 1990s|jstor=3704264|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While butch-femme roles had previously been the primary way of identifying lesbians and quantifying lesbian relationships in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, lesbian feminist ideology had turned these roles into a "perversion of lesbian identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elizabeth|year=1989|title=Butches, Femmes, And Feminists: The Politics Of Lesbian Sexuality|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesbian feminism was publicly represented though [[white feminism]], and often excluded and alienated working class lesbians and lesbians of color. In these excluded communities, butch-femme roles persisted and grew throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the criticism from both middle-class lesbians and lesbian feminists, butch and femme roles reemerged in the 1980s and 1990s, but were no longer relegated to only working-class lesbians.&lt;ref name="Faderman 1992"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Community displacement''' is the movement of a population out of a neighborhood as formal or informal redevelopment occurs.   It may be a result of [[gentrification]], the informal redevelopment that occurs when new, and typically more affluent people, move into a neighborhood. It is the result of urban redevelopment of a residential neighborhood to non-residential uses including retail, education, healthcare, and transportation.  It is often criticized because the current residents have limited options to buy or rent equivalent housing in alternative areas at the same price.  If they stay, prices for products, services, and taxes in the local area rise and existing social networks are disturbed.

==Origin of the term==

The 1949 Housing Act described the movement of populations out of blighted areas as ''planned shrinkage''.&lt;ref name="mf1106"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fullilove|first1=Mindy Thompson|title=Serial Forced Displacement in American Cities, 1916–2010|journal=Journal of Urban Health|date=Jun 2011|doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9585-2|pmc=3126925|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic literature describes this movement as ''serial displacement''. Recently, the terms ''urban displacement'' and ''community displacement'' are used commonly.&lt;ref name="ui060316"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Diane K.|title=Community-level Effects of Displacement|url=https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/52311/900936-Community-level-Effects-of-Displacement.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=Urban Institute|date=March 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What community displacement is not==

Community displacement is not ''gentrification''. It may be a byproduct, but it is not a necessary result of gentrification. New York City's gentrification of the financial district produced no outflow of population.  It did not significantly change the cost of living in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="frbp170925"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Jeffrey|title=Understanding Gentrification’s Causes|date=2017|url=https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/economic-insights/2017/q3/eiq3_understanding-gentrifications-causes.pdf|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Lance Freeman came to this conclusion: "displacement and higher mobility play minor if any roles as forces of change in gentrifying neighborhoods."&lt;ref name="uar050301"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Lance|title=Displacement or Succession? Residential Mobility in Gentrifying Neighborhoods|journal=Urban Affair Review|date=March 1, 2005|volume=40|issue=4|doi=10.1177/1078087404273341|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1078087404273341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Community displacement'' is not [[white flight]]—when residents voluntarily move away as a neighborhood declines.

==What community displacement is==

''Community displacement'' is the movement of a population out of a neighborhood as formal or informal redevelopment occurs. The predominant generator of population displacement is government sponsored projects: new highways, education campuses, hospitals, and other urban renewal projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cernea|first1=Michael|title=The Urban Environment and Population Relocation|date=1993|publisher=World Bank|isbn=0-8213-2057-2|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/381001468740959217/pdf/multi-page.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Housing projects may displace people temporarily.  In the 1960s, the preference was for high-density projects which did not result in net displacement.  Low-density projects may or may not cause a net displacement.

''Community displacement'' is used to describe movement in urban areas.  A related term, [[Development-induced displacement]], typically describes movement connected with rural projects, such as dam projects.

''Community displacement'' is a key argument against informal and formal urban renewal projects.&lt;ref name="tg160112"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hancox|first1=Dan|title=Gentrification X: how an academic argument became the people's protest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/12/gentrification-argument-protest-backlash-urban-generation-displacement|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=Jan 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The implication is that the benefits calculus undervalues the interests of the community residents who will be displaced.

The '''Eskimo–Aleut languages''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|i|ˈ|j|uː|t}}), '''Eskaleut languages''', or '''Inuit-Yupik-Unangan languages''' are a [[language family]] native to [[Alaska]], the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] ([[Nunavut]] and [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]]), [[Nunavik]], [[Nunatsiavut]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], on the eastern tip of [[Siberia]]. It is also known as ''Eskaleutian'', ''Eskaleutic''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Fleming 1987:189.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Inuit–Yupik-Unangan''.&lt;ref&gt;"Due to the pejorative nature of the term 'Eskimo' in some locales, and the increasing preference for 'Unangan' as opposed to 'Aleut' in Alaska, this family may be alternately referred to as '''Inuit-Yupik-Unangan'''. The hyphenated term gives some sense of the variety of languages subsumed under this family label." Holton, Gary. 2012. [http://www.uaf.edu/anla/collections/cea/about/ ''Overview of Comparative Inuit-Yupik-Unangan.''] Retrieved 2013-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eskimo–Aleut language family is divided into two branches: the Eskimo languages and the [[Aleut language]]. The Aleut branch consists of a single language, Aleut, spoken in the [[Aleutian Islands]] and the [[Pribilof Islands]]. It is divided into several [[dialect]]s. The Eskimo languages are divided into two branches: the [[Yupik languages]], spoken in western and southwestern Alaska and in easternmost Siberia, and the [[Inuit languages]], spoken in northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Inuit, which covers a huge range of territory, is divided into several varieties. Neighbouring varieties are [[Dialect continuum|quite similar]], although those at the farthest distances from the centre in the [[Diomede Islands]] and [[Tunu|East Greenland]] are quite divergent.&lt;ref name="ANLC1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence D Kaplan |editor-last=McGary |editor-first=Jane |year=1984 |title=Inupiaq and the Schools - A Handbook for Teachers |publisher=[[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper place of one language, [[Sireniki Eskimo language|Sirenik]], within the Eskimo family has not been settled. While some linguists list it as a branch of Yupik,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ysr "Ethnologue report for Yupik Sirenk"], ''Ethnologue'', Retrieved 2008-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt; others list it as a separate branch of the Eskimo family, alongside Yupik and Inuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages.html "Alaska Native Languages – An Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104608/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages.html |date=2008-05-09 }}. Retrieved 2008-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Alaska Native Language Center]] believes that the common ancestral language of the Eskimo languages and of Aleut divided into the Eskimo and Aleut branches at least 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="ANLC1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLC2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven A Jocobson |year=1984 |title=Central Yupik and the Schools - A Handbook for Teachers |publisher=[[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eskimo language family split into the Yupik and Inuit branches around 1,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="ANLC2" /&gt;

The Eskimo–Aleut languages are among the [[indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages of the Americas]]. This is a geographical category, not a [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genealogical]] one. The Eskimo–Aleut languages are not demonstrably related to the other language families of [[North America]]&lt;ref name="ANLC2" /&gt; and are believed to represent [[Thule people|a separate, and the last, prehistoric migration of people from Asia]].

[[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2015. Eskimo Loanwords in Northern Tungusic. Iran and the Caucasus 19 (2015), 87-95. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Northern [[Tungusic languages]], which are spoken in eastern [[Siberia]] and northeastern [[China]], have Eskimo-Aleut loanwords that are not found in Southern Tungusic, implying that Eskimo-Aleut was once much more widely spoken in eastern [[Siberia]]. Vovin (2015) estimates that the Eskimo-Aleut loanwords in Northern Tungusic had been borrowed no more than 2,000 years ago, which was when Tungusic was spreading up north from its homeland in the middle reaches of the [[Amur River]]. Vovin (2015) considers the homeland (''[[Urheimat]]'') of Proto-Eskimo-Aleut to be in Siberia rather than in Alaska.

== Position among the world's language families ==

Eskimo–Aleut does not have any [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] to any of the world's other language families that is generally accepted by linguists at the present time. There is general agreement that it is not closely related to the other language families of North America. The more credible proposals on the external relations of Eskimo–Aleut all concern one or more of the language families of northern [[Eurasia]], such as [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] just across the [[Bering Strait]]. One of the first such proposals was made by the pioneering Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1818, upon noticing similarities between [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Perhaps the most fully developed such proposal to date is [[Michael Fortescue]]'s [[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]] hypothesis, published in 1998.

More recently [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) suggested grouping Eskimo–Aleut with all of the language families of northern Eurasia (Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Korean, Japanese, Ainu, Nivkh/Gilayak, and Chukchi-Kamchatkan), with the exception of [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]], in a proposed language family called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]]. Such proposals are not generally accepted. Criticisms have been made stating that Greenberg's hypothesis is [[ahistorical]], meaning that it lacks and sacrifices known historical elements of language in favour of external similarities.&lt;ref name="Georg 2005 184–191"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Georg|first=Stefan|last2=Vovin|first2=Alexander|year=2005|title=Review of Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives: The Eurasiatic language family.|url=|journal=John Benjamins Publishing Company|volume=22|pages=184–191|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eurasiatic hypothesis is generally disregarded by linguists, one critique by [[Stefan Georg]] and [[Alexander Vovin]], stated that they were not willing to disregard the theory immediately, although ultimately agreed that Greenberg's conclusion was dubious. Greenberg explicitly states that his developments were based on the previous macro-comparative work done by [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and Bombard and Kerns.&lt;ref name="Georg 2005 184–191"/&gt; By providing evidence of lexical comparison, Greenberg hoped that it would strengthen his hypothesis.

Despite all these efforts, the Eurasiatic language theory was overruled on the basis that mass comparison is not accurate enough an approach. In [[comparative linguistics]], the comparative method bases its validity on highly regular changes, not occasional semantic and phonological similarities, which is what the Eurasiatic hypothesis provides.

In the 1960s [[Morris Swadesh|Swadesh]] suggested a connection with the [[Wakashan languages]]. This was picked up and expanded by Holst (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Henrik Holst, ''Einführung in die eskimo-aleutischen Sprachen''. Buske Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable features ==
Every word must have only one [[root (linguistics)|root]] ([[free morpheme]]) always at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Mattissen, Johanna. ''Dependent–Head Synthesis in Nivkh: A Contribution to a Typology of Polysynthesis'' p. 282. {{ISBN|90-272-2965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eskimo–Aleut languages have a relatively small number of roots: in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, around two thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Garry, Jane and Rubino, Carl R. Galvez, ''Facts about the World's Languages: An Encyclopedia of the World's Major Languages'' pp. 842–844. {{ISBN|0-8242-0970-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the root are a number of ''[[postbases]]'', which are [[bound morpheme]]s that add to the basic meaning of the root. If the meaning of the postbase is to be expressed alone, a special neutral root (in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik and Inuktitut ''pi'') is used.

The basic word schema is as follows: root-(affixes)-inflection-(enclitic). Below is an example from Central Siberian Yupik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johns|first=Alana|date=|title=Derivational Morphology in Eskimo Aleut|url=|journal=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Central Siberian Yupik
|angyagh-(gh)lla-ng(e)-yug-tuq=lu
|-
|boat-big-acquire-want.to-indic.3s-also
|-
|‘also, he wants to acquire a big boat’
|}
There are a total of three affixes internal to the word 'angyagh.' The root (or free morpheme) 'angyagh' and the inflection '-tuq' on the right consist of the indicative mood marker plus third person singular. The enclitic –lu ‘also’ follows the inflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johns|first=Alana|date=|title=Derivational Morphology in Eskimo-Aleut|url=|journal=Oxford Journal Press|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the postbases are [[inflectional suffix|non-lexical suffixes]] that indicate [[grammatical case|case]] on nouns and [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]] on verbs. The number of cases varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to Eskimo. The Eskimo languages are [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] in nouns and in Yup'ik languages, also in verbal person marking. All Eskimo–Aleut languages have [[polypersonal agreement|obligatory verbal agreement]] with agent and patient in [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] clauses, and there are special suffixes used for this purpose in [[subordinate clause]]s, which makes these languages, like most in the North Pacific, highly ''complement [[balancing and deranking|deranking]]''.

At the end of a word there can be one of a small number of [[clitic]]s with meanings such as "but" or indicating a [[yes–no question|polar question]].

Phonologically, the Eskimo–Aleut languages resemble other language families of northern North America ([[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]] and [[Tsimshianic languages|Tsimshianic]]) and far-eastern Siberia ([[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]]). There are usually only three vowels—{{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}—though some Yup'ik dialects also have {{IPAslink|ə}}. All Eskimo–Aleut languages lack [[ejective consonant|ejectives]], in which they resemble the Siberian languages more than the North American ones.  Eskimo–Aleut languages possess [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] [[Stop consonant|plosive]]s at four [[place of articulation|positions]] ([[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]) in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops (though it has retained the [[bilabial nasal|nasal]]). There are contrasting voiced and voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s at the same positions, and in the Eskimo subfamily a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] is also present. A rare feature of many dialects of Yup'ik and Aleut is contrasting [[voiceless nasal]]s.

=== Aleut ===
{{main|Aleut language}}

The following vowels and consonants were taken from [[Knut Bergsland]], (1997).&lt;ref name="Bergsland 1997"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aleut Grammar: Unangam Tunuganaan Achixaasix̂|last=Bergsland|first=Knut|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=1997|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vowels====

The Aleut language has six vowels in total: three short vowels /i/, /u/, /a/, and three long vowels /iː/, /uː/, /aː/. Orthographically, they would be spelled ''ii'', ''uu'', and ''aa''. There are no diphthongs in Aleut vowels. The length of the vowel is dependent upon three characteristics: stress, surrounding consonants, and in particularly Eastern Aleut, surrounding vowels. Short vowels are in initial position if a following consonant is velar or labial. For example: the demonstratives ''uka'', ''ika'', and ''aka''.

Long vowels are lower than their short counterpart vowels, but are less retracted if they make contact with a uvular consonant. For example: ''uuquchiing'' 'blue fox,' ''qiiqix̂'' 'storm-petrel', and ''qaaqaan'' 'eat it!'

Phonemes in parenthesis are found only in Russian and English loanwords, the phoneme in italics is found only in Eastern Aleut, and the bold phonemes are a part of the standard Aleut inventory.

Aleut lacks labial stops and allows clusters of up to three consonants as well as consonant clusters in word initial position.

Noteworthy phonological features: lack of a [p] and its unaspirated nasals

== Morphology ==
===Language type===

====Polysynthetic language====

Eskimo-Aleut is a [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] language, which is the process in which a single word is able to contain multiple post-bases or morphemes. The Eskimo–Aleut languages are exclusively [[suffix]]ing (with the exception of one prefix in Inuktitut which appears in demonstratives). Suffixes are able to combine and ultimately create an unlimited number of words. Some of the morphemes that are able to attach contain features such as, carrying nominal subjects and objects, adverbial information, direct objects, and spatial noun phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysynthetic languages are said to have come from a form of extreme [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]], which allows single words to carry the same information that another language expresses in whole clauses. For example, in central Alaskan Yupik, one can say:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Central Alaskan Yupik:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A grammar of Central Alaskan Yupik&amp;nbsp;(cay)|last=Miyaoka|first=Osahito|publisher=Mouton Grammar Library|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|'''qayarpaliqasqessaagellruaqa'''

|-
|kayak-big-make-pol-ev-A.ask-but-past-1sg/3sg.ind
|-
|I asked him to make a big kayak. (but actually he has not made it yet)
|}

As a polysynthetic language, Eskimo-Aleut is  concerned with what "each morpheme means, which categories it can attach to, whether there is any category change, etc. and what type of morphophonological effect occurs to the left as it attaches to the stem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johns|first=Alana|year=|title=Derivational Morphology in Eskimo-Aleut|url=|journal=The Oxford Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morphosyntactic alignment====

''Ergative-Absolutive Language:''

Eskimo-Aleut follows the basic word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

Eskimo is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|Ergative-Absolutive]] language. This means subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs are marked with the absolutive case, while subjects of transitive verbs are marked with the&amp;nbsp;ergative case.

Aleut is not an ergative-absolutive language. It doesn't matter if the verb is transitive or intransitive—subjects and objects are not marked differently.

If a transitive object or an object of possession is openly communicated, ergative case marking will not be expressed. If a transitive object or object of possession is not openly communicated, then ergative case marking will be expressed.

Example of case marking in Aleut:&lt;ref name="Bergsland 1997"/&gt;

== Syntax ==
The syntax of Eskimo-Aleut is concerned with the functional use of its morphological structure. The two language branches, although part of the same family, have separated and detached themselves in relation to grammatical similarities. Bergsland states that Aleut, which was once a language more similar to Proto-Eskimo than the current Eskimo languages themselves, has distanced itself from the ancient language.

The case inflections, "relative *-m, instrumental *-mEk/meN, and locative *-mi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Relations Across Bering Strait: Reappraising the Archaeological and Linguistic Evidence|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|publisher=Bookcraft Ltd.|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have undergone phonological merger and led to a completely different explanation of ergative morphology in Proto-Eskimo.

In order to further explain the profound changes that have occurred in Aleutian syntax, Bergsland proposed the Domino Effect, which is ultimately the chronological order of Aleut’s unique features. Below is a step by step list of the 'domino effect':

''The Domino Effect:''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Relations Across Bering Strait: Reappraising the Archaeological and Linguistic Evidence|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|publisher=Bookcraft Ltd.|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The phonological reduction of final syllables and the ensuing syncretism of locative, relative, and instrumental case markers;
# The collapse of the ergative system (and of the distinction between relative and locative case in postpositional constructions;
# The development of the unusual Aleut anaphoric reference system from the debris of this collapse, going hand in hand with a strict fixation of SOV word order;
# The simple 3rd person forms when the original morphemes began to refer to any anaphoric (non-overt) referent, and;
# The spread of such a referent's own number (including that of a possessor of some overt argument) to the final verb of the (complex) sentence, overriding agreement with the subject.

== Vocabulary comparison ==
The following is a comparison of [[Cognate (etymology)|cognate]]s among the basic vocabulary across the Eskimo–Aleut language family (about 122 words). Note that empty cells do not imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language is formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row. Also, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the "common meaning" given is only approximate. In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language. Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.

Cognates of the Eskimo language can be found in Michael Fortescue et al., 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Eskimo Dictionary with Aleut Cognates|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|last2=Jacobson|first2=Steven|last3=Kaplan|first3=Lawrence|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=2010|isbn=|location=United states of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognates of the Aleut language can be found in Knut Bergsland, 1997.&lt;ref name="Bergsland 1997"/&gt;

'''Personal Pronouns:'''

There are two types of pronouns in Eskimo- Aleut: Independent Pronouns and Pronominal Pronouns.

''Pronouns in relation to Nouns:''

In Eskimo-Aleut, singular, dual and plural nouns are marked by inflectional suffixes, and if they are possessed the number marker is followed by pronominal suffixes that specify the (human) possessor. There are no genders in the Eskimo–Aleut languages, and this can be seen in the 4 persons: my, your, his/her, his/her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Morphologie / Morphology|last=Booij|first=Geert|last2=Lehmann|first2=Christian|last3=Mugdan|first3=Joachim|last4=Skopeteas|first4=Stavros|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Eskimo.html|title=Eskimo-Aleut Languages|last=Gutman|first=Alejandro|last2=Avanzati|first2=Beatriz|date=2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'His/her own' specifies ownership in contrast with 'his/her' that does not. E.g., his house versus his own house.

''Pronouns in relation to Verbs:''

Aleut uses independent pronouns, instead of pronominal marking on verbs. Eskimo, on the other hand has 4 persons and 3 numbers marked by pronominal suffixes.

'''''Fingerspitzengefühl''''' {{IPA-de|ˈfɪŋɐˌʃpɪtsənɡəˌfyːl|}} is a [[German language|German]] term, literally meaning ''"finger tips feeling"'' and meaning intuitive flair or instinct, which has been appropriated by the [[English language]] as a [[loanword]]. It describes a great [[situational awareness]], and the ability to respond most appropriately and tactfully. It can also be applied to diplomats, bearers of bad news, or to describe a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation. The term is sometimes used to describe the instinctive play of certain [[Association football|football]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fingerspitzengefühl|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4aWzWLn_uw|website=youtube.com|publisher=Danny Davis|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social context==
In social context, fingerspitzengefuhl suggests a combination of "tact, diplomacy and a certain amount of sensitivity to the feelings of others".  It is a quality that can enable a person to "negotiate tricky social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fingerspitzengefühl Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it.|url=http://www.dw.com/en/fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl/a-16426633|website=dw.com|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military context==
In military terminology, it is used for the stated ability of some military commanders, such as Field-Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters of Battle: Monty, Patton and Rommel at war|author=[[Terry Brighton|Brighton, Terry]]|url=http://www.mastersofbattle.co.uk/prologue.htm|accessdate=2009-08-15}}, Prologue&lt;/ref&gt; to describe "the instinctive and immediate response to battle situations",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a quality needed to maintain, with great accuracy and attention to detail, an ever-changing [[Operational warfare|operational]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]] situation by maintaining a [[Mental mapping|mental map]] of the battlefield. The idiom is intended to evoke a military commander who is in such intimate communication with the battlefield that it is as though he has a fingertip on each critical point. In this sense the term is synonymous with the English expression of "keeping one's finger on the pulse", and was expressed in the 18th and 19th centuries as "having a feel for combat".

The term is only [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]], and cannot in itself give a realistic picture of the ability being described. It is cognitively related to personal possession of [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligences]], notably those pertinent to visual and spatial data processing. The term suggests that in addition to any discursive [[Information processing|processing of information]] that the commander may be conducting (such as mentally considering a specific plan), the commander is automatically establishing cognitive relationships between disparate pieces of information as they arrive, and is able to immediately re-synthesise their mental model of the battlefield.

Even though there is no physical connection between the commander and his troops, other than conduits for discursive information such as radio signals, it is ''as if'' the commander had their own sensitive presence in each spot.

One of the functions of a static map is to allow a traveler to decide upon a course of action suitable for getting from one point to another. In times of war, the terrain and the troops and weapons deployed upon it can be changed much more rapidly than cartographers can change their maps. A commander with ''fingerspitzengefühl'' would hold such a map in their mind, and adjust it by incorporating any significant information that was received.

==Related concepts==
The concept may be compared to ideas about [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[Neural network software|neural net programming]]. The same phenomenon, but conceptualized in a radically different way, seems to be described by [[D.T. Suzuki]] in swordsmanship teaching stories recounted in his ''Zen and Japanese Culture,'' and given in analytical detail in ''[[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Psychoanalysis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Suzuki and De Martino&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57451">'''Gaius Valerius Troucillus''' or '''Procillus'''&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of name under [[Gaius Valerius Troucillus#One man, two names?|One man, two names]].&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[wikt:floruit|fl.]]'' mid-1st century BC) was a [[Helvii|Helvian]] [[Gauls|Celt]] who served as an [[interpreter]] and [[diplomacy|envoy]] for [[Julius Caesar]] in the first year of the [[Gallic Wars]]. Troucillus was a second-generation [[Roman citizen]], and is one of the few ethnic Celts who can be identified both as a citizen and by [[List of Celtic tribes|affiliation with a Celtic polity]]. His father, [[Caburus]], and a brother are named in Book 7 of Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Bellum Gallicum]]'' as defenders of Helvian territory against a force sent by [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC. Troucillus plays a role in two episodes from the first book of Caesar's war commentaries (58 BC), as an interpreter for the [[druid]] [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]] and as an envoy to the [[Suebi]]an king [[Ariovistus]], who accuses him of spying and has him thrown in chains.

Troucillus was an exact contemporary of two other notable [[Transalpine Gaul]]s: the [[Vocontii|Vocontian]] father of the historian [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], who was a high-level [[military administration|administrator]] on Caesar's staff; and [[Varro Atacinus]], the earliest Transalpiner to acquire a literary reputation in Rome as a [[Latin literature|Latin poet]]. Their ability as well-educated men to rise in Roman society is evidence of early [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] [[acculturation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], "The Origin of Cornelius Gallus," ''Classical Quarterly'' 32 (1938) 39–44, especially p. 41. Syme's article, which is not the last word on the subject (see [[Cornelius Gallus]]), considers whether Gallus himself might be the best example of the cultured Narbonese Gaul: "If the foregoing argument is correct," he concludes, "Gallus was not of [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia Roman]] or of [[freedman]] stock, but, like Caesar's friends Trogus and Procillus ''(= Troucillus)'', the son of a local [[dynasty|dynast]] of Gallia Narbonensis" (p. 43).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two names, one man?==
Caesar first mentions Valerius Troucillus in ''Bellum Gallicum'' 1.19, when the Roman commander is made aware of questionable loyalties among the Celtic [[Aedui]], Rome's allies in central Gaul since at least the 120s BC. Caesar represents this divided allegiance in the persons of two brothers, the druid Diviciacus, who had appeared before the [[Roman senate]] a few years earlier to request aid against [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders, and the enterprising populist [[Dumnorix]], who was the leading Aeduan in terms of wealth and military power.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barlow, “Noble Gauls and Their Other in Caesar’s Propaganda,” in ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter: The War Commentaries as Political Instruments'', edited by Kathryn Welch and Anton Powell (Classical Press of Wales, 1998), pp. 139–170; Serge Lewuillon, "Histoire, société et lutte des classes en Gaule: Une féodalité à la fin de la république et au début de l'empire," ''Aufstieg under Niedergang der römische Welt'' (1975) 425–485.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumnorix stood accused of conspiring with the enemy [[Helvetii]]; when Caesar holds a confidential discussion with his friend Diviciacus, he dismisses the usual interpreters&lt;ref&gt;''Cotidianis interpretibus remotis''.&lt;/ref&gt; and calls in Troucillus. Caesar describes Troucillus as a leading citizen of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and his personal friend (''familiaris''),&lt;ref&gt;The word ''amicus'' can mean a political friend or a socially useful friend, but ''familiaris'' implies intimacy.&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he placed the highest trust (''fides'') in the Helvian in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;''Cui summam omnium rerum fidem habebat''. [[Latin]] ''fides'' represents a complex of meanings rendered variously in English as "trust," "confidence," "trustworthiness," "credibility," "fidelity," and "loyalty."&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''Bellum Gallicum'' 1.46 and 52, Caesar names a Transalpine Gaul, this time according to the [[manuscript]]s as Gaius Valerius Procillus, whom he again calls his ''familiaris'' as well as his ''hospes''. The ''hospes'', sometimes translatable as a "family friend" and meaning "guest" or "host" in Latin interchangeably, is a participant in the mutual social relationship of ''[[hospitium]]'', reciprocal guest-host hospitality. Caesar's use of the term may imply that he was a guest of the Helvian Valerii when he traveled through the Narbonensis, as he did to or from one of his two postings in [[Hispania]] during the 60s, or that the Helvian had been a guest of Caesar in Rome before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Goudineau, ''César et la Gaule'' (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Rice Holmes]] reviews the 19th-century scholarship in his classic work ''Caesar's Conquest of Gaul'' (London, 1903), p. 170 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNdAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mistaken+in+identifying+Procillus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mistaken%20in%20identifying%20Procillus%22&amp;f=false online.] Holmes holds with the single-man identification, as do [[Ramsey MacMullen]] (who also cites a two-men argument), ''Romanization in the Time of Augustus'', pp. 166–167, note 48, limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=uBu2yq1IHasC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online], though he calls this man "Procillus"; and John C. Rolfe, "Did [[Liscus]] Speak Latin? Notes on Caesar ''B.G.'' i. 18. 4–6 and on the Use of Interpreters," ''Classical Journal'' 7 (1911), p. 128 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0fnPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false  online;] and [[Ronald Syme]] (discussed ''passim'' in this article). See also C.-J. Guyonvarc'h, “La langue gauloise dans le ''De bello gallico'',” ''Revue du CRBC 6: La Bretagne linguistique'' (1990), discussed at L'Arbre Celtique, "Les personnages Celtes," [http://www.arbre-celtique.com/encyclopedie/troucillus-procillus-2867.htm Troucillus/Procillus.]&lt;/ref&gt; assume that the two names refer to a single man; although ''Troucillus'' is a [[textual criticism|problematic reading of the text]], it is a well-established Celtic name,&lt;ref&gt;D. Ellis Evans, ''Gaulish Personal Names'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), p. 380; Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), p. 303, giving a derivation from ''trougo-, trouget-'', "sad, unhappy, miserable." The name ''Troucillus'' also appears in inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''Procillus'' appears to have been confused with a Roman name.&lt;ref&gt;In discussing the importation of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system of three names]] into Gaul, the 19th-century Celticist [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville|Arbois de Jubainville]] accepted the name ''Procillus'' as correct and derives it from Latin ''procus'', like the [[gens|gentilic]] ''Procilius''; see ''Recherches sur l'origine de la propriété foncière et des noms de lieux habités en France'' (Paris, 1890), p. 131 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QWUBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22un+exemple+ancien+et+connu+est+celui+de+C.+Valerius+Procillus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22un%20exemple%20ancien%20et%20connu%20est%20celui%20de%20C.%20Valerius%20Procillus%22&amp;f=false online.] ''Procillus'' is also one of the names in the epigrams of [[Martial]] (''Epigrams'', book 1, poems 27 and 115), who was a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]].&lt;/ref&gt; In this episode, Caesar sends Troucillus as a diplomatic envoy to the [[Suebi]]an king [[Ariovistus]],&lt;ref&gt;A mission referred to also by [[Appian]], ''Celtic Wars'' 17, where Troucillus is not identified by name.&lt;/ref&gt; and again commends his linguistic skills and his ''fides'', his loyalty or trustworthiness.

Caesar identifies Troucillus as an ''adulescens'', a young man, generally in Caesarian usage between the ages of 20 and 30 and not having yet entered the [[cursus honorum|political career track]] or held a formal command. The term is used elsewhere in the ''Bellum Gallicum'' for [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Crassus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Gallicum'' 1.51.7; 3.7.2 and 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Gallicum'' 3.11.5; 7.9.1 and 87.1.&lt;/ref&gt; who were born in the mid-80s.&lt;ref&gt;Guyonvarc'h, "La langue gauloise dans le ''De Bello Gallico''"; [[Elizabeth Rawson]], “''Crassorum funera'',” ''Latomus'' 41 (1982), p. 545 on the meaning of ''adulescens''. See further discussion at [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)#Early military career|Publius Licinius Crassus: Early military career]]. Vercingetorix is called ''adulescens'' at ''BG'' 7.4, as is the Aeduan [[Convictolitavis]] at 7.32.4, who was one of two candidates in the disputed election for 52 BC. The Aeduan co-commanders at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]], Eporedorix and Viridomarus, are described as ''adulescentes'' (7.39.1 and 63.9).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Princeps'' and legate==
[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|300px|The Helvii were a small polity on the northern border of the [[Narbonensis]], southeast of the [[Arverni]]]]

Caesar's identification of Troucillus's citizen status provides a piece of evidence for the history of Roman provincial administration in Gaul. Caesar notes that he is the son of [[Gaius Valerius Caburus]], who was granted citizenship by [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul 93 BCE)|G. Valerius Flaccus]] during his [[Roman governor|governorship]] in the 80s. Caburus took his [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'s [[gens|gentilic]] [[Roman naming conventions#Foreign names|name, as was customary]] for [[naturalization|naturalized]] citizens. Although Caburus's two sons retain a Celtic ''[[cognomen]]'' (personal name), by the third generation a member of such a family is likely to be using a more typically Roman name, and the Helvian Valerii cannot be identified further in the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;MacMullen, ''Romanization'' p. 99 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uBu2yq1IHasC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22a+third+generation+in+this+family%22+intitle:romanization&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20third%20generation%20in%20this%20family%22%20intitle%3Aromanization&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference to Caburus's grant of citizenship in 83 BC helps date the term of Flaccus in his Transalpine province, and shows that Gauls were receiving Roman citizenship soon after annexation.&lt;ref&gt;Although ''Gallia Transalpina'' was brought under Roman control as a result of wars concluded in 120 BC, and the [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman ''colonia'']] at [[Narbonne]] was established in 118, there is little evidence that the Narbonensis was regularly administered as a province till the 90s. Valerius Flaccus, a highly experienced administrator, had held one of the longest terms in the province until Caesar's proconsulship; see [[T. Corey Brennan]], ''The Praetorship in the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 363 [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIzxygbg8DkC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22extraordinarily+long+tenures%22+intitle:Praetorship+intitle:in+intitle:the+intitle:Roman+intitle:Republic&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22extraordinarily%20long%20tenures%22%20intitle%3APraetorship%20intitle%3Ain%20intitle%3Athe%20intitle%3ARoman%20intitle%3ARepublic&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As indicated by his closeness in age to Crassus and Brutus, Troucillus was born shortly before or after his father became a citizen, and was among the first Transalpiners to grow up with a dual [[Gallo-Roman]] identity.

Although no title or rank is given for Troucillus, Caesar calls him a ''[[princeps]] Galliae provinciae'', "a leading citizen of the Province of Gaul".  His father, Caburus, is called ''princeps civitatis''&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Gallicum'' 7.65.2.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Helvii, who are identified in this phrase not as a ''[[pagus]]'', much less a "tribe" (Latin ''[[Tribal Assembly|tribus]]''), but as a ''[[civitas]]'', a [[polity]] with at least small-scale urban centers (''[[oppidum|oppida]]'').&lt;ref&gt;John Koch notes that the [[Gallo-Brittonic]] word corresponding to Caesar's usage of ''civitas'' is most likely ''[[Toutatis#Etymology|*touta]]'' ([[Old Irish]] ''[[túath]]''): "'[[tribe]]' would not be a perfect translation, but is less misleading than '[[State (polity)|state]],' '[[city]],' or '[[nation]]'" ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2000), p. 450 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA450&amp;dq=civitas+oppidum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1972&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=civitas%20oppidum&amp;f=false online.] John Drinkwater, however, argues in ''Roman Gaul: The Three Provinces, 58 BC–AD 260'' (Cornell University Press, 1983), for "[[Native Americans in the United States|'nation' in the American Indian sense]] (made up of a number of tribes&amp;nbsp;— Caesar's ''pagi''" (p. 30, note 2; concept of ''civitas'' discussed in depth pp. 103–111). See also A.N. Sherwin-White on ''civitas'', ''populus'', ''[[municipium]]'' and ''oppidum'' in ''The Roman Citizenship'' (Oxford University Press, 1973) ''passim''; if ''*touta'' is correctly translated as "a people," the sense of ''civitas Helviorum'' might be analogous to that of [[SPQR|the Roman People (''populus'')]] as a political entity. In his edition of Tacitus' ''Germania'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), J.B. Rives, drawing on Cicero's definition of ''civitas'' as "an assembly and gathering of men associated under law" (''Republic'' 6.13), says that it is the usual word for a "community viewed under its political aspect," equivalent to the Greek ''[[polis]]'' (p. 153).

In ''Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul'' (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), Ton Derks views the ''civitates'' of the [[Augustus|Augustan]] era as "[[city-state]]s": "a ''civitas'' was a community, whose constitution was shaped after the Roman example and whose social and political life was centred on a single town" (p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=FSLbNelH1GQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=civitas#v=onepage&amp;q=civitas&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that ''princeps'' denotes a particular office in the Narbonensis,&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Lamoine, "[[Praetor|Préteur]], [[vergobret]], ''princeps'' en Gaule Narbonnaise et dans les Trois Gaules: pourquoi faut-il reprendre le dossier?" in ''Les élites et leurs facettes: Les élites locales dans le monde hellénistique et romain'' (École française de Rome, 2003), p. 191 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0_tK_6x-FMC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online], and ''Le pouvoir local en Gaule romaine'' (Presses Universitaires Blaise-Pascal, 2009), pp. 74–75 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUxjz24HUo0C&amp;pg=PT72&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online.] Christian Goudineau calls Troucillus "un prince helvien," perhaps with the assumption that his father would have been a ''rix'' (Latin ''[[King of Rome|rex]]'') had the Helvii not been under Roman rule.&lt;/ref&gt; but the word is usually taken to mean simply a "leader" or "leading citizen." Troucillus is listed among [[legatus|legates]] and envoys for 58 BC in [[T.R.S. Broughton|Broughton]]'s ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich S. Gruen]] notes the presence of Troucillus among those who demonstrate that Caesar favored men of non-Roman and [[equestrian order|equestrian]] origin among his junior officers and lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich S. Gruen]], "The '[[First Triumvirate]]' and the Reaction," in ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California Press, 1974, reprinted 1995), pp. 117–118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=axY9jQzzW9UC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Syme]] calls the Helvian "a cultivated and admirable young man."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, ''The Origin of Cornelius Gallus," ''Classical Quarterly'' 32 (1938), p. 41, reiterated in ''The Roman Revolution'' (Oxford University Press, 1939, reissued 2002), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troucillus was accompanied on the mission to Ariovistus by [[Marcus Mettius]] (or Metius), a Roman who had a formal social relationship (''[[hospitium]]'') with the Suebian king. Since Ariovistus had been declared a Friend of the Roman People (''amicus populi romani'') during Caesar's consulship in 59 BC, the ''hospitium'' between him and Mettius might have had to do with the diplomacy that led to the declaration of friendship;&lt;ref&gt;This assumption is common enough to have been noted in a student textbook for Caesar's commentaries edited by Francis W. Kelsey (Boston, 1918), p. 117 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDAYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Metius+may+have+been+received+and+entertained+by+Ariovistus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Metius%20may%20have%20been%20received%20and%20entertained%20by%20Ariovistus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; business dealings involving goods, slaves, or animals are also not out of the question.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Caesar: Life of a Colossus'' (Yale University Press, 2006), [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] identifies Mettius, whose ''[[praenomen]]'' he gives erroneously as Caius, as a merchant (p. 229 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8wBTzdZG5UC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=%22Caius+Mettius,+a+merchant%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Caius%20Mettius%2C%20a%20merchant%22&amp;f=false online]). Others have made a Romanized Gaul of Mettius. None of these have a basis in the text of the ''Bellum Gallicum''. Caesar says only that Mettius had availed himself of the ''hospitium'' of Ariovistus (''qui hospitio Ariovisti utebatur'', ''BG'' 1.46.4), and provides no further information about the man's social rank, ethnicity, or occupation.&lt;/ref&gt; In 60 BC, the senate had sent three [[legatus|legates]] on a diplomatic mission to shore up relations to key Gallic ''civitates'', including the Aedui, against the threatened invasion or inducements of the [[Helvetii]], whose entry into [[Allobroges|Allobrogian]] and Aeduan territory two years later provided Caesar with a ''[[casus belli]]''. One of these legates was [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (praetor 63 BC)|Lucius Valerius Flaccus]], the nephew of the Valerius Flaccus who had granted Caburus's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad Atticum'' 1.19.2–3 and 20.5. The senior legate was [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55 BC)|Metellus Creticus]], under whom Flaccus had served in [[History of Crete#Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Crete|Crete]] earlier in the 60s. The other man was Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus (the praetor of 59 BC, not the consul of 72).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucius had served under his uncle in the Narbonensis at the beginning of his career.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the governorship of Flaccus and his nephew's presence in Gaul during the [[Roman civil wars|civil wars of the 80s]], see [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul 93 BCE)#Role in civil war|G. Valerius Flaccus: Role in civil war]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ties to the Valerii Flacci, Troucillus or another member of his family might have traveled with Flaccus as interpreter or liaison. Caesar explains his decision to send Troucillus to Ariovistus on linguistic grounds, saying that the Suebian king had learned to speak Celtic.&lt;ref&gt;''Commodissimum visum est C. Valerium &amp;lt;Troucillum&amp;gt; ... propter fidem et propter linguae Gallicae scientiam, qua multa iam Ariovistus longinqua consuetudine utebatur, et quod in eo peccandi Germanis causa non esset, ad eum mittere'': "It seemed most advantageous to send C. Valerius Troucillus, because of his loyalty and his knowledge of the Gaulish language, in which Ariovistus had become quite fluent after his long exposure to it, and because there would be no cause for the Germans to find fault with him" (''BG'' 1.46.4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Caesar's assertion that the king should have no cause to find fault with Troucillus, Ariovistus immediately accuses the pair of envoys of spying and refuses to allow them to speak. He has Troucillus thrown in chains. Such treatment of envoys was a violation of the ''[[ius gentium]]'', the customary law of international relations,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Peretz, "The Roman Interpreter and His Diplomatic and Military Roles," ''Historia'' 55 (2006), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been observed that Ariovistus's charge may not have been groundless.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Collins, “Caesar as Political Propagandist,” in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 1.1 (1972), p. 930 [https://books.google.com/books?id=64VyN5U0R8AC&amp;pg=PA930&amp;dq=%22it+is+hard+to+avoid+the+feeling+that%22+intitle:Aufstieg+intitle:und+intitle:Niedergang&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20is%20hard%20to%20avoid%20the%20feeling%20that%22%20intitle%3AAufstieg%20intitle%3Aund%20intitle%3ANiedergang&amp;f=false online]: "it is hard to avoid the feeling that if we had an independent report of the incident from the German side we should learn that the envoys' conduct was not quite so diplomatically correct as Caesar has represented it"; see also N.J.E. Austin and N.B. Rankov ''Exploratio: Military and Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople'' (Routledge, 1995), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troucillus is held by the Suebi until the decisive battle, in which the Romans are victorious. Caesar gives the recovery of the young Celt an emphatic place in the penultimate paragraph of the book; several scholars&lt;ref&gt;"Cette affection s'exprime en termes plus chaleureux" ("this affection is expressed in the warmest terms"), [[:fr:Ernest Desjardins|Ernest Desjardins]], ''Géographie historique et administrative de la Gaule romaine'' (Paris, 1878), p. 512 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgs8AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA512&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online;] the story demonstrates Caesar's "warm heart for friendship" observes Ernst Riess, reviewing a teaching text of the ''Bellum Gallicum'' in ''Classical Weekly'' 3 (1909–1910), p. 132; [[William Warde Fowler]] perceives a "genuine feeling" that "helps us to understand the secret of Caesar's wonderful influence over other men," ''Julius Caesar and the Foundation of the Roman Imperial System'' (New York and London: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1892), p. 160 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DunQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA159-IA2&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online;] Christian Goudineau, ''César et la Gaule'' (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 240 ("un des très rares moments de la ''Guerre des Gaules'' où César exprime une émotion"); an emotion rare in the war commentaries noted also by [[T.P. Wiseman]], “The Publication of ''De Bello Gallico'',” in ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'', pp. 1–9; Ronald Syme, ''The Provincial at Rome'' (University of Exeter Press, 1999), p. 64, noting the "providential delivery Caesar recounts in moving words"; and "a notable exception to Caesar's generally objective tone in his narrative," Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, ''Ancient Rome from the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 86 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qMNL0jqhygoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; have detected a degree of personal warmth in the passage that is atypical of the commentaries:

[[File:Troucillus in chains.jpg|thumb|250px|A 19th-century illustration depicting the chained '''Troucillus''' in the moment before his rescue by [[Julius Caesar]]]]
{{cquote|Caesar himself, while pursuing the enemy with his cavalry, happened upon C. Valerius Troucillus,&lt;ref&gt;Most texts have ''Procillus'' at this point.&lt;/ref&gt; bound in three chains and dragged along by guards during the rout. This event indeed brought Caesar a pleasure no less than the victory itself, because he saw the most worthy man of the Gallic province, both a personal and a social friend,&lt;ref&gt;''Familiarem et hospitem.''&lt;/ref&gt; snatched from the hands of the enemy and restored to him; fortune had not diminished any element of pleasure or thanksgiving by his loss.&lt;ref&gt;The sentiment as expressed by the Latin here is easy to understand, but difficult to render in nuanced English; a more natural translation based on the rhetorical emphasis of word order would be: "his loss would have deprived the occasion of some degree of happiness and cause for thanksgiving; fortune had it otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Troucillus told how three times, before his very eyes, they had cast lots to determine whether he should be burnt alive on the spot or whether to put it off for another time; thanks to the luck of the draw, he was unharmed. Marcus Metius likewise was recovered and brought to Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Gallicum'' 1.52.5–8: ''C. Valerius Procillus, cum a custodibus in fuga trinis catenis vinctus traheretur, in ipsum Caesarem hostes equitatu insequentem incidit. Quae quidem res Caesari non minorem quam ipsa victoria voluptatem attulit, quod hominem honestissimum provinciae Galliae, suum familiarem et hospitem, ereptum ex manibus hostium sibi restitutum videbat neque eius calamitate de tanta voluptate et gratulatione quicquam fortuna deminuerat. Is se praesente de se ter sortibus consultum dicebat, utrum igni statim necaretur an in aliud tempus reservaretur: sortium beneficio se esse incolumem. Item M. Metius repertus et ad eum reductus est.'' The repetition of ''voluptas'' strikes an oddly Epicurean note, consonant with the theme of friendship; some scholars have seen an attraction to Epicureanism in Caesar, and an inordinate number of Epicureans among his supporters. See Frank C. Bourne, "Caesar the Epicurean," ''Classical World'' 70 (1977) 417–432, and [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], review of ''Science and Politics in the Ancient World'' by Benjamin Farrington (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1939), ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 31 (1941) 149–157. [[Miriam Griffin]], "Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome," in ''Philosophia togata'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), observed that Caesar's camp during the Gallic Wars was a "hot-bed of Epicureanism", where [[Cicero]]'s friend [[Trebatius Testa]] converted to the philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his discussion of racial stereotyping among the Romans, [[A.N. Sherwin-White]] takes note of this passage in Caesar's overall depiction of Ariovistus as "an impossible person" who thought "nothing of frying an envoy."&lt;ref&gt;[[A.N. Sherwin-White]], ''Racial Prejudice in Imperial Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), pp. 14 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons that are unclear, the Roman Mettius seems to have received better treatment during his captivity than did the Celtic envoy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wallace-Hadrill]] suggests that the preexisting guest-friend connection (''hospitium'') between Mettius and Ariovistus accounts for this preferential treatment; see ''Patronage in Ancient Society'' (Routledge, 1989), p. 140 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CesNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Troucillus+OR+procillus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Troucillus%20OR%20procillus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The episode allows Caesar himself to display by contrast the aristocratic virtue of treating one's dependent friends well, which fosters obligations that enhance the important man's prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason references the example of Caesar's friendship with Troucillus in ''Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary'' (Brill, 2001), p. 166, note 1718 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IZWPcySG_mAC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_s&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Procillus%20&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious significance===
[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.R.

Reid, "Human Sacrifices at Rome and Other Notes on Roman Religion," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 2 (1912) 34–52. A notable rite of human sacrifice in Rome was the live burial of one Greek couple and one Gallic couple in the [[Forum Boarium]] in 228 BC; see Briggs L. Twyman, "''Metus Gallicus'': The Celts and Roman Human Sacrifice," ''Ancient History Bulletin'' 11 (1997) 1–11; multiple instances in [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 118 ff ("three times in the later history of the Republic the Romans resorted to human sacrifice to ward off a Gallic invasion"). Several Greek and Roman literary sources document [[Celts and human sacrifice|human sacrifice among the Celts]], as does archaeology, explored particularly by Jean-Louis Brunaux, for whom see: “Gallic Blood Rites,” ''Archaeology'' 54 (March/April 2001), 54–57; ''Les sanctuaires celtiques et leurs rapports avec le monde mediterranéean'', Actes de colloque de St-Riquier (8 au 11 novembre 1990) organisés par la Direction des Antiquités de Picardie et l’UMR 126 du [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]] (Paris: Éditions Errance, 1991); “La mort du guerrier celte. Essai d’histoire des mentalités,” in ''Rites et espaces en pays celte et méditerranéen.

Rives connects the practice to the incident involving Troucillus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Germania'' 10 and 39; J.B.

===The Helvii and Roman politics===
No [[polity]] within Caesar's Narbonese province joined the [[Battle of Alesia|pan-Gallic rebellion of 52 BC]], nor engaged in any known acts of hostility against Rome during the war. The family of Troucillus, in fact, plays a key role in securing Caesar's [[Rear (military)|rear militarily]] against Vercingetorix, who sent forces to invade Helvian territory. In his 1861 history of the [[Vivarais]],&lt;ref&gt;L'Abbé Rouchier, "L'Helvie à l'époque gauloise et sous la domination romaine," in ''Histoire religieuse, civile et politique du Vivarais'' (Paris, 1861), vol. 1, pp. 3–65, especially pp. 48–52 on Troucillus (under the name Procillus).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abbé]] Rouchier conjectured that Caesar, seeing the strategic utility of Helvian territory on the border of the Roman province along a main route into central Gaul, was able to cultivate the Valerii by redressing punitive measures taken against the ''civitas'' by [[Pompey|Pompeius Magnus]] ("Pompey the Great") in the 70s. During the secession of [[Quintus Sertorius]] in Spain, Celtic polities in Mediterranean Gaul were subjected to [[conscription|troop levies]] and forced requisitions to support the military efforts of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Metellus Pius]], Pompeius, and other Roman commanders against the rebels. Some Celts, however, supported Sertorius. After the renegade Roman was assassinated, Metellus and Pompeius were able to declare a victory, and the Helvii along with the [[Volcae Arecomici]] were forced to cede a portion of their lands to the Greek city-state Massilia (present-day [[Marseilles]]), a loyal independent ally of Rome for centuries, located strategically at the mouth of the [[Rhône]]. Caesar mentions the land forfeiture in his account of the civil war, without detailing Helvian actions against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' 1.35.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman civil wars of the 40s]], Massilia chose to maintain its longstanding relationship with Pompeius even in isolation, as the Gallic polities of the Narbonensis continued to support Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Mauné, "La centuriation de Béziers B et l'occupation du sol de la vallée de l'Hérault au I&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; av. J.-C.," in ''Histoire, espaces et marges de l'Antiquité: Hommages à Monique Clavel Lévêque'' (Presses Universitaires Franc-Comtoises, 2003), vol. 2, p. 73 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3DM-8zw1BS0C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22une+fidélité+certaine+de+la+Transalpine+envers+Rome%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22une%20fidélité%20certaine%20de%20la%20Transalpine%20envers%20Rome%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Massiliots were besieged and defeated by Caesar, and as a result lost their independence, as well as possibly the land they had taken from the Helvii. Rouchier presents an extended portrait of Troucillus in his history, viewing the educated young Celt through Caesar's eyes as an example of a visionary [[meritocracy]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Noting "sa bravoure, la noblesse de son caractère, les facultés brillantes d'un esprit qui, pour parâitre supérieur, n'avait besoin que de culture": Rouchier,  pp. 48–49. For Caesar's grants of citizenship and senatorial rank to Gauls, including "trousered Gauls" of Transalpina, see [[Gaius Valerius Troucillus#Humanitas, virtus and becoming Roman|''Humanitas'', ''virtus'' and becoming Roman]] following.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Humanitas'', ''virtus'' and becoming Roman==
During his [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], Caesar extended full rights of Roman citizenship to ethnically Celtic [[Cisalpine Gaul]] ([[northern Italy]]), and filled the roll of the [[Roman senate]] with controversial appointments that included Cisalpine and possibly a few Narbonese Gauls. Although accusations of degrading the senate with uncivilized "[[braccae|trouser-wearing Gauls]]"&lt;ref&gt;A jibe in poetic form is recorded by [[Suetonius]], ''Divus Iulius'' 80.2: "Caesar led the Gauls in [[Roman triumph|triumph]] and likewise into the [[Curia Julia|senate house]]; the Gauls took off their [[braccae|trousers]] and put on the [[Laticlave|wide stripe]]" (''Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit, idem in curiam / Galli bracas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt'').&lt;/ref&gt; were exaggerations meant to disparage Caesar's inclusive efforts, [[Ronald Syme]] has pointed out that men such as Troucillus and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Trogus]] were  educated citizens worthy of such appointments:

{{cquote|Gallia Narbonensis can assert a peculiar and proper claim to be the home of trousered senators. No names are recorded. Yet surmise about origins and social standing may claim validity. The province could boast opulent and cultivated natives of dynastic families, [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] before they became Roman, whose citizenship, so far from being the recent gift of Caesar, went back to proconsuls a generation or two earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, ''The Roman Revolution'' (Oxford University Press, 1939, reprinted 2002), p. 79; cf. "The Origins of Cornelius Gallus," p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Troucillus's fluent [[bilingualism]] is asserted by Caesar. The French scholar Christian Goudineau found it "perplexing" to have Caesar take special note that a native Gaul spoke [[Gaulish]], and suggests that this emphasis on Troucillus's retention of what should have been his first language indicates that the Helvian had been given the same education as a Roman, perhaps even in Rome and maybe as a hostage.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Goudineau, ''César et la Gaule'' (Paris: Errance, 1990), p. 74. See also L'Abbé Rouchier, "L'Helvie à l'époque gauloise et sous la domination romaine," in ''Histoire religieuse, civile et politique du Vivarais'' (Paris, 1861), vol. 1, p. 88. For Roman and Celtic practices of hostage-taking in this period, see discussion of [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)#Hostage crisis|Publius Crassus's hostage crisis in Armorica]] in 56 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syme points out that the Gauls of the ''Provincia'' had direct exposure to the Greek language and to Hellenic culture through the regional influence of Massilia,&lt;ref&gt;''The Provincial at Rome'' p. 58 [https://books.google.com/books?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Celtic+Ligures+OR+Liguria+OR+Ligurian&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1976&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; which had well-established contact with the Helvii (see [[Gaius Valerius Troucillus#The Helvii and Roman politics|"The Helvii and Roman politics"]] above). The cultural and linguistic complexity of Mediterranean Gaul is asserted by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], who says Massilia is "trilingual, because they speak Greek, Latin, and Gaulish."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (the famous polymath, not Varro Atacinus) as quoted by [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'' 15.1.63, ''trilingues quod et graece loquantur et latine et gallice''; Edgar C. Polomé, "The Linguistic Situation in the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire," ''Augstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II (De Gruyter, 1983), p. 527 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6GO3qtZGcRcC&amp;pg=PA527&amp;dq=%22The+coastal+area+from+Montpellier+to+Nice%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20coastal%20area%20from%20Montpellier%20to%20Nice%22&amp;f=false online]; Philip Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'' (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001), p. 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=trilingues+varro&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=trilingues%20varro&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar employs two abstract nouns from the Roman moral vocabulary to describe Troucillus: he is said to be outstanding for his ''humanitas'' and his ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Goudineau translates these qualities into French as "sa [[Virtue ethics|grande valeur]]" and "sa [[high culture|haute culture]]" (''César et la Gaule'', p. 74).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Humanitas'' was "a keyword for late Republican elite self-definition";&lt;ref&gt;Brian A. Krostenko, "Beyond (Dis)belief: Rhetorical Form and Religious Symbol in Cicero's ''De Divinatione''," ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 130 (2000), p. 364. It should be noted that the word ''humanitas'' first begins to be used regularly at this time, and its meaning evolves in later [[Latin literature]].&lt;/ref&gt; it embraced a range of ideals including culture, civilization, education, and goodwill toward one's fellow human beings. [[Cicero]] considered ''humanitas'' to be one of Caesar's own outstanding qualities,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero uses the word ''humanitas'' five times in the speech ''Pro Ligario'' in regard to Caesar, as noted by William C. McDermott, "''In Ligarianam''," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 101 (1970), p. 336. Also John H. Collins, “Caesar and the Corruption of Power,” ''Historia'' 4 (1955), pp. 451, 455.&lt;/ref&gt; and often pairs it with ''lepos'', "charm"; in his speech arguing for the extension of Caesar's [[proconsul]]ar command, he distinguishes Roman culture from Gallic by mockingly asking whether "the culture and charm of those people and nations" could possibly be the attraction for Caesar, rather than the war's usefulness to the state (''utilitas rei publicae'').&lt;ref&gt;''De provinciis consularibus'' 29: ''hominum nationumque illarum humanitas et lepos''.  Brian A. Krostenko, ''Cicero, [[Catullus]], and the Language of Social Performance'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), pp. 193–194 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IXzysvM-M7oC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22Caesar+must+be+remaining+in+Gaul+out+of+a+sense+of+duty%22+inauthor:Krostenko&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Caesar%20must%20be%20remaining%20in%20Gaul%20out%20of%20a%20sense%20of%20duty%22%20inauthor%3AKrostenko&amp;f=false  online]: "Even in this relatively straightforward, humorous passage the exclusionary force of the language of social performance is plainly present."&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero also associates ''humanitas'' with speaking well, the ability to hold a cultivated conversation free of vulgarity and to speak in an [[urbanitas|urbane manner]].&lt;ref&gt;Krostenko, ''Cicero, Catullus, and the language of social performance'' pp. 197, 212 ''et passim''. See also Lindsay Hall on Caesar's "linguistic nationalism," "''Ratio'' and ''Romanitas'' in the ''Bellum Gallicum''," in ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter,'' pp. 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

A hundred and fifty years later, Tacitus takes a more cynical view of ''humanitas'' as an illusion of civilization that is in fact submission to the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Slater, "Handouts at Dinner," ''Phoenix'' 54 (2000), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus observes that as governor of [[Roman Britain]], [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] had engaged in a program of

{{cquote|edifying the sons of chieftains by means of the liberal arts and promoting the natural abilities of the Britons over the intellectual achievements of the Gauls,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton]] in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' translates this phrase as "preferred the natural wits of Britain before the laboured studies of the French", with an emphasis not lacking in other Anglocentric translations.&lt;/ref&gt; so that now those who used to shun the Roman tongue craved eloquence. After that it was considered an honor to dress like us, and togas were everywhere. Little by little resistance melted in contact with vices — covered walkways and hot baths and fashionable dinner parties. And among the benighted this was called civilization (''humanitas''), although it was an aspect of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' 21: ''Iam vero principum filios liberalibus artibus erudire, et ingenia Britannorum studiis Gallorum anteferre, ut qui modo linguam Romanam abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent. Inde etiam habitus nostri honor et frequens toga; paulatimque discessum ad delenimenta vitiorum, porticus et balinea et conviviorum elegantiam. Idque apud imperitos humanitas vocabatur, cum pars servitutis esset.'' For discussion of ''humanitas'' and Gallo-Roman acculturation, see Greg Woolf, ''Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 54-70, also p. 53 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GjNaT7FMohwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22The+idea+that+Roman+rule+and+contact+with+Rome+had+beneficial+effects%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20idea%20that%20Roman%20rule%20and%20contact%20with%20Rome%20had%20beneficial%20effects%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Roman concept of ''humanitas'' as it took shape in the 1st century BC has been criticized from a [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] perspective as a form of [[imperialism]], "a civilizing mission: it was Rome's destiny and duty to spread humanitas to other races, tempering barbarian practices and instituting the ''[[pax Romana]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Jane Webster, "[[Creole language|Creolizing]] the Roman Provinces," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105 (2001), p. 210, quoting also Greg Woolf, "Beyond Romans and Natives," ''World Archaeology'' 28 (1997), p. 55: "despite its applicability to humankind, humanitas embodied 'concepts of culture and conduct that were regarded by the Romans as the hallmarks of the aristocracy in particular.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''humanitas'' appears only twice throughout the entirety of Caesar's ''Bellum Gallicum'', both times in Book 1. In the famous opening, in which the commander parcels out Gaul into three divisions (''[[Belgae]] ... [[Aquitani]] ... [[Celts|Celtae]]'', 1.1.1) for potential conquest, Caesar reports that the [[Gallia Belgica#The Roman conquest of Gaul|Belgic Gauls]] are the bravest (''fortissimi'') fighters, "because they are at the farthest remove from the cultivation (''cultus'') and civilization (''humanitas'') of the Province."&lt;ref&gt;''Propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt''.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Troucillus is said to possess the highest level of both ''humanitas'' and ''virtus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Summa virtute et humanitate'' (''BG'' 1.46.4). Cicero also collocates ''humanitas'' and ''virtus'', as at ''De oratore'' 3.1 and 57. In his speech ''Pro Flacco'', delivered on behalf of [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus (praetor 63 BC)|Lucius Flaccus]], Cicero associates ''humanitas'' with Athens and ''virtus'' with Sparta (62–63).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Virtus'', which shares a semantic element with the Latin word ''vir'', "man,"&lt;ref&gt;Gendered, as distinguished from ''homo, homines'', "people, human beings."&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly translated by either "virtue" or "courage, valor"; it is "the quality of manliness or manhood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], "The Ambiguity of ''Virtus'' in Lucan's ''Civil War'' and Statius' ''Thebiad''," ''Arachnion'' 3 [http://www.cisi.unito.it/arachne/num3/fantham.html online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As an active quality, appropriate to the man of action,&lt;ref&gt;"Although battlefields might be thought to be its best proving grounds, Cicero used the term [''virtus''] to denote general excellence in other areas of activity, ... all with the {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} notion that it was something that existed only in action," notes Andrew J.E. Bell, "Cicero and the Spectacle of Power," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997), p. 9. See also Edwin S. Ramage,  “Aspects of Propaganda in the ''De bello gallico'': Caesar’s Virtues and Attributes,” ''Athenaeum'' 91 (2003) 331–372. Ramage sees ''humanitas'' as belonging to a class of virtues encompassing "kindness and generosity," associated in Caesar with qualities such as ''clementia'' ("clemency, leniency"), ''beneficium'' ("service, favor, benefit"), ''benevolentia'' ("goodwill, benevolence"), ''indulgentia'' or ''indulgeo'' ("leniency, mildness, kindness, favor," or the verbal action of granting these), ''mansuetudo'' ("mildness"), ''misericordia'' ("compassion, pity"), and ''liberalitas'' or ''liberaliter'' ("generosity" or to do something "freely, generously, liberally").&lt;/ref&gt; ''virtus'' balances the potentially enervating effects of civilization in the natural aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Evans, ''Utopia Antiqua: Readings of the Golden Age and Decline at Rome'' (Routledge, 2008), pp. 156–157 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ppWwPuye_e4C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=%22That+peace+can+lead+to+lethargy+and+decay%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22That%20peace%20can%20lead%20to%20lethargy%20and%20decay%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's prolific use of the word ''virtus''&amp;nbsp;— fourteen instances in Book 1 alone, in reference to Celtic nations as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;Helvetii (1.1.4, 1.2.2, 1.13.4 thrice), [[Boii]] (1.28.4), Aedui (1.31.7).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the Roman army&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Gallicum'' 1.40.4 and 1.51.1, and of the 10th Legion in particular at 1.40.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— points to "no easily articulated essential meaning": "''Virtus'' was whatever it was that Romans liked when they saw it."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J.E. Bell, "Cicero and the Spectacle of Power," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 87 (1997), p. 9. Ariovistus claims the quality for his ''Germani'' and for himself (''BG'' 1.36.7 and 1.44.1), but while this German ''virtus'' is affirmed by Gauls and merchants, causing unease among the army, it is downplayed by Caesar (1.39.1 and 1.40.8). On the rhetoric of ''virtus'' and competing claims to it in the ''Bellum Gallicum'', see Louis Rawlings, “Caesar’s Portrayal of Gauls as Warriors,” in ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'' (Classical Press of Wales, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word appears frequently throughout the ''Bellum Gallicum'', Caesar attributes the quality of ''virtus'' to only a few individuals: Troucillus; three Roman officers;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Volusenus]] (3.5.2), [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus Cicero]] (5.48.6), and [[Titus Labienus]] (7.59.6); see Myles Anthony McDonnell, ''Roman manliness:'' virtus ''and the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 308 [https://books.google.com/books?id=v2vefi2_ojYC&amp;pg=RA11-PA308&amp;dq=Volusenus+CIcero&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Volusenus%20CIcero&amp;f=false online.] The [[centurion]]s [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]] bandy the word between themselves at 5.44.&lt;/ref&gt; and two Celts, [[Commius]] of the [[Atrebates]] and [[Tasgetius]] of the [[Carnutes]].&lt;ref&gt;Commius at ''Bellum Gallicum'' 4.21.7, the only instance of the word ''virtus'' in Book 4; Tasgetius at 5.25.2, in noting that having been installed as king by Caesar, he was murdered by his own people three years into his reign.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Bellum Gallicum'' audience===
[[T.P. Wiseman]] saw the role of Troucillus in ''Bellum Gallicum'' 1 as one indication of the breadth of Caesar's intended audience. Wiseman argues that the commentaries were first published serially,&lt;ref&gt;At one time, the dominant scholarly view held that the ''Commentarii'' were published as a collection, reworked from Caesar's annual report as [[proconsul]] to the [[Roman senate]]; internal contradictions, narrative discontinuities, and gaffes (such as Caesar's insistence on the loyalty of [[Commius]] of the [[Atrebates]], and his failure to anticipate the uprising of [[Vercingetorix]] and the [[Arverni]] and the [[Aedui]]) are among the questions that cause scholars to find serial publication more likely, with the collected edition appearing as a [[public relations]] effort at the outset of [[Caesar's civil war]] with [[Pompeius Magnus]] and the senatorial elite.&lt;/ref&gt; with a year-by-year account to keep Caesar and his achievements vivid in the mind of the public (''[[SPQR|populus]]'') on whose support he counted as a [[populares|popularist]] leader. The seven individual books were then collected and supplemented by [[Aulus Hirtius]] at the end of the 50s or beginning of the 40s. "Publication" in ancient Rome relied less on the circulation of written copies than on public and private readings, which were an important form of entertainment; this circumstance, Wiseman intuits, goes a long way toward explaining Caesar's narrative use of the [[Narrative mode#Third-person view|third person]] in regard to himself, since the audience would be hearing the words spoken by a reader. In addition to [[public relations]] efforts among the [[plebs|Roman people]], Wiseman believes that Caesar would have sent readers to the [[Narbonensis]], the Mediterranean region of Gaul already under Roman administration, because he required Narbonese support at his back if he was to succeed in independent Gaul.

The prominent attention given to the recovery of Troucillus from the Suebi at the end of Book 1, and the unusual warmth with which Caesar speaks of him, suggests that the proconsul valued his friends to the south and was careful to show it.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], “The Publication of ''De Bello Gallico'',” in ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'', pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In another indication of Narbonese regard for Caesar, the poet [[Varro Atacinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Varro Atacinus, or P. Terentius Varro, was a native of the Narbonensis, identified by his [[toponym]]ic ''cognomen'' as associated with the [[Aude River]] (ancient ''Atax'') and thus distinguished from the more famous Varro; whether he was an ethnic Celt or a Roman colonist can be debated. Though his work survives only in fragments, the Augustan poets regarded him highly.&lt;/ref&gt; the contemporary of Troucillus, wrote an epic poem called the ''Bellum Sequanicum'' (''[[Sequani]]an War''), no longer extant, about the first year of Caesar's war in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 235–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''German''' ({{lang|de|Deutsch}} {{IPA-de|dɔʏtʃ||de-Deutsch.ogg}}) is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that is mainly spoken in [[Central Europe]]. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italy]]), the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is also one of the three official languages of [[Luxembourg]]. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], the [[Frisian languages]], [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], and [[Yiddish]]. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], although those belong to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] group. German is the second most widely spoken [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], after English.

One of the [[world language|major languages of the world]], German is the first language of almost 100&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10128380/German-should-be-a-working-language-of-EU-says-Merkels-party.html |title=German 'should be a working language of EU', says Merkel's party |date=18 June 2013 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[French language|French]], German is the second most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English, making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf Europeans and their Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |date= 6 January 2016 }}, [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_anx_en.pdf Data for EU27], published in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7008563/3-24092015-AP-EN.pdf/bf8be07c-ff9d-406b-88f9-f98f5199fe5a |title=More than 80% of primary school pupils in the EU were studying a foreign language in 2013 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 September 2015 |website= |publisher=Eurostat |access-date=3 May 2016 |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;[[Modern Language Association]], February 2015, [http://www.mla.org/pdf/2013_enrollment_survey.pdf Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2013].

German is an [[inflected language]] with four [[Grammatical case|cases]] for nouns, pronouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and [[Germanic strong verb|strong and weak verbs]]. German derives the majority of its vocabulary from the ancient Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. A portion of German words are derived from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and fewer are borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Modern English]]. With slightly different standardized variants ([[German Standard German|German]], [[Austrian Standard German|Austrian]] and [[Swiss Standard German|Swiss]] Standard German), German is a [[pluricentric language]]. Like English, German is also notable for its [[German dialects|broad spectrum of dialects]], with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Template:German L1 speakers outside Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and [[Standard German]], as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a "dialect" and a "language",&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt; some German varieties or dialect groups (e.g. [[Low German]] or [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]&lt;ref name="Goossens2000"&gt;Jan Goossens: {{lang|de|Niederdeutsche Sprache: Versuch einer Definition.}} In: Jan Goossens (Hrsg.): {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch: Sprache und Literatur.}} Karl Wachholtz, 2.

Auflage, Weidler, Berlin 2000, {{ISBN|3-89693-326-4}}, S. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;) are alternatively referred to as "languages" and "dialects".&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (2015)" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Modern [[Standard German]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] descended from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]]. The first of these branches survives in modern [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], all of which are descended from [[Old Norse]]. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and the only historical member of this branch from which written texts survive is [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as [[English language|English]], German, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Yiddish]], [[Afrikaans]], and others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22811452|title=Old English and its closest relatives : a survey of the earliest Germanic languages|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|date=1992|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8047-2221-6|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=16|oclc=22811452}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Germanic Languages Map Europe.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Germanic languages]] in Europe]]
Within the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] lines (running through [[Düsseldorf]]-[[Düsseldorf-Benrath|Benrath]] and [[Krefeld]]-[[Uerdingen]], respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the [[High German consonant shift]] (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as [[High German languages|High German]] dialects ''(nos. 29–34 on the map)'', while those spoken to the north comprise the [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] ''(nos. 19–24)'' and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] ''(no. 25)'' dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian can be further distinguished historically as [[Irminones|Irminonic]], [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]], and [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]], respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser-Rhine group).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Standard German]] is based on [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] dialects ''(no. 30 on the map)'', which are [[Central German]] dialects ''(nos. 29–31)'', belonging to the Irminonic [[High German languages|High German]] dialect group ''(nos. 29–34)''. German is therefore most closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] (based on [[Central Franconian dialects]] – ''no. 29''), and [[Yiddish]]. Also closely related to Standard German are the [[Upper German]] dialects spoken in the southern [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking countries]], such as [[Swiss German]] ([[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] – ''no. 34''), and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the [[France|French]] [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Grand Est]], such as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (mainly Alemannic, but also Central- and&amp;nbsp;[[High Franconian German|Upper Franconian]]&amp;nbsp;''(no. 32)''&amp;nbsp;dialects) and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (Central Franconian – ''no. 29'').

After these High German dialects, standard German is (somewhat less closely) related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g. Dutch and Afrikaans) or Low German/Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern [[Germany]] and southern [[Denmark]]), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages—[[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] (spoken in [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] – ''no. 28''), [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] (spoken in [[Saterland]] – ''no. 27''), and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] (spoken in [[Friesland]] – ''no. 26'')—as well as the Anglic languages of [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]. These [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] dialects are all members of the Ingvaeonic family of West Germanic languages which did not take part in the High German consonant shift.

== History ==
{{Main|History of German}}

=== Old High German ===
{{Main|Old High German}}

The [[History of German|history of the German language]] begins with the [[High German consonant shift]] during the [[migration period]], which separated [[Old High German]] (OHG) dialects from [[Old Saxon]]. This [[Sound change|sound shift]] involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant]]s (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following:

*Voiceless stops became long ([[Gemination|geminated]]) voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] following a vowel
*Voiceless stops became [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] in word-initial position, or following certain consonants
*Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22811452|title=Old English and its closest relatives : a survey of the earliest Germanic languages|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|date=1992|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8047-2221-6|location=Stanford, Calif.|pages=239, 242|oclc=22811452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is written evidence of the [[Old High German]] language in several [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions from as early as the 6th century AD (such as the [[Pforzen buckle]]), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the ''[[Abrogans]]'' (written c.765–775), a Latin-German [[glossary]] supplying over 3,000 OHG words with their [[Latin]] equivalents. Following the ''Abrogans'' the first coherent works written in OHG appear in the 9th century, chief among them being the ''[[Muspilli]]'', the ''[[Merseburg Charms]]'', and the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'', as well as a number of other religious texts (the ''[[Georgslied]]'', the ''[[Ludwigslied]]'', the ''Evangelienbuch'', and translated hymns and prayers).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvin2"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Anthology of German Literature|publisher=D. C. Heath &amp; co|pages=5–6|oclc=6128632|author=Calvin, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Muspilli'' is a Christian poem written in a [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]] dialect offering an account of the soul after the [[Last Judgment]], and the ''Merseburg Charms'' are transcriptions of spells and charms from the [[Paganism|pagan]] Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the ''Hildebrandslied'', a secular [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of [[Old Saxon]] and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the [[Alemanni|Alamanni]], [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian]], and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group ([[Irminones]]), which had settled in what is now southern-central [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] between the 2nd and 6th centuries during the great migration.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In general, the surviving texts of OHG show a wide range of [[dialect]]al diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through [[Monastery|monasteries]] and [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.

The German language through the OHG period was still predominantly a spoken language, with a wide range of dialects and a much more extensive [[Oral literature|oral]] tradition than a written one. Having just emerged from the High German consonant shift, OHG was also a relatively new and volatile language still undergoing a number of [[Phonetics|phonetic]], [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], and [[Syntax|syntactic]] changes. The scarcity of written work, instability of the language, and widespread illiteracy of the time thus account for the lack of [[Standard language|standardization]] up to the end of the OHG period in 1050.

Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into [[Slavs|Slavic]] territory (this is known as the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]''). Along with the increasing wealth and geographic extent of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/Ling450ch/reports/german.html|title=A Brief History of the German Language|last=Alder|first=Aaron D.|date=|website=linguistics.byu.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear example of this is the ''mittelhochdeutsche Dichtersprache'' employed in the [[Hohenstaufen]] court in [[Swabia]] as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.

While the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of certain vowel sounds: ''hus'' (OHG "house")''→haus'' (MHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to [[schwa]] [ə]: ''taga'' (OHG "days")→''tage'' (MHG)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811323307|title=A history of German : what the past reveals about today's language|last=Salmons|first=Joe|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-969793-9|edition=1st|location=Oxford, U.K.|pages=195|oclc=811323307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, among this repertoire are a number of impressive secular works, such as the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] telling the story of the [[dragon]]-slayer [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] (c. 13th century), and the ''[[Iwein]],'' an [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] verse poem by [[Hartmann von Aue]] (c. 1203), as well as several [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and courtly romances such as ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Tristan]]''. (Also noteworthy is the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', the first book of laws written in [[Middle Low German|Middle ''Low'' German]] (c. 1220)). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.

The Middle High German period is generally seen as ending with the decimation of the population of [[Europe]] in the [[Black Death]] of 1346–1353.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Areas in the east where German is no longer spoken are marked by lighter shades.]]
Modern German begins with the [[Early New High German]] (ENHG) period, which the influential German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm Scherer]] dates 1350–1650, terminating with the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This period saw the further displacement of Latin by German as the primary language of courtly proceedings and, increasingly, of literature in the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. While these states were still under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking [[Principality|principalities]] and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured through this period with a vast number of often mutually-incomprehensible [[German dialects|regional dialects]] being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the [[printing press]] c.1440 and the publication of [[Luther Bible|Luther's vernacular translation of the Bible]] in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.

The ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] German, one being ''gemeine tiutsch,'' used in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and the other being ''Meißner Deutsch'', used in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the [[Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4139504|title=The German language|last=Keller|first=R.E.|date=1978|publisher=Faber|year=|isbn=0-571-11159-9|location=London|pages=365–368|oclc=4139504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers' languages (''Druckersprachen'') aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geschichte der deutschen Sprache|last=Bach|first=Adolf|publisher=Quelle &amp; Meyer|year=1965|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardization in the written form of the German language.[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The widespread popularity of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]] translated into German by [[Martin Luther]] helped establish modern German]]One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther's translation of the Bible into German (the [[New Testament]] in 1522 and the [[Old Testament]], published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the ''Meißner Deutsch'' of [[Saxony]],&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey William. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''. Grand Rapids, MI: Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill, 1999–2003, 1:244.&lt;/ref&gt; spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther's Bible featured a long list of [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] for each region that translated words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Concerning his translation method Luther says the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;One who would talk German does not ask the Latin how he shall do it; he must ask the mother in the home, the children on the streets, the common man in the market-place and note carefully how they talk, then translate accordingly. They will then understand what is said to them because it is German. When Christ says 'ex abundantia cordis os loquitur,' I would translate, if I followed the papists, ''aus dem Überflusz des Herzens redet der Mund''. But tell me is this talking German? What German understands such stuff? No, the mother in the home and the plain man would say, ''Wesz das Herz voll ist, des gehet der Mund über''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgermanl00supeiala|title=A history of the German language|last=Super|first=Charles William|date=1893|publisher=Columbus, Ohio: Hann &amp; Adair|others=University of California Libraries|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;With Luther's rendering of the Bible in the vernacular German asserted itself against the dominance of Latin as a legitimate language for courtly, literary, and now ecclesiastical subject-matter. Further, his Bible was ubiquitous in the German states with nearly every household possessing a copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The German Nation and Martin Luther|last=Dickens|first=A.G.|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even with the influence of Luther's Bible as an unofficial written standard, it was not until the middle of the 18th century after the ENHG period that a widely accepted standard for written German appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Scherer]], ''{{lang|de|Zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache}} [On the history of the German language]'' (Berlin 1868)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austrian Empire ===
[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|Ethnolinguistic map of [[Austria-Hungary]], 1910, with German-speaking areas shown in red]]

German was the language of commerce and government in the [[Habsburg Empire]], which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-19th century, it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. Its use indicated that the speaker was a [[merchant]] or someone from an urban area, regardless of nationality.

Some cities, such as [[Prague]] ({{lang-de|Prag|links=no}}) and [[Budapest]] ([[Buda]], {{lang-de|Ofen|links=no}}), were gradually [[Germanization|Germanized]] in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain. Others, such as [[Pozsony]] ({{lang-de|Pressburg|links=no}}, now [[Bratislava]]), were originally settled during the Habsburg period, and were primarily German at that time. Prague, Budapest and Bratislava as well as cities like [[Zagreb]] ({{lang-de|Agram|links=no}}), and [[Ljubljana]] ({{lang-de|Laibach|links=no}}), contained significant German minorities.

In the eastern provinces of [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]] ({{lang-de|Siebenbürgen|links=no}}), German was the predominant language not only in the larger towns&amp;nbsp;– such as {{lang|de|Temeswar}} ([[Timișoara]]), {{lang|de|Hermannstadt}} ([[Sibiu]]) and {{lang|de|Kronstadt}} ([[Brașov]])&amp;nbsp;– but also in many smaller localities in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Anstalt G.

=== Standardization ===
[[File:German dictionary.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' (1854) by the [[Brothers Grimm]] helped to standardize German orthography.]]

The most comprehensive guide to the vocabulary of the German language is found within the {{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}}. This [[dictionary]] was created by the [[Brothers Grimm]] and is composed of 16 parts which were issued between 1852 and 1860.&lt;ref name = BBAWsynopsis&gt;[http://www.bbaw.de/en/research/dwb Synopsis of the ''Deutsches Wörterbuch''] {{En icon}} at the Language Research Centre, Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, retrieved 27 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the ''[[Duden Handbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/3531328 |jstor=3531328|title=Up-to-Date and with a Past: The "Duden" and its History|journal=Die Unterrichtspraxis / Teaching German|volume=28|pages=7|year=1995|last1=Weiss|first1=Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, the 2nd Orthographical Conference ended with a complete [[standardization]] of the German language in its written form and the ''Duden Handbook'' was declared its standard definition.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Nerius: {{lang|de|Die Rolle der II. Orthographischen Konferenz (1901) in der Geschichte der deutschen Rechtschreibung.}} In: Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie ({{ISSN|0044-2496}}), 119. Jahrgang 2000, Nr. 1, S. 30–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|Deutsche Bühnensprache}} (literally, German [[stage (theatre)|stage]] language) had established conventions for German pronunciation in theatre ([[Bühnendeutsch]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Siebs: {{lang|de|Deutsche Bühnenaussprache (zuletzt als: Deutsche Aussprache. Reine und gemässigte Hochlautung mit Aussprachewörterbuch.}} Hrsg. von Helmut de Boor. 19., umgearbeitete Auflage. VMA, Wiesbaden 2000, {{ISBN|3-928127-66-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;) three years earlier; however, this was an artificial standard that did not correspond to any traditional spoken dialect. Rather, it was based on the pronunciation of Standard German in Northern Germany, although it was subsequently regarded often as a general prescriptive norm, despite differing pronunciation traditions especially in the Upper-German-speaking regions that still characterize the dialect of the area today&amp;nbsp;– especially the pronunciation of the ending {{lang|de|-ig}} as [ɪk] instead of [ɪç]. In Northern Germany, Standard German was a foreign language to most inhabitants, whose native dialects were subsets of Low German. It was usually encountered only in writing or formal speech; in fact, most of Standard German was a written language, not identical to any spoken dialect, throughout the German-speaking area until well into the 19th century.

Official revisions of some of the rules from 1901 were not issued until the controversial [[German orthography reform of 1996]] was made the official standard by governments of all German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name="Upward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Upward |first=Chris |title=Spelling Reform in German |journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |year=1997 |volume=J21 |pages=22–24, 36 |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j21/german.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923054752/https://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j21/german.php |archivedate=23 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media and written works are now almost all produced in Standard German (often called {{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}}, "High German") which is understood in all areas where German is spoken.

Due to the [[German diaspora]] as well as German being the second most widely spoken language in Europe and the third most widely taught [[foreign language]] in the US&lt;ref name=MLA /&gt; and the EU (in upper secondary education)&lt;ref name="eurostat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Foreign_language_learning_statistics |title=Foreign language learning statistics – Statistics Explained |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=17 March 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others, the [[geographical distribution of German speakers]] (or "Germanophones") spans all inhabited continents. As for the number of speakers of any language worldwide, an assessment is always compromised by the lack of sufficient, reliable data. For an exact, global number of native German speakers, this is further complicated by the existence of several varieties whose status as separate "languages" or "dialects" is disputed for political and/or linguistic reasons, including quantitatively strong varieties like certain forms of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] (e.g., [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]])&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt; and [[Low German]]/Plautdietsch.&lt;ref name="Goossens2000" /&gt; Mostly depending on the inclusion or exclusion of certain varieties, it is estimated that approximately 90–95 million people speak German as a [[first language]],&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (2015)"&gt;Sum of Standard German, Swiss German, and all German dialects not listed under "Standard German" at [[Ethnologue]] (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marten"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Marten |editor2-first=Fritz Joachim|editor2-last= Sauer |title=Länderkunde&amp;nbsp;– Deutschland, Österreich, Schweiz und Liechtenstein im Querschnitt |trans-title= Regional Geography&amp;nbsp;– An Overview of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein |year=2005 |publisher=Inform-Verlag |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=3-9805843-1-3 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 10–25 million as a [[second language]],&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (2015)" /&gt; and 75–100 million as a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eurobarometer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title=Special Eurobarometer 386: Europeans and their languages |type=report |format=PDF |date=June 2012 |publisher=European Commission |pages= |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply approximately 175–220 million German speakers worldwide.&lt;ref name=Statista&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/266808/the-most-spoken-languages-worldwide/ |title=The most spoken languages worldwide (speakers and native speaker in millions) |publisher=Statista, The Statistics Portal |location=New York, USA |quote=Native speakers=105, total speakers=185 |accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that also including all persons who are or were taking German classes, i.e., regardless of their actual proficiency, would amount to about 280 million people worldwide with at least some knowledge of German.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;

==== German Sprachraum ====
{{Main|List of territorial entities where German is an official language}}
In Europe, German is the second most widely spoken mother tongue (after Russian) and the second biggest language in terms of overall speakers (after English). The area in central Europe where the majority of the population speaks German as a first language and has German as a (co-)official language is called the "[[German Sprachraum]]". It comprises an estimated 88 million native speakers and 10 million who speak German as a second language (e.g. immigrants).&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue (2015)" /&gt; Excluding regional minority languages, German is the only official language of
*[[Germany]] (de facto, not specified in the [[Grundgesetz|constitution]]),
*[[Austria]] (de jure),
*[[Languages of Switzerland|17 cantons of Switzerland]] (de jure), and
*[[Liechtenstein]] (de jure).

It is a co-official language of the
*[[Italy|Italian]] [[South Tyrol|Autonomous Province of South Tyrol]] (also majority language),
*[[Belgium]] (as majority language only in the [[German-speaking Community]]),
*four [[Cantons of Switzerland#List|cantons of Switzerland]], and

==== Outside the Sprachraum ====
Although [[Flight and expulsion of Germans|expulsions]] and [[Organised persecution of ethnic Germans|(forced) assimilation]] after the two [[World War]]s greatly diminished them, minority communities of mostly bilingual German native speakers exist in areas both adjacent to and detached from the Sprachraum.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;

{{Main|German language in Namibia}}
Namibia was [[German South-West Africa|a colony]] of the [[German Empire]] from 1884 to 1919. Mostly descending from German settlers who immigrated during this time, 25–30,000 people still speak German as a native tongue today.&lt;ref name="Deutsch in Namibia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az.com.na/fileadmin/pdf/2007/deutsch_in_namibia_2007_07_18.pdf |title=Deutsch in Namibia |publisher=Supplement of the Allgemeine Zeitung |date=18 August 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2008 |format=PDF |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624233949/http://www.az.com.na/fileadmin/pdf/2007/deutsch_in_namibia_2007_07_18.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of German colonialism in Namibia also led to the evolution of a Standard German-based [[pidgin]] language called "[[Namibian Black German]]", which became a second language for parts of the indigenous population. Although it is nearly extinct today, some older Namibians still have some knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Markedness and salience in language contact and second-language acquisition: evidence from a non-canonical contact language |series=Language Sciences |volume=25 |last=Deumert |first=Ama |doi=10.1016/S0388-0001(03)00033-0 |date=2003 |publisher=Elsevier Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German, along with English and [[Afrikaans]] was a co-official language of Namibia from 1984 until its independence from [[South Africa]] in 1990. At this point, the Namibian government perceived Afrikaans and German as symbols of [[apartheid]] and colonialism, and decided English would be the sole official language, claiming that it was a "neutral" language as there were virtually no English native speakers in Namibia at that time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch in Namibia" /&gt; German, Afrikaans and several indigenous languages became "national languages" by law, identifying them as elements of the cultural heritage of the nation and ensuring that the state acknowledged and supported their presence in the country.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt; Today, German is used in a wide variety of spheres, especially business and tourism, as well as the churches (most notably the German-speaking [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK)]]), schools (e.g. the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Höhere Privatschule Windhoek]]}}), literature (German-Namibian authors include Giselher W. Hoffmann), radio (the [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]] produces radio programs in German), and music (e.g. artist [[EES (rapper)|EES]]).

The small town of [[Kroondal]] in the [[North West (South African province)|North-West]] Province also has a mostly German-speaking population. The South African constitution identifies German as a "commonly used" language and the [[Pan South African Language Board]] is obligated to promote and ensure respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-1-founding-provisions#5 |title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 – Chapter 1: Founding Provisions &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Gov.za |date= |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community is strong enough that several German International schools are supported such as the [[Deutsche Schule Pretoria]].

=== Oceania ===
In [[Australia]], the state of [[South Australia]] experienced a pronounced wave of immigration in the 1840s from Prussia (particularly the [[Silesia]] region). With the prolonged isolation from other German speakers and contact with [[Australian English]], a unique dialect known as [[Barossa German]] has developed and is spoken predominantly in the [[Barossa Valley]] near [[Adelaide]]. Usage of German sharply declined with the advent of [[World War I]], due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment in the population and related government action. It continued to be used as a first language into the twentieth century but now its use is limited to a few older speakers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

German migration to New Zealand in the 19th century was less pronounced than migration from Britain, Ireland, and perhaps even Scandinavia. Despite this there were significant pockets of German-speaking communities which lasted until the first decades of the 20th century. German-speakers settled principally in [[Puhoi]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], and [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]]. At the last census (2013), 36,642 people in New Zealand spoke German, making it the third most spoken European language after English and French and overall the ninth most spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethniccommunities.govt.nz/story/top-25-languages-new-zealand|title=Top 25 Languages in New Zealand  {{!}} ethniccommunities.govt.nz|website=ethniccommunities.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an important German [[German-based creole languages|creole]] being studied and recovered, named {{lang|de|[[Unserdeutsch]]}}, spoken in the former German colony of [[German New Guinea]], across [[Micronesia]] and in northern Australia (i.e. coastal parts of [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]]), by a few elderly people. The risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars.&lt;ref name="Holm, 1989"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcD7p9y3EIcC&amp;dq=Kiautschou+Pidgin+German&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |author=Holm, John A. |title=Pidgins and Creoles: Volume 2, Reference Survey |language=English |edition=1st |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |ISBN=0-521-35940-6 |accessdate=12 June 2016 |page=616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard German ==

{{Main|Standard German}}

[[File:Knowledge of German EU map.svg|thumb|right|Knowledge of Standard German within the states of the European Union.]]

Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a [[written language]]. However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by new vernaculars based on standard German; that is the case in large stretches of [[Northern Germany]] but also in major cities in other parts of the country. It is important to note, however, that the colloquial standard German differs greatly from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.

Standard German differs regionally between German-speaking countries in [[vocabulary]] and some instances of [[pronunciation]] and even [[grammar]] and [[orthography]]. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local [[dialects]]. Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a [[pluricentric language]].

In most regions, the speakers use a continuum from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to circumstances.

=== Varieties of Standard German ===
[[File:Standard varieties of German.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of German.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner, et al.: {{lang|de|Variantenwörterbuch des Deutschen. Die Standardsprache in Österreich, der Schweiz und Deutschland sowie in Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Ostbelgien und Südtirol}}. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In German [[linguistics]], German [[dialect]]s are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[standard German]].
The ''varieties of standard German'' refer to the different local varieties of the [[pluricentric language|pluricentric]] standard German. They differ only slightly in lexicon and phonology. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.
*[[German Standard German]]
*[[Austrian Standard German]]
*[[Swiss Standard German]]

In the German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]], mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language, though about 11% of the Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (aka Standard German) at home, but mainly due to German immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html|title=Die am häufigsten üblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der ständigen Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren - 2012-2014, 2013-2015, 2014-2016 {{!}} Tabelle|last=Statistik|first=Bundesamt für|work=Bundesamt für Statistik|access-date=2018-12-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation has been called a ''medial [[diglossia]]''. [[Swiss Standard German]] is used in the Swiss education system, whereas [[Austrian Standard German]] is officially used in the Austrian education system.

A mixture of dialect and standard does not normally occur in Northern Germany either. The traditional varieties there are Low German, whereas Standard German is a High German "variety". Because their linguistic distance to it is greater, they do not mesh with Standard German the way that High German dialects (such as Bavarian, Swabian, Hessian) can.

== Dialects ==
{{Main|German dialects}}
[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects]]

German is a member of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[language family|family of languages]], which in turn is part of the [[Indo-European language family]]. The German dialects are the traditional local varieties; many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, and they have great differences in [[lexicon]], [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]. If a narrow definition of [[language]] based on [[mutual intelligibility]] is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the [[Ethnologue]]). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014" /&gt;

The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into [[High German languages|High German]] and [[Low German]], also called [[Lower Saxony|Low Saxon]]. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today's Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers. The same phenomenon is found in the eastern Netherlands, as the traditional dialects are not always identified with their Low Saxon/Low German origins, but with Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Nederduits]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.

=== Low German/Low Saxon ===
{{Main|Low German}}
[[File:Map of the Low German Dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] (yellow) and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (orange) dialects]]
[[Middle Low German]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]]. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the [[Luther Bible]] was published. The translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the [[Early New High German]]. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on [[Central German|Central]] and [[Upper German]] varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than [[Low German]] and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, based around northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]] were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.

The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass [[education]] in [[Standard German]] in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. Today, Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable Standard German influx{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as {{lang|de|[[Missingsch]]}}. Sometimes, Low Saxon and [[Low Franconian]] varieties are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift. However, the proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since [[World War II]]. The largest cities in the Low German area are [[Hamburg]] and [[Dortmund]].

=== Low Franconian ===
[[File:Niederfränkisch.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]]]]
The [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] dialects are the dialects that are more closely related to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] than to [[Low German]]. Most of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Belgium]], where they are considered as dialects of Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In Germany, Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the northwest of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], along the [[Lower Rhine]]. The Low Franconian dialects spoken in Germany are referred to as [[Meuse-Rhenish]] or Low Rhenish. In the north of the German Low Franconian language area, North Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as Cleverlands or as dialects of [[South Guelderish]]) are spoken. These dialects are more closely related to Dutch (also North Low Franconian) than the South Low Franconian dialects (also referred to as East [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and, east of the [[Rhine]], [[Bergish dialects|Bergish]]), which are spoken in the south of the German Low Franconian language area. The South Low Franconian dialects are more closely related to Limburgish than to Dutch, and are transitional dialects between Low Franconian and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] ([[Central Franconian dialects|Central Franconian]]). The [[East Bergish]] dialects are the easternmost Low Franconian dialects, and are transitional dialects between North- and South Low Franconian, and [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] (Low German), with most of its features however being North Low Franconian. The largest cities in the German Low Franconian area are [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]].

=== High German ===
{{Main|High German languages}}
[[File:Mitteldeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Central German]] dialects]]
[[File:Fränkisches Sprachgebiet.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] ([[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]], [[Central Franconian dialects|Central-]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]], and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian)]]]]
The High German dialects consist of the [[Central German]], [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]], and [[Upper German language|Upper German]] dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s have several unique features, and are considered as a separate language, [[Yiddish]], written with the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. 

==== Central German ====

The [[Central German]] dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from [[Aachen]] in the west to [[Görlitz]] in the east. They consist of [[Franconian languages|Franconian dialects]] in the west ([[West Central German]]), and non-Franconian dialects in the east ([[East Central German]]). Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.

The Franconian, '''West Central German''' dialects are the [[Central Franconian dialects]] ([[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] and [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]]), and the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] ([[Hessian dialects|Hessian]] and [[Palatine German language|Palatine]]). These dialects are considered as
* German in Germany and Belgium
* [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in Luxembourg
* [[Lorraine Franconian]] (spoken in [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]]) and as a Rhine Franconian variant of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] (spoken in [[Alsace bossue]] only) in France
* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] or [[Kerkrade dialect]] in the Netherlands.
Luxembourgish as well as the [[Transylvanian Saxon dialect]] spoken in [[Transylvania]] are based on Moselle Franconian dialects. The largest cities in the Franconian Central German area are [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].

Further east, the non-Franconian, '''East Central German''' dialects are spoken ([[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]], [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]], [[Erzgebirgisch|Ore Mountainian]], and [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects|Lusatian-New Markish]], and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of [[Silesia]] also [[Silesian German|Silesian]], and in then German southern [[East Prussia]] also [[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]]). The largest cities in the East Central German area are [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]].

==== High Franconian ====

The [[High Franconian German|High Franconian dialects]] are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. They consist of the [[East Franconian German|East-]] and [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects.

The East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are spoken in the region of [[Franconia]] and in the central parts of [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Vogtland]]. Franconia consists of the [[Bavaria]]n districts of [[Upper Franconia|Upper-]], [[Middle Franconia|Middle-]], and [[Lower Franconia]], the region of [[South Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]), and the eastern parts of the region of [[Heilbronn-Franken]] ([[Tauber Franconia]] and Hohenlohe) in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. The largest cities in the East Franconian area are [[Nuremberg]] and [[Würzburg]].

South Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-Württemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of [[Alsace]] in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-Württemberg, they are considered as dialects of [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace (most Alsatian dialects are however [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]]). The largest cities in the South Franconian area are [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Heilbronn]].

==== Upper German ====
[[File:Oberdeutsche Mundarten.png|thumb|upright=0.81|The [[Upper German]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] (transitional between Central- and Upper German) dialects]]
The [[Upper German]] dialects are the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] in the west, and the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]] in the east.

===== Alemannic =====
Alemannic dialects are spoken in [[Switzerland]] ([[High Alemannic German|High Alemannic]] in the densely populated [[Swiss Plateau]], in the south also [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]], and [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] in [[Basel]]), Baden-Württemberg ([[Swabian German|Swabian]] and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Bavarian Swabia]] (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), [[Vorarlberg]] (Low-, High-, and Highest Alemannic), [[Alsace]] (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), [[Liechtenstein]] (High- and Highest Alemannic), and in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] [[Reutte District|district of Reutte]] (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered as [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] in Alsace. The largest cities in the Alemannic area are [[Stuttgart]] and [[Zürich]].

===== Bavarian =====
Bavarian dialects are spoken in [[Austria]] ([[Vienna]], [[Lower Austria|Lower-]] and [[Upper Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Burgenland]], and in most parts of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]), [[Bavaria]] ([[Upper Bavaria|Upper-]] and [[Lower Bavaria]] as well as [[Upper Palatinate]]), [[South Tyrol]], southwesternmost [[Saxony]] (Southern [[Vogtländisch dialect|Vogtlandian]]), and in the Swiss village of [[Samnaun]]. The largest cities in the Bavarian area are [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].

== Grammar ==
{{Main|German grammar}}

German is a [[fusional language]] with a moderate degree of [[inflection]], with three [[grammatical gender]]s; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.

=== Noun inflection ===
[[File:DE-def-art-declensions-en.svg|thumb|Declension of the German definite articles (all equivalent to English "the").]]
{{further information|Grammatical gender in German}}
[[German nouns]] inflect by case, gender and number:
* four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]].
* three [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ung}} (-ing), {{lang|de|-schaft}} (-ship), {{lang|de|-keit}} or {{lang|de|heit}} (-hood, -ness) are feminine, and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-chen}} or {{lang|de|-lein}} ([[diminutive]] forms) are neuter and nouns ending in {{lang|de|-ismus}} ([[-ism]]) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken; and some endings are not restricted to one gender, e.g. {{lang|de|-er}} ([[agent noun|-er]]), e.g. {{lang|de|Feier}} (feminine), celebration, party, {{lang|de|Arbeiter}} (masculine), labourer, and {{lang|de|Gewitter}} (neuter), thunderstorm.
* two numbers: singular and plural.

This degree of inflection is considerably less than in [[Old High German]] and other old [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, [[Old English]], modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] or [[Russian language|Russian]]. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive (only in archaic use in the dative), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Stevenson|first2=Patrick|title=Variation in German|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-35704-7|pages=160-163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dative noun ending is considered archaic or at least old-fashioned in almost all contexts and is almost always dropped even in writing, except in proverbs and other petrified forms. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: {{lang|de|-s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e}}.

In German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised to make it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence ({{lang|de|Am Freitag ging ich einkaufen.}}&amp;nbsp;– "On Friday I went shopping."; {{lang|de|Eines Tages kreuzte er endlich auf.}}&amp;nbsp;– "One day he finally showed up.") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related [[Luxembourgish language]] and several insular dialects of the [[North Frisian language]]), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.

Like the other Germanic languages, German forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second,: {{lang|de|Hundehütte}} ("dog hut"; specifically: "dog kennel"). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in "open" with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the "closed" form without spaces, for example: {{lang|de|Baumhaus}} ("tree house"). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also [[English compounds]]). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is {{lang|de|[[Rinderkennzeichnungs- und Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz|Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz]]}}, which, literally translated, is "beef labelling supervision duty assignment law" [from {{lang|de|Rind}} (cattle), {{lang|de|Fleisch}} (meat), {{lang|de|Etikettierung(s)}} (labelling), {{lang|de|Überwachung(s)}} (supervision), {{lang|de|Aufgaben}} (duties), {{lang|de|Übertragung(s)}} (assignment), {{lang|de|Gesetz}} (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward or even satirical.

The inflection of standard German verbs includes:
* two main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] classes: [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.
* three [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second and third.
* two [[grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural.
* three [[grammatical mood|moods]]: [[realis mood|indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (in addition to [[infinitive]])
* two [[voice (grammar)|voices]]: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb ’’to be’’ (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb “to become’’ (werden).
* two [[grammatical tense|tenses]] without auxiliary verbs ([[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs ([[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[pluperfect]], [[future tense|future]] and [[future perfect]]).
* the distinction between [[grammatical aspect]]s is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself conveys secondhand information{{clarify|date=September 2012}}; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.
* the distinction between perfect and [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.
* disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (''{{wiktde|blicken}}'' [to look], ''{{wiktde|erblicken}}'' [to see&amp;nbsp;– unrelated form: {{wiktde|sehen}}]).

==== Verb prefixes ====
The meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix '''{{lang|de|zer-}}''' refers to destruction, as in {{lang|de|'''zer'''reißen}} (to tear apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''brechen}} (to break apart), {{lang|de|'''zer'''schneiden}} (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; '''{{lang|de|ver-}}''' is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in {{lang|de|'''ver'''suchen}} (to try) from {{lang|de|suchen}} (to seek), {{lang|de|'''ver'''nehmen}} (to interrogate) from {{lang|de|nehmen}} (to take), {{lang|de|'''ver'''teilen}} (to distribute) from {{lang|de|teilen}} (to share), {{lang|de|'''ver'''stehen}} (to understand) from {{lang|de|stehen}} (to stand).

Other examples include the following:
{{lang|de|haften}} (to stick), {{lang|de|'''ver'''haften}} (to detain); {{lang|de|kaufen}} (to buy), {{lang|de|'''ver'''kaufen}} (to sell); {{lang|de|hören}} (to hear), {{lang|de|'''auf'''hören}} (to cease); {{lang|de|fahren}} (to drive), {{lang|de|'''er'''fahren}} (to experience).

Many [[German verbs]] have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In [[finite verb]] forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a "resultative particle". For example, {{lang|de|mitgehen}}, meaning "to go along", would be split, giving {{lang|de|Gehen Sie mit?}} (Literal: "Go you with?"; Idiomatic: "Are you going along?").

Indeed, several [[parenthetical referencing|parenthetical]] clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):
: {{lang|de|Er '''kam''' am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem üblichen Ärger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause '''an'''.}}
A selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:
: He "came" on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally at home "on".

=== Word order ===
German word order is generally with the [[V2 word order]] restriction and also with the [[SOV word order]] restriction for main [[clause]]s. For polar questions, exclamations and wishes, the [[finite verb]] always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, the verb occurs at the very end.

German requires for a verbal element (main verb or [[auxiliary verb]]) to appear [[V2 word order|second in the sentence]]. The verb is preceded by the [[topic–comment|topic]] of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are some possibilities:

: {{lang|de|Der alte Mann gab mir gestern das Buch.}} (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)
: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir gestern der alte Mann.}} (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)
: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab der alte Mann mir gestern.}} (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)
: {{lang|de|Das Buch gab mir der alte Mann gestern.}} (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)

: {{lang|de|Gestern gab mir der alte Mann das Buch.}} (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)
: {{lang|de|Mir gab der alte Mann das Buch gestern.}} ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for you, it was another date))

The position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a [[sentence (linguistics)|declarative sentence]] in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.

However, German's flexibile word order allows one to emphasise specific words:

Normal word order:
:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein Büro.}}
:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.

Object in front:
:: {{lang|de|Sein Büro betrat der Direktor gestern um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}
:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand.
: The object {{lang|de|Sein Büro}} (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.

Adverb of time in front:
:: {{lang|de|Gestern betrat der Direktor um 10 Uhr mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein Büro. (aber heute ohne Schirm)}}
:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o'clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)

Both time expressions in front:
:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor mit einem Schirm in der Hand sein Büro}}.
:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.
: The full-time specification {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr}} is highlighted.

Another possibility:
:: {{lang|de|Gestern um 10 Uhr betrat der Direktor sein Büro mit einem Schirm in der Hand}}.
:: Yesterday at 10 o'clock the manager entered his office with an umbrella in his hand.
: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.

Swapped adverbs:
:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat mit einem Schirm in der Hand gestern um 10 Uhr sein Büro.}}
:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o'clock his office.
: The phrase {{lang|de|mit einem Schirm in der Hand}} is highlighted.

Swapped object:
:: {{lang|de|Der Direktor betrat gestern um 10 Uhr sein Büro mit einem Schirm in der Hand.}}
:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o'clock his office with an umbrella in his hand.
: The time specification and the object {{lang|de|sein Büro}} (his office) are lightly accentuated.

The flexible word order also allows one to use language "tools" (such as [[poetic meter]] and [[figures of speech]]) more freely.

==== Auxiliary verbs ====
When an [[auxiliary verb]] is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect tense]]. Many word orders are still possible:

:{{lang|de|Der alte Mann hat mir heute das Buch gegeben.}} (The old man has me today the book given.)
:{{lang|de|Das Buch hat der alte Mann mir heute gegeben.}} ('''''The book''''' has the old man me today given.)
:{{lang|de|Heute hat der alte Mann mir das Buch gegeben.}} ('''''Today''''' has the old man me the book given.)

The main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The [[auxiliary verb]] is still in second position.

:{{lang|de|Gegeben hat mir der alte Mann das Buch heute.}} ('''''Given''''' has me the old man the book ''''today''''.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as 'today'.

==== Modal verbs ====
Sentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence "Should he go home?" would be rearranged in German to say "Should he (to) home go?" ({{lang|de|Soll er nach Hause gehen?}}). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: "What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?"

==== Multiple infinitives ====
German subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end. Given that auxiliaries encode [[future]], [[passive voice|passive]], [[modality (semiotics)|modality]], and the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle in {{lang|de|ge-}} is often replaced by the infinitive.

: ''{{lang|de|Man nimmt an, dass der Deserteur wohl erschossen}}&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; {{lang|de|worden}}&lt;sub&gt;psv&lt;/sub&gt; {{lang|de|sein}}&lt;sub&gt;perf&lt;/sub&gt; {{lang|de|soll}}&lt;sub&gt;mod&lt;/sub&gt;''
: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.
: ("It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot")

:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschlüssel hatte machen lassen}}
:: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let

:: {{lang|de|Er wusste nicht, dass der Agent einen Nachschlüssel machen lassen hatte}}
:: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had
: ("He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made")

The order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the latter version is unusual.

== Vocabulary ==
[[File:Duden 25Auflage.JPG|upright|thumb|Volume 1–"The Spelling Dictionary"–of the 25 edition of the ''[[Duden]]'' dictionary.]]
[[File:OeWB 42Aufl.jpg|upright|thumb|42nd edition of the {{lang|de|[[Österreichisches Wörterbuch]]}} ("Austrian Dictionary").]]

Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the European language family.{{citation needed|reason=This was cited in the lead to a source that said nothing of the sort. Also, 'derives vocabulary from the Germanic branch' is problematic, as technically English is a member of is branch (so the 'however' in the following sentence makes no sense). Assuming what is meant is that the majority of agerman words are descended from older German words and German has historically had a relatively small number of foreign loanwords, this is probably correct, but it still needs a source.|date=July 2017}} However, there is a significant amount of loanwords from other languages, in particular from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], French&lt;ref&gt;some of which might be reborrowings from Germanic [[Frankish language|Frankish]]&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently English.&lt;ref&gt;This phenomenon is known as {{lang|de|[[Denglisch]]}} in German or as [[Germish]] or Denglish in English.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]] estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Pörksen, German Academy for Language and Literature’s Jahrbuch [Yearbook] 2007 (Wallstein Verlag, Göttingen 2008, pp. 121–130)&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the [[Roman Empire]] and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. {{lang|de|Pforte}}, {{lang|de|Tafel}}, {{lang|de|Mauer}}, {{lang|de|Käse}}, {{lang|de|Köln}} from Latin {{lang|la|porta}}, {{lang|la|tabula}}, {{lang|la|murus}}, {{lang|la|caseus}}, {{lang|la|Colonia}}). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianization, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during [[Renaissance humanism]]. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance, and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.

At the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Thus, [[Notker Labeo]] was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000. The tradition of loan translation was revitalized in the 18th century, with linguists like [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], who introduced close to 300 words that are still used in modern German. Even today, there are movements that try to promote the {{lang|de|[[Ersatz]]}} (substitution) of foreign words deemed unnecessary with German alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verein Deutsche Sprache e.V. |url=http://vds-ev.de/anglizismenindex |title=Verein Deutsche Sprache e.V. – Der Anglizismen-Index |publisher=Vds-ev.de |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated and as well democratise public life.

As in English, there are many pairs of [[synonym]]s due to the enrichment of the Germanic vocabulary with [[loanword]]s from Latin and Latinized Greek. These words often have different connotations from their Germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly.

* {{lang|de|Historie, historisch}}&amp;nbsp;– "history, historical", ({{lang|de|Geschichte, geschichtlich}})
* {{lang|de|Humanität, human}}&amp;nbsp;– "humaneness, humane", ({{lang|de|Menschlichkeit, menschlich}})&lt;ref&gt;Note that {{lang|de|menschlich}}, and occasionally {{lang|de|human}}, may also mean "human, pertaining to humans," whereas {{lang|de|Menschlichkeit}} and {{lang|de|Humanität}} never mean "humanity, human race," which translates to {{lang|de|Menschheit}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|de|Millennium}}&amp;nbsp;– "millennium", ({{lang|de|Jahrtausend}})
* {{lang|de|Perzeption}}&amp;nbsp;– "perception", ({{lang|de|Wahrnehmung}})
* {{lang|de|Vokabular}}&amp;nbsp;– "vocabulary", ({{lang|de|Wortschatz}})

The size of the vocabulary of German is difficult to estimate. The {{lang|de|[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]}} (''The German Dictionary'') initiated by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] already contained over 330,000 headwords in its first edition. The modern German scientific vocabulary is estimated at nine million words and word groups (based on the analysis of 35 million sentences of a [[Text corpus|corpus]] in Leipzig, which as of July 2003 included 500 million words in total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wortschatz.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/html/inhalt_next.html |title=Ein Hinweis in eigener Sache |publisher=Wortschatz.informatik.uni-leipzig.de |date=7 January 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064508/http://wortschatz.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/html/inhalt_next.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Duden]] is the ''de facto'' official [[dictionary]] of the German language, first published by [[Konrad Duden]] in 1880. The Duden is updated regularly, with new editions appearing every four or five years. {{As of|August 2017}}, it is in its 27th edition and in 12 volumes, each covering different aspects such as [[loanword]]s, [[etymology]], [[pronunciation]], [[synonyms]], and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;The first of these volumes, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Rechtschreibung}} (German Orthography), has long been the [[Usage dictionary|prescriptive]] source for the spelling of German. The ''Duden'' has become the bible of the German language, being the definitive set of rules regarding grammar, spelling and usage of German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerhard Weiss |title=Up-to-Date and with a Past: The "Duden" and Its History |date=1995 |journal=Die Unterrichtspraxis / Teaching German |volume=6 |issue= 1: The Publisher as Teacher |doi=10.2307/3531328 |jstor=3531328 |publisher=Wiley |pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|de|[[Österreichisches Wörterbuch]]}} ("Austrian Dictionary"), abbreviated {{lang|de|[[ÖWB]]}}, is the official [[dictionary]] of the German language in the [[Republic of Austria]]. It is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]] ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur|links=no}}). It is the Austrian counterpart to the German ''[[Duden]]'' and contains a number of terms unique to [[Austrian German]] or more frequently used or differently pronounced there.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Zur Definition und sprachwissenschaftlichen Abgrenzung insbesondere}}: Rudolf Muhr, Richard Schrodt, Peter Wiesinger (Hrsg.): [http://www-oedt.kfunigraz.ac.at/OEDTBIB/120-1995-OEDTSBd2.pdf ''Österreichisches Deutsch – Linguistische, sozialpsychologische und sprachpolitische Aspekte einer nationalen Variante des Deutschen'' (PDF, 407 Seiten; 1,3&amp;nbsp;MB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514090855/http://www-oedt.kfunigraz.ac.at/OEDTBIB/120-1995-OEDTSBd2.pdf |date=14 May 2014 }}, Verlag Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, Wien 1995.

The most recent edition is the 42nd from 2012. Since the 39th edition from 2001 the orthography of the {{lang|de|ÖWB}} was adjusted to the [[German spelling reform of 1996]]. The dictionary is also officially used in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]].

== Orthography ==
{{Main|German orthography|German braille}}

[[File:1995 Schulschrift 2. Schraegschrift.jpg|right|thumb|[[German alphabet]], one of Austria's elementary school handwriting programs]]
[[File:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift.png|thumb|[[German alphabet]], elementary school handwriting program in some West German states]]

German is written in the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]], namely ''ä'', ''ö'' and ''ü'', as well as the eszett or {{lang|de|[[scharfes s]]}} (sharp s): ''[[ß]]''. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, ''ss'' is used instead of ''ß''. Since ''ß'' can never occur at the beginning of a word, it has no traditional [[Capital_ẞ|uppercase form]].

Written texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] and certain [[German orthography|orthographical]] features&amp;nbsp;– German is the only major language that capitalizes all nouns, a relic of a widespread practice in Northern Europe in the early modern era (including English for a while, in the 1700s)&amp;nbsp;– and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. The longest German word that has been published is {{lang|de|[[Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft]]}} made of 79 characters. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (In contrast, although English can also string nouns together, it usually separates the nouns with spaces. For example, "toilet bowl cleaner".)

=== Present ===
Before the [[German orthography reform of 1996]], ''ß'' replaced ''ss'' after [[vowel length|long vowels]] and [[diphthong]]s and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings. In reformed spelling, ''ß'' replaces ''ss'' only after long vowels and diphthongs.

Since there is no traditional capital form of ''ß'', it was replaced by ''SS'' when capitalization was required. For example, {{lang|de|Maßband}} (tape measure) became {{lang|de|MASSBAND}} in capitals. An exception was the use of ß in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case ''ß'' was maintained (so, "{{lang|de|KREßLEIN}}" instead of "{{lang|de|KRESSLEIN}}"). [[Capital ß]] (ẞ) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1033265/germanys-century-long-debate-over-a-missing-letter-in-its-alphabet|title=Germany has ended a century-long debate over a missing letter in its alphabet|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|language=English|accessdate=5 December 2017|quote=According to the council’s 2017 spelling manual: When writing the uppercase [of ß], write SS. It’s also possible to use the uppercase ẞ. Example: Straße — STRASSE — STRAẞE.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Umlaut vowels (ä, ö, ü) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner ß can be transcribed as ss. Some [[operating systems]] use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in [[Microsoft Windows]] this is done using [[Alt codes]]. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are a makeshift, not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. ''Raesfeld'' {{IPA-de|ˈraːsfɛlt|}}, ''Coesfeld'' {{IPA|[ˈkoːsfɛlt]}} and ''Itzehoe'' {{IPA|[ɪtsəˈhoː]}}, but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than [[proper noun]]s.)

}}

There is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a [[telephone directory|telephone book]] {{lang|de|Ärzte}} occurs after {{lang|de|Adressenverlage}} but before {{lang|de|Anlagenbauer}} (because Ä is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary {{lang|de|Ärzte}} comes after {{lang|de|Arzt}}, but in some dictionaries {{lang|de|Ärzte}} and all other words starting with ''Ä'' may occur after all words starting with ''A''. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial ''Sch'' and ''St'' are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after ''S'', but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.

Written German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma ([[quotation mark]]) as in {{lang|de|„Guten Morgen!“}}.

=== Past ===
[[File:Fraktur-ru.jpg|thumb|A Russian dictionary from 1931, showing the "German alphabet"&amp;nbsp;– the 3rd and 4th columns of each half are [[Fraktur]] and [[Kurrent]] respectively, with the footnote explaining [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] used in Fraktur.]]
{{Further information|2nd Orthographic Conference (German)|Antiqua–Fraktur dispute|German orthography reform of 1944}}
Until the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s (mostly in [[Fraktur]], but also in [[Schwabacher]]) and written in corresponding [[penmanship|handwriting]] (for example [[Kurrent]] and [[Sütterlin]]). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or [[sans-serif]] [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for [[Germanic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Reinecke, {{lang|de|Die deutsche Buchstabenschrift: ihre Entstehung und Entwicklung, ihre Zweckmäßigkeit und völkische Bedeutung}}, Leipzig, Hasert, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; (Often, foreign names in a text were printed in an Antiqua typeface even though the rest of the text was in Fraktur.) The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered [[Aryan]], but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]&lt;br /&gt;
The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.&lt;br /&gt;"For general attention, on behalf of the Führer, I make the following announcement:&lt;br /&gt;It is wrong to regard or to describe the so-called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so-called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.&lt;br /&gt;Today the Führer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf Müller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.&lt;br /&gt;The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.&lt;br /&gt;On behalf of the Führer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script".&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that the Nazi régime had banned this script as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Albert |last=Kapr |title=Fraktur: Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften |location=Mainz |publisher=H. Schmidt |year=1993 |page=81 |isbn=3-87439-260-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.

A proper use of the [[long s]], ({{lang|de|langes s}}), [[long s|ſ]], is essential for writing German text in [[Fraktur]] typefaces. Many [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] typefaces include the [[long s]] also. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case "s" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words {{lang|de|Wachſtube}} (guard-house) and {{lang|de|Wachstube}} (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which "s" to use by appropriate hyphenation, ({{lang|de|Wach-ſtube}} vs. {{lang|de|Wachs-tube}}). The long s only appears in [[lower case]].

=== Reform of 1996 ===
{{Main|German orthography reform of 1996}}

The orthography reform of 1996 led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states ({{lang|de|Bundesländer}}) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]] would not accept it. The dispute landed at one point in the highest court, which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule&amp;nbsp;– everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it. After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the coming school year. In 2007, some traditional spellings were finally invalidated, whereas in 2008, on the other hand, many of the old [[comma]] rules were again put in force.

The most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter ''ß'', called {{lang|de|scharfes s}} (''Sharp S'') or {{lang|de|ess-zett}} (pronounced ''ess-tsett''). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:

# After a long vowel or vowel combination,
# Before a ''t'', and
# At the end of a syllable

Thus {{lang|de|Füße}}, {{lang|de|paßt}}, and {{lang|de|daß}}. Currently only the first rule is in effect, thus {{lang|de|Füße}}, {{lang|de|passt}}, and {{lang|de|dass}}. The word {{lang|de|Fuß}} 'foot' has the letter ''ß'' because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an 'ß' is a single letter whereas 'ss' obviously are two letters, so the same distinction applies as for instance between the words {{lang|de|den}} and {{lang|de|denn}}.

== Phonology ==
{{Main|German phonology}}

=== Vowels ===
[[File:De-Faust - Der Tragödie erster Teil-Prolog und Auf dem Theater-wikisource.ogg|thumb|Spoken German in [[Goethe's Faust]]]]

In German, vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) are either ''short'' or ''long'', as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! !! A !! Ä !! E !! I !! O !! Ö !! U !! Ü
|-
! short
| {{IPA|/a/}} || {{IPA|/ɛ/}} || {{IPA|/ɛ/, /ə/}} || {{IPA|/ɪ/}} || {{IPA|/ɔ/}} || {{IPA|/œ/}} || {{IPA|/ʊ/}} || {{IPA|/ʏ/}}
|-
! long
| {{IPA|/aː/}} || {{IPA|/ɛː/, /eː/}} || {{IPA|/eː/}} || {{IPA|/iː/}} || {{IPA|/oː/}} || {{IPA|/øː/}} || {{IPA|/uː/}} || {{IPA|/yː/}}
|}
Short {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in stressed syllables (including [[secondary stress]]), but as {{IPA|[ə]}} in unstressed syllables. Note that stressed short {{IPA|/ɛ/}} can be spelled either with ''e'' or with ''ä'' (for instance, {{lang|de|hätte}} "would have" and {{lang|de|Kette}} "chain" rhyme). In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are close. The one exception is the open {{IPA|/ɛː/}} sound of long ''Ä''; in some varieties of standard German, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} have merged into {{IPA|[eː]}}, removing this anomaly. In that case, pairs like {{lang|de|Bären/Beeren}} 'bears/berries' or {{lang|de|Ähre/Ehre}} 'spike (of wheat)/honour' become homophonous (see: [[Captain Bluebear]]).

In many varieties of standard German, an unstressed {{IPA|/ɛr/}} is not pronounced {{IPA|[ər]}}, but vocalised to {{IPA|[ɐ]}}.

Whether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:
* If a vowel (other than ''i'') is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. {{lang|de|Hof}} {{IPA|[hoːf]}}).
* If a vowel is followed by ''h'' or if an ''i'' is followed by an ''e'', it is long.
* If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ''ff'', ''ss'' or ''tt''), ''ck'', ''tz'' or a [[consonant cluster]] (e.g. ''st'' or ''nd''), it is nearly always short (e.g. {{lang|de|hoffen}} {{IPA|[ˈhɔfən]}}). Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preceding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled, in other words this is not a [[feeding order]] of [[gemination]] and then [[vowel shortening]].
Both of these rules have exceptions (e.g. {{lang|de|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} "has" is short despite the first rule; {{lang|de|Mond}} {{IPA|[moːnt]}}, "[[moon]]" is long despite the second rule). For an ''i'' that is neither in the combination ''ie'' (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule. In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany ([[Hessen]]), the ''o'' in the [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper name]] "Hoffmann" is pronounced long, whereas most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the ''e'' in the geographical name "[[Mecklenburg]]" for people in that region. The word {{lang|de|Städte}} "cities", is pronounced with a short vowel {{IPA|[ˈʃtɛtə]}} by some ([[Jan Hofer]], [[Das Erste|ARD Television]]) and with a long vowel {{IPA|[ˈʃtɛːtə]}} by others ([[Marietta Slomka]], [[ZDF]] Television). Finally, a vowel followed by ''ch'' can be short ({{lang|de|Fach}} {{IPA|[fax]}} "compartment", {{lang|de|Küche}} {{IPA|[ˈkʏçə]}} "kitchen") or long ({{lang|de|Suche}} {{IPA|[ˈzuːxə]}} "search", {{lang|de|Bücher}} {{IPA|[ˈbyːçɐ]}} "books") almost at random. Thus, {{lang|de|Lache}} is homographous between {{IPA|[laːxə]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} "puddle" and {{IPA|[laxə]}} {{lang|de|Lache}} "manner of laughing" (colloquial) or {{lang|de|lache!}} "laugh!" (imperative).

German vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, äu, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:
{| class="wikitable"
! spelling
| ai, ei, ay, ey || au || äu, eu
|-
! pronunciation
| {{IPA|/aɪ̯/}} || {{IPA|/aʊ̯/}} || {{IPA|/ɔʏ̯/}}
|}
Additionally, the digraph ''ie'' generally represents the phoneme {{IPA|/iː/}}, which is not a diphthong. In many varieties, an {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable is vocalised. However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised {{IPA|/r/}} is not a phonemic diphthong: {{lang|de|Bär}} {{IPA|[bɛːɐ̯]}} "bear", {{lang|de|er}} {{IPA|[eːɐ̯]}} "he", {{lang|de|wir}} {{IPA|[viːɐ̯]}} "we", {{lang|de|Tor}} {{IPA|[toːɐ̯]}} "gate", {{lang|de|kurz}} {{IPA|[kʊɐ̯ts]}} "short", {{lang|de|Wörter}} {{IPA|[vœɐ̯tɐ]}} "words".

In most varieties of standard German, syllables that begin with a vowel are preceded by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}.

=== Consonants ===
With approximately 25 phonemes, the German consonant system exhibits an average number of consonants in comparison with other languages. One of the more noteworthy ones is the unusual [[affricate]] {{IPA|/p͡f/}}. The consonant inventory of the standard language is shown below.

* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;{{IPA|/x/}} has two allophones, {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[ç]}}, after back and front vowels, respectively.
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{IPA|/r/}} has three allophones in free variation: {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[ʀ]}}. In the [[syllable coda]], the allophone {{IPA|[ɐ]}} is found in many varieties.
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] except when preceded by a [[sibilant]], exactly as in English.
* &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;{{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} occur only in words of foreign (usually English or French) origin.
* Where a stressed syllable has an initial vowel, it is preceded by {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. As its presence is predictable from context, {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is not considered a phoneme.

==== Consonant spellings ====
* '''c''' standing by itself is not a German letter. In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[t͡s]}} (before ä, äu, e, i, ö, ü, y) or {{IPA|[k]}} (before a, o, u, and consonants). The combination '''ck''' is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.
* '''ch''' occurs often and is pronounced either {{IPA|[ç]}} (after ä, ai, äu, e, ei, eu, i, ö, ü and consonants; in the diminutive suffix {{lang|de|-chen}}; and at the beginning of a word), {{IPA|[x]}} (after a, au, o, u), or {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginning of a word before a, o, u and consonants. '''Ch''' never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word. In borrowed words with initial Ch before front vowels ({{lang|de|Chemie}} "chemistry" etc.), {{IPA|[ç]}} is considered standard. However, Upper Germans and Franconians (in the geographical sense) replace it with {{IPA|[k]}}, as German as a whole does before darker vowels and consonants such as in {{lang|de|Charakter}}, {{lang|de|Christentum}}. Middle Germans (except Franconians) will borrow a {{IPA|[ʃ]}} from the French model. Both agree in considering each other's variant,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} and Upper Germans also the standard in {{IPA|[ç]}}, as particularly awkward and unusual.
* '''dsch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Dschungel}} {{IPA|/ˈd͡ʒʊŋəl/}} "jungle") but appears in a few [[loanwords]] only.
* '''f''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} as in "''f''ather".
* '''h''' is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} as in "''h''ome" at the beginning of a syllable. After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|Reh}} {{IPA|[ʁeː]}} = [[roe deer]]).
* '''j''' is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}} in Germanic words ({{lang|de|Jahr}} {{IPA|[jaːɐ̯]}}) (like "y" in "year"). In recent loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.
* '''l''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[l]}}, never {{IPA|*[ɫ]}} (the English "[[dark L]]").
* '''q''' only exists in combination with '''u''' and is pronounced {{IPA|[kv]}}. It appears in both Germanic and Latin words ({{lang|de|quer}} {{IPA|[kveːɐ̯]}}; {{lang|de|Qualität}} {{IPA|[kvaliˈtɛːt]}}). But as most words containing q are Latinate, the letter is considerably rarer in German than it is in English.
* '''r''' is usually pronounced in a [[guttural R|guttural]] fashion (a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} or [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}) in front of a vowel or consonant ({{lang|de|Rasen}} {{IPA|[ˈʁaːzən]}}; {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[bʊʁk]}}). In spoken German, however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ({{lang|de|er}} being pronounced rather like {{IPA|[ˈɛɐ̯]}}&amp;nbsp;– {{lang|de|Burg}} {{IPA|[bʊɐ̯k]}}). In some varieties, the '''r''' is pronounced as a "tongue-tip" ''r'' (the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}).
* '''s''' in German is pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} (as in "''z''ebra") if it forms the [[syllable onset]] (e.g. {{lang|de|Sohn}} {{IPA|[zoːn]}}), otherwise {{IPA|[s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|Bus}} {{IPA|[bʊs]}}). In Austria, Switzerland, and Southern Germany, {{IPA|[s]}} occurs at syllable onset as well. A '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} indicates that the preceding vowel is short. '''st''' and '''sp''' at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced {{IPA|[ʃt]}} and {{IPA|[ʃp]}}, respectively.
* '''ß''' (a letter unique to German called {{lang|de|scharfes S}} or {{lang|de|[[ß|Eszett]]}}) was a ligature of a double '''s''' ''and'' of an '''sz''' and is always pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Originating in [[Blackletter]] typeface, it traditionally replaced '''ss''' at the end of a syllable (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muss}} → {{lang|de|ich muß}}; {{lang|de|ich müsste}} → {{lang|de|ich müßte}}); within a word it contrasts with '''ss''' {{IPA|[s]}} in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare {{lang|de|in Maßen}} {{IPA|[ɪn ˈmaːsən]}} "with moderation" and {{lang|de|in Massen}} {{IPA|[ɪn ˈmasən]}} "in loads"). The use of '''ß''' has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for '''ss''' after a short vowel (e.g. {{lang|de|ich muß}} and {{lang|de|ich müßte}} were always pronounced with a short U/Ü); Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mittelschulvorbereitung.ch/index.php?SUBJECT=&amp;actualid=5 |title=Mittelschulvorbereitung Deutsch |publisher=Mittelschulvorbereitung.ch |date= |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''sch''' is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (like "sh" in "shine").
* '''tion''' in Latin loanwords is pronounced {{IPA|[tsi̯oːn]}}.
* '''th''' is found, rarely, in loanwords and is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} if the loanword is from Greek, and usually as in the original if the loanword is from English (though some, mostly older, speakers tend to replace the English th-sound with {{IPA|[s]}}).
* '''v''' is pronounced {{IPA|[f]}} in a limited number of words of Germanic origin, such as {{lang|de|Vater}} {{IPA|[ˈfaːtɐ]}}, {{lang|de|Vogel}} "bird", {{lang|de|von}} "from, of", {{lang|de|vor}} "before, in front of", {{lang|de|voll}} "full" and the prefix {{lang|de|ver-}}. It is also used in loanwords, where it is normally pronounced {{IPA|[v]}}. This pronunciation is common in words like {{lang|de|Vase}}, {{lang|de|Vikar}}, {{lang|de|Viktor}}, {{lang|de|Viper}}, {{lang|de|Ventil}}, {{lang|de|vulgär}}, and English loanwords; however, pronunciation is {{IPA|[f]}} by some people in some in the very south. The only non-German word in which "v" is always pronounced "f" is {{lang|de|Eva}} (Eve).
* '''w''' is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} as in "''v''acation" (e.g. {{lang|de|was}} {{IPA|[vas]}}).
* '''y''' is pronounced as {{IPA|[y]}} when long, and {{IPA|[ʏ]}} when short (as in {{lang|de|Hygiene}} {{IPA|[hyɡi̯ˈeːnə]}} ; {{lang|de|Labyrinth}} {{IPA|[labyˈʁɪnt]}} or {{lang|de|Gymnasium}} {{IPA|/ɡʏmˈnaːzi̯ʊm/}}), except in ''ay'' and ''ey'' which are both pronounced {{IPA|[aɪ̯]}}. It is also often used in loanwords and pronounced like in the original language like in ''Style'' or ''Recycling''.
* '''z''' is always pronounced {{IPA|[t͡s]}} (e.g. {{lang|de|zog}} {{IPA|[t͡soːk]}}), except in loanwords. A '''tz''' indicates that the preceding vowel is short.

==== Consonant shifts ====
{{details|High German consonant shift}}

German does not have any [[dental fricative]]s (as English '''th'''). The '''th''' sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the German consonants see {{harvp|Cercignani|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English '''th''' with '''d''' in German: "Thank" → in German {{lang|de|Dank}}, "this" and "that" → {{lang|de|dies}} and {{lang|de|das}}, "[[thou]]" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) → {{lang|de|du}}, "think" → {{lang|de|denken}}, "thirsty" → {{lang|de|durstig}} and many other examples.

Likewise, the '''gh''' in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an '''f''', or not at all), can often be linked to German '''ch''': "to laugh" → {{lang|de|lachen}}, "through" → {{lang|de|durch}}, "high" → {{lang|de|hoch}}, "naught" → {{lang|de|nichts}}, "light" → {{lang|de|leicht}} or {{lang|de|Licht}}, "sight" → {{lang|de|Sicht}}, "daughter" → {{lang|de|Tochter}}, "neighbour" → {{lang|de|Nachbar}}.

== Literature ==
{{Main|German literature}}

The German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]], with the most notable authors of the period being [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]].
The {{lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}, whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.

Reformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], who was the first to translate the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern "High German" language. Among the most well known poets and authors in German are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]. Thirteen German-speaking people have won the [[Nobel Prize in literature]]: [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], [[Paul von Heyse]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Carl Spitteler]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Nelly Sachs]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich Böll]], [[Elias Canetti]], [[Günter Grass]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Herta Müller]].

== German loanwords in the English language ==
English has taken many [[loanword]]s from German, often without any change of spelling (aside from, often, the elimination of umlauts and not capitalizing nouns):

== Organisations ==
The use and learning of the German language are promoted by a number of organisations.

=== Goethe-Institut ===
{{Main|Goethe-Institut}}

The government-backed {{lang|de|Goethe-Institut}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/enindex.htm |title=Learning German, Experiencing Culture – Goethe-Institut |publisher=Goethe.de |date= |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after the famous German author [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]) aims to enhance the knowledge of German culture and language within Europe and the rest of the world. This is done by holding exhibitions and conferences with German-related themes, and providing training and guidance in the learning and use of the German language. For example, the {{lang|de|Goethe-Institut}} teaches the {{lang|de|Goethe-Zertifikat}} German language qualification.

=== Verein Deutsche Sprache ===
The Dortmund-based {{lang|de|Verein Deutsche Sprache (VDS)}}, which was founded in 1997, supports the German language and is the largest language association of citizens in the world. The VDS has more than thirty-five thousand members in over seventy countries. Its founder, statistics professor Dr. Walter Krämer, has remained chairperson of the association from its beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vds-ev.de |title=Verein Deutsche Sprache e.V. |website=Vds-ev.de|accessdate=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deutsche Welle ===
{{Main|Deutsche Welle}}
[[File:Deutsche Welle Logo.svg|thumb|Deutsche Welle logo]]
The German state broadcaster {{lang|de|Deutsche Welle}} is the equivalent of the British [[BBC World Service]] and provides radio and television broadcasts in German and 30 other languages across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/0,,3325,00.html |title=Who we are |publisher=DW.DE |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its German language services are tailored for German language learners by being spoken at slow speed. {{lang|de|Deutsche Welle}} also provides an {{nowrap|e-learning}} website to learn German.

Known for his sophisticated and elegant style, he has been compared to [[James Joyce]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He often writes about individuals under thirty, adolescent or post adolescent ones who struggle with [[Social alienation|alienation]] from family, society and from themselves. His earlier collection of short stories earned him the title of the "Catholic Writer". But elements of the fantastic also come in his works. In the ''2006 Graphic/Fiction Awards'', the main local sponsor of the contest, specialty book shop ''Fully Booked'', acknowledged Brillantes as one of the godfathers of fantastic literature in English by naming the first category the ''Gregorio C. Brillantes Prize for Prose''.

Brillantes is a native of [[Camiling]], [[Tarlac]]. He obtained his Litt. B. [[Academic degree|degree]] in the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. He has edited ''Sunburst'', ''The Manila Review'', ''Focus'', ''Asia-Philippines Leader'' and the ''Philippines Free Press''.

He also has published collections of [[essays]]: ''Looking for Rizal in Madrid'', ''Chronicles of Interesting Times'', and ''The Cardinal's Sins, the General's Cross, the Martyr's Testimony and other Affirmations''.

He acted as one of the judges of the Philippine Graphic Novel Awards in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/expressions/view/20071120-102130/Marvelous_maiden_voyage "Marvelous maiden voyage" - Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovely

'''Günther Schwab''' (7 October 1904 in [[Prague]] &amp;ndash; 12 April 2006 in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]) was an Austrian writer and [[author]], and member of the [[Nazi]] party.&lt;ref name=NN&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=okm3UoSBUvoC&amp;dq "Nature and nationalism: right-wing ecology and the politics of identity in contemporary Germany"], Jonathan Olsen. Palgrave Macmillan, 1999. {{ISBN|0-312-22071-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-22071-6}}. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[World Union for Protection of Life]].

==Early life==
After the First World War his family, who were merchants, moved to [[Vienna]], Austria, where Schwab discovered his love for nature. In Vienna, he joined [[NSDAP]] as well as [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) in which he was a lieutenant from 1930.

As an editor of ''Lebenschutz'' (Protection of Life), he has been repeatedly accused of racism{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

Through Prof. Dr. Günther Schlesinger, an Austrian [[Conservation (ethic)|Nature Protection]] Referent, Günther Schwab got more involved with nature protection. He studied in those years, as expected of the family, at the commercial academy, but due to his love for nature he soon became a forest ranger.

==Environment and literature==
His first book ''Abenteuer am Fluss'' (Adventures At The River), published by Franz-Eher-Verlag, the Central publishing house of the Nazi party, was proof of his love. as were all his following books ''Der Wind über den Feldern'' (The wind across the fields), ''Kamerad mit dem haarigen Gesicht'' (A story about a dog), ''Land voller Grande'' (Land of grace), ''Das Glück am Rand'' (Fortune at the edge).

In 1951, he gave up his profession, moved to Salzburg and dedicated his life to writing. He realised that the new upcoming 1950s affluent society threatened to destroy all that he loved: the countryside with all its inhabitants, the solitude of the wilderness, the wildlife as he knew it up to then. Günther Schwab proved to be almost clairvoyant when, at the age of 50, he held a lecture with the title "The catastrophe has started already", at the Audi Max in Vienna in 1954.

===The Dance with the Devil===
To explain his fears more plainly and understandably for the man in the street, Günther Schwab wrote his book ''Der Tanz mit dem Teufel'' (The dance with the devil). It reads like a subtle, interesting detective story, which he finished in 1958. The theme was mankind's industrial sins causing environmental damage in condemning many [[United States|Americans]] as degenerates. The book prophesied that improperly-managed population sizes from other continents would avalanche Europe. This was an effort to renew [[Social Darwinism]] and [[eugenics]] theories.&lt;ref name=NN /&gt; His hope was to awaken the people to this view. Strangely enough, although that book was on the market, there were some bookshops which denied the existence of this book. The book was translated into other languages; the English version was published in 1963.

==Film==
* ''[[The Forester of the Silver Wood]]'' (1954)

==Society==
Schwab was a member of the [[Nazi party]] and during his life would serve on the advisory panel of the Society for Biological Anthropology, Eugenics, and Behavior Research.&lt;ref name=NN /&gt;

==Awards==
Günther Schwab reached 100 years of age in 2004 when he received the Cup of Honour of Salzburg and the [[Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=1636 |trans-title=| format = pdf | accessdate = 29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 12 April 2006.

A '''heaving line knot''' is a family of knots which are used for adding weight to the end of a rope, to make the rope easier to throw. In nautical use, a heaving line knot is often tied to the end of a messenger line, which is then used for pulling a larger rope, such as a [[hawser]]. There are several distinct knots which all share the common name, ''heaving line knot''.&lt;ref name="ABOK"/&gt;  The [[monkey fist]] is a well-known heaving line knot.

== Tying ==
Make a [[Bight (knot)|bight]] in the tail end of the rope. Wrap the working end around the tail toward the bight end, with multiple turns. Complete the knot by passing the tail end through the bight loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">'''Jean Baptiste Lolo''' (born 1798, date of death unknown), also known as '''St. Paul''' or '''Chief St. Paul''', or '''Chief Lolo''', was an employee and interpreter with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in pre-Confederation [[British Columbia]], Canada.  First serving in the region at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]] in the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia fur district]], he acquired the nickname there of [[St. Paul]] because of his affection for that saint.  He was the right-hand man of [[John Tod (fur trader)|John Tod]] and followed him to [[Fort Kamloops]], where Tod was [[Chief Trader]] from 1841 to 1843, and remained in that region for the rest of his life.  He acquired such great respect among the local [[Secwepemc]] (Shuswap) people as to become regarded as a [[Tribal chief|chief]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His face was a very fine one, although sickness and pain had worn it away terribly. His eyes were black, piercing and restless; his cheekbones high, and the lips, naturally thin and close, had that white, compressed look which tells so surely of constant suffering."

When Mayne remarked that Lolo, in his decayed health, must find it hard to rule over his people,

"...he heard me with a grim smile, and for answer turned back his pillow, where a loaded gun and a naked sword lay ready to his hand."

The invalid Lolo showed, in fact, unexpected reserves of strength. Rising from his bed, he mounted his horse, and accompanied Mayne on a ride to see the view from the top of a neighbouring mountain, which was forthwith named Mt. St. Paul in honour of the old chief. Moreover, Lolo insisted on accompanying Mayne on the next lap of his journey, that from Kamloops to Pavilion."&lt;ref&gt;''British Columbia Place Names'', Helen and GPV Akrigg, quoting ''Reminiscences of Four Years in British Columbia and Vancouver Island'', Lieut. [[Richard Charles Mayne]], [[Royal Navy|RN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Lolo's daughters, Sophia, wed John Tod in 1843 in a "country marriage"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JsA-lo15X7QC&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage ''John Tod, Rebel in the Ranks'', Robert C. Belyk, 1995, Page 142]&lt;/ref&gt;  Though many other such marriages in HBC ranks were later abandoned in favour of "proper" wives, Tod kept true to Sophie and remarried her officially in a legal ceremony.

==Legacy==
[[Mount Lolo]], northeast of Kamloops near [[Heffley Lake]], and Lolo Lake and Lolo Creek in the same vicinity, were named for him.  "Paul" and "St. Paul" placenames in the same region (e.g. [[Paul Lake Provincial Park]]) are also believed to be derived from his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|10125|Lolo, Mount}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|29597|Lolo Lake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|34858|Lolo Creek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another [[Mount Lolo (Quadra Island)|Mount Lolo]] on [[Quadra Island]] is also believed to be named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|21184|Lolo, Mount}} citing the Akriggs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I think the Akriggs may be wrong about that...--&gt;

==Career==
Karanth began writing in 1924 and soon published his first book, ''Rashtrageetha Sudhakara'', a collection of poems. His first novel was ''Vichitrakoota''. Subsequent works like ''Nirbhagya Janma'' ("Unfortunate Birth") and ''Sooleya Samsara'' ("Family of a Prostitute") mirrored the pathetic conditions of the poor. His magnum opus ''Devaddhootaru'', a satire on contemporary India, was published in 1928.&lt;ref name="pampa"/&gt;

Karanth was an intellectual and environmentalist who made notable contribution to the art and culture of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=bennur/&gt; He is considered one of the most influential novelists in the Kannada language. His novels ''Marali Mannige'', ''Bettada Jeeva'', ''Alida Mele'', ''Mookajjiya Kanasugalu'', ''Mai Managala Suliyalli'', ''Ade OOru Ade Mara'', ''Shaneeshwarana Neralinalli'', ''Kudiyara Koosu'', ''Svapnada Hole'', ''Sarsammana Samadhi'', and ''Chomana Dudi'' are widely read and have received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name=bennur/&gt; He wrote two books on Karnataka's ancient stage dance-drama ''[[Yakshagana]]'' (1957 and 1975).

He was involved in experiments in the technique of printing for some years in the 1930s and 1940s and printed his own novels, but incurred financial losses. He was also a painter and was deeply concerned with the issue of nuclear energy and its impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-walk-through-the-life-of-karanth/article4454393.ece A walk through the life of Karanth – KARNATAKA].

The latter belonged to the [[Bunt (community)|Bunt community]] and was the daughter of a businessman, K. D. Alva. They married on 6 May 1936. The couple subsequently attracted ridicule from people in the region over their [[inter-caste marriage]]; Karanth belonged to an orthodox Brahmin community. Leela, who had her early education in [[Marathi language]], re-learnt Kannada after marriage and translated the Marathi novel ''Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto'' into Kannada. As a dancer, she participated in Karanth's operas. The Karanths had four children together: sons, Harsha and [[K. Ullas Karanth|Ullas]], a conservationist; and daughters, Malavika and Kshama. His mother's influence on Karanth was described by Ullas as: "It was our mother who shaped Karanth's life... She was the backbone of all his endeavours. She was also quite well-read, and she dedicated all of her talents to her husband. She took care of all household responsibilities." The family lived in the [[Puttur, Karnataka|Puttur]] town of [[Dakshina Kannada]], a district in the South Karnataka region, before moving to [[Saligrama, Udupi|Saligrama]], a town {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Karanth's birthplace Kota, in 1974. A few years prior to this, their eldest son Harsha died leaving Leela suffer from "depression and hallucinations". She died in September 1986. It was also the year that Karanth's final novel was published.&lt;ref name="SER"/&gt;

Karanth was admitted to [[Kasturba Medical College, Manipal|Kasturba Medical College]] in [[Manipal]] on 2 December 1997 to be treated for [[viral fever]]. He suffered from a cardiac [[respiratory arrest]] two days later and slipped into a coma. On 8 December, his [[Kidney failure|kidneys began to fail]] and subsequently developed severe [[acidosis]] and [[Sepsis|septicemia]], following which he was put on [[dialysis]]. Efforts to revive him failed and he died at 11:35 a.m. ([[Indian Standard Time|IST]]) the following day, aged 95.&lt;ref name="pampa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |title=Literary legend Karanth dead |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19971210/34450563.html |accessdate=4 November 2018 |agency=Press Trust of India |publisher=The Indian Express |date=10 December 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030817172929/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19971210/34450563.html |archivedate=17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of Karnataka]] declared a two-day [[mourning]] in the State as a mark of respect.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

A '''log line''' or '''logline''' is a brief (usually one-sentence) summary of a [[television program]], [[film]], or book that states the central conflict of the story, often providing both a synopsis of the story's [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], and an emotional "[[hook (rhetoric)|hook]]" to stimulate interest.  A one-sentence program summary in ''[[TV Guide]]'' is a log line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|2014|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==

Narrative elements often referenced in a logline include the [[setting (narrative)|setting]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], [[inciting incident]], [[Conflict (narrative)| conflict]] and [[goal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graemeshimmin.com/writing-a-logline-for-a-novel/|title=Writing a Logline|publisher=Graeme Shimmin|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Makanji Kuber Makwana''' (1849-1924) was a social leader, social worker and a caste historian, who is noted for writings on the history of the [[Mahyavanshi]] caste.

==Life sketch==
Makanji was born in 1849 at [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmadabad]] in a [[Vankar]] caste. He shifted to [[Bombay]] at the early age of fifteen and later joined [[J.J. School of Art]] and became a painter by profession.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; He opened his own painting shop and amassed a good fortune.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

Makanji was deeply disturbed at the treatment meted out to [[Dalit]] castes like he belonged and tried to establish that Dalits like [[Vankar]]s were actually [[Kshatriya]] caste, which had fallen from grace by writing several researched books starting with ''Mayavat Rajput Prakash'' in 1908 followed by several others. These books written by him helped the cause of their caste to get [[Kshatriya]] status officially as Mahyavanshi by Government of India in 1939, in which other social and political leaders after his death in 1924, like [[Kanhaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|Dr. Kanhaiyalal Munshi]] and Dr. Purshottam Solanki played the leading role.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Takashi Shinoda. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KZNfS7mikMoC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Mayavat+Rajput+Prakash&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qxekTd6zEIm0rAeRq5D8CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mayavat%20Rajput%20Prakash&amp;f=false ''The Other Gujarat'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

Makanji spent most of his wealth for the benefit of community and philanthropic works. He founded "Kabir Ashram" (Hostel) and "Kabir Temple"  named after [[Sant Kabir]] in Bomaby and declared opened for the community on 11 May 1913, which provided free boarding and lodging for community person till he found an employment in Bombay.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

Further, he was also founder of community forum, ''Mayavat Rajput Hitt Vardhak Sabha'' in 1910, to unite the community spread across the erstwhile  [[Bombay State]] and make them aware of his movement to establish the community as [[Rajputs]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

==Books==
Makanji in his writings stressed that the Mahyavanshi were the descendents of the [[Heheya Kingdom|Hattiavanshi]] King [[Kartavirya Arjuna|Arjuna]], arguing that it was because of the slaughter of [[Parashurama|Parsuram]] they were relegated to a lower caste thus linking them with the Mayavat Rajputs, a branch of [[Parmara]] clan of Kshatriyas. There are several books written by him in [[Gujarati language]], as under:&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://mahyavanshifoundation.org/makanji.html Makanji Kuber Makwana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820115746/http://mahyavanshifoundation.org/makanji.html |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''Monoclonal''' cells are a group of cells produced from a single ancestral cell by repeated cellular replication.&lt;ref name="Mosby-monoclonal"/&gt;  Thus they can be said to form a single [[cloning#Cellular cloning|clone]]. The term ''monoclonal'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''monos'', meaning "alone" or "single", and ''klon'', meaning "twig".&lt;ref name="Mosby-monoclonal"&gt;{{Cite book
|chapter=Monoclonal |title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition=8th |date=2009 |publisher=Elsevier
|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/monoclonal
|access-date=June 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of replication can occur ''[[in vivo]]'', or may be stimulated ''[[in vitro]]'' for laboratory manipulations.  The use of the term typically implies that there is some method to distinguish between the cells of the original population from which the single ancestral cell is derived, such as a random genetic alteration, which is inherited by the progeny.

Common usages of this term include:
*[[Monoclonal antibody]]:  A single [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] cell, which by chance includes the appropriate [[V(D)J recombination]] to produce the desired antibody, is cloned to produce a large population of identical cells.  In informal laboratory jargon, the monoclonal antibodies isolated from [[cell culture]] [[Precipitation (chemistry)|supernatant]]s of these hybridoma clones (hybridoma lines) are simply called ''monoclonals''.
*Monoclonal [[neoplasm]] (tumor): A single aberrant cell which has undergone [[carcinogenesis]] reproduces itself into a cancerous mass.
*Monoclonal plasma cell (also called [[plasma cell dyscrasia]]): A single aberrant plasma cell which has undergone carcinogenesis reproduces itself, which in some cases is cancerous.

'''Ngbinda''' is a poorly documented Congolese [[Bantu language]] of uncertain affiliation (though listed as unclassified [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone D|Zone D.30]] by Guthrie). Prior to 1975 it had also been spoken in southern Sudan. 

The Mayeka are a Ngbinda clan, but do to lack of evidence, it is not possible to determine whether Mayeka and Ngbinda should be considered the same language. An ISO proposal to merge the two languages into a single code was rejected due to the lack of linguistic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_detail.asp?id=2014-045&amp;lang=myc|title=ISO 639 code change request documentation|website=www-01.sil.org|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-photo blue''' (or '''non-repro blue''') is a common tool used in the [[graphic design]] and [[Printing|print]] [[industry]].&lt;ref name="Doran2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colleen Doran|title=Manga Pro Superstar Workshop: How to Create and Sell Comics and Graphic Novels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XN9l72svTP8C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=8 November 2007|publisher=IMPACT|isbn=978-1-58180-985-5|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="II2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Freddie E Williams II|title=The DC Comics Guide to Digitally Drawing Comics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUeTbxUjGfwC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=2 January 2013|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8230-9923-8|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Non-photo blue is a particular shade of [[blue]] that cannot be detected by graphic arts camera [[photographic film|film]]. This allows layout editors to write notes to the printer on the print flat (the image that is to be photographed and sent to print) which will not show in the final form. It also allows artists to lay down [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] lines without the need to erase after [[Inker|inking]].
[[File:NonPhotoBluevs.BluePen.jpg|thumb|right|(1) Colour copy of non-photo blue pencil. (2) Colour copy of blue pen. (3) Grayscale copy of non-photo blue pencil. (4) Grayscale copy of blue pen.]]

==Change in function==
More recently, with digital scanning and image manipulation, non-photo blue fulfills its function in a different way. The artist can do their sketch and inking in the traditional manner and scan the page. Most scanners ''will'' detect the light blue lines. However, shifting to [[grayscale|greyscale]] and increasing the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] and [[brightness]] of the scanned image causes the blue to disappear. Another common approach involves replacing the blue [[Channel (digital image)|channel]] with another channel – typically the red channel. The exact processes may differ depending on the scanner, settings and image-editing software, but the concept remains the same.

==Black ink==
The difference between the non-photo blue and [[Indian ink|black ink]] is vast enough that digital image manipulation can separate the two easily. If a black-and-white [[bitmap]] setting is scanned in, the exposure or threshold number can be set high enough to detect the black ink or dark images being scanned, but low enough to leave out the non-photo blue. On a threshold scale of 0–255, this number would be approximately 140. Only with a considerably high threshold setting will the blue be detected; this however may greatly distort black lines and add a lot of [[noise]] and black speckles, making the image potentially almost unrecognizable. Scanning in black-and-white makes it possible for the non-photo blue still to serve its original purpose, as notes and rough sketching lines can be placed throughout the image being scanned and remain undetected by the scan head.

[[Image:Dinneen by Yeats.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Patrick Dinneen by [[John Butler Yeats]].]]
'''Patrick Stephen Dinneen''' ({{lang-ga|Pádraig Ua Duinnín}}; 25 December 1860 – 29 September 1934) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[lexicographer]] and [[historian]], and a leading figure in the [[Gaelic revival]].

Dinneen was born near [[Rathmore, County Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel O'Connell, 29 September 1984, [http://www.irishtextssociety.org/dinneen.htm Father Dinneen, his dictionary and the Gaelic Revival]. Accessed 31 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Shrone and Meentogues National Schools and at [[St. Brendan's, Killarney|St. Brendan's College]] in [[Killarney]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from his grandniece Bridie Dinneen&lt;/ref&gt; He earned second class honours bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[Royal University of Ireland]].  The BA (1885) was in classics and mathematical science, the MA (1889) was in mathematical science. He joined the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1880 and was ordained a priest in 1894, but left the order in 1900 to devote his life to the study of the [[Irish language]] while still remaining a priest. After his ordination, he taught Irish, English, classics, and mathematics in three different Jesuit colleges, including Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, Co. Kildare.

He was a leading figure in the [[Irish Texts Society]], publishing editions of [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'', poems by [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] and [[Piaras Feiritéar]], and other works. He also wrote a novel and a play in Irish, and translated such works as [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' into Irish. His best known work, however, is his Irish-English dictionary, ''Foclóir Gaedhilge agus Béarla'', which was first published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Welch| first=Robert| title=The Concise Oxford Companion to Irish Literature| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1996| isbn=0-19-280080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock and plates of the dictionary were destroyed during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, so Dinneen took the opportunity to expand the dictionary. A much larger second edition, compiled with the assistance of Liam S Gogan, was published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;''Foclóir Gaedilge agus Béarla: an Irish-English dictionary, being a thesaurus of the words, phrases and idioms of the modern Irish language''; compiled and edited by Patrick S. Dinneen. New edition, revised and greatly enlarged. xxx, 1344 p. Dublin: published for the Irish Texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Dinneen's request to the Irish Texts Society to include Gogan's name on the title page was refused.&lt;ref&gt;http://gogan.ie/dinneens-letter.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Gogan continued to work on the collection of words  up to his death in 1979.  This complementary dictionary was published online in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://gogan.ie/credits.php?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Dinneen died in [[Dublin]] at the age of 73 and is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;Location: Plot No: CH 83.5, St Bridget's, CPS Coordinates: 53°22'19.48"N 6°16'44.04"W&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11701">'''Pragma-dialectics''', or '''pragma-dialectical theory''', developed by [[Frans H. van Eemeren]] and [[Rob Grootendorst]] (see 1984; 1992; 2004) at the [[University of Amsterdam]], is an [[argumentation theory]] that is used to analyze and evaluate argumentation in actual practice. Unlike strictly [[logic]]al approaches (which focus on the study of argument as product), or purely communication approaches (which emphasize argument as a process), pragma-dialectics was developed to study the entirety of an argumentation as a discourse activity. Thus, the pragma-dialectical theory views argumentation as a complex [[speech act]] that occurs as part of natural language activities and has specific communicative goals.

==The pragma-dialectical theory==
===Theoretical justification===

In pragma-dialectics, argumentation is viewed as a communicative and interactional discourse phenomenon that is to be studied from a normative as well as a descriptive perspective. The dialectical dimension is inspired by normative insights from “[[critical rationalism]]” and formal dialectics, the pragmatic dimension by descriptive insights from [[speech act theory]], [[Paul Grice|Gricean]] language philosophy and [[discourse analysis]].

To allow for the systematic integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions in the study of argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization is achieved by treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization is achieved by extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization is achieved by capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification is achieved by regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren &amp; Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53).

===The ideal model of a critical discussion===

Based on the meta-theoretical principles described above, the pragma-dialectical theory regards argumentation as ideally being part of a critical discussion (see Van Eemeren &amp; Grootendorst, 1984, p. 17).  The ideal model of a critical discussion treats argumentative discourse as a discussion in which argumentation is directed at the reasonable resolution of a difference of opinion. The ideal model can serve as a heuristic as well as a critical tool: it respectively constitutes an instrument for the argumentation analyst when deciding about the communicative functions of speech acts and provides a standard for argument evaluation (see Van Eemeren &amp; Grootendorst, 1992, p.36).

====Discussion stages====

In this ideal model of a critical discussion, four discussion stages are distinguished that the discussion parties have to go through to resolve their difference of opinion: the confrontation stage, opening stage, argumentation stage and concluding stage (see Van Eemeren &amp; Grootendorst, 1984, pp.85-88; 1992, pp.34-35; 2004, pp.59-62).  In the confrontation stage, the interlocutors establish that they have a difference of opinion. In the opening stage, they decide to resolve this difference of opinion. The interlocutors determine their points of departure: they agree upon the rules of the discussion and establish which propositions they can use in their argumentation. In the argumentation stage, the protagonist defends his/her standpoint by putting forward arguments to counter the antagonist’s objections or doubt. In the concluding stage, the discussion parties evaluate to what extent their initial difference of opinion has been resolved and in whose favor. The model also defines the nature and distribution of the speech acts that play a constructive part in the various stages of the resolution process.

====Rules for a critical discussion====

The ideal model stipulates ten rules that apply to an argumentative discussion. Violations of the discussion rules are said to frustrate the reasonable resolution of the difference of opinion and they are therefore considered as [[fallacies]].

The ten rules (see Van Eemeren, Grootendorst &amp; Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, pp.182-183):

:# ''Freedom rule'' &lt;br /&gt;Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints or from casting doubt on standpoints.
:# ''Burden of proof rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party that advances a standpoint is obliged to defend it if asked by the other party to do so.
:# ''Standpoint rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party’s attack on a standpoint must relate to the standpoint that has indeed been advanced by the other party.
:# ''Relevance rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party may defend a standpoint only by advancing argumentation relating to that standpoint.
:# ''Unexpressed premise rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party may not deny premise that he or she has left implicit or falsely present something as a premise that has been left unexpressed by the other party.
:# ''Starting point rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party may not falsely present a premise as an accepted starting point nor deny a premise representing an accepted starting point.
:# ''Argument scheme rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party may not regard a standpoint as conclusively defended if the defense does not take place by means of an appropriate argumentation scheme that is correctly applied.
:# ''Validity rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party may only use arguments in its argumentation that are logically valid or capable of being made logically valid by making explicit one or more unexpressed premises.
:# ''Closure rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A failed defense of a standpoint must result in the party that put forward the standpoint retracting it and a conclusive defense of the standpoint must result in the other party retracting its doubt about the standpoint.
:# ''Usage rule'' &lt;br /&gt;A party must not use formulations that are insufficiently clear or confusingly ambiguous and a party must interpret the other party’s formulations as carefully and accurately as possible.

===Strategic maneuvering===

Recently, the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation has incorporated insights from [[rhetoric]] into the analysis of argumentative discussion (Van Eemeren &amp; Houtlosser, 2002; 2006). Parties involved in a difference of opinion “maneuver strategically” to simultaneously realize their dialectical and their rhetorical aims. In other words, the parties in an argumentative discussion attempt to be persuasive (have their standpoint accepted) while observing the critical standards for argumentative discourse. In each of the critical discussion stages there is a rhetorical goal that corresponds with the dialectical goal and interlocutors can make use of three analytical aspects to balance effectiveness and reasonableness: making an opportune selection from the topical potential available at the stage concerned, approaching the audience effectively, and carefully exploiting presentational means. These three aspects correspond with some focal points of rhetorical study – topics, audience adaptation and presentational devices – so that insights acquired in rhetoric are brought to bear in explaining how rhetorical and dialectical considerations play a part in the various ways of strategic maneuvering.

==Analyzing and evaluating argumentative discourse==

From a pragma-dialectical perspective, in order to get an overview of those aspects in argumentative discourse that are crucial for resolving a difference of opinion, the following analytical operations are carried out:
:# Determining the points at issue;
:# Recognizing the positions the parties adopt;
:# Identifying the explicit and implicit arguments;
:# Analyzing the argumentation structure.

An analytical overview shows the differences of opinion, the distribution of dialectical roles, the expressed and unexpressed premises that make up the argument, and the argumentation structure (the relationship between a series of arguments presented to defend a standpoint) (see Snoeck Henkemans, 1992). The analytical overview can have critical or heuristic functions.

===Critical function===

Starting from the analytical overview, the evaluation of the quality of the argumentative discourse can be performed. In evaluating the arguments that are put forward in the argumentative discourse, the analyst should (1) check whether the discourse is free from logical and pragmatic inconsistencies, (2) determine whether the propositions put forward are acceptable, (3) evaluate whether the argumentation (can be made) logically valid, (4) check whether the argumentation schemes are appropriately applied, and (5) check for other fallacies.

===Heuristic function===

The concept of the analytical overview can also be used in argument production. Since the analytical overview brings together concisely all the information necessary for evaluating an argumentative discussion, it can be used to check whether the argumentation can stand up to criticism. If weaknesses are found, the argumentation can be adjusted or expanded thus it makes a useful guide for the creation of written or oral argumentation.

==Application of the pragma-dialectical theory==

The pragma-dialectical theory has been applied to understand several different types of argumentative discourse. For example, it has been used to analyze and evaluate legal argumentation, mediation, negotiation, (parliamentary) debate, interpersonal argumentation, political argumentation, health communication and visual argumentation (see, e.g., Van Eemeren (Ed.), 2002).

==Seismic waves (seismicity)==

===General principles of volcano seismology===

* Seismic activity (earthquakes and tremors) always occurs as volcanoes awaken and prepare to erupt and are a very important link to eruptions. Some volcanoes normally have continuing low-level seismic activity, but an increase may signal a greater likelihood of an eruption. The types of earthquakes that occur and where they start and end are also key signs. Volcanic seismicity has three major forms: '''short-period earthquake''', '''long-period earthquake''', and [[harmonic tremor]].
* Short-period earthquakes are like normal fault-generated earthquakes. They are caused by the fracturing of brittle rock as magma forces its way upward. These short-period earthquakes signify the growth of a magma body near the surface and are known as 'A' waves. These type of seismic events are often also referred to as Volcano-Tectonic (or VT) events or earthquakes.
*Long-period earthquakes are believed to indicate increased gas pressure in a volcano's plumbing system. They are similar to the clanging sometimes heard in a house's plumbing system, which is known as "[[water hammer]]". These oscillations are the equivalent of acoustic vibrations in a chamber, in the context of magma chambers within the volcanic dome and are known as  'B' waves. These are also known as [[resonance]] waves and long period resonance events.
*[[Harmonic tremor]]s are often the result of magma pushing against the overlying rock below the surface. They can sometimes be strong enough to be felt as humming or buzzing by people and animals, hence the name.

Patterns of seismicity are complex and often difficult to interpret; however, increasing seismic activity is a good indicator of increasing eruption risk, especially if long-period events become dominant and episodes of harmonic tremor appear.

Using a similar method, researchers can detect volcanic eruptions by monitoring infra-sound—sub-audible sound below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. The IMS Global Infrasound Network, originally set up to verify compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, has 60 stations around the world that work to detect and locate erupting volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ctbto.org/verification-regime/monitoring-technologies-how-they-work/infrasound-monitoring/ Infrasound technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismic case studies===

A relation between long-period events and imminent volcanic eruptions was first observed in the seismic records of the 1985 eruption of [[Nevado del Ruiz]] in Colombia.  The occurrence of long-period events were then used to predict the 1989 eruption of [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]] in Alaska and the 1993 eruption of [[Galeras]] in Colombia.  In December 2000, scientists at the [[National Center for Prevention of Disasters]] in [[Mexico City]] predicted an eruption within two days at [[Popocatépetl]], on the outskirts of Mexico City. Their prediction used research that had been done by [[Bernard Chouet]], a Swiss volcanologist who was working at the [[United States Geological Survey]] and who first observed a relation between long-period events and an imminent eruption.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Chouet (28 March 1996) "Long-period volcano seismicity:  its sources and use in eruption forecasting," ''Nature'', vol. 380, no. 6572, pages 309-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Bernard Chouet regarding his research into long-period events and volcanic eruptions:  {{cite web |url=http://www.esi-topics.com/volcanoes/interviews/BernardChouet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201114920/http://www.esi-topics.com/volcanoes/interviews/BernardChouet.html |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }}  .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. TV program on use of long-period events to predict volcanic eruptions:  "Nova:  Volcano's Deadly Warning":  https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/volcano/  .  See also "Volcano Hell" episode of BBC TV series "Horizon" on same subject:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/volcanohell.shtml  .&lt;/ref&gt; The government evacuated tens of thousands of people; 48 hours later, the volcano erupted as predicted. It was Popocatépetl's largest eruption for a thousand years, yet no one was hurt.

===Iceberg tremors===

Similarities between [[iceberg]] [[Earthquake|tremors]], which occur when they run aground, and volcanic tremors may help experts develop a better method for predicting [[volcanic eruptions]]. Although icebergs have much simpler structures than volcanoes, they are physically easier to work with. The similarities between volcanic and iceberg tremors include long durations and [[amplitude]]s, as well as common shifts in [[frequencies]].&lt;ref name="SingIce"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/singing-icebergs | title=Singing icebergs | publisher=[[Canadian Geographic]] | date=1 March 2006 | accessdate=11 December 2016 | author=Mason, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas emissions===
[[Image:Pinatubo ash plume 910612.jpg|thumb|Gas and ash plume erupted from Mount Pinatubo, Philippines.]]
As magma nears the surface and its pressure decreases, gases escape. This process is much like what happens when you open a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. [[Sulfur dioxide]] is one of the main components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]]. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 [[Galeras]], [[Colombia]] eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A [[multi-component gas analyzer system]] (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes.&lt;ref name=geosciworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/35/12/1115/|title=Forecasting Etna eruptions by real-time observation of volcanic gas composition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-GAS measurements of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.&lt;ref name="geosciworld" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Ground deformation}}Ground deformation===
Swelling of a volcano signals that magma has accumulated near the surface. Scientists monitoring an active volcano will often measure the tilt of the slope and track changes in the rate of swelling. An increased rate of swelling, especially if accompanied by an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions and harmonic tremors is a high probability sign of an impending event. The deformation of [[Mount St. Helens]] prior to the May 18, 1980 eruption was a classic example of deformation, as the north side of the volcano was bulging upwards as magma was building up underneath. Most cases of ground deformation are usually detectable only by sophisticated equipment used by scientists, but they can still predict future eruptions this way.
The Hawaiian Volcanoes show significant ground deformation; there is inflation of the ground prior to an eruption and then an obvious deflation post-eruption. This is due to the shallow magma chamber of the Hawaiian Volcanoes; movement of the magma is easily noticed on the ground above.&lt;ref&gt;[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo41739 Modeling Crustal Deformation Near Active Faults and Volcanic Centers: A Catalog of Deformation Models] [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal monitoring===

Both magma movement, changes in gas release and hydrothermal activity can lead to thermal emissivity changes at the volcano's surface. These can be measured using several techniques: 
* [[Forward looking infrared|forward looking infrared radiometry]] (FLIR) from hand-held devices installed on-site, at a distance, or airborne;
* [[infrared]] band [[satellite]] imagery;
* in-situ [[thermometry]] ([[hot spring]]s, [[fumarole]]s)
* [[heat flux]] maps
* [[Geothermal energy|geothermal well]] [[enthalpy]] changes

===Hydrology===
There are 4 main methods that can be used to predict a volcanic eruption through the use of hydrology:

*Borehole and well hydrologic and hydraulic measurements are increasingly used to monitor changes in a volcanoes subsurface gas pressure and thermal regime. Increased gas pressure will make water levels rise and suddenly drop right before an eruption, and thermal focusing (increased local heat flow) can reduce or dry out aquifers.
*Detection of lahars and other debris flows close to their sources.  USGS scientists have developed an inexpensive, durable, portable and easily installed system to detect and continuously monitor the arrival and passage of debris flows and floods in river valleys that drain active volcanoes.
*Pre-eruption sediment may be picked up by a river channel surrounding the volcano that shows that the actual eruption may be imminent.  Most sediment is transported from volcanically disturbed watersheds during periods of heavy rainfall. This can be an indication of morphological changes and increased hydrothermal activity in absence of instrumental monitoring techniques.
*Volcanic deposit that may be placed on a river bank can easily be eroded which will dramatically widen or deepen the river channel.  Therefore, monitoring of the river channels width and depth can be used to assess the likelihood of a future volcanic eruption.

===Remote sensing===
Remote sensing is the detection by a satellite’s sensors of electromagnetic energy that is absorbed, reflected, radiated or scattered from the surface of a volcano or from its erupted material in an eruption cloud.
*'''Cloud sensing'': Scientists can monitor the unusually cold eruption clouds from volcanoes using data from two different thermal wavelengths to enhance the visibility of eruption clouds and discriminate them from meteorological clouds
*'''Gas sensing'': Sulfur dioxide can also be measured by remote sensing at some of the same wavelengths as ozone.  [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]]s (TOMS) can measure the amount of sulfur dioxide gas released by volcanoes in eruptions. Carbon dioxide emissions from volcanoes have been detected in the short-wave infrared using [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Schwandner, F.M., Gunson, M.R., Miller, C.E., Carn, S.A., Eldering, A., Krings, T., Verhulst, K.R., Schimel, D.S., Nguyen, H.M., Crisp, D. and O’Dell, C.W., Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources, Science, 358(6360), p.eaam5782, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aam5782 link to paper] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*''Thermal sensing'': The presence of new significant thermal signatures or 'hot spots' may indicate new heating of the ground before an eruption, represent an eruption in progress or the presence of a very recent volcanic deposit, including lava flows or pyroclastic flows.
*''Deformation sensing'': Satellite-borne spatial radar data can be used to detect long-term geometric changes in the volcanic edifice, such as uplift and depression. In this method, [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] (InSAR), [[digital elevation model]]s generated from radar imagery are subtracted from each other to yield a differential image, displaying rates of topographic change.
*''Forest monitoring'': In recent period it has been demonstrated the location of eruptive fractures could be predicted, months to years before the eruptions, by the monitoring of forest growth. This tool based on the monitoring of the trees growth has been validated at both Mt. Niyragongo and Mt. Etna during the 2002-2003 volcano eruptive events.&lt;ref&gt;Houlié, N., J.C. Komorowski, M. de Michele, M. Kasereka, H. Ciraba, Early detection of eruptive dykes revealed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on high-resolution satellite imagery,  246, 3-4, 231-240, Earth Planetary Science Letters, 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.039,[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.039 link to paper] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass movements and mass failures===
Monitoring mass movements and -failures uses techniques lending from seismology (geophones), deformation, and meteorology. Landslides, rock falls, pyroclastic flows, and mud flows (lahars) are example of mass failures of volcanic material before, during, and after eruptions.

The most famous volcanic ''landslide'' was probably the failure of a bulge that built up from intruding magma before the Mt. St. Helens eruption in 1980, this landslide "uncorked" the shallow magmatic intrusion causing catastrophic failure and an unexpected lateral eruption blast. 
''Rock falls'' often occur during periods of increased deformation and can be a sign of increased activity in absence of instrumental monitoring. 
''Mud flows'' (''[[lahar]]s'') are remobilized hydrated ash deposits from pyroclastic flows and ash fall deposits, moving downslope even at very shallow angles at high speed. Because of their high density they are capable of moving large objects such as loaded logging trucks, houses, bridges, and boulders. Their deposits usually form a second ring of debris fans around volcanic edifices, the inner fan being primary ash deposits. Downstream of the deposition of their finest load, lahars can still pose a sheet flood hazard from the residual water. Lahar deposits can take many months to dry out, until they can be walked on. The hazards derived from lahar activity can exist several years after a large explosive eruption.

A team of US scientists developed a method of predicting [[lahars]].  Their method was developed by analyzing rocks on [[Mt. Rainier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  The warning system depends on noting the differences between fresh rocks and older ones.  Fresh rocks are poor conductors of electricity and become hydrothermically altered by water and heat.  Therefore, if they know the age of the rocks, and therefore the strength of them, they can predict the pathways of a lahar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby, Alex|work=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1146319.stm|title=Early warning for volcanic mudslides|date=January 31, 2001|accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of [[Acoustic Flow Monitors]] (AFM) has also been emplaced on Mount Rainier to analyze ground tremors that could result in a ''lahar'', providing an earlier warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsspc.org/Awards/2003/innovations.htm |title=WSSPC Awards in Excellence 2003 Award Recipients |last=Staff |publisher=Western States Seismic Policy Council |accessdate=2008-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720140858/http://www.wsspc.org/Awards/2003/innovations.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local case studies==

===Nyiragongo===
The eruption of [[Mt. Nyiragongo]] on January 17, 2002 was predicted a week earlier by a local expert who had been studying the volcanoes for years.  He informed the local authorities and a [[UN]] survey team was dispatched to the area; however, it was declared safe.  Unfortunately, when the volcano erupted, 40% of the city of [[Goma]] was destroyed along with many people's livelihoods. The expert claimed that he had noticed small changes in the local relief and had monitored the eruption of a much smaller volcano two years earlier.  Since he knew that these two volcanoes were connected by a small fissure, he knew that Mt. Nyiragongo would erupt soon.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Mt. Etna===
British geologists have developed a method of predicting future eruptions of [[Mt. Etna]].  They have discovered that there is a time lag of 25 years between events. Monitoring of deep crust events can help predict accurately what will happen in the years to come.  So far they have predicted that between 2007 and 2015, volcanic activity will be half of what it was in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2992369.stm|title=Clues to Etna's future eruptions|date=2003-05-01|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Sakurajima, Japan===
[[Sakurajima]] is possibly one of the most monitored areas on earth.  The Sakurajima Volcano lies near [[Kagoshima|Kagoshima City]], which has a population of over 500,000 people.  Both the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) and [[Kyoto University]]'s Sakurajima Volcanological Observatory (SVO) monitors the volcano's activity.  Since 1995, Sakurajima has only erupted from its summit with no release of lava.

Monitoring techniques at Sakurajima:

*Likely activity is signalled by swelling of the land around the volcano as magma below begins to build up.  At Sakurajima, this is marked by a rise in the seabed in Kagoshima Bay – tide levels rise as a result.
*As magma begins to flow, melting and splitting base rock can be detected as volcanic earthquakes.  At Sakurajima, they occur two to five kilometres beneath the surface.  An underground observation tunnel is used to detect volcanic earthquakes more reliably.
*Groundwater levels begin to change, the temperature of hot springs may rise and the chemical composition and amount of gases released may alter.  Temperature sensors are placed in bore holes which are used to detect ground water temp.  Remote sensing is used on Sakurajima since the gases are highly toxic – the ratio of [[HCl]] gas to [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas increases significantly shortly before an eruption.
*As an eruption approaches, tiltmeter systems measure minute movements of the mountain.  Data is relayed in real-time to monitoring systems at SVO.
*Seismometers detect earthquakes which occur immediately beneath the crater, signaling the onset of the eruption.  They occur 1 to 1.5 seconds before the explosion.
*With the passing of an explosion, the tiltmeter system records the settling of the volcano.

===Ecuador===
The Geophysics Institute at the [[National Polytechnic School]] in [[Quito]] houses an international team of [[seismology|seismologists]] and volcanologists &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igepn.edu.ec/  Institute for Geophysics at National Polytechnic School   ]&lt;/ref&gt; whose responsibility is to monitor [[Ecuador]]s numerous active volcanoes in the [[Andes Mountains]] of Ecuador and in the [[Galápagos Islands]].  Ecuador is located in the [[Ring of Fire]] where about 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?termID=150 |title=USGS.gov - Ring of Fire |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's earthquakes and 81%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Usgs Faqs |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/faq/?faqID=95 |title=USGS.gov - Where do earthquakes occur? |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's largest earthquakes occur.  The [[geologist]]s study the eruptive activity for the volcanoes in the country, especially [[Tungurahua]] whose volcanic activity restarted on 19 August 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://photoblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/19/13366108-tungurahua-volcano-erupts-in-ecuador?lite|date=19 Aug 2012|title=Tungurahua volcano erupts in Ecuador|publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several major eruptions since that period, the last starting on 1 February 2014.&lt;ref name="February 1 eruption"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/t/story/ecuadors-tungurahua-volcano-shoots-ash-lava-22331271|title=Ecuador's Tungurahua Volcano shoots ash and lava|publisher=Associated Press|date=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigations==
Going beyond predicting volcanic activity, there are highly speculative proposals to prevent explosive volcanic activity by cooling the [[magma chamber]]s using [[geothermal power]] generation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=David|title=NASA's ambitious plan to save Earth from a supervolcano|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170817-nasas-ambitious-plan-to-save-earth-from-a-supervolcano?ocid=global_future_rss|accessdate=18 August 2017|work=BBC Future|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proinsias Mac Aonghusa''' (English: '''Francis McGuinness'''; 23 June 1933 &amp;ndash; 28 September 2003) was an Irish journalist, writer, tv presenter and campaigner.

Mac Aonghusa was a broadcaster for [[Radio Éireann]] in 1952, and for [[RTÉ]], [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[BBC]] television from the 1960s. In 1962, he won a [[Jacob's Award]] for his [[Irish language]] broadcasting on [[RTÉ One|RTÉ]] television.

He ran for election as a candidate of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]], and became vice-chairman of the party. He encouraged the formation of the [[Young Labour League]] and edited and wrote an introduction to ''Corish Speaks'', a collection of speeches by [[Brendan Corish]], who was then leader of the party. He became involved in the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolfe Tone Society]] in late 1966, and he was expelled from the Labour Party on 12 January 1967 for "activities injurious" to the party.&lt;ref&gt;pp.13 ''Report of the Administrative Council and of the Parliamentary Labour Party for the Year 1966-67'' (Irish Labour Party, 20 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; He ran as an independent candidate in 1969, but thereafter became more concerned with the revival of the Irish language and with nationalist politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversialist deeply committed to Gaelic Ireland|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/controversialist-deeply-committed-to-gaelic-ireland-1.381137|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Catherine McGuinness|Catherine McGuinness (née Ellis)]], also left the party at this time, and later became a justice of the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court of Ireland]].

During 1974 and 1975, Mac Aonghusa worked as a [[United Nations]] Special Representative to southern [[Africa]] with [[Seán MacBride]]. He was an admirer of [[Charles Haughey]] whom he regularly praised in his column in the Sunday Press written under the pseudonym "Gulliver".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/oct/05/proinsias-mac-aonghusa/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Irish Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several books, most in the Irish language and was a member of the [[Arts Council of Ireland]] for many years. He was chairman of [[Bord na Gaeilge]], and president of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] between 1989 and 1994.

Professor '''Rana Nayar''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CK1N-oN0DwC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Rana+Nayar%22+1957&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UIdfTuiiPMXngQeHwbn6AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rana%20Nayar%22%201957&amp;f=false |title=From Across the Shores: Punjabi Short Stories by Asians in Britain |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a translator of [[poetry]] and short fiction from [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2006/12/12/stories/2006121200951700.htm |title=Short stories |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has more than forty volumes of poetry and translation works to his credit.  He is also a theatre artist and has participated in a number of major full-length productions. Initially he taught at the [[St Bede]]'s College in [[Shimla]] before joining the Department of English of [[Panjab University]], [[Chandigarh]], where he is at present teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.puchd.ac.in/show-biodata.php?qstrempid=309&amp;qstrempdesigcode=8|title= Panjab University - ''Profile of Rana Nayar''|publisher=English.puchd.ac.in|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
A critic, scholar and translator, Rana Nayar has been a pioneer in bringing into [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] translation a great number of classics from Punjabi literature. Among the prominent Punjabi authors he has translated are included such literary giants as Gurdial Singh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20121111/spectrum/book1.htm|title= The Sunday Tribune Review - ''Gurdial Singh - A Reader''|publisher=Tribuneindia.com|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raghubir Dhand, Mohan Bhandari and Beeba Balwant inter alia. He has translated two of Gurdial's novels, "Night of the Half-moon" and "Parsa". Besides translating the works of such prominent women writers from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] such as [[Amrita Pritam]], Ajit Caur and Dalip Kaur Tiwana, he has helped in bringing to public notice such lesser known writers as Chandan Negi, who writes in both Punjabi and [[Dogri]]. Rana Nayar was instrumental in revival of interest in Gurdial Singh's novels and short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katha.org/site/book-view?book_isbn=9788189020248|title= Katha Book Review - ''The Survivors'' by Gurdial Singh|publisher=Katha.org|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first collection of poems (composed by himself) is titled ''Breathing Spaces'', which has received critical review and appreciation in Indian literary circle.

== Critical and analytical writing ==
Rana Nayar's critical works on poetry include "Edward Albee : Towards a Typology of Relationships" published in 2003 by Prestige Publishers. His other critical works which are forthcoming include ''"Mediations : Self &amp; Society"'', which is a collection of essays on Indian history, society and culture, and ''"Third World Narrative : Theory &amp; Practice"''. He has made seminal contribution to historical analysis of Indian literary translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedamsbooks.in/no107698/intersections-essays-on-indian-literatures-translations-popular-consciousness-rana-nayar|title= Inter-sections - ''Essays on Indian Literatures, Translation &amp; Popular Consciousness''|publisher=Vedamsbooks.in|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
Rana Nayar has been a Charles Wallace (India) Trust Awardee, besides having won commendation awards for translation from [[British Council]] and ''Katha''. In 2007 he won [[Sahitya Akademi]]'s Indian Literature Golden Jubilee Literary Translation Prize for Poetry. Rana Nayar is also on the editorial board of the prestigious Lakeview International Journal of Literature &amp; Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lijla.weebly.com/about.html|title= LAKEVIEW Editorial Board|publisher=Lijla.weebly.com|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regularization''' is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] phenomenon observed in [[language acquisition]], [[language development]], and [[language change]] typified by the replacement of [[inflection#Regular and irregular inflection|irregular forms]] in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] or [[syntax]] by regular ones. Examples are "gooses" instead of "geese" in child speech and replacement of the [[Middle English]] plural form for "[[cow]]", "kine", with "cows". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson |first=Grover |title=Essential Introductory Linguistics |year=1999 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=0-631-20304-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RB07Jb4tREC&amp;pg=PA420&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=regularization+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqx_gWHnWe&amp;sig=bkGvvOpxVxaU1OaXI5SaM_S6HWc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yQw8TMSSGpG8sQOIo4HaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=regularization%20linguistics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regularization is a common process in [[natural language]]s; regularized forms can replace loanword forms (such as with "cows" and "kine") or coexist with them (such as with "[[wikt:formulae#Noun|formulae]]" and "[[wikt:formulas#Noun|formulas]]" or "[[wikt:hepatitides#Noun|hepatitides]]" and "[[wikt:hepatitises#Noun|hepatitises]]").

Erroneous regularization is also called ''overregularization''. In overregularization the regular ways of modifying or connecting words are mistakenly applied to words that require irregular modifications or connections. It is a normal effect observed in the language of beginner and intermediate language-learners, whether native-speaker children or foreign-speaker adults. Because most [[natural language]]s have some irregular forms, moving beyond overregularization is a part of mastering them. Usually learners' brains move beyond overregularization naturally, as a consequence of being immersed in the language.

The same person may sometimes overregularize and sometimes say the correct form. Native-speaker adults can overregularize, but this does not happen often.

== Models to explain overregularization ==

=== Dual-mechanism models ===

In these models, two mechanisms are at work. For example, the rule in English for forming a past-tense form is to add ''-ed''. In cases where the recall from memory instantly retrieves the form, the brain does not need to execute the rule, and skips execution. In cases where retrieval doesn't happen fast enough, the rule is executed. The more practice the speaker gets with the language, the more reliable is the retrieval.

These models can explain why the same person may sometimes overregularize and sometimes say the correct form. A child that already knows the word ''bought'' may occasionally say ''buyed'' when retrieval fails to work well. The next time, retrieval works well, and she says ''bought'' correctly.

These models also explain why native-speaker adults rarely overregularize. They are so thoroughly practiced in the language that retrieval rarely fails.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

== Comparison and contrast with phonetic overcompensation ==

Phonetic overcompensation, one form of [[hypercorrection]], can be compared and contrasted with overregularization.

In both cases, a learner must master the automatic overriding of a rule to the point that it happens unconsciously and instantly—one case being phonetic, the other being morphologic. (The neurologic mechanisms of how that happens are still being investigated. Perhaps the brain needs practice in sidestepping the rule entirely as the needed objects [e.g., phonetic strings or past-tense inflected verb forms] are called directly instead of being derived on-the-fly via the rule.)

Native-speaker children do not make phonetic overcompensation errors in the same manner or degree that foreign-speaker adults do, because they do not carry the baggage of an earlier language's differences. But it does not seem correct to say that overcompensation cannot happen at all to a monolingual speaker, because some minor tongue-twisting and some minor [[Freudian slips]] could possibly involve neurologic processes that are analogous to phonetic overcompensation.

[[Image:HelenaMT II.jpg|thumb|Residential area in [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], [[Montana]], United States]]
[[File:Nepali slum in Bhutan.jpg|thumb|Suburban slum in [[Bhutan]]]]
A '''residential area''' is a land used in which [[houses|housing]] predominates, as opposed to [[industrial district|industrial]] and [[Commercial Area|commercial areas]]. 
Housing may vary significantly between, and through, residential areas. These include [[single-family housing]], [[multi-family residential]], or [[mobile home]]s. [[Zoning]] for residential use may permit some services or work opportunities or may totally exclude business and industry. It may permit [[urban density|high density land use]] or only permit low density uses.  Residential zoning usually includes a smaller FAR ([[floor area ratio]]) than business, commercial or industrial/manufacturing zoning. The area may be large or small.

==Overview==
In certain residential areas, largely [[rural]], large tracts of land may have no services whatever, thus residents seeking services must use a motor vehicle or other transport, so the need for transport has resulted in [[land development]] following existing or planned [[transport infrastructure]] such as rail and road.  Development patterns may be regulated by [[restrictive covenant]]s contained in the [[deed]]s to the properties in the development, and may also result from or be reinforced by [[zoning]].  Restrictive covenants are not easily changed when the agreement of all property owners (many of whom may not live in the area) is required.  The area so restricted may be large or small.

Residential areas may be subcategorized in the [[concentric zone model]] and other schemes of [[urban geography]].

== Residential development ==
[[File:Silver Towers 44 11 jeh.JPG|thumb|upright|left|New inner city residences in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Manhattan]]]]
[[File:Roundstones 62 St 5 Av jeh.JPG|thumb|left|Residential area in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Brooklyn]] about a century after it was developed]]

'''Residential development''' is [[real estate development]] for residential purposes. Some such developments are called a '''[[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]]''', when the [[Real property|land]] is divided into lots with [[house]]s constructed on each lot. Such developments became common during the late nineteenth century, particularly in the form of [[streetcar suburb]]s.

In previous centuries, residential development was mainly of two kinds.  Rich people bought a townlot, hired an architect and/or contractor, and built a [[bespoke]] / customized house or [[mansion]] for their family.  Poor urban people lived in [[shantytown]]s or in [[tenement]]s built for rental.  [[Single-family house]]s were seldom built on [[speculation]], that is for future sale to residents not yet identified.  When cities and the [[middle class]] expanded greatly and [[mortgage loan]]s became commonplace, a method that had been rare became commonplace to serve the expanding demand for home ownership.

[[Post–World War II economic expansion]] in major cities of the United States, especially [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] produced a demand for thousands of new homes, which was largely met by speculative building.  Its large-scale practitioners disliked the term "property speculator" and coined the new name "residential development" for their activity.  Entire farms and ranches were [[Subdivision (land)|subdivided]] and developed, often with one individual or company controlling all aspects of entitlement (permits), land development (streets and grading), infrastructure (utilities and sewage disposal), and housing.  Communities like [[Levittown, Long Island]] or Lakewood south of Los Angeles saw new homes sold at unprecedented rates—more than one a day.  Many techniques which had made the automobile affordable made housing affordable: standardization of design and small, repetitive assembly tasks, advertising, and a smooth flow of capital.  [[Mass production]] resulted in a similar uniformity of product, and  a more comfortable [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] than cramped apartments in the cities.  With the advent of government-backed mortgages, it could actually be cheaper to own a house in a new residential development than to rent.

[[File:Prospect Park South gatepost jeh.JPG|thumb|upright|Minor entrance monument, early 20th century]]
As with other products, [[Kaizen|continual refinements]] appeared.  Curving streets, greenbelt parks, neighborhood pools, and community entry monumentation appeared.  Diverse [[floor plan]]s with differing room counts, and multiple [[Elevation (view)|elevations]] (different exterior "looks" for the same plan) appeared.  Developers remained competitive with each other on everything, including location, community amenities, kitchen appliance packages, and price.

Today, a typical '''residential development''' in the United States might include [[traffic calming]] features, such as a slowly winding [[street]], [[Cul-de-sac|dead-end road]], or [[Loop route|loop]]ed road lined with homes.

[[Suburb]]an developments help form the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] image of a "suburban America," and are generally associated with the [[United States|American]] [[middle-class]].  Most offer homes in a narrow range of age, price, size and features, thus potential residents having different needs, wishes or resources must look elsewhere.  Some residential developments are [[gated communities]].

=== Problems with residential developments ===
Criticisms of residential developments may include:

* They do not mesh well with the greater community. Some are isolated, with only one entrance, or otherwise connected with the rest of the community in few ways.
* Being [[commuter town]]s, they serve no more purpose for the greater community than other specialized settlements do, and thus require residents to go to the greater community for commercial or other purposes. Whereas [[mixed-use development]]s provide for commerce and other activities, thus residents need not go as often to the greater community.

== Early history ==

One of the earliest snapshots of the home page, dated 1 June 2004, can be seen at the earlier archives of Sanskrit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=789|title= Main Page|author= Wikipedia Contributors|date= June 1, 2004|publisher= Wikipedia|accessdate= September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest article still available on Sanskrit Wikipedia's site is apparently [[:sa:दमन दीव|Damana dīva]], dated July 9, 2004, however the first article was made on March 21, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8_%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B5&amp;oldid=6260|title= दमन दीव|author= Wikipedia Contributors|date= July 9, 2004|publisher= Wikipedia|accessdate= September 21, 2011|language= Sanskrit|trans-title=Daman Diu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Milestones_2004&amp;oldid=434169282|title= Wikipedia:Milestones 2004|author= Wikipedia Contributors|date= June 14, 2011|publisher= Wikipedia|accessdate= September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of articles dropped from the 1,000-article mark to only 600 in August 2005 after nearly half were deleted; many of the deletions were due to the articles being in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-08-22/News_and_notes&amp;oldid=366489237|title= Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2005-08-22/News and notes|author= Wikipedia Contributors|date= June 7, 2010|publisher= Wikipedia|accessdate= September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sanskrit Wikipedia reached 9,405 articles as of December 12, 2013.

==Collaboration with Samskrita Bharati==

[[Image:Samskrit Wikipedia Academy Wikipedian volunteers.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=Samskrita Wikipedia Academy|Wikipedia Academy Volunteers]]

Sanskrit Wikipedia has a collaboration with [[Samskrita Bharati]], a [[non-profit organisation]] working to [[language revitalization|revive]] Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="communitynews"/&gt; The collaboration efforts started in the [[WP:ACBLR1|Wikipedia Academy]] organized in [[Bangalore]] on Jan 23, 2010. That Wikipedia Academy was also the first in India.

There were 11 Sanskrita Bharathi participants at the Academy. They were introduced to Wikipedia and contributing to Wikipedia content and were helped in this by a team of roughly 3 [[Wikipedians]].

Later the first Sanskrit Wiki workshop was held in Sanskrit Bharati's office at Bangalore for an audience of 20 participants. The presentation was intended to give a basic working knowledge of Wikipedia and its interface.&lt;ref name="communitynews"/&gt;

A second workshop was held at the same location on March 26, 2011 for another 15 participants from software companies and the ''Om Shantidham Gurukulam''.&lt;ref name="communitynews"/&gt;

==Other collaborations==
Through an initiative by [[Gujarat University]]'s Department of Sanskrit, around 150 Sanskrit teachers from different colleges in Gujarat gathered in July 2012 to add materials to the Sanskrit Wikipedia through a two-day-long workshop held titled ''Sanskrit Wikipedia — Introduction and Expectations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1714503/report-sanskrit-wikipedia-in-the-offing-gujarat-teachers-planning-details DNA India - Sanskrit Wikipedia in the offing: Gujarat teachers planning details]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sant Singh Sekhon''' (1908–1997) was a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] playwright and fiction writer.  He is part of the generation of [[Indian literature|Indian authors]] who mark the transition of India into an [[Partition of India|independent]] nation, scarred by the tragedies of [[partition of India|partition]].

==Life==
Sekhon was born in [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] (present-day Pakistan), and grew up in his father's village in Dakha,near [[Ludhiana]].
His father was an idealist but introverted while his mother was more practical and religious, practicing [[Sikh]] ''Singh Sabha''. There was considerable marital discord in the family which colours many of his stories.  Sekhon eventually graduated with master's degrees in Economics and also in English.  In the 1930s, he started writing in English, and after some initial publications including some in shared publications with [[W.H. Auden]] and [[Stephen Spender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museindia.com/showauthor1.asp?id=83 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027221551/http://www.museindia.com/showauthor1.asp?id=83 |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
But given the greater audience in Punjabi, he shifted to Punjabi, and initially made a mark as a playwright.
Along with many South-Asian littérateurs of his generation ([[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], [[Harivansh Rai Bachchan]], [[Buddhadev Bose]]), he taught English but wrote in an Indian language.

==Literary career==
His first collection of one-act plays, ''Chhe Ghar'' (Six homes, 1941) was a critical success, particularly the play ''Bhavi'', which unfolds a tragic cross-relationship between a king and his son with a daughter-mother.

Like his contemporary [[Mulk Raj Anand]], Sekhon was influenced by the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/13.1.2_Jain.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620191839/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/13.1.2_Jain.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strong believer in [[Marxism]], and also joined the [[Communist party of India]], though he let his membership lapse.  He contested elections four times, thrice for the Punjab legislature and once for Parliament, but never won.

Much of his writing has a strong social activism message, but the questions and dilemmas facing the characters are subtly philosophical, and his plays did not see much success on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he also wrote a good bit of poetry, and also several full-length plays, mostly featuring modern themes, particularly man-woman relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhnet.com/news/honoring-professor-sant-singh-sekhon&lt;/ref&gt;   The historical play ''Waris'' is both a love-story with the poet Waris Shah, set against the rise of Sikh power.  The more contemporary ''Mittarpiara'' (beloved friend), develops on the notion of a group of Sikhs and other Indians developing a friendship with [[Lenin]] to liberate India from the British.  In total, his drama corpus runs into ten
full-length plays and four one-act play collections.

He also wrote five short story collections, of which ''Tija Pahar'' was very well received.
Many of his stories have been translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/~amit/books/bhattacharya-2006-contemporary-indian-short-vII.html#sant&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, he also
wrote two novels and five books of literary criticism, as well as several
histories and translations.
His scholarly works include
''Sahityarth'', a theory of literature, and the pioneering work, ''Punjabi boli da itihas'' (History of the Punjabi language).

In 1972, he won the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for ''Mittarpiara''.
He was also awarded the [[Padma Shri]], one of India's highest civilian awards, in 1987.

He was a Professor of Eminence at the Punjabi University in Patiala; after
his death, a chair was set up at the university in his name.

'''Spokil''' is a [[constructed language]], created by the Frenchman '''Adolphe Nicolas'''.

During the 1880s, the most popular [[international auxiliary language]] was undeniably [[Volapük]]. However, after a brief period of overwhelming success, rivalry on the part of the more practical and less complicated [[Esperanto]] (published in 1887) led to a rapid decline of the Volapük movement. Many who had previously supported Volapük switched to the Esperanto camp, while others tried their best to improve or reform Volapük itself. Partially due to the inflexible attitude of [[Johann Martin Schleyer]], the creator of Volapük, himself, this led to several schisms in the Volapük movement. As a result, a number of so-called "Volapükids" emerged, most notably [[Idiom Neutral]], first published in 1902, and Spokil.

Spokil was created by Adolphe Charles Antoine Marie Nicolas (1833-?), a French ship's doctor from [[La Bourboule]]. A former partisan of Volapük, he started working on Spokil in 1890 (though some sources mention 1887 instead). In 1904, he published a book about it: ''Spokil. Language internationale. Grammaire, exercise, les deux dictionnaires.'' At a conference in Paris, held in June 1907, Nicolas was allowed to defend his language in person; among the other languages discussed at the conference were [[Parla (language)|Parla]], [[Bolak (Blue Language)|Bolak]] (La Langue Bleue), [[Idiom Neutral]], and Esperanto. At the same meeting, [[Ido (language)|Ido]] was first presented. Spokil never gained much support, however, and nowadays is largely forgotten.

Like Volapük, Spokil is most often qualified as an [[a priori (languages)|a priori]]/a posteriori hybrid. Some authors, including Nicolas himself, consider it a purely a priori language.

The '''Sri Lankan Tamil dialects''' or '''Ceylon Tamil dialects''' form a group of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[dialect]]s used in the modern country of [[Sri Lanka]] by [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]] that is distinct from the dialects of modern Tamil spoken in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] [[States and territories of India|states]] of [[India]]. Tamil dialects are differentiated by the [[phonological change]]s and [[sound shift]]s in their evolution from classical or [[Old Tamil]] (300 BC - 700 CE). It is broadly categorized into four sub groups: Jaffna Tamil, Batticaloa Tamil, up country Indian origin Tamils and [[Negombo Tamil dialect|Negombo Tamil]] dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as [[Sinhalese people]], [[Sri Lankan Moors]] and [[Vedda people|Vedda]]s, who consider them to be distinct. These dialects are not mutually intelligible with Indian Tamil dialects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/sparadox/sparadox.html|title=Language Shift in the Tamil Communities of Malaysia and
Singapore:
        the Paradox of Egalitarian Language Policy.|author=|date=|website=ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some of the native speakers consider to be a separate language.

==Characteristics==
As Tamil is a [[diglossic]] language the differences between the standard written languages across the globe is minimal but the spoken varieties differ considerably. The spoken varieties in Sri Lanka although different from those of [[Tamil Nadu]] share some common features between the southern dialects of Tamil Nadu and the northern Sri Lankan Tamil dialect, the language of Jaffna. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lehmann, "Old Tamil" in Sanford Steever (ed.), ''The Dravidian Languages'' Routledge, 1998 at p. 75; E. Annamalai and S. Steever, "Modern Tamil" in ibid. at pp. 100-128.
&lt;/ref&gt; and use many other words slightly differently.&lt;ref name=Kamil&gt;Kamil Zvelebil, "Some features of Ceylon Tamil" ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 9:2 (June 1966) pp. 113-138.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are less influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and the western languages, [[Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|although there are western and Sanskrit loan words]] in day to day usage. In general Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are considered to be more conservative than the continental Tamil dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Indrapala, K ''The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka'', p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==

===Negombo Tamil===
{{Main|Negombo Tamil dialect}}
The [[Negombo Tamil dialect]] used in Negombo area by bilingual fishers who otherwise identify them as Sinhalese  has undergone considerable morphosyntactic convergence with spoken or colloquial [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], as a consequence of contact with it.&lt;ref name=BS1&gt;[http://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~sala23/abstracts/A17.doc Contact-Induced Morphosyntactic Realignment in Negombo Fishermen’s Tamil] By Bonta Stevens, South Asian Language Analysis Roundtable XXIII (October 12, 2003) The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BS2&gt;[http://nelc.osu.edu/newsevents/folklore/yr2004/volume20_3/dissertation.cfm#southa  Negombo fishermen's Tamil: A case of contact-induced language change from Sri Lanka] by Bonta Stevens, Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; It has also developed a number of other grammatical traits under the probable influence of Sinhala, including a postposed indefinite article, an indefinitizing postclitic –sari (apparently modeled on Sinhala –hari), and case assignments for defective verbs that follow the Sinhala, rather than Tamil, patterns of agreement.&lt;ref name=BS1/&gt;

===Batticaloa Tamil===
{{Main|Batticaloa Tamil dialect}}
Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]], [[Vedar|Veddhas]] and [[Portuguese Burghers]] in the eastern province. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the [[Trincomalee]] district has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.&lt;ref name=kuiper&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kuiper  | first = L.B.J  | title = Note on Old Tamil and Jaffna Tamil   | journal = Indo-Iranian Journal  | volume = 6 | issue = 1  | pages = 52–64  | publisher = Springer Netherlands  | location =   | date = March 1964  | accessdate =  | doi = 10.1007/BF00157142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]] a [[linguist]], the Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary like of all spoken dialects of Tamil, and it has preserved  several very antique features, and  has remained more true to the literary norm than any other form of Tamil while developing  a few striking innovations. Although Batticaloa Tamil has  some very specific features of vocabulary, it is classified with other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects as it is related to them by characteristic traits of its [[phonology]]. It also maintains some words that are unique to present day .&lt;ref name=Kamil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, ''Folk traditionas and Songs...'', p.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jaffna Tamil===
{{Main|Jaffna Tamil dialect}}
The dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and most archaic of Tamil dialects in Sri Lanka and India. It is also very refined and considered to preserve many antique features of Old Tamil that predate [[Tolkāppiyam]], the grammatical treatise of Tamil. The Jaffna Tamil dialect retained many forms of words which were used in [[Sangam literature]] such as [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] and [[Kuṟuntokai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viruba.com/tamilwritings/00010.aspx|title=Yalpana Thamilil Sangath Thamil |last=Shanmugathas|first=A|language=Tamil |accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a large portion of settlers in Jaffna who came from South India in the past centuries were [[Sri Lankan Vellalar|Vellalar]] (Mudaliar and [[Pillai]]{{dn|date=June 2018}}) and this would have helped retain pure Tamil words and linguistics since Vellalars speak a classic dialect of Tamil. Jaffna Tamil dialect is not mutually intelligible with Indian Tamil dialects, though both share a diglossic `H' variety in literary Tamil.&lt;ref name=hs&gt;{{cite web   | last = Schiffman  | first = Harold  | title = Language Shift in the Tamil Communities of Malaysia and Singapore: the Paradox of Egalitarian Language Policy. | publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania]]   | date = 1996-10-30   | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/sparadox/sparadox.html | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently mistaken for [[Malayalam]] by native Indian Tamil speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Indrapala, K ''The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of [[Prakrit]] loans words that are unique to the Jaffna Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;Indrapala, K ''The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka'', p.389&lt;/ref&gt; A subdialect retained by the [[Paraiyar]] people of [[Kayts]] still retains a number of [[proto-Dravidian language|archaic words]] and Prakrit loans not found in any other dialects of Tamil. These drummers had historically played an important role as ritual players of drums at funerals and folk temples and as heralds and traditional [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]]. They also maintained the family records of their [[feudalism|feudal]] [[lord]]s and even practiced medicine and astrology in folk traditions &lt;ref&gt;Ragupathy, ''Tamil Social Formation in Sri Lanka: A Historical Outline'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Na sombra, no bom....jpg|thumb|right|250px|According to the Stone Tape theory, emotions can be stored in materials, such as the trees in this allegedly haunted forest in [[List of reportedly haunted locations#Brazil|Brazil]]]]

The '''Stone Tape''' theory is the speculation that  [[ghosts]] and [[haunting]]s are analogous to [[tape recorder|tape recordings]], and that mental impressions during emotional or traumatic events can be projected in the form of energy, "recorded" onto rocks and other items and "replayed" under certain conditions. The Idea draws inspiration and shares similarities with views of 19th century intellectualists and psychic researchers, such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick|Eleonor Sidgwick]] and [[Edmund Gurney]]. Contemporarily, the concept was popularized by 1972 Christmas ghost story called ''[[The Stone Tape]]'', produced by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="Stanley2011"&gt;{{citation|author=Colin Stanley|title=Around the Outsider: Essays Presented to Colin Wilson on the Occasion of His 80th Birthday|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOEu5XpZT2oC&amp;pg=PA296|year=2011|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-84694-668-4|pages=296–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchickVaughn2013" /&gt; Following the movie's popularity, the idea and the term "stone tape" were retrospectively and inaccurately attributed to the British [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] turned [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]] [[T. C. Lethbridge]], who believed that ghosts were not [[spirit]]s of the deceased, but were simply non-interactive recordings similar to a [[Film|movie]].

== History ==
The idea that environmental elements are capable of storing traces of human thoughts or emotions was introduced by multiple 19th century scholars and philosophers as an attempt to provide natural explanations for supernatural phenomena. In 1837 the [[polymath]] [[Charles Babbage]] published a work on [[natural theology]] called the ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]]''. Babbage speculated that spoken words leave permanent impressions in the air, even though they become inaudible after time. He suggested that it is possible due to transfer of motion between particles.&lt;ref name="spooky"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon||authorlink= Sharon A. Hill|title=Spooky rocks|url=https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/spooky_rocks|website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=12 February 2018|ref=spooky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Stone tape theory" could also be derived from the concept of "place memory". In the early days of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] place memory was considered an explanation for ghostly apparitions, seemingly connected with certain places. In the late 19th century, two of the [[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] involved investigators, [[Edmund Gurney]] and [[Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick|Eleonor Sidgwick]], presented views about certain buildings or materials being capable of storing records of past events, which can be later played back by gifted individuals.&lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;

Another 19th century idea associated with the "Stone Tape Theory" is [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] - a belief, that it is possible to obtain knowledge about history associated with an object through physical contact with it.&lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;

In the 20th century, the idea that objects are able to store and play back past events was re-introduced in 1939 and 1940 by then-[[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] president [[H. H. Price]]. Price speculated about "psychic ether" as an intermediate medium between spiritual and physical reality, which can enable objects to carry memory traces of emotions or experiences from the past. In his works, he stated that the existence of such traces should be proveable by means of scientific methods and that they yet remain unproved hypotheses.&lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;

Following Price' ideas, an archeologist turned paranormal researcher, [[T. C. Lethbridge]], claimed that past events can be stored in objects thanks to fields of energy, that he believed to surround streams, forests or mountains. His 1961 book ''Ghost and Ghoul'' popularized these ideas which allegedly could have inspired the creators of the 1972 BBC movie ''[[The Stone Tape]]''.&lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;

== Reception ==
In their book ''How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New Age'', authors [[Theodore Schick]] and Lewis Vaughn dismissed the idea as an irrational claim, stating, "The problem is that we know of no mechanism that could record such information in a stone or play it back.

[[Sharon A. Hill|Sharon Hill]], science educator and geologist, claims that "stone tape theory" is a misleading term, as it suggests to encompass structure, credibility and explanatory power or scientific theory, while in reality it is speculation that lacks physical basis. According to her, it is an attempt to present a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claim in a seemingly scientific style.&lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon ||authorlink=Sharon A.

Hill also suspects that the "kernel of the idea of stone tape" is [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] &lt;ref name="spooky" /&gt;, which is criticized for being a form of cold reading rather than an unexplained supernatural phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Karen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stollznow|first1=Karen||authorlink=Karen Stollznow|title=A Psychometry Reading|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/a_psychometry_reading|website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=12 February 2018|ref=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert||authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|title=Psychometry|url=http://skepdic.com/psychometry.html|website=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its Italian subsidiary [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]] is attributed 16% of private clients and 29% of corporate clients share of Italian broadband and is also active in the mobile market.&lt;ref name="AR2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Annual Report 2017|url= http://reports.swisscom.ch/en/2017/report/annual-report/shareholders-letter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] network was first set up in 1852, followed by [[telephone]]s in 1877. The two networks were combined with the [[Mail|postal service]] in 1920 to form the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] ([[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|Postal Telegraph and Telephone]]). It struggled to develop a homegrown digital network, with the first digital exchange launched in 1986, but pioneered the [[NATEL]] A mobile service in 1978 and the [[GSM]]-based [[Natel|NATEL]] D offering a digital service in 1993. The Swiss [[telecommunication]]s market was deregulated in 1997. Telecom PTT was spun off and rebranded Swisscom ahead of a partial privatisation in 1997, which has left the [[Swiss government]] with a 51% stake. Besides pioneering the first [[Mobile Telephone Network|mobile telephone network]] [[Natel|NATEL]] A, the present-day Swisscom owns the protected brand [[Natel|NATEL]], which is used and known only in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="A million customers already enjoy Swisscom TV" /&gt;

In 2001, 25% of Swisscom Mobile was sold to [[Vodafone]]. Since then, Swisscom has bought a majority stake in [[Italy]]'s second-biggest telecom company [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]] and invested in areas such as hospitality support, [[Cloud computing|cloud services]], mobile solutions and billing.

==History==

===Pioneers (1852-1911)===
[[Switzerland]]'s entry into the [[telecommunication]]s era came in 1851, with the passage of legislation giving the [[Swiss government]] control over the development of a [[telegraph]] network throughout the country. The government's initial plans called for the creation of three primary [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines, as well as a number of secondary networks. In order to build equipment for the system, the government established the Atelier Fédéral de Construction des Télégraphes (Federal Workshop for the Construction of Telegraphs).

In July 1852, the first leg of the country's [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] system—between [[St. Gallen]] and [[Zurich]]—was operational. By the end of that year, most of the country's main cities had been connected to the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] system. In 1855, the network was extended with the first underwater cable, connecting [[Winkel, Switzerland|Winkel]]-[[Stansstad]] and [[Bauen]]-[[Flüelen]]. Night service was also launched that year, starting in [[Basel]], [[St. Gallen]] and [[Bellinzona]].

[[Telegraphy|Telegraph]] traffic took off in the late 1860s after the government had reduced the cost of 20-word messages in 1867. While [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] traffic continued to rise in the following decade, the technology was soon to be replaced by the [[telephone]].

[[Switzerland]]'s entry into the [[telephone]] age came in 1877, when the first experimental [[Telephone line|phone lines]] appeared, starting with a line linking the post office building with the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Federal Palace]] and then with a link, using the existing [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] line, between [[Bern]] and [[Thun]]. The following year, the government passed legislation establishing a [[monopoly]] on the country's [[telephone]] network. Nonetheless, private operators were allowed to bid for [[license]]s in order to develop their local [[Concession (contract)|concessions]]. By 1880, [[Switzerland]]'s first private network had been created in [[Zurich]]. This was a central system with the capacity for 200 lines. The first directory was also published that year and listed 140 subscribers.

[[Basel]], [[Bern]], and [[Geneva]] all launched their own local networks between 1881 and 1882. One year later, the first intercity [[telephone line]] was established, linking [[Zurich]]'s private exchange with [[Winterthur]]'s public system. Yet the [[Zürich|Zurich]] company ran into difficulties by the mid-1880s. With its development falling behind the [[telephone]] [[Concession (contract)|concessions]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; elsewhere in the country, the federal government bought out the private operator, paying just over CHF 300,000 in 1886.

The national [[telephone network]] continued to expand. [[Telephone number]]s were introduced in 1890, replacing the initial system whereby callers had been able to ask for their party by name. The number of [[Switzerland]]'s telephone subscribers steadily grew, particularly after the inauguration of a new [[telephone switchboard]] capable of handling nearly 4,000 lines.

By 1896, [[Switzerland]]'s [[telephone network]] had been extended to include all of [[Switzerland]]'s [[cantons]]. By 1900, the country had also established its first international connection, between [[Basel]] and [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. [[Switzerland]] began testing its first public [[Telephone booth|phone booths]] in 1904. Initially restricted to local calls, the public telephones allowed national calling for the first time in 1907.&lt;ref name="company-histories.com"&gt;http://www.company-histories.com/Swisscom-AG-Company-History.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/swisscom-ag-history/|title=History of Swisscom AG – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephony takes off (1912-1965)===
The first automatic [[telephone exchange]]s were installed by private networks in 1912. By 1917, a semi-automatic exchange had been installed, in [[Hottingen (Zürich)|Zurich-Hottingen]]. The following year, in order to extend the country's phone system into rural parts of [[Switzerland]], the government began promoting the establishment of party-line systems.

In 1920, the [[Swiss government]] created the Swiss [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]], combining the country's [[Mail|postal services]] and [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and [[telephone]] systems into a single, government-controlled entity. Development of the country's [[telephone]] system now came entirely under the purview of the government. In 1921, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] launched its own directory inquiries service. The following year, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] started the first fully automatic public [[telephone exchange]] in [[Hottingen (Zürich)|Zurich-Hottingen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/schweizerische-post-telefon-und-telegrafen-betriebe-history/|title=History of SCHWEIZERISCHE POST-, TELEFON- UND TELEGRAFEN-BETRIEBE – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] began [[telex]] services in 1934, and by 1936 had linked up the cities of [[Zurich]], [[Basel]], and [[Bern]], which were then linked via [[Zürich|Zurich]] to the international market. In the meantime, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] also became responsible for developing the company's [[radio broadcasting]], and, later, [[Outline of television broadcasting|television broadcasting]] services.

[[Switzerland]]'s [[telephone]] system took off in the years following [[World War II]]. By 1948, the country boasted 500,000 [[telephone]] subscribers. Over the following decade, that number doubled. In 1957, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] added computer capacity in order to handle billing for its fast-growing network. Through this period, the state-owned organisation had continued to invest in automating its [[telephone network]], and in 1959, [[Switzerland]] became the first country to feature a fully automated [[telephone exchange]] system.&lt;ref name="company-histories.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Space-age communications (1966-1981)===
[[Image:Telstar.jpg|thumb|The original Telstar, the first telecommunications satellite to be launched into space.]]
[[Telstar]] – the first [[Communications satellite|telecommunications satellite]] – was launched into space in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/telstar.html|title=Telstar at 50|last=Administrator|first=NASA|date=2015-07-08|work=NASA|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Expo 1964 in [[Lausanne]], the first exchange to permit international direct dialing was unveiled. In 1974, the Leuk satellite earth station went into operation in the canton of [[Valais|Wallis]].

===Moving towards mobile in the 1980s ===
Automation enabled the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] to introduce pulse-metering for local calls in 1963, priced at 10 centimes per pulse. In 1966, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] introduced automated international dialing services, initially from [[Montreux]]. International direct dialing was rolled out to the rest of the country over the following decade, achieving full coverage in 1982.

As the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]]'s subscriber base topped two million at the beginning of the 1970s, the country introduced a new, seven-digit phone numbering system. By then, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] was also becoming interested in a number of new technologies. In 1970, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] led a workgroup, including a number of prominent Swiss telecommunications players, in an effort to create an integrated digital [[telecommunications network]] (IFS). Originally intended to be rolled out by the middle of that decade, the first IFS exchange did not become operational until 1986.

Other technologies proved more accessible to the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]]. In 1976, the company launched [[facsimile transmission]] services from its customer service centers. Two years later, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] established its first [[Mobile Telephone Network|mobile telephone network]], called [[NATEL]] (for Nationales Autotelefonnetz). Although rudimentary—with calls limited to just three minutes, coverage restricted to five minutes, unlinked local networks, and often difficult-to-establish connections—the [[Natel|NATEL]] network marked one of the earliest and most successful attempts at making telephony mobile.

In 1980, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] enabled facsimile transmission for the home and office market. By then, its subscriber base had risen to nearly three million fixed-line users. In 1983, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] launched its next-generation mobile network, [[Natel|NATEL]] B, which, among other enhancements, reduced the size of [[Mobile phone|mobile telephone]] equipment to a 25-pound unit that fit in its own carrying case. In 1985, the first [[fibre-optic cable]] was laid between [[Berne]] and [[Neuchâtel]].

Other new technologies appeared in the mid-1980s, including the [[Telepac]] data transmission network, rolled out in 1983, and the first [[videoconferencing]] services, launched in 1985. In 1987, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] upgraded the [[Natel|NATEL]] network again. The new [[Natel|NATEL]] C network provided more extensive coverage, digitally transmitted sound, and smaller [[telephone]] sizes. The new network permitted [[mobile telephony]] to take off in [[Switzerland]], and by 1992 the country had some 200,000 subscribers on the [[Natel|NATEL]] network.

In the 1990s, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] faced the loss of its [[telecommunication]]s [[monopoly]]. As a run-up to the coming [[deregulation]] of the [[telecommunication]]s market, the [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] put into place a new [[corporate strategy]], separating its postal and [[telecommunication]]s operations into two focused units. The [[telecommunication]]s business became known as Swiss Telecom PTT. New [[telecommunication]]s legislation was passed in 1992 that stripped away the government's [[monopoly]] status, starting with the equipment sector and digital data communications services, although maintaining the company's de facto hold on the local [[telephone]] market for most of the remainder of the decade.

As part of its repositioning, Telecom PTT invested more heavily in the mobile telephony business, launching the new [[GSM]]-based [[Natel|NATEL]] D network in 1992. That network, which also provided customers with compatibility throughout most of [[Europe]], marked the start of a new era for the [[telephone]] market as callers adopted the new technology. By then end of the 1990s, nearly two million customers had connected to the [[Natel|NATEL]] D network.&lt;ref name="company-histories.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Public company in the 21st Century===
As one of the smallest European [[telecommunications companies]], Telecom PTT's aspirations to achieve international growth took a cumbersome path. At the very beginning, the company formed a Unisource partnership with the [[Netherlands]]' [[KPN]] and [[Sweden]]'s [[Telia Company|Telia]]. Although the Unisource partnership attempted to enter a number of markets around the world, including [[Malaysia]] and [[India]], it finally collapsed after several years of losses.

Telecom PTT's subsequent entry into the [[Internet]] proved to be more successful, as the company set up the service provider Blue Window (later [[Bluewin]]), which became the country's leading [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). In addition, the company had also introduced digital [[ISDN]] subscriber services, increasing its subscriber base from 250,000 in 1996 to more than two million by 2003.

In 1997, [[Swiss government]] passed new legislation fully deregulating the Swiss [[telecommunication]]s market. As part of that process, Telecom PTT was transformed into a special public limited company, its name was changed to Swisscom on 1 October 1997, its shares were listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange|Swiss Stock Exchange]], and it conducted a public offering of its shares in 1998. However, [[Swiss government]] remained a major shareholder of the company.

In 1998, for the first time in its home market, Swisscom faced competition. Diax (which later changed its name to [[Sunrise Communications AG|Sunrise]]) entered the Swiss mobile telephone market as a new player. Two years later, in 2000, the situation in this market segment was further intensified by the arrival of [[France Telecom]]-dominated [[Orange S.A.|Orange]]. Nonetheless, Swisscom held onto its leading position among mobile users.

Simultaneously to the developments in the domestic market, Swisscom also implemented its expansion strategy regarding international markets. In 1999, the company acquired [[Germany]]'s publicly listed [[Debitel]], then the third-largest mobile services provider on the German market, which also operated in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Denmark]]. [[Debitel]] quickly became the leading network-independent provider for mobile services in [[Europe]]. At that time, Debitel's customers base exceeded ten million subscribers. Swisscom rapidly built up its holding in [[Debitel]] to 93% in 2003.

In advance of planned public offerings of both [[Bluewin]] and Swisscom Mobile, Swisscom restructured its own operations. The company formed six primary business units, and in 2001, it sold a 25% stake in Swisscom Mobile to [[England]]'s [[Vodafone]]. At that time, [[Vodafone]] was a major investor in so-called [[3G]] (third-generation) mobile telephone technology.

In 2000, Swisscom won a [[UMTS]] (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) license. While others, including [[Vodafone]], paid billions for their UMTS licenses, Swisscom paid just CHF 50 million, which softened the blow on the company when the bottom dropped out of the UMTS market soon after.
In the early 2000s, Swisscom also began rolling out new [[DSL]] (digital subscriber line) broadband technology. Its customer base revealed a rapid grow, increasing to 200,000 subscribers by the beginning of 2003. Compared to its European competitors whose profit forecasts were hindered by significant indebtedness, the company accumulated between CHF 5 billion and CHF 10 billion for possible acquisitions.

These funds enabled the company to target the growing wireless "[[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]" market—that is, areas providing [[wireless network]] access. In May 2003, its newly formed subsidiary, Swisscom Eurospot, merged with the Netherlands' Aervik, which operated some ten [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]] and had access to another 45 sites. By the end of that month, Swisscom advanced its position on the European [[WiFi]] market segment by acquiring England's Megabeam and Germany's WLAN AG. As a result, the company controlled 206 hotspots in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] as well as the third-largest [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]] network in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="company-histories.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Modern times===
The former state-owned [[Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland)|PTT]] ('''P'''ost, '''T'''elegraph, '''T'''elephone, founded 1852) was privatised in several stages from 1988 onwards and became a public limited company with special legal status in October 1998.&lt;ref name="AR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://report.swisscom.ch/en/annual-report/management-commentary/financial-review/key-financial-figures|title=Annual Report 2014 Key Financial Figures |accessdate=24 March 2015 |publisher=Swisscom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]] currently holds 51.0% of the share capital.&lt;ref name="AR2014"/&gt; The Telecommunications Enterprise Act limits outside participation to 49.9% of the share capital.&lt;ref name=TUG&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesgesetz über die Organisation der Telekommunikationsunternehmung des Bundes|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.admin.ch%2Fopc%2Fde%2Fclassified-compilation%2F19970161%2Findex.html|website=www.admin.ch|publisher=Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 5 April 2006 message, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] proposed to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Parliament]] that Swisscom should be completely privatised and that the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]] should sell its shares in stages. On 10 May 2006, the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] declined to support the proposal. On 20 May 2006, the Advisory Committee of the Council of States advised the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]] to endorse the proposal – but only so that it could be referred back to the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] for revision.

'''Swisscom (Switzerland) Ltd''' underwent a reorganisation on 1 January 2008. The subsidiary companies Fixnet, Mobile and Solutions were dissolved and were eventually replaced by Residential Customers, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Enterprise Customers, Wholesale as well as the IT, Network &amp; Innovation segments.&lt;ref name="AR2014 Business overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=AR2014 Business overview|url=http://report.swisscom.ch/en/annual-report/introduction/best-networked-world-always-and-everywhere/business-overview|publisher=Swisscom|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IT platforms together with the fixed-network and mobile communications infrastructures of the former Group companies were merged into the “IT, Network &amp; Innovation” Division.
[[File:Zuerich Fernmeldezentrum.jpg|thumb|Swisscom Telecommunication Centre Herdern in Zürich by architect Theo Hotz]]
Currently, Swisscom operations are performed via three operating divisions,&lt;ref name="Business overview"/&gt; Swisscom Switzerland, [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]], and other operating segments. Swisscom Switzerland is divided into the following segments: Residential Customers, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Enterprise Customers, Wholesale and IT, Network &amp; Innovation.&lt;ref name="Business overview"/&gt;

Swisscom '''Network &amp; IT''' builds, operates and maintains Swisscom's nationwide fixed-line and mobile communications infrastructure in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Business overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=AR 2014, Business overview|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/content/dam/swisscom/de/about/investoren/documents/2015/2014-annual-results.pdf|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=4 April 2015|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division is also responsible for the corresponding IT platforms and is in charge of migrating the networks to an integrated IT and IP-based platform (All-IP).&lt;ref name="Business overview"/&gt;

In the first half of 2007, Swisscom acquired a majority holding in the Italian company [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]]. During the offer period, which ran from 10 April to 15 May 2007, Swisscom acquired 80.7% of [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|FASTWEB]]'s share capital, which, when added to Swisscom's existing stake, meant that Swisscom owned 82.4% of [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]] shares by the cut-off date of 22 May. The total transaction amounted to EUR 4.2 billion or CHF 6.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=swisscom |url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2010/11/20101112_MM_Fastweb_Aktie.html |title=Takeover offer for Fastweb shares was successful |publisher=Swisscom |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219171451/https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2010/11/20101112_MM_Fastweb_Aktie.html |archivedate=19 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|FASTWEB]] currently operates the second largest network in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Business overview"/&gt;

===Hospitality Services===
Swisscom Hospitality Services (SHS) is a division of Swisscom AG specifically aimed at the hotel industry and offering specialised network and communication solutions.&lt;ref name="Business overview"/&gt;

SHS services are used e.g. by [[Hyatt]], [[Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group|Rezidor]], IHG, [[Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts|Marriott]], [[Hilton Worldwide]], [[AccorHotels|Accor]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel partners|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/business/hospitality/about/hotel-partners.html|website=swisscom - Business - About Us|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other large hotel groups across [[North America]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia-Pacific]].&lt;ref name=SHS&gt;{{cite web|title=Swisscom - About Swisscom Hospitality Services|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/content/dam/swisscom/en/biz/hospitality-new/pdf/SHS-CompanyBrochure-E-version.pdf|website=Swisscom - Business - About Us|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2002 as Swisscom Eurospot, the company originally specialised in providing High-Speed Internet Access (HSIA) services to hotel guests in European 4- and 5-star hotels.&lt;ref name="SHS profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serving hoteliers since 2002|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/business/hospitality/about/company-profile/history.html|website=swisscom - Business - about us|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rising complexity of information and communication technology and increasing cost pressures affecting the hotel business, SHS expanded their range of applications including Voice over IP, Hotel TV, High-speed Internet and tablet-based room controls that are offered through a converged hotel network infrastructure.&lt;ref name="SHS profile"/&gt;

In 2012, the company introduced a Managed Network Services offering specifically for its hotel customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swisscom Hospitality - Serving Hoteliers and their Guests|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/business/hospitality.html|website=swisscom - Business|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Swisscom Hospitality Services became part of a new company, Hoist Group, following its acquisition by the Sweden-based HoistLocatel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HoistLocatel and Swisscom Hospitality Services are now Hoist Group|url=http://www.hoistgroup.com/news-int/2015/06/03/hoistlocatel-and-swisscom-hospitality-services-are-now-hoist-group/|website=hoistgroup - News &amp;amp; Press - Press Releases|publisher=hoistgroup|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoist Group develops and supplies systems, products and services to independent hotels and hotel chains, hospitals and public venues in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Hoist Group|url=http://www.hoistgroup.com/about-us-int//|website=hoistgroup - About Us|publisher=hoistgroup|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud and data centers===

In 2013, Swisscom announced its plan to build a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] service based in [[Switzerland]]. In consequence, the service has to comply to the strict privacy laws of [[Switzerland]]. Although the data are to be stored within [[Switzerland]]'s borders, users would have global access. Thus, individuals and businesses are protected from intervention of foreign authorities, and less stringent foreign [[data privacy]] laws.&lt;ref name="The Whir Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Carsten Roetz on Swisscom's Swiss cloud|url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/qa-carsten-roetz-on-swisscoms-swiss-cloud|website=The Whir|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Swisscom's main focus is on Swiss-based clients, especially banking clients, it also targets foreign-based clients who are seeking protection for their data privacy.

For individuals in [[Switzerland]], Swisscom also offers "Docsafe", a [[cloud storage]] solution targeting at optimum security for documents.&lt;ref name="Swisscom Docsafe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Docsafe official site|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/residential/internet/security/docsafe.html|website=Swisscom|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents can be uploaded and accessed via web or an app and are free-of-charge with unlimited storage space. Swisscom's [[Cloud computing|cloud service]] is comparable to the [[Cloud computing|cloud service]] of [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] but without a desktop [[Client (computing)|client]].

Swisscom offers a Platform-as-a-Service cloud based on [[Cloud Foundry]] known as Swisscom Application Cloud for developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.swisscom.com/|title=Swisscom Developer Portal|website=developer.swisscom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New business fields===
Swisscom considers infrastructure to form the basis for its products and services.&lt;ref name="Annual report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate strategy and objectives|url=http://report.swisscom.ch/en/annual-report/management-commentary/strategy-organisation-and-environment/corporate-strategy-and-objectives#anchor-2|website=Annual report|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current increasingly competitive global environment, the company's strategy involves adapting to these new conditions by developing business models and by further developing its [[Natel]] infinity pricing plans, in order to ensure a sustained source of revenue.&lt;ref name="Annual report"/&gt; Therefore, the company decided to develop its national and international offerings based on a high-speed cloud infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Annual report"/&gt; In addition, for the banking, healthcare and energy sectors, Swisscom opted for developing vertical solutions.&lt;ref name="Annual report"/&gt; Recent examples in these fields include the testing of [[Autonomous car|driver-less cars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swisscom reveals the first driverless car on Swiss roads|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2015/05/20150512-MM-selbstfahrendes-Auto.html|website=Media|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=13 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928062253/https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/medien/press-releases/2015/05/20150512-MM-selbstfahrendes-Auto.html|archivedate=28 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploring the opportunities in the healthcare market, striving to make intelligent power networks, and forming a partnership with [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]] in the area of [[e-commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swisscom-Chef Urs Schaeppi "Wenn wir etwas machen, schreien immer alle auf"|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzz.ch%2Fnzzas%2Fnzz-am-sonntag%2Fwenn-wir-etwas-machen-schreien-immer-alle-auf-1.18612346|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swisscom StartUp Challenge ===
The Swisscom StartUp Challenge has been held for five successive years. The program provides ten selected tech startups (five early stage and five late stage) the chance to join a tailor-made week-long business acceleration program in [[Silicon Valley]], where they can further develop their ideas and meet with industry experts, investors and potential customers. From all submissions, ten finalists are selected and invited to pitch before a jury. The jury then gives a feedback and names the five winners. The Challenge is organized in collaboration with [[VentureLab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.startupticker.ch/en/news/march-2017/swisscom-launches-swisscom-startup-challenge-2017|title=Swisscom launches Swisscom StartUp Challenge 2017 Startupticker.ch {{!}} The Swiss Startup News channel|website=www.startupticker.ch|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, over 200 startups participated in the challenge. The winners were Advanon, Flashwell, Nanolive, Qumram and Xsensio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ict.swisscom.ch/2016/08/swisscom-startup-challenge-and-the-winner-is/|title=Swisscom StartUp Challenge: And the winner is…|work=Swisscom ICT|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate Responsibility==

Complying with the recommendations of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance 2014 issued by [[economiesuisse]] and meeting the requirements of the Ordinance Against Excessive Compensation in Listed Stock Companies, Swisscom opted for practicing effective and transparent [[corporate governance]].&lt;ref name="CG report 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/content/dam/swisscom/en/about/governance/documents/2014-corporate-governance-en.pdf.res/2014-corporate-governance-en.pdf|title=Corporate Governance Report 2014|website=swisscom.ch|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Swisscom's corporate responsibility strategy involves fostering long-standing partnerships in the areas of climate and environmental protection, sustainable living and working, social responsibility and media expertise.&lt;ref name="sustainability"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/sustainability/partners.html|title=About Swisscom|website=swisscom.ch|publisher=swisscom|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swisscom was ranked 20th in the recent list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World.&lt;ref name="Global 100"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World|url=http://theogm.com/2012/08/15/the-global-100-most-sustainable-corporations-in-the-world/|publisher=OGM|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
On the market segment for [[Mobile telephony|mobile telecommunication]] services, the main competitors for Swisscom are represented by [[Orange S.A.|Salt]] and [[Sunrise Communications AG]]. For the 6th consecutive year, "Connect" magazine named Swisscom the winner of its yearly network test by comparing telephone and data services of the three largest providers in 2015.&lt;ref name="Connect magazine network test"&gt;{{cite web|title=Netztest Schweiz: Die Handy-Netze im Vergleich |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.connect.de%2Fvergleich%2Fnetztest-2014-bestes-handy-netz-schweiz-vergleich-2744063.html|website=Connect|publisher=Connect magazine|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connect network test===
In the network test, conducted in the [[germanophone]] region of [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], by Connect magazine, Swisscom secured a second position in the category "phone network", with [[Sunrise Communications AG|Sunrise]] being able to closely lead in this category mainly benefiting from Swisscom's slower connection time for telephone calls.&lt;ref name="Connect magazine network test" /&gt;

In the category "data network", the success rates for the connection to the internet for all three main networks are close to 100% with Swisscom providing the fastest download and upload data rate, even in less urban areas.&lt;ref name="Connect magazine network test" /&gt;

Based on overall results of 2016, "Connect" magazine awarded Swisscom the prize of "Best Network". However, the gap between Swisscom and the two other companies has shrunk significantly as compared to e.g. 2012. The test also revealed significant improvements in services for all companies involved.&lt;ref name="Swisscom network"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/network.html|title=Possibilities grow with the network|website=Swisscom|publisher=Swisscom|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tagesanzeiger.ch%2Fwirtschaft%2Funternehmen-und-konjunktur%2Fservice-public-die-swisscom-aergert-am-meisten%2Fstory%2F31096626|title=Service public: Die Swisscom ärgert am meisten|website=tagesanzeiger.ch/|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the Swiss newspaper [[Tages-Anzeiger|Tagesanzeiger]], some consumers criticized Swisscom's international roaming rates and its subscription rates for mobile phones. The main concern of the consumers in the survey was that they found the rates to be too high.

[[File:Demobilisation of the British Army D26323.jpg|thumb|right|A Second World War British soldier selects a jacket for his "demob suit". These suits are one of the possible origins of the phrase]]
'''''The full monty''''' (or '''''the full Monty''''') is a British [[slang]] phrase of uncertain origin. It is generally used to mean "everything which is necessary, appropriate or possible; ‘the works’".&lt;ref name="oed" /&gt; Similar North American phrases include ''the whole [[kit and caboodle]]'',{{refn|name=Dent}} ''[[the whole nine yards]]'',{{refn|name=Gooden}} ''the whole ball of wax'', ''the whole enchilada'', ''the whole shebang'', or ''[going] whole hog''.

The phrase was first identified in print by the OED in the 1980s. Anecdotal evidence exists for earlier usage;&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt; the phrase was also used as the name for some [[fish and chip shop]]s in [[Manchester]] during the same period.&lt;ref name="Gooden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Games"/&gt;

Hypothesized origins of the phrase include:

* [[Field Marshal Montgomery]]'s preference for a large breakfast, even while on campaign.&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gooden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinion" /&gt;
* A full [[three-piece suit]] with [[waistcoat]] and a spare pair of trousers from the [[Leeds]]-based British tailors [[Burton (retailer)|Montague Burton]].{{refn|name=Dent}}{{refn|name=Gooden}} When the British forces were demobilised after the Second World War, they were issued with a "[[demob suit]]". The contract for supplying these suits was partly fulfilled by Montague Burton.{{refn|name=Quinion}}
* Gamblers’ jargon, meaning the entire kitty or [[pot (poker)|pot]], deriving from the card game called [[Monte_Bank|monte]].&lt;ref name="Quinion" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4295">[[Telugu language|Telugu]] is one of the Indian languages that has had the earliest [[Tirukkural translations]] in modern times. As of 2000, there are at least 14 translations of the [[Kural text]] available in Telugu.

==Background==
With the first translation of the Kural text into Telugu made in 1877, Telugu has seen a series of translations before the turn of the 20th century. The first translation was titled ''Trivarga Dipika'' made by Venkatrama Srividyanandaswami of the Kanuparti family, who presented it with elaborate notes.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; The second translation appeared in 1892 under the title ''Trivargamu'' made by Sakkam Narasimhalu Naidu. It was not a complete translation but only select couplets were translated.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; In 1906, another translation of selections was made by C. Lakshminarayana Sastry.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; In 1948, Telugu poet P. Sriramulu Reddi, who translated Kambaramayana into Telugu, published a translation of the Kural.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; In 1954, Challa Radhakrishna Sarma made a translation under the title ''Tamila Vedamu''.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; Another translation was published in 1955 by Jalayya under the title ''Nitisudha''.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"/&gt; In 1966,  Sonti Sripati Sastry published a translation titled ''Sri Padula''.&lt;ref name="TKSeminarPapers"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">[[Image:Vrad on turkey creek.png|thumb|[[Serving area interface|Cross-connect box]] (left) and VRAD (right) on a suburban street in Houston, Texas.]]A '''video-ready access device''' ('''VRAD''') provides [[digital subscriber line]] access and [[high-definition television]] programming to customers subscribed to [[IPTV]] services such as [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[U-verse]], [[Bell Canada]]'s [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Claro Puerto Rico]]'s [[Claro TV]], and [[Telus]]'s [[Optik TV]]. VRAD equipment manufactured by [[Alcatel-Lucent]] can be configured to support between 48 and 864 lines per box.&lt;ref name=alcatel/&gt; The VRAD boxes are composed of circuit boards providing service, fed by [[fiber-optic communications|fiber-optic]] cable.

==AT&amp;T VRADs==
There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by AT&amp;T: [[Fiber to the x|FTTN]] (fiber to the node), and [[FTTP]] (fiber to the premises).

FTTN, widely used where copper facilities exist in established neighborhoods, uses an [[Alcatel-Lucent]] 7330 Intelligent Services Access Manager (ISAM) shelf,&lt;ref name=bbp&gt;[https://archive.is/20130122071408/http://broadbandpropertiesmagazine.epubxpress.com/wps/portal/bbp/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3iLkCAPEzcPIwP3MF9TAyMnT0_PYDdvY3dLc_1I_ShznPIBxvohIBMz9SPNTCwtQMxi_UgDEF2gH2lsoF-QnZhUlRqpCADUQLI_/ Post Alexander, Atlanta, Ga.], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the existing copper wiring to customers' homes, leading to distance limitations from the VRAD cabinet to the customer's home. The 7330 ISAM is an [[IP-DSLAM|internet protocol DSL access multiplexer]] that supports [[VDSL]] and [[ADSL]] protocols.&lt;ref name=alcatel&gt;[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w3dnTRL8h2VAQADYR9IA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Solution_Product_Catalog&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=Products/Product_Detail_000413.xml&amp;LMSG_PARENT=Product_Families/Product_Family_000130.xml Alcatel-Lucent 7330 ISAM FTTN ANSI]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FTTP system uses an Alcatel-Lucent 7340 ISAM shelf, which is mostly used in areas such as new neighborhoods or large-scale developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a [[Primary Flexibility Point]], which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. In FTTP systems, the fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the [[network interface device]]. In FTTD (fiber to the desk) systems, the fiber can continue to an equipment room or garage, then to a decoder box or [[residential gateway]], then to the customer's TV, computer, and phone lines.

The VRAD typically connects upstream to an Alcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet service switch in the [[Telephone exchange|central office]] hub, then to the [[cable television headend|headend]] [[video hub office]].&lt;ref name=bbp/&gt;

VRADs required for U-verse are around {{convert|150|cm|in}} wide, {{convert|122|cm|in}} tall, and {{convert|66|cm|in}} deep. Size and graffiti risk have drawn complaints from homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATTs-Latest-VRAD-Headache-Graffiti-96209 AT&amp;T's Latest VRAD Headache: Graffiti - City of New Haven now annoyed with box tagging...]&lt;/ref&gt; AT&amp;T has sued competitor [[Comcast]] for Chicago ads against AT&amp;T's "large and unsightly" VRADs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6554809.html?desc=topstory AT&amp;T, Comcast Trade Jabs In Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt; Four VRADs have exploded due to faulty [[lithium-ion batteries]] manufactured by Avestor (now bankrupt), at least one explosion sending parts "fifty feet throughout the neighborhood." AT&amp;T replaced all 17,000 Avestor batteries used in its VRADs with safer [[Alcatel-Lucent]]-designed [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] [[NiCad]] batteries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/91000 AT&amp;T Replacing 17,000 U-Verse Batteries - Apparently the units aren't supposed to spontaneously combust]&lt;/ref&gt; which have a 10-year life.

==Other VRADs==
[[Bell Canada]]'s [[Bell Fibe TV]] and [[Telus]]'s [[Optik TV]] also use VRADs in their networks. Bell Canada uses the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 and [[Ikanos Communications]] IKNS ISAMs, and provides Internet service via either [[FTTN]] to 50 Mbit/s, or [[FTTH]] (fibre to the home) to 700 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Internet_access Bell Internet Packages]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claro Puerto Rico]] is currently deploying VRADs to offer their [[IPTV]] and [[VDSL]] Internet service up to 50Mbit/s. There are 2 types of VRAD systems currently used by Claro: [[Fiber to the x|FTTN]] (fiber to the node), and [[FTTP]] (fiber to the premises). It is unknown the equipment they are using.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Voice broadcasting''' is a [[mass communication]] technique, begun in the 1990s,{{dubious|reason=[[War Games (film)]] was 1983; CA outlawed practice in 1987|date=February 2017}} that [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s [[telephone]] [[message]]s to hundreds or thousands of [[called party|call recipient]]s at once.  This technology has both [[commerce|commercial]] and [[community]] applications.  Voice broadcast users can contact targets (whether they be members, subscribers, constituents, employees, or customers) almost immediately.  When used by government authorities, it may be known as an [[emergency notification system]] (since such notifications are intended only for use in emergencies).

Voice broadcast systems manage a [[database]] of phone lists as well as digitally recorded phone messages.  Using [[telephony]] components, these [[computer]]s can simultaneously broadcast thousands of phone messages.  [[Personalize]]d information can be included in the phone messages through the integration of [[text-to-speech]] software.

Advanced systems include telephony boards with [[answering machine|answering-machine]] detection, and the logic to properly play a unique message to answering machines without message [[truncation]].

==Interactive voice broadcasting==
'''Interactive voice broadcasting''' (also referred to as '''interactive voice messaging''') programs allow the call recipient to listen to the recorded message and interact with the system by pressing keys on the phone keypad. The system can detect which key is pressed and be programmed to interact and play various messages accordingly. This is a form of [[Interactive voice response]] (IVR).

The actions that can be programmed may include [[customer survey|surveys]], information [[confirmation]], contact preference confirmation, or navigation through a phone [[menu (computing)|menu]]. An example of the use of this technology is [[automated phone survey]]s, where professional [[opinion poll|polling]] organizations place [[automatic call]]s to conduct surveys. Respondents are provided survey questions that are answered using [[DTMF]]-tone [[keypad]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quick Guide to New Survey Methods|url=http://www.hhh.umn.edu/img/assets/23538/A%20Quick%20Guide%20to%20New%20Survey%20Methods.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=14 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110170534/http://www.hhh.umn.edu/img/assets/23538/A%20Quick%20Guide%20to%20New%20Survey%20Methods.pdf|archive-date=10 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More qualitative results can be captured by allowing call recipients to leave their own voice message instead of just button presses. This function can not only be used for "[[grassroots]]" [[lobbying]], but can be used to allow loved ones to leave voice messages for each other when separated after a [[disaster]].

==Voice broadcasting law==

'''Voice broadcasting law''' is a subset of laws under [[telemarketing]] law. One of the most recent of these laws is the 2008 [[Telemarketing Sales Rule]] Amendment as issued by the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).{{dubious|reason=TSR is not law; FTC writes regulations; Congress writes laws|date=February 2017}} Predictive dialing drop call rates and prerecorded message delivery restrictions were provided in the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FTC Issues Final Telemarketing Sales Rule Amendments Regarding Prerecorded Calls: Rule Will Halt Prerecorded Sales Calls Unless the Seller Obtains Consumer's Permission|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/08/tsr.shtm|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

==Popularity==

Voice broadcasting is a popular method of [[direct marketing]]. Industry groups such as insurance, real estate, [[telemarketing]], healthcare, direct sales, etc., have used it to create leads or as a follow-up method to their existing or past customers and/or current prospects. Also, one example of the popularity is its use by [[nonprofit organizations]] (NPOs). For example, an NPO can use voice broadcasting to send a simple "thank you" message to its donor base. This may be very valuable especially when an organization is manpower constrained and there is a large donor list to call periodically, e.g., quarterly, to thank or to request additional donations.

==Two voice broadcasting methods for lead creation==

Two popular methods to create marketing leads with voice broadcasting are to deliver a prerecorded interactive message and the voicemail message. The prerecorded message is commonly referred to as the "press one" method. The [[dialer]] or voice broadcasting system calls the consumer, plays a marketing message, and then asks the recipient to press a number on their keypad (e.g., "1") to receive more information or to connect with a live agent.

Instead of reaching the consumer, the consumer's answering machine may have answered the call. The dialer may use an [[answering machine detection]] (AMD) algorithm and leave a message on the prospect's answering machine. The objective is for the recipient to check and listen to their messages, and then to call back the phone number in the prerecorded message for more information.

Both of these methods cost much less than making calls with live sales agents. Making a voice broadcast call in the U.S. costs one or two cents. The voice broadcast call does not have a significant labor cost (a $20/hour sales agent consumes $0.33 per minute). Live sales agents are expensive, so telemarketers using live agents will purchase marketing lists that identify good demographic targets. Voice broadcast marketing is cheap enough that marketers may not bother purchasing marketing lists. Voice broadcast marketing only needs live agents for those prospects who express interest in the product by pressing "1" or calling back.

Consumers do not like automated cold calls,&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 102-243 &amp;sect; Findings&lt;/ref&gt; so many jurisdictions have made marketing voice broadcasts illegal unless the recipient has previously consented to such calls. The U.S. Congress passed the [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act]] (TCPA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 227&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients of illegal voice broadcast calls under the TCPA may sue the caller for statutory damages of $500 to $1500 per violation.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 227(b)(3)&lt;/ref&gt; TCPA class actions have been settled for millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;''Desai v ADT'', Northern District of Illinois, 11 C 1925, settled for $15 million.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bigclassaction.com/settlement/adt-robocalls-class-action-lawsuit-tcpa.php&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the TCPA was enacted, state laws prohibited voice broadcast solicitations. California's [[Consumers Legal Remedies Act]] prohibited many such calls&lt;ref&gt;California Civil Code &amp;sect; 1770(a)(22)&lt;/ref&gt; and allows plaintiffs to recover attorneys' fees.
