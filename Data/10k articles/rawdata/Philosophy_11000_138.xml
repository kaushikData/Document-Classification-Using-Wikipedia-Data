'''Acharya Vamana''' (latter half of the 8th century - early 9th century)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VGxKTDT0h2kC&amp;pg=PA1582&amp;lpg=PA1582&amp;dq=riti+theory+of+vamana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RJDaIVX4p3&amp;sig=oeOTSMBArS0p8T3wQqWR4nC9YjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7xbBUq3gJ87_rAeg1oHoAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=riti%20theory%20of%20vamana&amp;f=false Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Pali Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; was an Indian [[Rhetoric|Rhetorician]].

Vamana's investigation into the nature of a [[Kāvya]] is known as theory of Riti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/thephilosophyofritiapr69.htm The Philosophy of Riti - Yabaluri.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vamana’s [[Kavyalankara Sutra]] is considered as the first attempt at evolving a [[Philosophy of education|philosophy]] of literary [[aesthetics]]. He regarded that riti is the soul of Kavya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vamana Vamana definition of Vamana in the Free Online Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his formulations in the form of [[Sutras]].

{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}
'''''An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture''''' is a [[dissertation]] by the English mathematician and scholar [[Isaac Newton]]. This was sent in a letter to [[John Locke]] on 14 November 1690 and built upon the textual work of [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] and his own research. The text was first published in English in 1754, 27 years after his death. The account claimed to{{citation needed|reason=Where exactly did Newton make this claim?  I suspect this sentence originated in the 1977 Watchtower April 15 page 244, which says "It reviewed all the textual evidence available from ancient sources", and somebody then inserted "claimed to".  But unless it can be demonstrated that NEWTON made this claim, it would be more accurate to say "has been clamied to" or just change this sentence altogether.|date=March 2014}} review all the [[Textual criticism|textual evidence]] available from ancient sources on two disputed Bible passages: {{bibleverse|1John|5:7|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|1Timothy|3:16|NIV}}.

Newton describes this letter as "an account of what the reading has been in all ages, and what steps it has been changed, as far as I can hitherto determine by records",&lt;ref name="An Historical Account, p. 1"&gt;An Historical Account, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "a criticism concerning a text of Scripture".&lt;ref name="An Historical Account, p. 2"&gt;An Historical Account, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He blames "the Roman church" for many abuses in the world&lt;ref name="An Historical Account, p. 1"/&gt; and accuses it of "[[pious fraud]]s".&lt;ref name="An Historical Account, p. 2"/&gt; He adds that "the more learned and quick-sighted men, as [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Erasmus]], [[Heinrich Bullinger|Bullinger]], [[Grotius]], and some others, would not dissemble their knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Account, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==1 John 5:7==
{{See also|Comma Johanneum}}

In the [[King James Version]] Bible, [[1 John 5#Verse 7|1 John 5:7]] reads:

{{quote|For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, [[Logos|the Word]], and the [[Holy Ghost]]: and these three are one.}}

Using the writings of the early [[Church Fathers]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] manuscripts and the testimony of the first versions of the Bible, Newton claims to have demonstrated that the words "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one", that support the [[Trinity]] doctrine, did not appear in the original Greek Scriptures. He then attempts to demonstrate that the purportedly spurious reading crept into the Latin versions, first as a [[Biblical gloss|marginal note]], and later into the text itself. He noted that "the Æthiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] versions, still in use in the several Eastern nations, Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, [[Muscovy]], and some others, are strangers to this reading".&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Account, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; He argued&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; that it was first taken into a Greek text in 1515 by [[Cardinal Ximenes]] on the strength of a late Greek manuscript 'corrected' from the Latin. Finally, Newton considered the sense and context of the verse, concluding that removing the [[Glosses to the Bible|interpolation]] makes "the sense plain and natural, and the argument full and strong; but if you insert the testimony of 'the Three in Heaven' you interrupt and spoil it."&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Today most versions of the Bible are from the Critical Text and omit this verse, or retain it as only a marginal reading.

==1 Timothy 3:16==
The shorter portion of Newton's dissertation was concerned with [[1 Timothy]] 3:16, which reads (in the [[King James Version]]):

{{quote|And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.}}

Newton argued that, by a small alteration in the Greek text, the word "God" was substituted to make the phrase read "God was manifest in the flesh" instead of "which was manifested in the flesh".&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Newton only gave in translation the literal texts, "which" (from the Latin) or "who" (from some Greek mss). "These ancient Latins all cite the text after this manner, Great is the mystery of Godliness, which was manifested in the flesh" p. 231 In quoting Cyril of Alexandria Newton translates, "Ye err," saith he, "not knowing the Scriptures, nor the great mystery of godliness, that is Christ; who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit."  p.238. and  "Moreover," saith he, "in my opinion, that mystery of godliness is nothing else than he who came to us from God the Father ; the Word, who was manifested in the flesh." p.239.  Newton contends that the original Greek was or ὅ (which), changed to ὃς (who) and then to  	
θεός (God) (see p. 230 and p. 232 "Chrysostom, I am satisfied that he read ὅ", p.234 Nestorius, p.237 John Cassian, and pp. 252–253 "it is more reasonable to lay the fault on the Greeks... in the Greek the sense was obscure; in the versions clear" .) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YsMPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA231 Two Notable Corruptions] About this from Newton, John Burgon commented "Over this latter reading, however, we need not linger; seeing that ὅ does not find a single patron at the present day. And yet, this was the reading which was eagerly upheld during the last century: Wetstein and Sir Isaac Newton being its most strenuous advocates." ''Revision Revised'', p.100&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to demonstrate that early Church writers in referring to the verse knew nothing of such an alteration.&lt;ref&gt;In 1731 [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] turned his attention to this passage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of both passages==
Newton concludes: "If the ancient churches in debating and deciding the greatest mysteries of religion, knew nothing of these two texts, I understand not, why we should be so fond of them now the debates are over."&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture. p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; With minor exceptions, it was only in the nineteenth century that Bible translations appeared changing these passages. Modern versions of the Bible from the Critical Text usually omit the addition to [[Comma Johanneum|1 John 5:7]], but some place it in a footnote, with a comment indicating that "it is not found in the earliest manuscripts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:6–8;&amp;version=31; Biblegateway].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern translations of 1 Timothy 3:16 following the Critical Text now typically replace "God" with "He" or "He who", while the literal Emphasized has "who".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%203:16;&amp;version=31; Biblegateway]&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of papers in the years following responded to Newton, notably John Berriman in 1741, who had seen at least some of Newton's text prior to publication. Later, Frederick Nolan in 1815, Ebenezer Henderson in 1830 and John William Burgon in the Revision Revised in 1883 all contributed substantially to the verse discussion.

==Historical background==
Newton did not publish these findings during his lifetime, likely due to the political climate. Those who wrote against the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] were subject to persecution in England. The [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] made it an offence to deny one of the persons of the Trinity to be God, punishable with loss of office and employment on the first occasion, further legal ramifications on the second occasion, and imprisonment without hope for bail on the third occasion. Newton's friend [[William Whiston]] (translator of the works of [[Josephus]]) lost his professorship at [[Cambridge]] for this reason in 1711. In 1693 a pamphlet attacking the Trinity was burned by order of the [[House of Lords]], and the next year its printer and author were prosecuted. In 1697 [[Thomas Aikenhead]], an eighteen-year-old student charged with denying the Trinity, was [[Hanging|hanged]] at [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower April 15, 1977 page 245 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissertation was published in 1754.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/tas/locke/mss/c1690.html John Locke Manuscripts – Chronological Listing: 1690]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour buffer strips used to retain soil and reduce erosion.]]

A '''buffer strip''' is an area of land maintained in permanent [[vegetation]] that helps to control [[air quality index|air]], [[soil quality|soil]], and [[water quality]], along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in [[agriculture]]. Buffer strips trap [[sediment]], and enhance [[filtration]] of [[nutrient]]s and [[pesticide]]s by slowing down [[surface runoff|runoff]] that could enter the local [[surface water]]s. The [[root|root systems]] of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]] and stabilize [[stream bed|stream banks]] providing protection against substantial [[erosion]] and [[landslide]]s. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing [[crop]] fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.

Buffer strips can have several different configurations of vegetation found on them varying from simply grass to combinations of grass, trees, and shrubs. Areas with diverse vegetation provide more protection from nutrient and pesticide flow and at the same time provide better [[biodiversity]] amongst [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), (2000). [http://www.wsi.nrcs.usda.gov/products/W2Q/pest/docs/newconbuf.pdf "Conservation Buffers to Reduce Pesticide Losses."] March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodstock Conservation Commission (2000). [http://www.woodstockconservation.org/buffer_strips.htm Buffer Strips- Common Sense Conservation.] Town of Woodstock, CT. Retrieved 2009-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many country, state, and local governments provide financial [[incentive]]s for [[conservation movement|conservation programs]] such as buffer strips because they help stabilize the environment even when the land is being used. Buffer strips not only stabilize the land but can also provide a visual demonstration that land is under [[stewardship]].

==Types==
===Buffers within fields===

A [[grassed waterway]] reduces soil erosion and captures most nutrients and pesticides that would normally wash out of crop fields and into major waters. These waterways help to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to an area where it will have a stable outlet.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; Outlets must be adequate enough to allow water to drain without ponding or flooding the area being protected, while also preventing erosion of the water into the outlet which can be accomplished through the use of [[riprap]]. A limitation is during large runoff events, when soil is saturated, grassed waterways will have a very concentrated flow of water making them not as effective during high rainfalls. Grassed waterways require very little maintenance once they are introduced with major upkeep being mowing of the grass and reseeding. Farm machinery and cattle can cross these waterways but it may be hazardous during wet periods. One of the major disadvantages of waterways are actually getting them established. A late summer or early fall seeding when rainfall is minimal is recommended to allow the seed to have the best chance at establishing a root system.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, R. (1994). [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/engineer/facts/94-039.htm "Fact Sheet: Grassed Waterways."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807220249/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/engineer/facts/94-039.htm |date=August 7, 2007 }} Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Order No. 94-039.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contour buffer strips are strips of perennial vegetation alternated with wider cultivated strips of cropland. This type of buffer strip is most effective when runoff water enters uniformly as sheetflow.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; They are very adapted to trapping pesticides and reducing [[Water erosion|rill erosion]]. These buffers need to be at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide and make up for 20 to 30 percent of slope of an area. A lot of the time contour buffers can be used as a very inexpensive substitute for terraces. Most of the time a grass is selected that can be harvested during mid-summer. These buffers are not permanent and can be moved up and down hillsides from season to season in order to re-establish vegetation.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

===Edge of field buffers===
Vegetative barriers are narrower buffer strips of hardy, native, perennial grasses or shrubs planted in parallel rows to crops.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, K.D. et al. (1999). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T3X-3WG31V3-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1999&amp;_alid=922970396&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=4958&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=61b71abf24cf643b417eb4f9b686f503 "Study on the performance of contour vegetative barriers in an arid region using numerical models."] ''Agricultural Water Management,'' 41:1, June 1999. {{DOI|10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00114-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are very effective in reducing wind and water erosion which results in sediment trapping and water infiltration. They function in similar fashion to a contour buffer strip, just much narrower.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

Field borders are bands or strips of perennial vegetation that is found on the edge of a cropland field. Field borders help with runoff only when it flows over the strip. They’re very effective in benefiting spraying operations because they allow for extra room between adjacent fields. They also provide room for farming equipment to turn around. Field borders are effective in reducing wind and water erosion and provide great wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

Filter strips are areas of grass or other permanent vegetation that protect riparian areas from sediment runoff, pesticides, pathogens, organics and nutrients. These strips are very important in protecting stream banks and water quality. Filter strips work best when other conservation practices are used in order to drain water in their direction.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; Filter strips were originally used mostly in agriculture, but now are a common practice in urban areas where water quality has become an increasingly important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Watershed Protection (1997). [http://www.stormwatercenter.net/Assorted%20Fact%20Sheets/Tool6_Stormwater_Practices/Filtering%20Practice/Grassed%20Filter%20Strip.htm "Stormwater Management Fact Sheet: Grassed Filter Strip."] Stormwater Manager's Resource Center.

[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|right|A [[riparian buffer]] of vegetation lining a farm creek in [[Story County, Iowa]].]]
{{Main|Riparian buffer}}
Riparian forest buffers are diverse communities of trees, shrubs and native perennial grasses. They are great for providing habitat for wildlife on land and in the water. Taller trees next to the streams help to lower water temperatures with shade which improves aquatic communities. The shrubs and grasses help to slow flooding and the larger trees can sometimes intercept nitrates before they reach the water with their deep roots.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

===Wind buffers===
{{Main|Windbreak}}
The main purpose of a windbreak or a shelterbelt is to protect areas from wind causing erosion on the bare soil of croplands. Windbreaks can also serve as an area that separates fields and protects them from spray drift of pesticides.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

==Wildlife habitat==
Buffer strips are very important in helping to provide [[habitat]] for many species of [[wildlife]] in the open farm lands by causing an [[edge effect]]. With much of the land open on farms having an edge allows a safe-haven for animals to move between different [[ecosystems]]. Buffers are also helpful in conserving [[biodiversity]] especially to that of rare or endangered species through the incorporation of native grasses into their seeding by the landowner. [[:Category:Native grasses of California|Native grasses]] are especially important to [[pheasant]]s, [[quail]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]] and [[songbird]]s because they provide the foods they need as well as the shelter from predators. Since most buffer strip areas have limited disturbance from farming it allows for a shelter to hide year round for many of the species including insects, birds, and mammals. When buffers run into and follow [[riparian]] areas along stream beds it is important to have larger vegetation like trees and shrubs that shade the water from the open sun. The water is then able to be cooler allowing for greater fish production and other [[aquatic plants]] and other biota to thrive in a less disturbed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/waters/buffer_strips.pdf |title=revision5_11-7-07_buffer strips.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area of vegetation following a body of water is noted as a [[riparian zone]]. These buffer areas often incorporate large trees that protect stream banks from excessive erosion and shade aquatic areas. The shade provided by the larger trees reduces water temperatures and light intensity from [[ultraviolet]] light. Debris including leaves and branches that fell from trees, often contain aquatic invertebrates important to the structure of the water following the "River Continuum" concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivercontinuum.org/files/RCC.178151255.pdf |title=Data |website=www.rivercontinuum.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the riparian zones contain a larger variety of plants the overall diversity is much greater as well. With more [[photosynthesis]] and higher amounts of available water plant primary production can increase in turn creating more potential food for the wildlife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Riparian_zone |title=Riparian zone |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planted vegetation==

The [[USDA]] shows that grassed waterways of less than 5% slopes for a chosen waterway will greatly reduce velocity of draining water within the land.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/grassedwtrway.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) offers the use of an online [[Soil survey]] to view the area of land to be planted and examine slope and soil drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm |title=Web Soil Survey - Home |publisher=Websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As viewed by the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], soil drainage is the number one priority for location of certain grasses. Poorer drainage causes less infiltration of water into the soil as [[groundwater recharge]] causing ponding and flooding of surrounding crops. Higher drainage becomes more droughty which hinders the establishment of certain grasses good for waterways. Medium soil drainage becomes the most suitable for planting. Determining exact grasses and seed amounts to plant follows specifications of a local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide and the Contour Buffer practice standard while taking practice on land and regional environmental conditions into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov/pubs/lapmctn7260.pdf |title=Info |website=www.plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRCS has shown contour strip cropping provides the greatest effectiveness when slopes of the area are within 4-8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awqa.org/pubs/conservation/NRCSPractices/ContourBufferStrips.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025031/http://www.awqa.org/pubs/conservation/NRCSPractices/ContourBufferStrips.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For greater success in lowering the erosion, contour strips on the slopes need to follow the [[contour line|contours]] of the landscape. Row crops like [[maize|corn]], [[legumes]], or [[soybeans]] should alternate strips of small grains or forages to successfully limit erosion and slowing or capturing the runoff of [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]]. Tests from the NRCS have shown that the smaller tighter rooted grasses and [[hay]]s provide more surface cover to prevent rain and wind erosion while slowing runoff, increasing infiltration, and trapping sediment from the high erosive row crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.or.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/conservation-planning-and-conservation-records/contourstripcropping.html |title=Contour Stripcropping &amp;#124; Oregon NRCS |publisher=Or.nrcs.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220121959/http://www.or.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/conservation-planning-and-conservation-records/contourstripcropping.html |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper planting of the contour crops is important for higher success of erosion control to protect highly fertile [[topsoil]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">A '''circannual cycle''' is a biological process that occurs in living creatures over the period of approximately one year. This cycle was first discovered by Ebo Gwinner and Canadian biologist Ted Pengelley.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is classified as an [[Infradian rhythm]], which is biological process with a period longer than that of a circadian rhythm, less than one cycle per 28 hours. These processes continue even in artificial environments in which seasonal cues have been removed by scientists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Circannual rhythm - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095613678|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term circannual is Latin, [[circa]] meaning approximately and [[wikt:annual|annual]] relating to one year. [[Chronobiology]] is the field of biology pertaining to periodic rhythms that occur in living organisms in response to external stimuli such as [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]].

The location of the physical circannual timer in organisms and how it works are almost entirely unknown.

== Examples ==
In one study performed by Eberhard Gwinner, two species of birds were born in a controlled environment without ever being exposed to external stimuli. They were presented with a fixed [[Photoperiodism|Photoperiod]] of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness each day. The birds were exposed to these conditions for eight years and consistently molted at the same time as they would have in the wild, indicating that this physiological cycle is innate rather than governed environmentally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/Biological_clocks.htm|title=Circannual Rhythms, Seasonal Change, Climate and Stress - Darrell Senneke|website=www.chelonia.org|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Ted Pengelley and Ken Fisher studied the circannual clock in the golden-mantled ground squirrel. They exposed the squirrels to twelve hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and at a constant temperature for three years. Despite this constant cycle, they continued to hibernate once a year with each episode preceded by an increase in body weight and food consumption. During the first year, the squirrels began hibernation in late October. They started hibernating in mid August and early April respectively for the following two years, displaying a circannual rhythm with a period of about 10 months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Foster RG, Kreitzman L. Seasons of life: The biological rhythms that enable living things to thrive and survive 1-303.&amp;nbsp;New Haven (Connecticut): Yale University Press.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|9780300115567}}. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example in insects is the [[varied carpet beetle]].

== Biological advantages ==
Generating  biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes in the environment before they occur, thus providing the organisms with time to prepare and survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, some plants have a very strict time frame in regards to blooming and preparing for spring. If they begin their preparations too early or too late they risk not being pollinated, competing with different species, or other factors that might affect their survival rate. Having a circannual cycle may keep them from making this mistake if a particular geographic region experiences a false spring, where the weather becomes exceptionally warm early for a short period of time before returning to winter temperatures.

Similarly, bird plumage and mammal fur change with the approach of winter, and is triggered by the shortening photoperiod of autumn.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwinner|first=Eberhard|date=1996|title=Circannual Clocks in Avian Reproduction and Migration|url=|journal=Ibis|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|volume=138|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circannual cycle can also be useful for animals that [[Animal migration|Migrate]] or [[Hibernation|Hibernate]]. Many animals' reproductive organs change in response to changes in photoperiod. Male gonads will grow during the onset of spring to promote reproduction among the species. These enlarged gonads would be nearly impossible to keep year round and would be inefficient for the species. Many female animals will only produce eggs during certain times of the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Interaction with changing climate ==
Changing climate may unravel ecosystems in which different organisms use different internal calendars. Warming temperatures may lead to earlier blooms of flora in spring. For instance, one study performed by Menzel et al., analyzed 125,000 phenological records of 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 and found that 78% of all plants studied advanced in flowering, leafing, and fruiting while only three percent were significantly delayed. They determined that the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menzel|first=et al.,|date=2006|title=European Phenological Response to Climate Change Matches the Warming Pattern|url=|journal=Global Change Biology|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|volume=12|pages=1969–1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, fauna may breed or migrate based on the length of day, and thus might arrive too late for critical food supplies they co-evolved with.

For example, the [[Parus major]] closely times the hatching of their chicks to the emergence of the protein-rich winter moth caterpillar, which in turn hatches to meet the budding of oaks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These birds are a single-brood bird, meaning they breed once a year with about nine chicks per brood. If the birds and caterpillars and buds all emerge at the right time, the caterpillars eat the new oak leaves and their population increases dramatically, and this hopefully will coincide with the arrival of the new chicks, allowing them to eat. But if plants, insects, and birds respond differently to the advance of spring or other [[phenology]] changes, the relationship may be altered.

As another example, studies of the Pied Flycatcher ([[ficedula hypoleuca]]) have shown that their spring migration timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These particular birds overwinter in dry tropical forest in Western Africa and breed in temperate forests in Europe, over 4,500&amp;nbsp;km away. From 1980-2000, temperatures at the time of arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly. They have advanced their mean laying date by ten days, but have not advanced the spring arrival on their breeding grounds because their migration behavior is triggered by photoperiod rather than temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In short, even if each individual species can easily live with elevated temperatures, disruptions of [[phenology]] timing at ecosystem level may still imperil them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges for scientific study ==
One reason for the paucity of research on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle to the length of the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It takes an entire year to get a time series which makes it difficult to see how these cycles adjust over the years. To put this into perspective, a two-week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.

{{about|the history of Citadel BBS software|the modern Citadel system|Citadel/UX}}

'''Citadel''' is the name of a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) computer program, and of the genre of programs it inspired.   Citadels were notable for their room-based structure (see below) and relatively heavy emphasis on messages and conversation as opposed to gaming and files. The first Citadel came online in 1980 with a single 300 baud modem; eventually many versions of the software, both clones and those descended from the original code base (but all usually called "Citadels"), became popular among BBS callers and sysops, particularly in areas such as the Pacific Northwest, Northern California and Upper Midwest of the United States, where development of the software was ongoing. Citadel BBSes were most popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but when the Internet became more accessible for online communication, Citadels began to decline. However, some versions of the software, from small community BBSes to large systems supporting thousands of simultaneous users, are still in use today. Citadel development has always been collaborative with a strong push to keep the [[source code]] in the [[public domain]]. This makes Citadel one of the oldest surviving [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] projects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==The Citadel user interface==
[[Image:CitadelBBSwindow.litlnemo.png|thumb|200px|right|Typical Citadel BBS screen]]
The utilization of a natural metaphor, the concept of '''rooms''' devoted to topics, marked Citadel's main advancement over previous BBS packages in the area of organization.  Messages are associated with rooms, to which the user moves in order to participate in discussions; similarly, a room could optionally give access to the underlying file system, permitting the organization of available files in an organic manner.  Most installations permitted any user to create a room, resulting in a dynamic ebb and flow closer to true conversation than most other BBS packages achieved.  Certain versions of Citadel extend the metaphor of rooms with “hallways” and/or “floors,” organizing groups of  rooms according to system requirement. By contrast, previous bulletin board software emphasized the availability of files, with a single [[Coupling|uncoupled]] message area that could only be read linearly, forward or backward.

Citadel further improved the user experience in the area of command and control.  Based on [[Alan Kay]]’s philosophy of user-interface design, “Simple things should be simple; complex things should be possible,” and influenced by the fact that Citadel was developed in an era of 300 baud modems, the basic and most heavily used commands are accessed via single keystrokes.  The most common commands are &lt;'''G'''&gt;oto (the next room with new messages), &lt;'''N'''&gt;ew messages (display the New messages in the room to the user), and &lt;'''E'''&gt;nter a message into the room.  Other single keystroke commands exist as well, such as &lt;'''K'''&gt;nown rooms, which lists the rooms known to the user.

This elegantly small command set made the system so usable that many daily users during Citadel’s golden era were never aware that Citadel also provided sophisticated capabilities.  These are known as the “dot” commands and build logically from the set of single keystroke commands.  A simple example would be the requirement to go directly to a specified room.  The user would type &lt;'''.G'''&gt;oto &lt;'''roomname'''&gt;”, where the text between the brackets is user typed, while the rest is filled in by the system.  A more complex example might be &lt;'''.R'''&gt;ead &lt;'''A'''&gt;ll rooms &lt;'''Z'''&gt;modem &lt;'''N'''&gt;ew messages ('''.RAZN'''), which results in all of the new messages in all of the rooms known to the user being sent to the user via the [[ZMODEM]] protocol.  Filters for users, keyword searches, and other capabilities have been implemented, depending on the version of Citadel.

==History==

Citadel was originally written for the [[CP/M]] operating system in 1981 by Jeff Prothero, known to the nascent Citadel world as [[Cynbe ru Taren]] (CrT). Unlike most BASIC-based BBS programs of the time, it was written in a fairly standard dialect of C known as [[BDS C]], a compiler written and distributed by Leor Zolman.  The first installation came online in December, 1981, running on a [[Heathkit]] H-89, and in its 6 month lifetime achieved immediate success.

Version 2 debuted on David Mitchell's ICS BBS, and with the release of 2.11, Prothero's involvement with the project ended following a conflict centered around a user called "sugar bunny".  He released the source to the public domain and it became available as a download from various systems as well as through the C Users Group.

At this point, the history of Citadel becomes complex as many individuals began modifying the source to their own ends, and lacking modern distributed source tracking, innovations were never incorporated into a central source repository, as such a thing did not exist.  Initially, Bruce King, David Bonn (releasing under the name Stonehenge), Caren Park, and James Shields, amongst others, picked up the opportunity in the Seattle area.

The longest lived{{fact|date=June 2010}} fork from the 2.10 code started in the American Midwest, when Hue White (aka Hue, Jr.) ported the code to MS-DOS and called it Citadel-86 ("C-86"). His board, Citadel-86 Test System, served not only as a discussion board and distribution center for the software, but also was the focal point for a lively Citadel-86 community in the 612 area code (the Twin Cities), which at their peak numbered roughly forty systems, and probably more than 100 over the years.  Numerous suggestions from sysops and users, both local and national, guided the growth of Citadel-86, including the addition of a network capability as well as enhancements to the command set. Hue's contributions were substantial enough that several other porting projects used Citadel-86 as source material, such as Asgard-86 (MS-DOS), Macadel (Macintosh), STadel (Atari ST, fnordadel), Citadel-68K (Amiga), and Citadel:K2NE (MS-DOS), and many of these contributed back to Hue Jr's project. Most of these ports were compatible with the growing Citadel-86 network (C86Net). Local systems would network with each other on a demand basis (due to the work of David Parsons), while the long haul network was serviced late at night.

An early fork from Citadel-86 was DragCit, written by The Dragon. DragCit also introduced networking code, but the DragCit network was not generally compatible with the Citadel-86 network.  DragCit forked to several more versions, eventually leading to efforts to merge several code bases under the guidance of Matt Pfleger, Richard Goldfinder, Brent Bottles, Don Kimberlin, and Elisabeth Perrin, the end result being Citadel+, a multiuser capable version of the software, which also included advanced scripting, user control of message displays, and other features.

==Other Citadel implementations==

Implementations that share the familiar Citadel user interface, but are not derived from the original Citadel code base, are also common. They have ranged from vanity projects such as a Citadel-like control program to control the serial port of an advanced graphing calculator, to full-blown efforts to modernize the Citadel interface with modern protocols.

Some of the more notable ones included Glenn Gorman's [[TRS-80]] [[BASIC]] implementation called Minibin, a clone of Cit-86 intended to run on a Unix running on Motorola processors called Cit/68, and a Unix version, technically called [[Citadel/UX]] but referred to simply as "Citadel" in the mainstream open source community. This version of Citadel is still being developed, extending the Citadel metaphor to enable what its developers call "a messaging and collaboration platform (for) connecting communities of people together": a [[groupware]] platform.

Several efforts have also been made to present the Citadel paradigm as a [[World Wide Web|web service]], including Webadel, written by Jarrin Jambik, a former Citadel-86 sysop, and Anansi-web, anansi-web.com hosted by former Citadel-86 Sysop, Ultravox the Muse. The only{{fact|date=June 2010}} current actively developed web-enabled Citadels are Citadel/UX and PenguinCit, a PHP-based Citadel.

[[Image:Copyleft.svg|thumb|alt=Small letter c turned 180 degrees, surrounded by a single line forming a circle.|Copyleft symbol]]
{{copyleft sidebar}}
'''Copyleft''', distinguished from [[copyright]], is the practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in [[derivative works]] created later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft |title=What is Copyleft? |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyleft software licenses are considered ''protective'' or ''reciprocal'', as contrasted with [[permissive free software licence|permissive]] [[free software]] licenses.&lt;ref name="redhat2005"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.redhat.com/f/summitfiles/presentation/May31/Open%20Source%20Dynamics/Troan_OpenSourceProprietyPersp.pdf |date=* |title=Open Source from a Proprietary Perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyleft is a form of [[License|licensing]], and can be used to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from [[computer software]], to [[documents]], to [[art]], to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newman |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=December 29, 2011 |title=Copyright and Open Access at the Bedside |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1110652 |journal=NEJM |volume=365 |issue= |pages=2447-2449 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1110652|access-date= May 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives a copy of the work permission to reproduce, [[Derivative work|adapt]], or distribute it, with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.

Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the [[executable|binaries]]. The [[source code]] files will usually contain a copy of the license terms and acknowledge the authors.

Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to ensure a work remains freely available. The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), originally written by [[Richard Stallman]], was the first software copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html|title = GNU General Public License|date = June 29, 2007|accessdate = August 14, 2015|website = GNU|publisher = Free Software Foundation|last = Stallman|first = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creative Commons]], a [[non-profit organization]] founded by [[Lawrence Lessig]], provides a similar license provision condition called [[share-alike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/|title = Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)|date = |accessdate = August 14, 2015|website = Creative Commons|publisher = Creative Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reciprocity==
Copyleft is a copyright licensing scheme in which an author surrenders some, but not all, rights under copyright law. Instead of allowing a work to fall completely into the [[public domain]] (where no ownership of copyright is claimed), copyleft allows an author to impose some restrictions on those who want to engage in activities that would more usually be reserved by the copyright holder. Under copyleft, derived works may be produced provided they are released under the compatible copyleft scheme.

The underlying principle is that one benefits freely from the work of others, but any modifications one makes public must be released under similar terms. For this reason some copyleft licenses are also known as [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]] licenses, they have also been described as "[[viral license|viral]]" due to their self-perpetuating terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under [[fair use]], however, the copyleft license may be superseded, just like regular copyrights. Therefore, any person utilizing a copyleft-licensed source for their own work is free to choose any other license provided they meet the fair use standard.&lt;ref&gt;

According to [[Free Software Foundation]] compliance engineer [[David Turner (computer scientist)|David Turner]], the term ''viral license'' creates a misunderstanding and a fear of using copylefted [[free software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2006082902126OSHLLL |title=IT Manager's Journal: 10 Common Misunderstandings About the GPL |first=Bruce |last=Byfield |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David McGowan has written that there is no reason to believe the GPL could force proprietary software to become free software, but could "try to enjoin the firm from distributing commercially a program that combined with the GPL'd code to form a derivative work, and to recover damages for [[copyright infringement|infringement]]."  If the firm "actually copied code from a GPL'd program, such a suit would be a perfectly ordinary assertion of copyright, which most private firms would defend if the shoe were on the other foot."&lt;ref&gt;

Richard Stallman has described this view with an analogy, saying, "The GPL's domain does not spread by proximity or contact, only by deliberate inclusion of GPL-covered code in your program. It spreads like a [[Chlorophytum comosum|spider plant]], not like a virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While copyright law gives software authors control over copying, distribution and modification of their works, the goal of copyleft is to give all users of the software the [[Gratis versus Libre|freedom]] to carry out these activities. In this way, copyleft licenses are distinct from other types of free software licenses, which do not guarantee that all subsequent recipients of the program receive these rights, or the [[Source Code|source code]] needed to make them effective. In particular, [[permissive free software licence|permissive]] free software licenses such as [[BSD licenses|BSD]] allow re-distributors to remove some or all these rights, and do not require the distribution of source code.

Reuses of open source software which subvert the freedom of the software by adding extra restrictions are called open source hijacking.  Other forms of open source licensing are susceptible to hijacking, so creators who desire that their work remain free may choose to use copyleft. The [[DMOZ|Open Directory Project (ODP, also known as DMOZ)]], which is created and maintained entirely by volunteer editors, can be considered an example of open-source hijacking. Since all of the top search engines use DMOZ, it is an extremely important public commodity which is entirely built by volunteer contributions. Despite this, the DMOZ has remained a commercial product for its entire existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The economic incentives to work on copyleft content can vary. Traditional copyright law is designed to promote progress by providing economic benefits to creators. When choosing to copyleft their work, content creators may seek complementary benefits like recognition from their peers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working on free software may also be an outlet for programmers to fill a need they have noticed. For some creators, keeping their work open is an incentive in and of itself. For these programmers, preventing commercial enterprises from absorbing and selling their product is another incentive.

Copyleft software has economic effects beyond the individual creators. The presence of quality copyleft software can force commercial producers to increase the quality of their products, which must compete with free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may also have the effect of preventing large commercial entities from applying monopoly prices. However, competition with proprietary software can also be a reason to forego copyleft. The [[Free Software Foundation]] recommends that when “widespread use of the code is vital for advancing the cause of free software,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
An early use of the word "copyleft" was in [[Li-Chen Wang]]'s Palo Alto [[Tiny BASIC]]'s distribution notice "@COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED" in June 1976, but Tiny BASIC was not distributed under any form of copyleft distribution terms, so the wordplay is the only similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang |first=Li-Chen |authorlink=Li-Chen Wang |title=Palo Alto Tiny BASIC |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia, Running Light Without Overbyte]] |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=12–25 |date=May 1976}} (NB. Source code begins with the following six lines. "TINY BASIC FOR INTEL 8080; VERSION 1.0; BY LI-CHEN WANG; 10 JUNE, 1976; @COPYLEFT; ALL WRONGS RESERVED". The June date in the May issue is correct. The magazine was behind schedule, the June and July issues were combined to catch up.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauskolb |first=Roger |title=Dr. Wang's Palo Alto Tiny BASIC |journal=Interface Age |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=92–108 |date=December 1976}} (NB. The source code begins with the following nine lines: "&lt;tt&gt;TINY BASIC FOR INTEL 8080; VERSION 2.0; BY LI-CHEN WANG; MODIFIED AND TRANSLATED TO INTEL MNEMONICS; BY ROGER RAUSKOLB; 10 OCTOBER, 1976 ; @COPYLEFT; ALL WRONGS RESERVED&lt;/tt&gt;")&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of copyleft was described in [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU Manifesto]] in 1985, where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary modifications will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stallman worked a few years earlier on a [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] interpreter. [[Symbolics]] asked to use the Lisp interpreter, and Stallman agreed to supply them with a [[Public domain software|public domain]] version of his work. Symbolics extended and improved the Lisp interpreter, but when Stallman wanted access to the improvements that Symbolics had made to his interpreter, Symbolics refused. Stallman then, in 1984, proceeded to work towards eradicating this emerging behavior and culture of [[proprietary software]], which he named ''software hoarding''. This was not the first time Stallman had dealt with proprietary software, but he deemed this interaction a "turning point". He justified software sharing, protesting that when sharing, the software online can be copied without the loss of the original piece of work. Everyone is a winner. The software can be used multiple times without ever being damaged or wearing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carver|first=Brian W.|title=Share and Share Alike: Understanding and Enforcing Open Source and Free Software Licenses|ssrn=1586574|publisher=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom |title=Free as in Freedom – Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software |first=Sam |last=Williams |authorlink=Sam Williams (American journalist) |date=March 2002 |chapter=7 |isbn=0-596-00287-4 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |chapterurl=http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch07.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Stallman deemed it impractical in the short term to eliminate current copyright law and the wrongs he perceived it perpetuated, he decided to work within the framework of existing [[law]]; in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rebel Code|last=Moody|first=Glyn|authorlink=Glyn Moody|page=26|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created his own copyright license, the Emacs General Public License,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-soft.org/gpl_history/emacs_gpl.html | title=Emacs General Public License | date=5 July 2001 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first copyleft license. This later evolved into the [[GNU General Public License]], which is now one of the most popular Free Software licenses. For the first time a copyright holder had taken steps to ensure that the maximal number of rights be perpetually transferred to a program's users, no matter what subsequent revisions anyone made to the original program. This original GPL did not grant rights to the public at large, only those who had already received the program; but it was the best that could be done under existing law.

The new license was not at this time given the copyleft label.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html |title=About the GNU Project |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |first=Richard |last=Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=21 January 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Stallman stated that the use of "Copyleft" comes from [[Don Hopkins]], who mailed him a letter in 1984 or 1985, on which was written: "Copyleft&amp;nbsp;– all rights reversed."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The term "kopyleft" with the notation "[[All Rites Reversed]]" was also in use in the early 1970s, within the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', which may have inspired Hopkins or influenced other usage. And in the arts [[Ray Johnson]] had earlier coined the term independently as it pertained to his making of and distribution of his mixed media imagery in his [[mail art]] and ephemeral gifts, for which he encouraged the making of [[derivative work]]s. (While the phrase appears briefly as (or on) one of his pieces in the 2002 documentary ''[[Ray Johnson|How to Draw a Bunny]]'', Johnson himself is not referenced in the 2001 documentary ''[[Revolution OS]]''.)

Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} have suggested that copyleft became a divisive issue in the ideological strife between the [[Open Source Initiative]] and the [[free software movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/30/esr_interview.html |title=ESR: "We Don't Need the GPL Anymore" |date=30 June 2005 |publisher=ONLamp.com |first=Federico |last=Biancuzzi |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence that copyleft is both accepted and proposed by both parties:

* Both the OSI and the FSF have copyleft and non-copyleft licenses in their respective lists of accepted licenses.&lt;ref name="osi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical |title=Licenses by Name | first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses |title=Licenses |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The OSI's original Legal Counsel [[Lawrence Rosen (attorney)|Lawrence Rosen]] has written a copyleft license, the [[Open Software License]].
* The OSI's licensing how-to recognises the GPL as a "best practice" license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html#choosing |title=Licensing HOWTO |date=9 November 2002 |first=Eric Steven |last=Raymond |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some of the software programs of the GNU Project are published under non-copyleft licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=225606&amp;cid=18272276 |title=What the GPLv3 Means for MS-Novell Agreement |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stallman himself has endorsed the use of non-copyleft licenses in certain circumstances, most recently in the case of the [[Ogg Vorbis]] [[Relicensing|license change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3 |title=LWN.net: RMS on the Ogg Vorbis license |date=26 February 2001 |first=Richard |last=Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |quote=[M]y agreement with the idea of a lax [Ogg/Vorbis] license in this special case is just as pragmatic as my preference for the GPL in most cases. In both cases it is a matter of how we can attain freedom. |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applying copyleft==
Common practice for using copyleft is to codify the copying terms for a work with a [[license]]. Any such license typically gives each person possessing a copy of the work the same freedoms as the author, including (from the [[Free Software Definition]]):

: Freedom 0&amp;nbsp;– the freedom to use the work,
: Freedom 1&amp;nbsp;– the freedom to study the work,
: Freedom 2&amp;nbsp;– the freedom to copy and share the work with others,
: Freedom 3&amp;nbsp;– the freedom to modify the work, and the freedom to distribute modified and therefore derivative works.

(Note that the list begins from 0 as a reference to computer programming, where [[zero-based numbering]] is prevalent.)

These freedoms do not ensure that a [[derivative work]] will be distributed under the same liberal terms. In order for the work to be truly copyleft, the license has to [[Obligation|ensure]] that the author of a derived work can only distribute such works under the same or equivalent license.

In addition to restrictions on copying, copyleft licenses address other possible impediments. These include ensuring the rights cannot be later [[revoke]]d and requiring the work and its derivatives to be provided in a form that facilitates modification. In [[Computer software|software]], this requires that the [[source code]] of the derived work be made available together with the software itself.

Copyleft licenses necessarily make creative use of relevant rules and laws. For example, when using copyright law, those who contribute to a work under copyleft usually must gain, defer or assign copyright holder status. By submitting the copyright of their contributions under a copyleft license, they deliberately give up some of the rights that normally follow from copyright, including the right to be the unique distributor of copies of the work.

Some laws used for copyleft licenses vary from one country to another, and may also be granted in terms that vary from country to country. For example, in some countries it is acceptable to sell a software product without warranty, in standard GNU GPL style (see articles 11 and 12 of [http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html the GNU GPL version 2]), while in most [[Europe]]an countries it is not permitted for a software distributor to [[waiver|waive]] all warranties regarding a sold product. For this reason the extent of such warranties are specified in most European copyleft licenses. Regarding that, see the European Union Public Licence [[EUPL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osor.eu/eupl/european-union-public-licence-eupl-v.1.1 |title=The EUPL – European Union Public Licence |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[CeCILL license]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inria.fr/valorisation/logiciels/Licence.CeCILL-V1.US.pdf |title=Free Software Licensing Agreement CeCILL |publisher=INRIA |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a license that allows one to use GNU GPL (see article 5 of the EUPL and article 5.3.4 of CeCILL) in combination with a limited warranty (see article 7 and 8 of the EUPL and 9 of CeCILL). For projects which will be run over a network, a variation of the GPL is provided in the [[Affero General Public License]], which ensures that the source code is available to users of network software.

==Types and relation to other licenses==
{{See also|Free software licences#Restrictions}}
[[Image:Cc-sa.svg|thumb|The [[Creative Commons]] icon for Share-Alike, a variant of the copyleft symbol]]
Copyleft is a distinguishing feature of some [[free software]] licenses. Many [[free software licenses]] are not copyleft licenses because they do not require the licensee to distribute derivative works under the same license. There is an ongoing debate as to which class of license provides the greater degree of freedom. This debate hinges on complex issues such as the definition of [[Political freedom|freedom]] and whose freedoms are more important, or whether to maximize the freedom of all potential future recipients of a work (''freedom from'' the creation of proprietary software). Non-copyleft free software licenses maximize the freedom of the initial recipient (''freedom to'' create proprietary software).

In common with the [[Creative Commons]] share-alike licensing system, GNU's Free Documentation License allows authors to apply limitations to certain sections of their work, exempting some parts of their creation from the full copyleft mechanism. In the case of the GFDL, these limitations include the use of invariant sections, which may not be altered by future editors. The initial intention of the GFDL was as a device for supporting the [[documentation]] of copylefted software. However, the result is that it can be used for any kind of document.

===Strong and weak copyleft===
The strength of the copyleft governing a work is an expression of the extent that the copyleft provisions can be efficiently imposed on all kinds of derived works. "Weak copyleft" refers to licenses where not all derived works inherit the copyleft license; whether a derived work inherits or not often depends on the manner in which it was derived.

"Weak copyleft" licenses are generally used for the creation of [[Library (computing)|software libraries]], to allow other software to link to the library, and then be redistributed without the legal requirement for the work to be distributed under the library's copyleft license. Only changes to the weak-copylefted software itself become subject to the copyleft provisions of such a license, not changes to the software that links to it. This allows programs of any license to be compiled and linked against copylefted libraries such as [[GNU C Library|glibc]] (the [[GNU project]]'s implementation of the [[C standard library]]), and then redistributed without any [[Software relicensing|re-licensing]] required.

The most well known free software license that uses strong copyleft is the GNU General Public License. A stronger copyleft license is the [[GNU Affero General Public License|AGPL]] which requires the publishing of the source code also for the usage case [[software as a service]], ("see also" the term sometimes used, "service as a software substitute [SaaSS]"&lt;ref&gt;For some of the philosophy behind the term "SaaSS", see the "Server Software" section of {{cite web

It requires you to publish the source code publicly whenever you “Deploy” the covered software, and “Deploy” is defined to include many kinds of private use.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free software licenses that use "weak" copyleft include the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] and the [[Mozilla Public License]]. 
Examples of non-copyleft ([[Permissive license|"permissive"]]) free software licenses include the [[MIT License|X11 license]], [[Apache license]] and the [[BSD licenses]].
The concrete effect of strong vs. weak copyleft has yet to be tested in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/news/meaning-%E2%80%9Ccopyleft%E2%80%9D-eupl |title=The meaning of "Copyleft" in EUPL|date=April 3, 2015|author=Patrice-Emmanuel Schmitz |work=Joinup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Design Science License]] is a strong copyleft license that can apply to any work -- not only software or documentation, but also to literature, artworks, music, photography, and video. It was created by Michael Stutz after his interest in applying GNU-style copyleft to non-software works, which later came to be called [[Open content]]. In the 1990s the DSL was used on music recordings, visual art, and even novels. It is now hosted on the Free Software Foundation website's license list,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html Various Licenses and Comments about Them]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not considered compatible with the GPL by the Free Software Foundation.

===Full and partial copyleft===
"Full" and "partial" copyleft relate to another issue. Full copyleft exists when all parts of a work (except the license itself) may only be modified and distributed under the terms of the work's copyleft license. Partial copyleft, by contrast, exempts some parts of the work from the copyleft provisions, thus permitting distribution of some modifications under terms other than the copyleft license, or in some other way does not impose all the principles of copylefting on the work. For example, the GPL linking exception made for some software packages (see below).

===Share-alike===
[[Share-alike]] imposes the requirement that any freedom that is granted regarding the original work must be granted on exactly the same or compatible terms in any derived work: this implies that any copyleft license is automatically a share-alike license, but not the other way around, as some share-alike licenses include further restrictions, for instance prohibiting commercial use. Another restriction is that not everyone wants to share their work and some share-alike agreements require that the whole body of work be shared, even if the author only wants to share a certain part. The plus side for the author of the source code is that any modification to the code will not only benefit the company, but the author will be recognized and hold equal claim over the changed code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engelfriet|first=Arnoud|title=Choosing an Open Source License|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5370763|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715044527/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5370763|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 July 2012|publisher=Athens University of Economics and Business|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Myers, [http://www.robmyers.org/weblog/2008/02/24/noncommercial-sharealike-is-not-copyleft/ NonCommercial Sharealike is not Copyleft]&lt;/ref&gt; Some permutations of the [[Creative Commons licenses]] are examples of share-alike.

In response to Microsoft's attacks on the GPL, several prominent Free Software developers and advocates released a joint statement supporting the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Free Software Leaders Stand Together|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] compliance engineer David Turner, it creates a misunderstanding and a fear of using copylefted free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2006082902126OSHLLL |title=IT Manager's Journal: 10 Common Misunderstandings About the GPL |first=Bruce |last=Byfield |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a person can catch a virus without active action, license conditions take effect upon effective usage or adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lu.is/blog/2012/02/02/the-license-term-smorgasbord-copyleft-share-alike-reciprocal-viral-or-hereditary/|title=The license term smorgasbord: copyleft, share-alike, reciprocal, viral, or hereditary? – Luis Villa: Open Law and Strategy|website=lu.is|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; David McGowan has written that there is no reason to believe the GPL could force proprietary software to become free software, but could "try to enjoin the firm from distributing commercially a program that combined with the GPL'd code to form a derivative work, and to recover damages for infringement." If the firm "actually copied code from a GPL'd program, such a suit would be a perfectly ordinary assertion of copyright, which most private firms would defend if the shoe were on the other foot."&lt;ref&gt;

Popular copyleft licenses, such as the GPL, have a clause allowing components to interact with non-copyleft components as long as the communication is abstract, such as executing a command-line tool with a set of switches or interacting with a Web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation |title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, even if one module of an otherwise non-copyleft product is placed under the GPL, it may still be legal for other components to communicate with it normally. This allowed communication may or may not include reusing libraries or routines via [[Library (computing)|dynamic linking]]&amp;nbsp;– some commentators say it does,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html#id2789302 |title=Licensing HOWTO |date=9 November 2002 |first=Eric Steven |last=Raymond |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FSF asserts it does not and explicitly adds an [[GPL linking exception|exception allowing it]] in the license for the [[GNU Classpath]] re-implementation of the Java library. This ambiguity is an important difference between the GPL and the [[LGPL]], in that the LGPL specifically allows linking or compiling with the covered work.&lt;ref name="not_use_LGPL"&gt;Stallman, Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="997">'''Dhauti''' is an important part of the [[Shatkarma]] (sometimes known as '''Shatkriya'''), 
the yogic system of body cleansing techniques. It is intended mainly to the cleaning of the digestive tract in its full length but it affects also the respiratory tract, external ears and eyes. According to [[Gheranda Samhita]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1991/cmay91/dhauti.shtml Dhauti - Internal Cleansing], in [[Yoga Magazine]], a publication of [[Bihar School of Yoga]]&lt;/ref&gt; it is divided into four parts: Antar (internal) dhauti, Danta (teeth) dhauti, Hrid (cardiac or chest region) dhauti and Moola shodhana (rectal cleansing).

Antar Dhauti is further divided into four parts: Vatsara, Varisara, Agnisara, Bahishkrit.
Danta Dhauti: Danta Mula, Jivha Mula, Karna Randha, Kapola Randha.
Hrid Dhauti: Danda Dhauti, Vaman Dhauti, Vastra Dhauti

[[File:Three virtues Diligentia.jpg|thumb|Plate 1 of classical virtues: Diligence. She is holding a whip and spurs, signifying a drive to steadfastly move forward with one's means.]]

'''Diligence''' is one of the [[seven heavenly virtues]]. Diligent behavior is indicative of a [[work ethic]]; a belief that work is good in itself. Diligence is carefulness and persistent effort or work. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Work and society |author1=Keith E. Thurley |author2=Sek Hong Ng |chapter=The Concept of the Work Ethic |pages=136–137 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-962-209-391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In students ==

Bernard et al.&lt;ref name=bdp/&gt; suggest diligence in a student is defined as an effort he or she puts towards balanced and holistic development in mental, physical, social and spiritual dimensions. They find diligence in students is correlated with [[academic performance]].  This is especially found in younger students.  The support of parents and educators encourages students to be diligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Student Diligence and Student Diligence Support: Predictors of Academic Success. |author=Christon G Arthur |year=2002 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED471295.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other factors which encourage diligence in students include [[motivation]], [[discipline]],  [[attention|concentration]], responsibility and devotedness.&lt;ref name=bdp&gt;{{citation |title=Student-Centered Educational Reform: The Impact of Parental and Educator Support of Student Diligence |author1=H Bernard |author2=DD Drake |author3=JJ Pace |journal=School Community Journal |year=1996 |url=http://www.adi.org/journal/fw96/BernardDrakePacesRaynorFall1996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Buddhism ==

The last words of the [[Buddha]] were "Strive on with diligence." Diligence is an integral part of all [[Buddhist]] teaching, and is considered the fourth of the [[pāramitā]]. In [[Mahayana]] tradition diligence is the third pāramitā and the first which is said to lead to liberation. The practice of diligence will bring an increase of qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Gems of Dharma, Jewels of Freedom|author=Je Gampopa|page=163|publisher=Altea Publishing |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-9524555-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Christianity ==

Diligence, in Christianity, is the effort to do one's part, while keeping faith and reliance in God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web001.rbc.org/pdf/discovery-series/how-do-you-live-the-christian-life.pdf How do we live the Christian Life?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104234046/http://web001.rbc.org/pdf/discovery-series/how-do-you-live-the-christian-life.pdf |date=November 4, 2013 }} David Sper (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, diligence and faith are two sides of a mystery. One doesn’t know how, despite one's effort, it all works out. But diligence when combined with faith assures spiritual success. Diligence as one of seven virtues describes thoroughness, completeness and persistence of an action, particularly in matters of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas J. Kšstenberger (2011), ''Excellence: The Character of God and the Pursuit of Scholarly Virtue'', {{ISBN|978-1-58134-910-8}}, pp 88–90&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure. We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.|Hebrews 6:11-12|&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Bible: New International Version. International Bible Society, (1973), THE LETTER OF PAUL TO THE HEBREWS 6:11–12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Islam ==
{{bq|That man can have nothing but what he strives for; That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight: Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete.|The Quran|&lt;ref&gt;An-Najm 53:39–41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Hinduism ==

According to Brian Hatcher, the precepts of Hinduism require a human being to discover and live a ''dharmic'' life. To live a ''dharmic'' life, one must live with right intention with diligence, and with concern for well being of others.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hatcher (2008), ''Bourgeois Hinduism or Faith of the Modern Vedantists'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-532608-6}}, page 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, B. A. (2007). Bourgeois Vedānta: The Colonial Roots of Middle-class Hinduism. Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 75(2), 298–323.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindus celebrate [[Diwali]], a festival of lights, where Goddess Lakshmi (also called Goddess Sri) is worshipped; the goddess symbolizes thorough preparation, being organized, diligent and honest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/962/1/HINDUISM..pdf HINDUISM] Stephen Bigger (1990), University of Worcester, UK&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are considered by Hindus as essential for success and Shubh Labh (ethical profit).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, S.

== Due diligence ==
{{main|Due diligence}}

Due diligence is the necessary amount of diligence required in a professional activity to avoid being [[negligence|negligent]]. This commonly arises in major [[takeover|acquisitions]] where the legal principle of [[caveat emptor]] ("let the buyer beware") requires the purchaser to make a diligent [[survey]] of the property or service being sold. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT0NRBjjriMC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The system of liability of articles III and IV of the Hague (Visby) Rules |author=N.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6062">'''Dominicus Gundissalinus''', also known as '''Domingo Gundisalvi''' or '''Gundisalvo''' ({{c.}} 1115 – post 1190), was a philosopher and translator of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] to [[Medieval Latin]] active in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Among his translations, Gundissalinus worked on [[Avicenna]]'s ''Liber de philosophia prima'' and ''De anima'', [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Ibn Gabirol]]'s ''Fons vitae'', and [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''Summa theoricae philosophiae'', in collaboration with the Jewish philosopher [[Abraham ibn Daud|Abraham Ibn Daud]] and Johannes Hispanus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polloni|first=Nicola|date=2016-10-12|title=Elementi per una biografia di Dominicus Gundisalvi|url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=AHDLM_082_0007|journal=Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge|language=it|volume=Tome 82|issue=1|pages=7–22|doi=10.3917/ahdlm.082.0007|issn=0373-5478}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a philosopher, Gundissalinus crucially contributed to the Latin assimilation of [[Arabic philosophy]], being the first Latin thinker in receiving and developing doctrines, such as [[Avicenna]]'s modal ontology or [[Solomon ibn Gabirol|Ibn Gabirol]]'s universal hylomorphism, that would soon be integrated into the thirteenth-century philosophical debate.

==Life==
Born presumably in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] around 1115-1125, Gundissalinus received his education in [[Chartres]], supposedly following the teaching of [[William of Conches]] and [[Thierry of Chartres]].&lt;ref&gt;Fidora, Alexander, 2011, 'Le débat sur la création: Guillaume de Conches, maître de Dominique Gundisalvi?', in B. Obrist - I. Caiazzo (eds.), ''Guillaume de Conches: Philosophie et science au XIIe siècle'', Firenze, 271-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polloni|first=Nicola|date=2015-01-01|title=Thierry of Chartres and Gundissalinus on Spiritual Substances: The Problem of Hylomorphic Composition|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.BPM.5.110804|journal=Bulletin de Philosophie Médiévale|volume=57|pages=35–57|doi=10.1484/J.BPM.5.110804|issn=0068-4023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1148, Gundissalinus is in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]: the capitular archives of [[Segovia]] refer to him as archdeacon of [[Cuéllar]], a small town not far from Segovia, where he presumably spent around 14 years, regarding which almost no information is available.&lt;ref&gt;Villar García, L.M., 1990, ''Documentación medieval de la Catedral de Segovia'' ''(1115-1300)'', Salamanca, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Abraham ibn Daud|Ibn Daud]]'s request to the archbishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], John II, to start a series of translations into Latin of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Kitab al-Shifāʾ'', Gundissalinus moved to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1161-1162, where he worked with Ibn Daud on the translation of [[Avicenna]]'s ''De anima'', realised before 1166.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, J., 1985, ''Los Cartularios de Toledo. Catalogo Documental'', Madrid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bertolacci, Amos, 2011, 'A Community of Translators: The Latin Medieval Versions of Avicenna’s Book of the Cure', in C. J. Mews- J. N. Crossley (eds.), ''Communities of Learning: Networks and the Shaping of Intellectual Identity in Europe 1100-1500'', Turnhout, 37-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Gundissalinus remained in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] for twenty years, collaborating with [[Abraham ibn Daud|Abraham Ibn Daud]] and Johannes Hispanus to the realisation of around twenty translations of Arabic  works into Latin. In the Castilian capital, Gundissalinus also wrote his philosophical treatises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Domingo Gundisalvo. Una introducción|last=Polloni|first=Nicola|publisher=Editorial Sindéresis|year=2017|isbn=978-84-16262-34-2|location=Madrid|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toledan chapter names Gundissalinus for the last time in 1178 but he presumably remained in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] at least until 1181, when a document written in Arabic mentions his name.&lt;ref&gt;D'Alverny, Marie-Thérèse, 1989, 'Les traductions à deux interprètes, d’arabe en langue vernaculaire et de langue vernaculaire en latin', in G. Contamine, (ed.), ''Traduction et traducteurs au Moyen Âge. Actes du colloque international du CNRS organisée à Paris, Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, les 26-28 mai 1986'', Paris, 193-206.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alonso Alonso, Manuel, 1943, 'Notas sobre los traductores toledanos Domingo Gundisalvo y Juan Hispano', ''al-Andalus'' 8:  155-188&lt;/ref&gt;

The last record witnessing Gundissalinus alive is the report of a meeting between the chapters of [[Segovia]] and [[Burgos]], held in [[Segovia]] in 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Villar García'',''  L. M., 1985,  ''Documentación medieval de la Catedral de Segovia (1115-1300)'', Madrid, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that the last years of Gundissalinus's life were spent in that Castilian town, and he died sometime after 1190.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">'''Eliezer of Beaugency''' was a [[Jewish]] [[French people|French]] [[Bible exegete]] of the [[twelfth century]].

==Biography and works==
He was born at [[Beaugency]], capital of a canton in the department of [[Loiret]]. A student of [[Rashbam]], Eliezer was one of the most distinguished representatives of Rashbam's school and of the exegesis of northern France. His chief concern was to find the connection between successive verses and the sequence of thought, a method that is also characteristic of the system of interpretation employed by Rashbam as well as [[Joseph Kara]]. Not concerned with grammatical observations or daring criticisms, he reached very happy results in explaining certain figurative passages in accordance with the metaphors employed in the context. He often used French terms to express his thoughts more clearly. His interpretation is entirely free from midrashic admixture.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=ELIEZER OF BEAUGENCY|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5600-eliezer-of-beaugency|accessdate=Aug 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly interested in dating the Biblical prophecies and identifying the events mentioned in them.&lt;ref name="ejudaica"&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/eliezer-beaugency&lt;/ref&gt;


Of his works, the commentaries on Isaiah&lt;ref&gt;ed. Nutt, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; and Hosea&lt;ref&gt;ed. S. Poznanski, in "Ha-Goren," iii. 98-127&lt;/ref&gt; were published prior to 1906. There still exists in manuscript a commentary on the other Minor Prophets and on Ezekiel.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, "Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS." No. 1465&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from his commentary on Job are also extant; and he himself refers to his commentary on Genesis.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; His commentaries on [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] and [[Jonah]] were published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvvncgw|title=Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency, Commentaries on Amos and Jonah (With Selections from Isaiah and Ezekiel)|last=Harris|first=Robert A.|date=2018|publisher=Medieval Institute Publications|isbn=9781580443036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enlightened moderation''' is a term coined by a former [[Pakistani president]], [[Pervez Musharraf]]; it applies to practicing a [[moderate Islam]], as opposed to the interpretions of [[fundamentalist Islam]].

To think properly as to rationalize thoughts, to be on the positive side of life and to prefer optimism, the theory goes, is to be against extremism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5081-2004May31.html "A Plea for Enlightened Moderation"], by Pervez Musharraf, June 1, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=952 Ayman Al-Zawahiri's Interview to Al-Sahab (Part II): Osama Bin Laden Still Commands the Jihad, but the Jihad Is Larger than Individuals. Mujahideen Should Attack Oil Infrastructure in the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy of enlightened moderation was unveiled by Musharraf during the 2002 [[OIC]] Summit Conference in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA437501%26Location=U2%26doc=GetTRDoc.pdf], p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

Musharraf explained his position in an opinion piece that was published in various newspapers in 2004. His plan for enlightened moderation has two sides. It calls "for the Muslim world to shun militancy and extremism and adopt the path of socioeconomic uplift" and "for the West, and the United States in particular, to seek to resolve all political disputes with justice and to aid in the socioeconomic betterment of the deprived Muslim world".&lt;ref name= plea&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5081-2004May31.html A Plea for Enlightened Moderation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Musharraf pointed out that moderation and enlightenment have been the traits of the [[Islamic world]] since the times of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name= plea/&gt;

Musharraf wrote:&lt;ref name= plea/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I say to my brother Muslims: The time for [[renaissance]] has come. The way forward is through [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. We must concentrate on human resource development through the alleviation of poverty and through education, health care and social justice. If this is our direction, it cannot be achieved through confrontation. We must adopt a path of moderation and a conciliatory approach to fight the common belief that Islam is a religion of militancy in conflict with modernization, democracy and secularism. All this must be done with a realization that, in the world we live in, fairness does not always rule. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Islamic Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist Islamic organizations]] have criticized Musharraf's vision of enlightened moderation. The [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] condemns it as a [[neologism]] for [[Westernization]] and [[American imperialism]]. Islam is innately a religion of enlightened moderation, they argue, and needs no Westernized amendments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaat.org/Isharat/ish0704.html Jamaat-e-Islami ""Enlightened Moderation" or the new US 'Religious Order'"], by prof. Khurshid Ahmad, accessed 12 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Masooda Bano points out that the US is not likely to "suddenly metamorphose into a benevolent entity, which will 'resolve all political disputes with justice.'"&lt;ref&gt;Masooda Bano,  "Unraveling 'Enlightened Moderation'", ''[[Al-Ahram]]'', 17–23 June 2004 ,Issue No. 695&lt;/ref&gt;

'''František Mareš''' (October 20, 1857 – February 6, 1942) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[professor]] of [[physiology]] and [[philosophy]], and [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[politician]]. He was rector of the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]] in 1920-21, and member of the [[National Democratic Party (Czechoslovakia)|National Democrats]].

==Life==
Mareš was born in Opatovice and died in České Budějovice (tomb - Hluboká nad Vltavou). He studied philosophy and medicine in Prague (postgraduate in Vienna). He promoted in 1886. He became a professor in 1890. He became a chairman of the Physiology Institute of the Charkes University in 1895, continuing in that capacity until 1928. In 1914 and 1920, he was appointed rector of the Charles University for one year. He was many times appointed dean of Faculty of Medicine. Honorary doctorate Mayo clinic.

During the war and after the independence of [[Czechoslovakia]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918, Mareš became active in the Czechoslovak nationalist movement. He was an active member of the National Democrats, and became a member of the Revolutionary National Assembly of Czechoslovakia in 1918. In 1920, he was elected to the Senate, until the next election of 1925. At that time he became influenced by fascism, much to the dismay of the National Democratic leadership. In 1934, he was part of the leadership of the National Front (''Národní fronta''), later National Unity (''Národní sjednocení''). He was also a contributor to ''[[Vlajka]]''.

==Work==
Mareš published his research papers mainly in German and French journals. The papers were oriented on metabolismus, neurophysiology and winter dormancy in rodents. For medical students he prepared great textbooks ''Všeobecná fysiologie'' and ''Fysiologie I-IV''. His philosophy was briefly based upon the [[Vitalism]] of [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Hans Driesch]]. He was a critic of [[positivism]] - book (1903) ''Idealism and Realism in Natural Sciences''. He also defended the ''[[Václav Hanka|Rukopis královédvorský]]'', which were later exposed as [[literary forgery|forgeries]] by [[absolute dating|scientific dating methods]].

'''George Caruana''' (1831–1872) was a Maltese minor [[philosopher]] mostly interested in [[epistemology]]. He held the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Malta]] (1859–72).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Caruana was a diocesan priest. He was born in [[Victoria, Gozo]] in 1831, and dedicated his relatively short life to academic work. He studied at the bishop’s seminary in [[Gozo]], and then at the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], from where he graduated as Doctor of Ecclesiastical Studies. Back in the [[Maltese islands]], in 1858 Caruana was appointed Rector at the bishop’s seminary of [[Malta]]. Here he taught philosophy and [[mathematics]]. A few months later, in 1859, he was appointed Professor of the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Malta]]. His teaching compliments here were various: intellectual philosophy, [[moral philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]]. During the same time, he was also member of the Committee of the [[National Library of Malta]]. Caruana occupied the Chair of Philosophy for thirteen years, until his premature death. He died on May 27, 1872. His funeral oration was delivered by fellow-philosopher [[Saviour Cumbo]].

==Extant work==
Only one work of Caruana is as yet known to exist. It is simply called '''''Filosofia''''' (Philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is still in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Library of Malta]], [[Valletta]], MS. 1334.&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in Italian, and contains 184 folios in Caruana’s own handwriting. The document is divided into an introduction, chapters, and paragraphs.

Caruana deals with a number of themes, namely, knowledge, truth, nature, conscience, sensibility, imagination, intellect, intuition, judgement, discourse, memory, words, and such like subjects. All are discussed in a philosophically clear and argumentative way.

The '''hard problem of consciousness''' is the problem of explaining how and why [[sentient]] organisms have [[qualia]] or [[Consciousness#Is it a single thing?|phenomenal experiences]]—how and why it is that some internal states are [[Feeling|felt]] states, such as heat or pain, rather than unfelt states, as in a thermostat or a toaster.&lt;ref name=Harnad/&gt; The philosopher [[David Chalmers]], who introduced the term "hard problem" of [[consciousness]],&lt;ref name=Cooney/&gt; contrasts this with the "easy problems" of explaining the ability to discriminate, integrate information, report mental states, focus attention, etc. Easy problems are easy because all that is required for their solution is to specify a mechanism that can perform the function. That is, their proposed solutions, regardless of how complex or poorly understood they may be, can be entirely consistent with the modern [[Materialism|materialistic]] conception of natural phenomena. Chalmers claims that the problem of experience is distinct from this set and that the problem of experience will "persist even when the performance of all the relevant [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] is explained".&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

The existence of a "hard problem" is controversial and has been disputed by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt; and [[cognitive neuroscientist]]s such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]].&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

==Chalmers' formulation==
===The hard problem===

In ''Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness'' (1995), Chalmers wrote:&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively unreasonable that it should, and yet it does.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same paper, he also wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive there is a whir of information processing, but there is also a subjective aspect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher Raamy Majeed noted in 2016 that the hard problem is, in fact, associated with two "explanatory targets":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Majeed |first=Raamy |date=September 2016 |title=The hard problem &amp; its explanatory targets |journal=[[Ratio (journal)|Ratio]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=298–311 |doi=10.1111/rati.12103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[PQ] Physical processing gives rise to experiences with a phenomenal character.
#[Q] Our phenomenal qualities are thus-and-so.

The first fact concerns the relationship between the physical and the phenomenal (i.e., how and why are some physical states [[Feeling|felt]] states), whereas the second concerns the very nature of the phenomenal itself (i.e., what does the felt state [[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?|feel like]]?). Most responses to the hard problem are aimed at explaining either one of these facts or both.

===Easy problems===
Chalmers contrasts the hard problem with a number of (relatively) easy problems that consciousness presents. He emphasizes that what the easy problems have in common is that they all represent some ability, or the performance of some function or behavior. Examples of easy problems include:&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;

* the ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli;
* the integration of information by a cognitive system;
* the reportability of mental states;
* the ability of a system to access its own internal states;
* the focus of attention;
* the control of behavior;
* the difference between wakefulness and sleep.

==Other formulations==
Other formulations of the "hard problem" include:{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* "How is it that some organisms are subjects of experience?"
* "Why does awareness of sensory information exist at all?"
* "Why do [[qualia]] exist?"
* "Why is there a subjective component to experience?"
* "Why aren't we [[philosophical zombie]]s?"

===Historical predecessors===
The hard problem has scholarly antecedents considerably earlier than Chalmers, as Chalmers himself has pointed out.&lt;ref name="Moving forward"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |date=January 1997 |title=Moving forward on the problem of consciousness |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–46 |url=http://consc.net/papers/moving.html |quote=Any number of thinkers in the recent and distant past - including a number of contributors to this symposium – have recognized the particular difficulties of explaining consciousness and have tried to face up to them in various ways. All my paper really contributes is a catchy name, a minor reformulation of philosophically familiar points, and a specific approach to dealing with them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist and mathematician [[Isaac Newton]] wrote in a 1672 letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;to determine by what modes or actions light produceth in our minds the phantasm of colour is not so {{not a typo|easie}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Seager |first1=William |last2=Allen-Hermanson |first2=Sean |date=2010 |title=Panpsychism |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), the philosopher and physician [[John Locke]] argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Divide matter into as minute parts as you will (which we are apt to imagine a sort of spiritualizing or making a thinking thing of it) vary the figure and motion of it as much as you please—a globe, cube, cone, prism, cylinder, etc., whose diameters are but 1,000,000th part of a gry, will operate not otherwise upon other bodies of proportionable bulk than those of an inch or foot diameter—and you may as rationally expect to produce sense, thought, and knowledge, by putting together, in a certain figure and motion, gross particles of matter, as by those that are the very minutest that do anywhere exist. They knock, impel, and resist one another, just as the greater do; and that is all they can do... [I]t is impossible to conceive that matter, either with or without motion, could have originally in and from itself sense, perception, and knowledge; as is evident from hence that then sense, perception, and knowledge must be a property eternally inseparable from matter and every particle of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |date=1722 |title=The works of John Locke: in three volumes |location=London |publisher=Printed for A. Churchill, and A. Manship, and sold by W. Taylor in Pater-noster-Row |volume=1 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0BfmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 293]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[polymath]] and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote in 1714, as an example also known as [[Leibniz's gap]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which depends upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to say, by means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a machine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill. That being so, we should, on examining its interior, find only parts which work one upon another, and never anything by which to explain a perception.&lt;ref name=Aranyosi/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill|J.S. Mill]] wrote in ''[[A System of Logic]]'' (1843), Book V, Chapter V, section 3:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now I am far from pretending that it may not be capable of proof, or that it is not an important addition to our knowledge if proved, that certain motions in the particles of bodies are the conditions of the production of heat or light; that certain assignable physical modifications of the nerves may be the conditions not only of our sensations or emotions, but even of our thoughts; that certain mechanical and chemical conditions may, in the order of nature, be sufficient to determine to action the physiological laws of life. All I insist upon, in common with every thinker who entertains any clear idea of the logic of science, is, that it shall not be supposed that by proving these things one step would be made towards a real explanation of heat, light, or sensation; or that the generic peculiarity of those phenomena can be in the least degree evaded by any such discoveries, however well established. Let it be shown, for instance, that the most complex series of physical causes and effects succeed one another in the eye and in the brain to produce a sensation of colour; rays falling on the eye, refracted, converging, crossing one another, making an inverted image on the retina, and after this a motion—let it be a vibration, or a rush of nervous fluid, or whatever else you are pleased to suppose, along the optic nerve—a propagation of this motion to the brain itself, and as many more different motions as you choose; still, at the end of these motions, there is something which is not motion, there is a feeling or sensation of colour. Whatever number of motions we may be able to interpolate, and whether they be real or imaginary, we shall still find, at the end of the series, a motion antecedent and a colour consequent. The mode in which any one of the motions produces the next, may possibly be susceptible of explanation by some general law of motion: but the mode in which the last motion produces the sensation of colour, cannot be explained by any law of motion; it is the law of colour: which is, and must always remain, a peculiar thing. Where our consciousness recognises between two phenomena an inherent distinction; where we are sensible of a difference which is not merely of degree, and feel that no adding one of the phenomena to itself would produce the other; any theory which attempts to bring either under the laws of the other must be false; though a theory which merely treats the one as a cause or condition of the other, may possibly be true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T.H. Huxley]] wrote in 1868:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what consciousness is, we know not; and how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin when Aladdin rubbed his lamp in the story, or as any other ultimate fact of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Thomas Henry |authorlink1=Thomas Henry Huxley |last2=Youmans |first2=William Jay |authorlink2=William Jay Youmans |date=1868 |title=The elements of physiology and hygiene: a text-book for educational institutions |location=New York |publisher=D. Appleton and company |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aVUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 178]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argued in 1974:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.&lt;ref name="Bat"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Nagel |date=October 1974 |title=What is it like to be a bat? |journal=[[The Philosophical Review]] |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=435–450 |doi=10.2307/2183914 |jstor=2183914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relationship to scientific frameworks==
===Neural correlates of consciousness===
{{further|Neural correlates of consciousness}}
Since 1990, researchers including the molecular biologist [[Francis Crick]] and the neuroscientist [[Christof Koch]] have made significant progress toward identifying which neurobiological events occur concurrently to the experience of subjective consciousness.&lt;ref name="KochEtAl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=Christof|last2=Massimini|first2=Marcello|last3=Boly|first3=Melanie|last4=Tononi|first4=Giulio|title=Neural correlates of consciousness: Progress and problems|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=April 2016|volume=17|issue=5|pages=307–321|doi=10.1038/nrn.2016.22|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301567963_Neural_correlates_of_consciousness_Progress_and_problems|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These postulated events are referred to as ''neural correlates of consciousness'' or NCCs. However, this research arguably addresses the question of ''which'' neurobiological mechanisms are linked to consciousness but not the question of ''why'' they should give rise to consciousness at all, the latter being the hard problem of consciousness as Chalmers formulated it. In "On the Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness", Chalmers said he is confident that, granting the principle that something such as what he terms global availability can be used as an indicator of consciousness, the neural correlates will be discovered "in a century or two".&lt;ref name="chalmers-ncc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chalmers|first=David|editor1-last=Hameroff|editor1-first=Stuart|editor1-link=Stuart Hameroff|editor2-last=Kaszniak|editor2-first=Alfred|editor3-first=Alwyn|editor3-last=Scott|encyclopedia=Toward a Science of Consciousness II|title=On the Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262082624|url=http://consc.net/papers/ncc.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he stated regarding their relationship to the hard problem of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One can always ask why these processes of availability should give rise to consciousness in the first place. As yet we cannot explain why they do so, and it may well be that full details about the processes of availability will still fail to answer this question. Certainly, nothing in the standard methodology I have outlined answers the question; that methodology assumes a relation between availability and consciousness, and therefore does nothing to explain it. [...] So the hard problem remains. But who knows: Somewhere along the line we may be led to the relevant insights that show why the link is there, and the hard problem may then be solved.&lt;ref name="chalmers-ncc"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neuroscientist and Nobel laureate [[Eric Kandel]] wrote that locating the NCCs would not solve the hard problem, but rather one of the so-called easy problems to which the hard problem is contrasted.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kandel Eric R. |year=2007 |title=In search of memory: The emergence of a new science of mind |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0393329372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnRwWXzypgC |pages=380–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kandel went on to note Crick and Koch's suggestion that once the [[binding problem]]—understanding what accounts for the unity of experience—is solved, it will be possible to solve the hard problem empirically.&lt;ref name="Kandel"/&gt; However, neuroscientist [[Anil Seth]] argued that emphasis on the so-called hard problem is a distraction from what he calls the "real problem": understanding the neurobiology underlying consciousness, namely the neural correlates of various conscious processes.&lt;ref name="seth-aeon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seth|first1=Anil|title=The real problem|url=https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one|website=Aeon|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This more modest goal is the focus of most scientists working on consciousness.&lt;ref name="Kandel"/&gt; Psychologist [[Susan Blackmore]] believes, by contrast, that the search for the neural correlates of consciousness is futile and itself predicated on an erroneous belief in the hard problem of consciousness.&lt;ref name="blackmore"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackmore|first1=Susan|title=The Neural Correlates of Consciousness|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25457|website=Edge.org|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated information theory===
{{further|Integrated information theory}}
Integrated information theory (IIT), developed by the neuroscientist and psychiatrist [[Giulio Tononi]] in 2004 and more recently also advocated by Koch, is one of the most discussed models of consciousness in neuroscience and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="comp-iit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krohn|first1=Stephan|last2=Ostwald|first2=Dirk|title=Computing integrated information|journal=Neuroscience of Consciousness|date=2017|volume=2017|issue=1|doi=10.1093/nc/nix017|url=https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/nix017/4060547|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="critique-iit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cerullo|first1=Michael A.|editor1-last=Kording|editor1-first=Konrad P.|title=The Problem with Phi: A Critique of Integrated Information Theory|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=September 2015|volume=11|issue=9|pmid=26378789|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4574706/#pcbi.1004286.ref004|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes an [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] between consciousness and integrated information, with the latter item (denoted as Φ) defined mathematically and thus in principle measurable.&lt;ref name="critique-iit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="morch-iit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mørch|first1=Hedda Hassel|title=The Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/121/The_Integrated_Information_Theory_of_Consciousness|website=Philosophy Now|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hard problem of consciousness, write Tononi and Koch, may indeed be intractable when working from matter to consciousness.&lt;ref name="tononi+koch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tononi|first1=Giulio|last2=Koch|first2=Christof|title=Consciousness: here, there and everywhere?|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=March 2015|volume=370|issue=1668|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0167|accessdate=|pmc=4387509}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because IIT inverts this relationship and works from phenomenological axioms to matter, they say it could be able to solve the hard problem.&lt;ref name="tononi+koch"/&gt; In this vein, proponents have said the theory goes beyond identifying human neural correlates and can be extrapolated to all physical systems. Tononi wrote (along with two colleagues):

&lt;blockquote&gt;While identifying the “neural correlates of consciousness” is undoubtedly important, it is hard to see how it could ever lead to a satisfactory explanation of what consciousness is and how it comes about. As will be illustrated below, IIT offers a way to analyze systems of mechanisms to determine if they are properly structured to give rise to consciousness, how much of it, and of which kind.&lt;ref name="iit-3.0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oizumi|first1=Masafumi|last2=Albantakis|first2=Larissa|last3=Tononi|first3=Giulio|title=From the Phenomenology to the Mechanisms of Consciousness: Integrated Information Theory 3.0|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=May 2014|volume=10|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588|pmid=24811198|pmc=4014402|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of a broader critique of IIT, Michael Cerullo suggested that the theory's proposed explanation is in fact for what he dubs (following [[Scott Aaronson]]) the "Pretty Hard Problem" of methodically inferring which physical systems are conscious—but would not solve Chalmers' hard problem.&lt;ref name="critique-iit"/&gt; "Even if IIT is correct," he argues, "it does not explain why integrated information generates (or is) consciousness."&lt;ref name="critique-iit"/&gt;

==Responses==
===Consciousness as fundamental or elusive===
Some philosophers, including [[David Chalmers]] in the late 20th century and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] earlier in the 1900s, argued that conscious experience is a fundamental constituent of the universe, a form of [[panpsychism]] sometimes referred to as [[panexperientialism]]. Chalmers argued that a "rich inner life" is not logically reducible to the functional properties of physical processes. He states that consciousness must be described using nonphysical means. This description involves a fundamental ingredient capable of clarifying phenomena that have not been explained using physical means. Use of this fundamental property, Chalmers argues, is necessary to explain certain functions of the world, much like other fundamental features, such as mass and time, and to explain significant principles in nature.

The philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] posited in 1974 that experiences are essentially subjective (accessible only to the individual undergoing them—i.e., felt only by the one feeling them), while physical states are essentially objective (accessible to multiple individuals). So at this stage, he argued, we have no idea what it could even mean to claim that an essentially subjective state just ''is'' an essentially non-subjective state (i.e., how and why a felt state is just a functional state). In other words, we have no idea of what reductivism really amounts to.&lt;ref name="Bat"/&gt;

[[New mysterianism]], such as that of the philosopher [[Colin McGinn]], proposes that the human [[mind]], in its current form, will not be able to explain consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2012/02/consciousness-mind-brain |title=All machine and no ghost? |last=McGinn |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin McGinn |date=20 February 2012 |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deflationary accounts===
Some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt; and [[Peter Hacker]]&lt;ref name=Hacker&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hacker's challenge |url=http://philpapers.org/rec/HACHC |last=Hacker |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Hacker |journal=The Philosopher's Magazine |volume=51 |issue=51 |pages=23–32 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; oppose the idea that there is a hard problem. These theorists have argued that once we really come to understand what consciousness is, we will realize that the hard problem is unreal. For instance, Dennett asserts that the so-called hard problem will be solved in the process of answering the "easy" ones (which, as he has clarified, he does not consider "easy" at all).&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt; In contrast with Chalmers, he argues that consciousness is not a fundamental feature of the universe and instead will eventually be fully explained by natural phenomena. Instead of involving the nonphysical, he says, consciousness merely plays tricks on people so that it appears nonphysical—in other words, it simply seems like it requires nonphysical features to account for its powers. In this way, Dennett compares consciousness to stage magic and its capability to create extraordinary illusions out of ordinary things.&lt;ref name=Dennett3/&gt;

To show how people might be commonly fooled into overstating the powers of consciousness, Dennett describes a normal phenomenon called [[change blindness]], a visual process that involves failure to detect scenery changes in a series of alternating images.&lt;ref name=Dennett2/&gt; He uses this concept to argue that the overestimation of the brain's visual processing implies that the conception of our consciousness is likely not as pervasive as we make it out to be. He claims that this error of making consciousness more mysterious than it is could be a misstep in any developments toward an effective explanatory theory. Critics such as [[Galen Strawson]] reply that, in the case of consciousness, even a mistaken experience retains the essential face of experience that needs to be explained, contra Dennett.

To address the question of the hard problem, or how and why physical processes give rise to experience, Dennett states that the phenomenon of having experience is nothing more than the performance of functions or the production of behavior, which can also be referred to as the easy problems of consciousness.&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt; He states that consciousness itself is driven simply by these functions, and to strip them away would wipe out any ability to identify thoughts, feelings, and consciousness altogether. So, unlike Chalmers and other dualists, Dennett says that the easy problems and the hard problem cannot be separated from each other. To him, the hard problem of experience is included among—not separate from—the easy problems, and therefore they can only be explained together as a cohesive unit.&lt;ref name=Dennett3/&gt;

Critics of Dennett's approach, such as Chalmers and Nagel, argue that Dennett's argument misses the point of the inquiry by merely re-defining consciousness as an external property and ignoring the subjective aspect completely. This has led detractors to refer to Dennett's book ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' as ''Consciousness Ignored'' or ''Consciousness Explained Away''.&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt;  Dennett discussed this at the end of his book with a section entitled ''Consciousness Explained or Explained Away?''&lt;ref name=Dennett2/&gt;

Like Dennett, Hacker argues that the hard problem is fundamentally incoherent and that "consciousness studies", as it exists today, is "literally a total waste of time":&lt;ref name=Hacker/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole endeavour of the consciousness studies community is absurd—they are in pursuit of a chimera. They misunderstand the nature of consciousness. The conception of consciousness which they have is incoherent. The questions they are asking don't make sense. They have to go back to the drawing board and start all over again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the most common arguments against deflationary accounts and [[eliminative materialism]] are the argument from qualia and the argument that conscious experiences are irreducible to physical states—or that current popular definitions of "physical" are incomplete—the objection has been posed{{by whom|date=September 2018}} that the one and same reality can appear in different ways, and that the numerical difference of these ways is consistent with a unitary mode of existence of the reality.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Critics of the deflationary approach object that qualia are a case where a single reality cannot have multiple appearances. For example, the philosopher [[John Searle]] pointed out: "where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance is the reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Searle |first=John R. |authorlink=John Searle |date=1997 |title=The mystery of consciousness |location=New York |publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] |isbn=0940322064 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqsytrHg8LkC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable deflationary account is the [[higher-order theories of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Peter |last=Carruthers |authorlink=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) |title=Higher-order theories of consciousness |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/ |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the philosopher [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] wrote about "recognitional concepts of experience", that is, "a capacity to recognize [a] type of experience when it occurs in one's own mental life", and suggested that such a capacity does not depend upon qualia.&lt;ref name=Carruthers&gt;{{cite book |title=Consciousness: essays from a higher-order perspective |chapter=Phenomenal concepts and higher-order experiments |last=Carruthers |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKI4flNaGjUC&amp;pg=PA79 |pages=79 ''ff'' |isbn=0191535044 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers Glenn Carruthers and Elizabeth Schier said in 2012 that the main arguments for the existence of a hard problem—[[philosophical zombies]], [[Mary's room]], and [[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?|Nagel's bats]]—are only persuasive if one already assumes that "consciousness must be independent of the structure and function of mental states, i.e. that there is a hard problem". Hence, the arguments [[beg the question]]. The authors suggest that "instead of letting our conclusions on the thought experiments guide our theories of consciousness, we should let our theories of consciousness guide our conclusions from the thought experiments".&lt;ref name=CarruthersSchier2012&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Carruthers |first1=Glenn |last2=Schier |first2=Elizabeth |title=Dissolving the hard problem of consciousness|book-title=Consciousness Online fourth conference|date=2012|url=http://consciousnessonline.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/disolvinghardproblem.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the philosopher Elizabeth Irvine argued that both science and [[folk psychology]] do not treat [[mental state]]s as having phenomenal properties, and therefore "the hard problem of consciousness may not be a genuine problem for non-philosophers (despite its overwhelming obviousness to philosophers), and questions about consciousness may well 'shatter' into more specific questions about particular capacities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Elizabeth |date=2013 |title=Consciousness as a scientific concept: a philosophy of science perspective |series=Studies in brain and mind |volume=5 |location=Dordrecht; New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=9789400751729 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jO4HNB7OoUgC&amp;pg=PA167 167]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] distances himself from eliminativism, but he said in 2013 that the hard problem is still misguided, resulting from a "category mistake":&lt;ref name=Pigliucci2013&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Massimo Pigliucci|authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|title=What hard problem?|journal=Philosophy Now|date=2013|issue=99|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/PIGWHP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course an explanation isn't the same as an experience, but that's because the two are completely independent categories, like colors and triangles. It is obvious that I cannot experience what it is like to be you, but I can potentially have a complete explanation of how and why it is possible to be you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2017, the philosopher Marco Stango, in a paper on [[John Dewey]]'s approach to the problem of consciousness (which preceded Chalmers' formulation of the hard problem by over half a century), noted that Dewey's approach would see the hard problem as the consequence of an unjustified assumption that feelings and functional behaviors are not the same physical process: "For the Deweyan philosopher, the 'hard problem' of consciousness is a 'conceptual fact' only in the sense that it is a {{em|philosophical mistake}}: the mistake of failing to see that the physical can be had as an episode of immediate sentiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stango |first=Marco |date=Summer 2017 |title=A Deweyan assessment of three major tendencies in philosophy of consciousness |journal=Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society: A Quarterly Journal in American Philosophy |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=466–490 |doi=10.2979/trancharpeirsoc.53.3.06 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/680916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of the illusion===
A complete reductionistic or mechanistic theory of consciousness must include the description of a [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]] by which the subjective aspect of consciousness is perceived and reported by people. Philosophers such as Chalmers or Nagel have rejected reductionist theories of consciousness because they believe that the reports of subjective experience constitute a vast and important body of empirical evidence which is ignored by modern reductionist theories of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Moving forward"/&gt;

Dennett argued that solving the easy problem of consciousness, that is finding out how the brain works, will eventually lead to the solution of the hard problem of consciousness.&lt;ref name = Dennett/&gt; In particular, the solution can be achieved by identifying the stimuli and neurological pathways whose operation generates evidence of subjective experience.

Neuroscientist [[Michael Graziano]], in his book ''Consciousness and the Social Brain'', advocates what he calls [[attention schema theory]], in which our perception of being conscious is merely an error in perception, held by brains which evolved to hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own internal workings, just as they hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own bodies and of the external world.&lt;ref name="Consciousness as engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Consciousness as engineering2"/&gt;

Cognitive neuroscientist [[Stanislas Dehaene]], in his 2014 book ''Consciousness and the Brain'', summarized the previous decades of experimental consciousness research involving reports of subjective experience, and argued that Chalmers' "easy problems" of consciousness are actually the hard problems and the "hard problems" are based only upon ill-defined intuitions that, according to Dehaene, are continually shifting as understanding evolves:&lt;ref name=Dehaene/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once our intuitions are educated by cognitive neuroscience and computer simulations, Chalmers' hard problem will evaporate. The hypothetical concept of qualia, pure mental experience, detached from any information-processing role, will be viewed as a peculiar idea of the prescientific era, much like [[vitalism]]... [Just as science dispatched vitalism] the science of consciousness will keep eating away at the hard problem of consciousness until it vanishes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1941">'''Henri Gouhier''' ({{IPA-fr|guje|lang}}; 5 December 1898 – 31 March 1994) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], a [[historian]] of philosophy, and a [[literary critic]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Auxerre]], [[Yonne]], Gouhier's studies led to a doctorate in 1926. He served as the Professor of philosophy at a ''[[lycée]]'' in [[Troyes]] from 1925 to 1928. Then he taught at the Faculty of Arts at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]] between 1929 and 1940; subsequently, he taught at the [[University of Bordeaux]] during 1940 and 1941.

Gouhier was a Professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] for twenty-seven years from 1941 to 1968. In 1979 he was elected to the [[Académie française]] and in 1988 was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].

Gouhier supervised the undergraduate dissertation of famed sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]], a translation of and commentary on Leibniz's ''Animadversions''.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Robbins, "Pierre Bourdieu, 1930-2002," ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'' 19:3 (2002), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Paris]].

and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts ([[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]]) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (''[[ijma]]'').&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform ''ijtihad'' is called a ''[[mujtahid]]''.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ''ijtihad'' was gradually restricted.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception among Western scholars and lay Muslim public that the so-called "gate of ''ijtihad''" was closed at the start of the classical era.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; While recent scholarship has disproved this notion, the extent and mechanisms of legal change in the post-formative period remain a subject of debate.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

Starting from the 18th century, some Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of ''taqlid'' and emphasis on ''ijtihad'', which they saw as a return to Islamic origins.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; Public debates in the Muslim world surrounding ''ijtihad'' continue to the present day.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; The advocacy of ''ijtihad'' has been particularly associated with [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] and purist [[Salafi]] thinkers. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of ''ijtihad'' which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical methodology.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

[[Shia]] jurists did not use the term ''ijtihad'' until the 12th century, but they employed a rational mode of legal reasoning from the early period, and its scope was not narrowed as in the Sunni tradition, with the exception of [[Zaydi]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

==Etymology and definition==
The word derives from the [[triliteral|three-letter Arabic verbal root]] of {{lang|ar|ج-ه-د}} ''[[gimel (letter)|{{transl|ar|ALA|J}}]]-[[he (letter)|H]]-[[dalet|D]]'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|jahada}}'', 'struggle'): the "t" is inserted because the word is a [[Arabic verbs#Formation of derived stems ("forms")|derived stem VIII]] verb. In its literal meaning, the word refers to effort, physical or mental, expended in a particular activity.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; In its technical sense, ''ijtihad'' can be defined as a "process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah|Sunna]]".&lt;ref name=hallaq&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallaq|first=Wael|title=The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The juristic meaning of ijtihād has several definitions according to scholars of [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|Islamic legal theory]]. Some define it as the jurist’s action and activity to reach a solution. Al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) defines it as the “total expenditure of effort made by a jurist for the purpose of obtaining the religious rulings.” Similarly the ijtihād is defined{{by whom|date=February 2017}} as “the effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the ''[[Ahkam|aḥkām]]'' (rulings) of the [[sharī‘ah]] (Islamic canonical law) through interpretation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kayadibi|first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh)|date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|location=Kuala Lumpur|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point of view that ijtihād essentially consists of an inference (''istinbāṭ'') that extents to a probability (''ẓann''){{clarify|date=February 2017}}{{quote needed|date=February 2017}}. Thus it excludes the extraction of a ruling from a clear text as well as rulings made without recourse to independent legal reasoning. A knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharī‘ah, but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources, is not called a mujtahid but rather a ''[[muqallid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kayadibi|first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh)|date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|location=Kuala Lumpur|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural basis==
Islamic scholar [[Asghar Ali Engineer]] cites a [[hadith]] related by a [[Sahabah|sahabi]] (companion of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]) by the name of [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] (also Ma’adh bin Jabal), as the basis for ijtihad.

==History==
===Formative period===

During the early period, ''ijtihad'' referred to the exercise of one's discretionary opinion (''ra'y'') on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent (''‘ilm'').&lt;ref name=hallaq/&gt; Jurists used ''ra'y'' to help reach legal rulings, in cases where the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah|Sunna]] did not provide clear direction for certain decisions. It was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the Muslim community and promote the public good.

As religious law continued to develop over time, ''ra'y'' became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah|Sunna]]. However, during this time, the meaning and process of ''ijtihad'' became more clearly constructed. ''Ijtihad'' was "limited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts, the Quran and Sunna," and the rulings could be "extended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Ijtihad|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t24/e150|work=The Islamic World: Past and Present|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the practice of ''ijtihad'' transformed over time, it became religious duty of a ''mujtahid'' to conduct legal rulings for the Muslim society. ''Mujtahid'' is defined as a Muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah|Sunna]], and Arabic, as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ''ijtihad''.&lt;ref name="Oxford Islamic Studies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Ijtihad|url=http://oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e150|work=The Islamic World: Past and Present|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical era===

Around the beginning of the 10th century, most Sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled, allowing for ''[[taqlid]]'' (تقليد), "the established legal precedents and traditions," to take priority over ''ijtihād'' (اجتهاد).&lt;ref name="Oxford Islamic Studies" /&gt;{{request quote|date=April 2016}} This move away from the practice of ''ijtihād'' was made by the [[Hanafi|Hanafī]] and [[Maliki|Malikī]] law schools, and the majority of [[Shafii|Shafīʿi]]s, but not by [[Hanbali|Hanbalī]]s or a number of prominent Shafīʿi jurists who believed that "true consensus" (''[[ijma|ijmāʿ]]'' اجماع), apart from that of Muhammad's Companions, did not exist" and that "the constant continuous existence of ''mujtahids'' (مجتهد) was a theological requirement."&lt;ref name=WahhabiIslam&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLong-Bas|first=Natana J.|authorlink=Natana J. DeLong-Bas|title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA|year=2004|page=106|edition=First|isbn=0-19-516991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 11th century, Sunni legal theory developed systems for ranking jurists according to their qualifications for ''ijtihad''. One such ranking placed the founders of ''[[maddhab]]''s, who were credited with being "absolute ''mujtahid''s" (''mujtahid muṭlaq'') capable of methodological innovation, at the top, and jurists capable only of ''taqlīd'' at the bottom, with ''mujtahid''s and those who combined ''ijtihād'' and ''taqlīd'' given the middle ranks.{{#tag:ref| After the eleventh century, Sunnī legal literature developed rankings of jurists according to their ability to practice ''ijtihād''. One predominant classification credited the founders of the legal schools with the distinction of being absolute ''mujtahid''s (''mujtahid muṭlaq'') who were capable of laying down a methodology of the law and of deriving from it the positive doctrines that were to dominate their respective schools. Accordingly, each legal school represented a different methodology for ''ijtihād''. Next came the ''mujtahid''s who operated within each school (''mujtahid muntasim'' or ''mujtahid fī al-madhhab''), who followed the methodology of the school's founder but proffered new solutions for novel legal cases. The lowest rank belonged to the ''muqallid'', the jurist-imitator who merely followed the rulings arrived at by the ''mujtāhid''s without understanding the processes by which these rulings were derived. Between the ranks of ''mujtahid''s and ''muqallid''s there were distinguished other levels of jurists who combined ''ijtihād'' with ''taqlīd''. [...] The settling of the major areas of Islamic law gave rise to the perception, prevalent among many modern Western scholars and Sunnī lay Muslims, that jurists had come to a consensus that the so-called "gate of ijtihād" (باب الاجتهاد ''bāb al-ijtihād'') was closed at the beginning of the tenth century. 
&lt;ref name=rabb&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ijtihād|author=Intisar A.

During that era some jurists began to ponder whether practitioners of ''ijtihad'' continued to exist and the phrase "closing of the gate of ''ijtihād''" (إغلاق باب الاجتهاد ''iġlāq bāb al-ijtihād'') appeared after the 16th century.{{#tag:ref|In the eleventh century, jurists defined a jurisconsult as being a ''mujtahid'' (i.e., one who has the ability to independently reason; the highest rank of a jurist).

The settling of Sunni law and increasing prominence of ''taqlid'' has at one point led most Western scholars to believe that the "gate of ''ijtihad''" was in fact effectively closed around 900 C.E.&lt;ref name=rabb/&gt; In a 1964 monograph, which exercised considerable influence on later scholars, [[Joseph Schacht]] wrote that "a consensus gradually established itself to the effect that from that time onwards no one could be deemed to have the necessary qualifications for independent reasoning in religious law, and that all future activity would have to be confined to the explanation, application, and, at the most, interpretation of the doctrine as it had been laid down once and for all."{{#tag:ref| The leading European authority on Islamic law in the mid-twentieth century, Joseph Schacht, declared in a phenomenally influential survey that [...] Since the 1990s, a large and growing body of research has demonstrated the continuing creativity and dynamism of Islamic legal thinking in the post-formative period, as well as probed the lively dialectic between legal rulings and social practice. While it is no longer possible to assert that "the door of ijtihad was closed" after the tenth (or, indeed, any other) century, however, there is still lively debate over the extent of legal change and the mechanisms by which it occurred.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Age of Development and Continuity, 12th–15th Centuries CE|author=Marion Katz|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Law|year=2015 |publisher= Oxford University Press |subscription=yes|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199679010.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199679010-e-14|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacht|first=Joseph|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law|publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1964|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Islamic_Law.html?id=vL4LAQAAIAAJ |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

Hallaq, "On the origin of the Controversy about the Existence of Mutahids and the Gate of Ijtihad," ''Studia Islamica'', 63 (1986): 129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi'i]] Muslims recognized "human reasoning and intellect as a legal source that supplements the Quran and other revealed texts," thus continuing to acknowledge the importance of ''ijtihad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Ijtihad|url=http://www.islamicstudiesonline.com/article/opr/t125/e990|work=The Islamic World: Past and Present|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern era ===

During the turn of the 16th to 17th century, [[Sunni]] Muslim reformers began to criticize [[taqlid]], and promoted greater use of ''ijtihad'' in legal matters. They claimed that instead of looking solely to previous generations for practices developed by religious scholars, there should be an established doctrine and rule of behavior through the interpretation of original foundational texts of Islam—the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah|Sunna]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Islamic Studies" /&gt;{{request quote|date=April 2016}}

====Islamic modernism====
{{main article|Islamic modernism}}
Starting in the middle of the 19th century, [[Islamic modernism|Islamic modernist]]s such as Sir [[Sayyid Ahmed Khan]], [[Jamal al-din Al-Afghani]], and [[Muhammad Abduh]] emerged seeking to revitalize Islam by re-establish and reform [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and its interpretations to accommodate Islam with modern society.&lt;ref name=USIP&gt;{{cite web|title=Ijtihad: Reinterpreting Islamic Principles for the 21st Century|url=http://dspace.cigilibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/15036/1/Ijtihad%20Reinterpreting%20Islamic%20Principles%20for%20the%20Twenty%20first%20Century.pdf?1|work=United States Institute of Peace Special Report|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized the use of ''ijtihad'', but in contrast to its original use,&lt;ref name="NYU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices of a New Ijtihad|url=http://islamuswest.org/publications_islam_and_the_West/Who_Speaks_For_Islam/Who-Speaks-For-Islam_21.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105172407/http://islamuswest.org/publications_islam_and_the_West/Who_Speaks_For_Islam/Who-Speaks-For-Islam_21.html |archive-date=2016-01-05|work=Center for Dialogues|publisher=NYU|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they sought to "apply contemporary intellectual methods" such as academic or scientific thought "to the task of reforming Islam".&lt;ref name="NYU" /&gt;   Al-Afghani proposed the new use of ''ijtihad'' that he believed would enable [[Muslims]] to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="NYU" /&gt;

One modernist argument for applying ijtihad to sharia law is that while "the principles and values underlying Sharia (i.e. ''usul al-fiqh'')" are unalterable, human interpretation of sharia is not.&lt;ref name="Hussain-IotiL-2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hussain|first1=Tanveer |title=Immutability of the Islamic Laws|url=http://quranicteachings.org/immutability-of-islamic-laws/ |website=quranicteachings.org |accessdate=12 April 2018 |date=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISI-1-2-13"/&gt;  Another, (made by [[Asghar Ali Engineer]] of India), is that the ''adaat'' (customs and traditions) of Arabs were used in the development of the sharia, and form an important part of it. They are very much not divine or immutable, and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the ''adaat'' of Muslims living beyond the home of the original Muslim in the Arab [[Hejaz]].  The
&lt;blockquote&gt;ummah was no longer a homogenous group but {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} various cultural communities with their own age-old customs and traditions. ... When Imam [[Al-Shafi‘i]] moved from Hejaz to Egypt, which was a confluence of Arab and Coptic cultures, he realised this and changed his position on several issues.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In Indonesia, following considerable debate among the [[ulema]],  Indonesian ''adaat'' "become part of Sharia as applicable in that country".&lt;ref name="ISI-1-2-13"/&gt; This use of ijtihad to apply ''adaat'' applies to ''[[Muamalat|mu’amalat]]'' (socio-economic matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance), rather than ''[[Ibadah]]'' fiqh (ritual [[salat]], [[sawm]], [[zakat]], etc.). Asghar Ali Engineer argues that while the Arab ''adaat'' the Quran was revealed in was "highly patriarchal" and still informs what is understood as sharia, the "transcendental Quranic vision" is for "absolutely equal rights" between genders and should guide ijtihad of sharia.&lt;ref name="ISI-1-2-13"/&gt;

====Islamism and Salafism====

Contemporary [[Salafis]] are major proponents of ''ijtihad''. They criticize ''taqlid'' and believe ''ijtihad'' makes modern [[Islam]] more authentic and will guide Muslims back to the Golden Age of early Islam. [[Salafis]] assert that reliance on ''taqlid'' has led to [[Islam]]'s decline.&lt;ref name=Wahabism&gt;{{cite web|last=Ungureanu|first=Daniel|title=Wahabism, Salafism, and the Expansion of Islamic Fundamentalist Ideology|url=http://fssp.uaic.ro/argumentum/Numarul%2010/11_Ungureanu_tehno.pdf|publisher=Ai.I.Cuza University of Iasi|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] traces its founding philosophies to al-Afghani's ''ijtihad''. The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] holds that the practice of ''ijtihad'' will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the [[Quran]] and come to their own conclusions about its teachings. But as a political group the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] faces a major paradox between ''ijtihad'' as a religious matter and as a political one. ''Ijtihad'' weakens political unity and promotes pluralism, (which is also why many oppressive regimes reject ''ijtihad''{{'}}s legitimacy).&lt;ref name="American Historical Review" /&gt;

The Iranian Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] envisioned a prominent role for ''ijtihad'' in his political theory of "[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|guardianship of the jurist]]" (''vilāyat-e faqīh'').&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

[[Osama Bin Laden]] supported ''ijtihad''. He criticized the [[Saudi]] regime for disallowing the "free believer"&lt;ref name="American Historical Review" /&gt; and imposing harsh restrictions on successful practice of [[Islam]].  Thus, Bin Laden believed his striving for the implementation of ''ijtihad'' was his "duty" (''[[takleef]]'').&lt;ref name="American Historical Review" /&gt;

==Qualifications of a mujtahid== &lt;!--Linked from [[Mujtahid]]--&gt;
A ''mujtahid'' ({{lang-ar|مجتهد}}, "[[wikt:diligent|diligent]]") is an individual who is qualified to exercise ''ijtihad'' in the evaluation of Islamic law. The female equivalent is a ''mujtahida''. In general ''mujtahids'' must have an extensive knowledge of Arabic, the Qur'an, the [[Sunnah]], and legal theory ([[Usul al-fiqh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mujtahid|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e159|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni Islam and Shi'i Islam, due to their divergent beliefs regarding the persistence of divine authority, have different views on ''ijtihad'' and the qualifications required to achieve ''mujtahid''. In order to clarify how ''ijtihad'' differs in Sunni and Shi'i Islam it is necessary to explore the historical development of this position in both branches.

===Sunni===
In the years immediately following the Mohammed's death, Sunni Muslims practiced ''ijtihad'' because they saw it as an acceptable form of the continuation of sacred instruction. Sunni Muslims, therefore began to practice ''ijtihad'' primarily through the use of personal opinion, or ra'y. As Muslims turned to the Quran and Sunnah to solve their legal issues, they began to recognize that these divine proponents did not deal adequately with certain topics of law. Therefore, Sunni Muslims began to find other ways and sources for ''ijtihad'' such as ''ra'y'', which allowed for personal judgment of Islamic law. Sunni Muslims justified this practice of ''ra'y'' with a particular hadith, which cites Muhammad's approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the Qur'an and Sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=El Shamsy|first=Ahmed|title=Ijtihad bi al-Ray|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e1171|work=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, during the first two and a half centuries of Islam there were no restrictions placed on scholars interested in practicing ''ijtihad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamali|first=Mohammad Hashim|title=Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence|year=1991|publisher=Islamic Texts Society|location=Cambridge|isbn=0946621241|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 9th century, jurists began to make more restrictions on who could practice ''ijtihad'' and the kinds of qualifications necessary. Therefore, the practice of ''ijtihad'' became limited to a qualified scholar and jurist otherwise known as a ''mujtahid''. Abu'l-Husayn al-Basri provides the earliest and most expansive outline for the qualifications of a ''mujtahid'', they include:
* Enough knowledge of Arabic so that the scholar can read and understand both the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
* Extensive comprehensive knowledge of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. More specifically, the scholar must have a full understanding of the Qur'an's legal contents. In regards to the Sunnah the scholar must understand the specific texts that refer to law and also the incidence of abrogation in the Sunnah.
* Must be able to confirm the consensus (''[[Ijma]]'') of the Companions, the Successors, and the leading Imams and mujtahideen of the past, in order to prevent making decisions that disregard these honored decisions made in the past.
* Should be able to fully understand the objectives of the sharia and be dedicated to the protection of the Five Principles of Islam, which are life, religion, intellect, lineage, and property.{{Citation needed|reason=It seems like they are talking about the Five Pillars of Islam and not "principles" which don't seem to exist and are very different than described|date=September 2018}}
* Be able to distinguish strength and weakness in reasoning, or in other words exercise logic.
* Must be sincere and a good person.&lt;ref name="Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamali|first=Mohammad Hashim|title=Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence|year=1991|publisher=Islamic Texts Society|location=Cambridge|pages=374–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the declaration of these requirements of ''mujtahid'' onwards, legal scholars adopted these characteristics as being standard for anyone looking to practice ''ijtihad''. In order for the reasoning of these ''mujtahids'' to be accepted as law multiple ''mujtahids'' had to reach ''ijma''. This allowed for ''mujtahids'' to openly discuss their particular views and reach a conclusion together. The interaction required by ''ijma'' allowed for ''mujtahids'' to circulate ideas and eventually merge to create particular Islamic schools of law (''[[madhhab]]s''). This consolidation of ''mujtahids'' into particular ''madhhabs'' prompted these groups to create their own distinct authoritative rules. These laws reduced issues of legal uncertainty that had been present when multiple ''mujtahids'' were working together with one another. However, with this introduction of common laws for each ''madhhab'', legal scholars began to dismiss the practice of independent ''ijtihad'' and instead maintained the title of ''mujtahid'' only for the founders of the four main schools of Islamic law (''Hanafiyya, Malikiyya, Shafiyya, Hanbaliyya'').&lt;ref name="American Historical Review" /&gt; Therefore, from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a ''mujtahid'' or access ''ijtihad'' in only two cases, when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as "imitators" of ''mujtahids'', expressing the views of the more qualified ''mujtahids'' before them.&lt;ref name="American Historical Review"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Indira Falk Gesnik|title="Chaos on the Earth": Subjective Truths versus Communal Unity in Islamic Law and the Rise of Militant Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|journal=The American Historical Review|date=June 2003|volume=108|issue=3|pages=710–733|jstor=10.1086/529594|doi=10.1086/529594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the practice of ''ijtihad'' was restricted in favor of taqlid.  These Sunni restrictions on the power of the ''mujtahid'' and were due to historical developments and should not be accepted as terms of the original legal theory of ''ijtihad''.

===Shi'a===
The [[Shi'a]] Muslims understand the process of ''ijtihad'' as being the independent effort used to arrive at the rulings of sharia. Following the death of the Prophet and once they had determined the Imam as absent, ''ijtihad'' evolved into a practice of applying careful reason in order to uncover the knowledge of what ''Imams'' would have done in particular legal situations. The decisions the ''Imams'' would have made were explored through the application of the Qur'an, Sunnah, ''ijma'' and ''[['aql]]'' (reason). It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that the title of ''mujtahid'' became associated with the term ''faqih'' or one who is an expert in jurisprudence. From this point on religious courts began to increase in number and the ulama were transformed by Shi'i Islamic authorities into the new producer of ''ijtihad''.&lt;ref name=Momen&gt;{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shi'ism|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to produce perceptive ''mujtahids'' that could fulfill this important role, principles of Shi'i jurisprudence were developed to provide a foundation for scholarly deduction of Islamic law. [http://www.al-islam.org/short/ansari.htm Shaykh Murtada Ansari] and his successors developed the school of Shi'i law, dividing the legal decisions into four categories of certainty (''qat''), valid conjecture (''zann''), doubt (''shakk''), and erroneous conjecture (''wahm''). These rules allowed ''mujtahids'' to issue adjudications on any subject, that could be derived through this process of ''ijtihad'', demonstrating their great responsibility to the Shi'i community&lt;ref name=Momen /&gt; Furthermore, according to Shi'i Islamic Jurisprudence a believer of Islam is either a ''Mujtahid'' (one that expresses their own legal reasoning), or a ''Muqallid'' (one performing Taqlid of a Mujtahid) and a ''Muhtat'' (one who acts with precaution). Most Shi'i Muslims qualify as ''Muqallid'', and therefore are very dependent on the rulings of the ''Mujtahids''. Therefore, the ''Mujtahids'' must be well prepared to perform ''ijtihad'', as the community of ''Muqallid'' are dependent on their rulings. Not only did Shi'i Muslims require:
* Knowledge of the texts of the Qur'an and Sunnah
* Justice in matters of public and personal life
* Utmost piety
* Understanding of the cases where Shi'i ''mujtahids'' reached consensus
* Ability to exercise competence and authority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutahhari|first=Murtada|title=The Principle of Ijtihad in Islam|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-serat/ijtihad.htm|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scholars also depended on further training that could be received in religious centers called Hawza. At these centers they are taught the important subjects and technical knowledge a ''mujtahid'' need be proficient in such as:
* Arabic grammar and literature
* Logic
* Extensive knowledge of the Qur'anic sciences and Hadith
* Science of narrators
* Principle of Jurisprudence
* Comparative Jurisprudence&lt;ref name="Principles of Ijtihad in Islam"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutahhari|first=Murtada|title=The Principles of Ijtihad in Islam|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-serat/ijtihad.htm|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Shi'i ''mujtahids'' remain revered throughout the Shi'i Islamic world. The relationship between the ''mujtahids'' and ''muqallids'' continues to address and solve the contemporary legal issues. Participating in ijtihad, however, has been cautioned by scholars for those not properly educated in interpretation of the Qu'ran. This is narrated by [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]], the great grandson of Muhammad, when he cautioned [[Aban ibn abi-Ayyash]], a companion of the Imam, saying, "Oh brother form 'Abd Qays, if the issue becomes clear to you, then accept it. Otherwise remain silent and defer to Allah because your interpretation from the truth will be as far from the Earth as the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Kulayni |first1=Muhammad ibn Ya‘qub |title=Al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=Islamic Seminary Incorporated |location=NY |isbn=9780991430864 |edition=Volume 6 |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female mujtahids===
A woman can be a ''mujtahid'' and there are dozens who have attained the rank in the modern history of Iran (for instance, [[Amina Bint al-Majlisi]] in the Safavid era, [[Bibi Khanum]] in the Qajar era, [[Nosrat Amin|Lady Amin]] in the Pahlavi era, and [[Zohreh Sefati]] during the time of the Islamic Republic).&lt;ref&gt;See: Mirjam Künkler and Roja Fazaeli, "The Life of Two Mujtahidas: Female Religious Authority in 20th Century Iran", in ''Women, Leadership and Mosques: Changes in Contemporary Islamic Authority'', ed. Masooda Bano and Hilary Kalmbach (Brill Publishers, 2012), 127-160. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1884209_code1321417.pdf?abstractid=1884209&amp;mirid=1&lt;/ref&gt; There are diverging opinions as to whether a female ''mujtahid'' can be a [[Marja'|marjaʻ]] or not. [[Zohreh Sefati]] and some male jurists believe a female ''mujtahida'' can become a ''marjaʻ'', -in other words, they believe that believers perform ''taqlid'' (emulation) of a female mujtahid- but many male jurists believe a ''marjaʻ'' must be male.

'''Im Che''' ({{Korean|임제|林悌}}; 1549 – 1587) was a [[literate]] [[Confucianist]] [[Yangban]] in [[Joseon]].

== Works ==

Im penned the following [[sijo]] upon the death of famed [[gisaeng]], [[Hwang Jini]].
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|ko|청산리 벽계수(靑山裏 碧溪水)청초 우거진 골에 자는다 누웠는다
홍안(紅顔)은 어디 두고 백골(白骨)만 묻혔는다
잔 잡아 권할 이 없으니 그를 설워 하노라}}
|
Below this deep green grave
  do you sleep? Are you resting?
  Where are your blushing cheeks?
  Only white bones remain.
This cup breaks my heart:
  She is not here to sip it.&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Race" Bannon|David Bannon]], [https://sites.google.com/site/atakoreanlanguagedivision/kld-newsletter/Hangul%20Herald%20Fall%202008.pdf?attredirects=0 “Sijo Poetry of Korean Kisaeng,”]  ''Hangul Herald'', Fall 2008: 10-13. Excerpted and used with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


The following two poems were exchanged between Im Che and his lover, [[gisaeng]] Hanu (한우; 寒雨). Im was known for his liaisons with Hanu and Hwang Jin Yi. The term in line 3, ch’an bi (찬비), literally translates as “freezing rain.” It uses the same Chinese characters as the poetess’ name (寒雨), but with a different pronunciation, and was intended by both poets as a [[pun]]. 
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|ko|북천이 맑다커늘 우장 없이 길을 나니
산에는 눈이 오고 들에는 찬 비로다
오늘은 찬 비 맞았시니 얼어 잘가 하노라}}
|
They called for clear weather.
  I left without a coat
  but snow fell on the mountain,
  freezing rain on the fields.
Rain has frozen me today:
  I shiver on my mat tonight.
- Im Che to Hanu&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Race" Bannon|David Bannon]], [https://sites.google.com/site/atakoreanlanguagedivision/kld-newsletter/Hangul%20Herald%20Fall%202008.pdf?attredirects=0 “Sijo Poetry of Korean Kisaeng,”]  ''Hangul Herald'', Fall 2008: 10-13. Excerpted and used with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hanu’s particular gift is to echo the style of the original that Im wrote to her, while improving on it with a teasing, very human tone. The translation employs a formal tone to match Im’s original; and then follows with the simpler and more lyric style used by Hanu. In both cases, the line “rain has frozen” seemed to best communicate the [[double entendre]] of the originals.
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|ko|어이 얼어자리 무슨 이로 얼어 자리
원앙침(鴛鴦枕) 비취금(翡翠衾)을 어디두고 얼어 자리
오늘은 찬비 맞았으니 녹아 잘까 하노라}}
|
How can you stand that frigid mat?
  Here is my bed
  with ducks embroidered on pillows
  and a soft jade quilt.
Rain has frozen you today:
  Melt with me tonight.
- Hanu’s response to Im Che&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Race" Bannon|David Bannon]], [https://sites.google.com/site/atakoreanlanguagedivision/kld-newsletter/Hangul%20Herald%20Fall%202008.pdf?attredirects=0 “Sijo Poetry of Korean Kisaeng,”]  ''Hangul Herald'', Fall 2008: 10-13.

'''''In Our Time''''' is a live [[BBC]] radio discussion series exploring the [[history of ideas]], presented by [[Melvyn Bragg]] since 15 October 1998.&lt;ref Name="IOT"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/in-our-time/ BBC ''In our time''].&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of BBC Radio 4's most successful discussion programmes, acknowledged to have "transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time".&lt;ref Name="Ankles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article7097836.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 21 June 2018, 808 episodes have been aired&lt;ref name="broadcasts"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/player?page=73 | title= Episodes | work=In Our Time|publisher= [[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate=2017-08-19| quote=1998 - 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the series attracts a weekly audience exceeding two million listeners.&lt;ref name="bragg11"/&gt;

==Programme==
The series, devised and produced by Olivia Seligman (with others) and currently produced by Simon Tillotson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b084zk6z|title=The Gin Craze, In Our Time - BBC Radio 4|author=|date=|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Victoria Brignell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anglia.ac.uk/graduation-and-alumni/honorary-award-holders2/victoria-brignell|title=Victoria Brignell - Anglia Ruskin University|author=|date=|website=anglia.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs weekly throughout the year on [[BBC Radio 4]], except for a summer break of approximately eight to ten weeks between July and September. Each programme covers a specific historical, philosophical, religious, cultural or scientific topic. In a November 2009 interview, Bragg described how he prepares for each show: "It's not easy, but I like reading. I enjoy what was called [[Cramming (education)|swotting]] in my day. I get the notes late Friday afternoon for the following Thursday morning. I find all the spare time I can for reading, get up very early on a Thursday morning, have a final two hours of nervousness, and away we go."&lt;ref name="scot09"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://living.scotsman.com/books/Interview-Melvyn-Bragg--Man.5640953.jp | title=Interview: Melvyn Bragg - Man out of time |date= 9 November 2009 | publisher=[[The Scotsman]] | first=Chitra |last= Ramaswamy | accessdate= 2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bragg hosts discussion of the week's subject featuring what he has characterised as "three absolutely top-class academics"&lt;ref name="bragg11"/&gt; on the subject. The programme is normally broadcast live and unedited on Thursday mornings at 9{{nbsp}}am, lasting around 42 minutes, and is then available online. He begins each episode with a short summary of the week's topic, then introduces the three guests. He guides the discussion along a generally chronological route, then either concludes the programme himself or invites summation remarks from one of the specialists.

{{quote|Bragg gives short shrift to pretension of any kind, while remaining stalwart in his search for knowledge. His methodology in ''In Our Time'' is... not unlike that of a man [[Fetch (game)|throwing a stick for a dog]]: he chucks his questions ahead, and if the chosen academic fails to bring it right back, he chides them.

==History==
{{See also|List of In Our Time programmes}}
''In Our Time'' was conceived for Bragg in 1998 after he was forced to quit his decade-long role as presenter for ''[[Start the Week]]'' due to a perceived conflict of interest arising from his appointment as a Labour [[life peer]].&lt;ref name="scot09"/&gt; He was offered the Thursday "death-slot" and decided he would "do what [he] always wanted to do,"&lt;ref name="scot09"/&gt; and "hastily battered out a simple idea" with producer [[Olivia Seligman]]&lt;ref name="bragg11"&gt;{{cite web| title= Who says Britain is dumbing down?| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8371699/Who-says-Britain-is-dumbing-down.html | date= 10 Mar 2011 | first=Melvyn | last= Bragg| publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; expecting the show would only last a few months. By September 1999, he had taken a time slot that was previously attracting an audience of 600,000 and grown it to 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Television lacks `intellectual ambition', says Bragg | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/television-lacks-intellectual-ambition-says-bragg-1115090.html | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=2 September 1999| accessdate=2009-11-09 | location=London | first=Paul | last=McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the half-hour show was expanded to 45 minutes and to include three guest speakers.&lt;ref name="500tele11"&gt;{{cite web| title= In Our Time reaches its 500th episode | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8371075/In-Our-Time-reaches-its-500th-episode.html | date= 9 Mar 2011 | first=Ed | last= Cumming | work=The Telegraph | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/the-archers-tops-podcast-list-30665578.html|title=The Archers tops podcast list|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the programme was made available as a [[podcast]] from the BBC website and [[iTunes]] for one week after broadcast. Until July 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/24496ca2-4729-3141-8fa5-e991de04e774|title=In Our Time, The Sun|website=[[Radio 4 Blogs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; listeners could also sign up for weekly email newsletters from Bragg, where he mentioned any additional information relating to the programme, along with snippets from his own personal and intellectual life. In 2009, selected transcripts of episodes from the programme were compiled in the book ''In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series'', edited by Bragg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series | publisher= [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]| editor1-first=Melvin |editor1-last=Bragg | url= http://www.hodder.co.uk/books/work.aspx?WorkID=147206 | isbn=978-0-340-97750-7 | pages=608 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, every episode of the programme has been available from its website as streaming audio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_archive_home.shtml|title=In Our Time - Listen Again From the Archives|website=[[BBC Radio 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the first BBC programmes to have its entire archive released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Melvyn Bragg history show ''In Our Time'' to go online in BBC archive| url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/nov/19/bbc-digital-archive-in-our-time-online | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=PDA: The Digital Content Blog| date= 19 November 2009 | accessdate=2009-11-20 | location=London | first=Mercedes | last=Bunz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the entire archive has been available to download as individual podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The complete In Our Time now available as podcasts | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-09-15/the-complete-in-our-time-now-available-as-podcasts | publisher=[[Radio Times]] | date=15 September 2011 | accessdate=2015-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The programme is considered one of the BBC's most successful projects, acknowledged to have "transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time".&lt;ref Name="Ankles"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/27/melvyn-bragg-south-bank-show|title=Melvyn Bragg: 'Life has a way of biting you on the ankles'|author=Emine Saner|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt; Frequent contributors to the programme since 1998 include [[A.

In 2005, listeners were invited to vote in a popularity contest for the "greatest philosopher in history" with the winner selected as the subject of the final programme before the summer break. With 30,000 votes cast,&lt;ref Name="Brand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/484707/marx-wins-bbc-times-greatest-philosopher-vote|title=Marx wins BBC In Our Time's Greatest Philosopher vote|work=brandrepublic.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contest was won by [[Karl Marx]] with 27.9% of the votes. Other shortlisted figures were [[David Hume]] (12.7%), [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (6.8%), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (6.5%), [[Plato]] (5.6%), [[Immanuel Kant]] (5.6%), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (4.8%), [[Socrates]] (4.8%), [[Aristotle]] (4.5%) and [[Karl Popper]] (4.2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/greatest_philosopher_vote_result.shtml In Our Time's Greatest Philosopher Result] from the [[BBC Radio 4]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The poll was controversial but led to widespread reporting, and a boost in the programme's overall listenership, as various UK celebrities and news outlets championed their favourites.&lt;ref Name="Brand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133548708.html|title=Proles and polls; Philosophy.(Britons seem about to vote Marx history's greatest philosopher)|work=highbeam.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article533688.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68991">{{Intelligent Design}}
The relationship between '''intelligent design and science''' has been a contentious one.  [[Intelligent design]] (ID) is presented by its proponents as science and claims to offer an alternative to [[evolution]]. The [[Discovery Institute]], a politically conservative think tank and the leading proponent of intelligent design, launched a campaign entitled "Teach the Controversy" which claims that a controversy exists within the scientific community over evolution. The scientific community, however, rejects intelligent design as a form of [[creationism]]. The basic facts of evolution are not a matter of controversy in science.

=="Teach the Controversy"==
{{Main|Teach the Controversy}}

The intelligent design movement states that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved. The movement stresses the importance of recognizing the existence of this supposed debate, seeking to convince the public, politicians, and cultural leaders that schools should "[[Teach the Controversy]]".&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as though it were a scientific hypothesis.&lt;ref name=IDstatementOnCreator group="n"&gt;

"...intelligent design does not address metaphysical and religious questions such as the nature or identity of the designer," and "...the nature, moral character and purposes of this intelligence lie beyond the competence of science and must be left to religion and philosophy". In: {{vcite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, among a significant proportion of the general public in the United States the major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools.&lt;ref name="Time-15-Aug-2005"/&gt; The public controversy was given widespread media coverage in the United States, particularly during the ''Kitzmiller v.

In response to Bush's statement and the pending federal trial, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ran an eight-page cover story on the Evolution Wars in which they examined the issue of teaching intelligent design in the classroom.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;

Dover'' case, the court ruled that intelligent design was a religious and creationist position, finding that God and intelligent design were both distinct from the material that should be covered in a science class.&lt;ref name="kitzruling-IDandGod" group="n"&gt;"ID is not a new scientific [[argument]], but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer." "This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley" (the [[teleological argument]]) "The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's 'official position' does not acknowledge that the designer is God." {{cite court

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also hold that religious neutrality requires the teaching of both evolution and intelligent design in schools, saying that teaching only evolution unfairly discriminates against those holding creationist beliefs. [[teach the controversy|Teaching both]], they argue, allows for the possibility of religious belief, without causing the state to actually promote such beliefs. Many intelligent design followers believe that "[[Scientism]]" is itself a religion that promotes [[secularism]] and [[materialism]] in an attempt to erase [[theism]] from public life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres. Some allege that this larger debate is often the subtext for arguments made over intelligent design, though others note that intelligent design serves as an effective proxy for the religious beliefs of prominent intelligent design proponents in their efforts to advance their religious point of view within society.&lt;ref&gt;

It has been argued that methodological naturalism is not an ''assumption'' of science, but a ''result'' of science well done: the God explanation is the least parsimonious, so according to [[Occam's razor]], it cannot be a scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="Jennings2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Byron K.|last=Jennings|title=In Defense of Scientism: An Insider's view of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-C-BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|year=2015|publisher=Byron Jennings|isbn=978-0-9940589-2-8|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the argument to give "equal time for all theories" were actually practiced, there would be no logical limit to the number of mutually incompatible supernatural "theories" regarding the origins and diversity of life to be taught in the public school system, including intelligent design parodies such as the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] "theory"; intelligent design does not provide a mechanism for discriminating among them.

==Inter-faith outreach==
Supporters of intelligent design have also reached out to other faith groups with similar accounts of creation with the hope that the broader coalition will have greater influence in supporting science education that does not contradict their religious views.&lt;ref name="Watanabe" group="n" /&gt; Many religious bodies have responded by [[Level of support for evolution#Support for evolution by religious bodies|expressing support for evolution]].

The cardinal, it seems, had received the backing of the new pope, Benedict XVI, the former Joseph Ratzinger (b. 1927), who in the mid-1980s, while serving as prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, successor to the notorious Inquisition, had written a defense of the doctrine of creation against Catholics who stressed the sufficiency of "selection and mutation." Humans, he insisted, are "not the products of chance and error," and "the universe is not the product of darkness and unreason. It comes from intelligence, freedom, and from the beauty that is identical with love."

Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] directly criticized the advocates of intelligent design as presenting a perspective of God that is dangerous to religion.&lt;ref name="Slifkin"&gt;Natan Slifkin (2006). ''The Challenge of Creation'' (New York: Yashar Books) 288 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who promote it as parallel to religion, he asserts, do not truly understand it. Slifkin criticizes intelligent design's advocacy of teaching their perspective in biology classes, wondering why no one claims that God's hand should be taught in other secular classes, such as history, physics or geology. Slifkin also asserts that the intelligent design movement is inordinately concerned with portraying God as "in control" when it comes to things that cannot be easily explained by science, but not in control in respect to things which ''can'' be explained by scientific theory.&lt;ref name="Slifkin" /&gt; Kenneth Miller expressed a view similar to Slifkin's: "[T]he struggles of the Intelligent Design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures—rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God.&lt;ref&gt;

The ruling discusses central aspects of expectations in the scientific community that a scientific theory be ''testable, dynamic, correctible, progressive, based upon multiple observations, and provisional'',&lt;/ref&gt; it is expected to be:

*'''Consistent'''
*'''Parsimonious''' (sparing in its proposed entities or explanations, see [[Occam's Razor]])
*'''Useful''' (describes and explains observed phenomena, and can be used predictively)
*'''Empirically testable and falsifiable''' (see [[Falsifiability]])
*'''Based on multiple observations''', often in the form of controlled, repeated experiments
*'''Correctable and dynamic''' (modified in the light of observations that do not support it)
*'''Progressive''' (refines previous theories)
*'''Provisional''' or tentative (is open to experimental checking, and does not assert certainty)

For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word.

By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data. See, e.g., the brief explanation in {{cite court

Critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the [[Daubert Standard]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{vcite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the criteria for [[scientific evidence]] mandated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]. The Daubert Standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in United States federal courts and most state courts. Its four criteria are:
*The theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified.
*The methods should preferably be published in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.
*There should be a known rate of [[error]] that can be used in evaluating the results.
*The methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.
In ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', using these criteria and others mentioned above, Judge Jones [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|ruled that]] "... we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science. We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents".

At the Kitzmiller trial, philosopher [[Robert T. Pennock]] described a common approach to distinguishing science from non-science as examining a theory's compliance with [[methodological naturalism]], the basic method in science of seeking natural explanations without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pennock | first1 = Robert T | year = 2007 | title = Can't philosophers tell the difference between science and religion?: Demarcation revisited | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/k305581557n60r31 | journal = Synthese | volume = 178 | issue = 2| pages = 177–206 | doi=10.1007/s11229-009-9547-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intelligent design proponents criticize this method and argue that science, if its goal is to discover truth, must be able to accept evidentially supported, supernatural explanations.&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;

==Peer review==
The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design being accepted as valid science. The intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article supporting ID in a scientific journal, and has failed to publish peer-reviewed research or data supporting ID.&lt;ref name="kitzruling_pg87"&gt;{{cite court

Intelligent design, by appealing to a [[supernatural]] agent, directly conflicts with the [[principle]]s of [[science]], which limit its inquiries to [[empirical]], observable and ultimately [[falsifiable|testable]] [[data]] and which require explanations to be based on empirical [[Scientific method|evidence]]. Dembski, Behe and other intelligent design proponents say bias by the scientific community is to blame for the failure of their research to be published.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/csc/freeSpeechEvolCampMain.php Free Speech on Evolution Campaign Main Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806232139/http://www.discovery.org/csc/freeSpeechEvolCampMain.php |date=2006-08-06 }} [[Discovery Institute]], [[Center for Science and Culture]].&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent design proponents believe that their writings are rejected for not conforming to purely naturalistic, non-supernatural mechanisms rather than because their research is not up to "journal standards", and that the merit of their articles is overlooked. Some scientists describe this claim as a [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]] has rebutted the claim, noting "Anyone who thinks that scientists do not question Darwinism has never been to an evolutionary conference." He noted that scientists such as [[Joan Roughgarden]] and [[Lynn Margulis]] have challenged certain Darwinist theories and offered explanations of their own and despite this they "have not been persecuted, shunned, fired or even expelled. Why? Because they are doing science, not religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-04-17.html#part1|title=Skeptic » eSkeptic » Thursday, April 17th, 2008|work=Skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue that supernatural explanations do not conform to the [[scientific method]] became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the 1990s, and is addressed in the [[wedge strategy]] as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design can be accepted by the broader scientific community.

Critics and advocates debate over whether intelligent design produces new research and has legitimately attempted to publish this research. For instance, the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]], a former funder of the Discovery Institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion, says that it asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, but none were ever submitted. Charles L. Harper Jr., foundation vice-president, said: "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".&lt;ref&gt;

The choice of venue for this article was also considered problematic, because it was so outside the normal subject matter (see [[Sternberg peer review controversy]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The [[Sternberg peer review controversy]] and several similar academic disputes are the subject of the 2008 documentary "[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]".&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Intelligence as an observable quality==
The phrase ''intelligent design'' makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], a concept that has no [[scientific consensus]] definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that "Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be [[observation|observable]] without specifying what the criteria for the [[measurement]] of intelligence should be. Dembski, instead, asserts that "in special sciences ranging from [[forensics]] to [[archaeology]] to [[SETI]] (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; How this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed. [[Seth Shostak]], a researcher with the [[SETI Institute]], disputed Dembski's comparison of SETI and intelligent design, saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference of design on complexity—the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes—while SETI researchers are looking primarily for [[Artificial creation|artificial]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;"For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies".—{{cite court

As a means of criticism, certain [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of [[artificial intelligence]]. The criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent, specifically that "no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent, that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes".&lt;ref&gt;

|archivedate=2001-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is similar in type to an assumption of [[Cartesian dualism]] that posits a strict separation between "mind" and the material [[Universe]]. However, in studies of artificial intelligence, while there is an implicit assumption that supposed "intelligence" or [[creativity]] of a [[computer program]] is determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer [[programmer]], artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules. Rather, if a computer program can access [[randomness]] as a function, this effectively allows for a flexible, creative, and adaptive intelligence. [[Evolutionary algorithms]], a subfield of machine learning (itself a subfield of artificial intelligence), have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to "evolve" complex, highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer. Evolutionary algorithms use the Darwinian metaphor of random mutation, selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods. Intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the "innate" intelligence associated with biological organisms, and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception that intelligence itself necessarily requires a designer. [[Cognitive science]] continues to investigate the nature of intelligence along these lines of inquiry. The intelligent design community, for the most part, relies on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Saint Isidore of Seville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|z|ɪ|d|ɔːr}}; {{lang-la|Isidorus Hispalensis}}; c. 560&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; 4 April 636), a scholar and, for over three decades, [[Archbishop]] of [[Seville]], is widely regarded in the Catholic Church as the last of the [[Church Fathers]], as the 19th-century historian [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]] put it in an oft-quoted phrase, "The last scholar of the ancient world."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, Charles F. ''Les Moines d'Occident depuis Saint Benoît jusqu'à Saint Bernard'' ''[The Monks of the West from Saint Benoit to Saint Bernard]''. Paris: J. Lecoffre, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Indeed, all the later medieval history-writing of [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) was based on his histories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}--&gt;

At a time of disintegration of classical culture,&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Fontaine, ''Isidore de Séville et la culture classique dans l'Espagne wisigothique'' (Paris) 1959&lt;/ref&gt; and aristocratic violence and illiteracy, he was involved in the conversion of the Arian Visigothic kings to Catholicism, both assisting his brother [[Leander of Seville]], and continuing after his brother's death. He was influential in the inner circle of [[Sisebut]], Visigothic king of [[Hispania]]. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the [[Councils of Toledo]] and Seville. The Visigothic legislation that resulted from these councils influenced the beginnings of representative government.

His fame after his death was based on his ''[[Etymologiae]]'', an [[etymology|etymological]] encyclopedia which assembled extracts of many books from classical antiquity that would have otherwise been lost.

==Life==

===Childhood and education===
Isidore was probably born in [[Cartagena, Spain]], a former Carthaginian colony, to Severianus and Theodora. Both Severianus and Theodora belonged to notable [[Hispano-Roman]] families of high social rank.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Throop, ''Isidore of Seville's Etymologies: Complete English Translation''. Vermont: MedievalMS, 2005, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were members of an influential family who were instrumental in the political-religious maneuvering that [[Religious conversion|converted]] the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic king]]s from [[Arianism]] to Catholicism. The Catholic Church celebrates him and all his siblings as known saints:

* An elder brother, Saint [[Leander of Seville]], immediately preceded Saint Isidore as Archbishop of Seville and, while in office, opposed king [[Liuvigild]].
* A younger brother, Saint [[Fulgentius of Cartagena]], served as the [[Diocese|Bishop]] of [[Astigi]] at the start of the new reign of the Catholic King [[Reccared]].
* His sister, [[Saint Florentina]], served God as a nun and allegedly ruled over forty convents and one thousand consecrated religious. This claim seems unlikely, however, given the few functioning monastic institutions in Iberia during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain''. New York: St Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], a body of learned men including Archbishop Saint Leander of Seville taught the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]], the classic [[liberal arts]]. Saint Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered Latin,&lt;ref&gt;"His literary style, though lucid, is pedestrian": Katherine Nell MacFarlane's observation, in "Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (Origines VIII. 11)", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', New Series, '''70'''.3 (1980):1-40, p. 4, reflects mainstream secular opinion.&lt;/ref&gt; and acquired some [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

Two centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classic learning, and manners of the [[Roman Empire]]. The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling [[Visigoths]] nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. [[Arianism]] meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.

Scholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly.

===Bishop of Seville===
[[Image:Isidoro de Sevilla (José Alcoverro) 01.jpg|thumb|A statue of Isidore of Seville by [[José Alcoverro]], 1892, outside the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]], in [[Madrid]]]]
[[Image:San Isidoro, Portada del Bautismo de la Catedral de Sevilla.jpg|thumb|[[Seville Cathedral]]. Sculpture of [[Lorenzo Mercadante|Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña]]]]

After the death of Saint [[Leander of Seville]] on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|See of Seville]]. On his elevation to the [[Bishop|episcopate]], he immediately constituted himself as protector of monks.

Saint Isidore recognized that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his See depended on assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, and consequently attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of [[Arianism]] and completely stifled the new [[heresy]] of [[Acephali]] at its very outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his See.

Archbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Saint Isidore introduced [[Aristotle]] to his countrymen long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively.

In 619, Saint Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries.

===Second Synod of Seville (November 619)===
{{Main|Second Synod of Seville}}

Saint Isidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619, in the reign of King [[Sisebut]], a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali.

===Third Synod of Seville (624)===
{{Main|Third Synod of Seville}}

Based on a few surviving canons found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]], Saint Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624.

The council dealt with a conflict over the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Écija, and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity by Sisebut failing to present their children for baptism.

The records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville were not preserved in the [[Collections of ancient canons|Hispana]], a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Saint Isidore himself.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Stocking, "Martianus, Aventius and Isidore: provincial councils in seventh-century Spain" ''Early Medieval Europe'' 6 (1997) 169-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth National Council of Toledo===
{{Main|Fourth Council of Toledo}}

All bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Saint Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council.

Through Isidore's influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree, commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Saint Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Isidore's own work regarding medicine is examined by {{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1=William D. |year=1964 |title=Isidore of Seville: The Medical Writings |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=54 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the Council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the [[Papacy|Bishop of Rome]].

===Death===
Saint Isidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville.

==Work==
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Isidore's Latin style in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions.

===''Etymologiae''===
{{Main|Etymologiae}}

[[Image:Isidoro di siviglia, etimologie, fine VIII secolo MSII 4856 Bruxelles, Bibliotheque Royale Albert I, 20x31,50, pagina in scrittura onciale carolina.jpg|thumb|A page of ''Etymologiae'', [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] manuscript (8th century), [[Brussels]], [[Royal Library of Belgium]]]]
[[File:Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia.tif|thumb|''Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia'' (1797)]]

Isidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a ''[[summa]]'' of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the ''[[Origines]]'' (the standard abbreviation being ''Orig''). This [[encyclopedia]] — the first such Christian [[epitome]]—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, as Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia, he continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in [[Late Antiquity]]. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved which otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; "in fact, in the majority of his works, including the ''Origines'', he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the ''stilus maiorum'' than his own" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarlane 1980:4; MacFarlane translates ''Etymologiae'' viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded—[[Braulio of Zaragoza|Braulio]] called it ''quaecunque fere sciri debentur'', "practically everything that it is necessary to know"—&lt;ref&gt;Braulio, ''Elogium'' of Isidore appended to Isidore's ''[[De viris illustribus]]'', heavily indebted itself to [[Jerome]].&lt;/ref&gt; that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: "all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further".&lt;ref&gt;MacFarlane 1980:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the [[Middle Ages]]. It was the most popular compendium in [[medieval]] libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the [[Renaissance]]. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of [[Aristotle]] and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek.&lt;ref name=CatEncy&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08186a.htm St. Isidore of Seville]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologiae'' was much copied, particularly into medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===On the Catholic faith against the Jews===
[[Image:Diagrammatic T-O world map - 12th century.jpg|thumb|upright|The medieval [[T-O map]] represents the inhabited world as described by Isidore in his ''[[Etymologiae]]''.]]

Isidore's ''De fide catholica contra Iudaeos'' furthers [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ideas on the Jewish presence in Christian society. Like Augustine, Isidore accepted the necessity of the Jewish presence because of their expected role in the anticipated [[Second Coming of Christ]]. In ''De fide catholica contra Iudaeos'', Isidore exceeds the anti-rabbinic polemics of earlier theologians by criticizing Jewish practice as deliberately disingenuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Jeremy |title=Living Letters of the Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3NfOL9Q0i4C |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-520-21870-3 |pages=97}}, books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed two decisions to the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]]: Canon 60 calling for the forced removal of children from parents practicing [[Crypto-Judaism]] and their education by Christians and Canon 65 forbidding Jews and Christians of Jewish origin from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Isidore of Seville: His attitude towards Judaism and his impact on early Medieval Canonical law |author=Bar-Shava Albert |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1990 |volume=XXX 3,4 |pages=207–220 |jstor=1454969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Isidore's other works, all in Latin, include:
* ''[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum]]'', a history of the Gothic, Vandal and Suebi kings
* ''Chronica Majora'', a [[universal history]]
* ''De differentiis verborum'', a brief theological treatise on the doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of Christ, of Paradise, angels, and men
* ''On the Nature of Things'', a book of [[astronomy]] and [[natural history]] dedicated to the Visigothic king [[Sisebut]]
* ''Questions on the Old Testament''
* a mystical treatise on the allegorical meanings of numbers
* a number of brief letters

==Veneration==
[[Image:Meister des Codex 167 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Isidore (right) and [[Braulio of Zaragoza|Braulio]] (left) in an [[Ottonian]] [[illuminated manuscript]] from the 2nd half of the 10th century]]
Isidore was one of the last of the ancient Christian philosophers; he was the last of the great Latin [[Church Father]]s and was contemporary with [[Maximus the Confessor]]. Some consider him to be the most learned man of his age, and he exercised a far-reaching and immeasurable influence on the educational life of the Middle Ages. His contemporary and friend, [[Braulio of Zaragoza]], regarded him as a man raised up by God to save the Iberian peoples from the tidal wave of barbarism that threatened to inundate the ancient civilization of [[Hispania]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Eighth Council of Toledo]] (653) recorded its admiration of his character in these glowing terms: "The extraordinary doctor, the latest ornament of the Catholic Church, the most learned man of the latter ages, always to be named with reverence, Isidore". This tribute was endorsed by the [[Fifteenth Council of Toledo]], held in 688 and later in 1598 by [[Pope Clement VIII]].{{fact|date=June 2018}} Isidore was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1722 by [[Pope Innocent XIII]]. 

Isidore was interred in [[Seville]]. His tomb represented an important place of veneration for the [[Mozarabs]] during the centuries after the Arab conquest of Visigothic Hispania. In the middle of the 11th century, with the division of [[Al Andalus]] into [[taifas]] and the strengthening of the Christian holdings in the Iberian peninsula, [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile]] found himself in a position to extract tribute from the fractured Arab states. In addition to money, [[Abbad II al-Mu'tadid]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] ruler of [[Seville]] (1042–1069), agreed to turn over St. Isidore's remains to Ferdinand I.&lt;ref&gt;Father Alban Butler. "Saint Isidore, Bishop of Seville". Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. Saints.SQPN.com. 2 April 2013. Web. 9 August 2014. [http://saints.sqpn.com/butlers-lives-of-the-saints-saint-isidore-bishop-of-seville/ Saints SQPN]&lt;/ref&gt; A Catholic poet described al-Mutatid placing a brocaded cover over Isidore's sarcophagus, and remarked, "Now you are leaving here, revered Isidore. You know well how much your fame was mine!" Ferdinand had Isidore's remains reinterred in the then-recently constructed [[Basilica of San Isidoro]] in [[León, Spain|León]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Today, many of his bones are buried in the cathedral of [[Murcia]], [[Spain]].

==Legacy==
In [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradiso]]'' (X.130), Isidore is mentioned among theologians and Doctors of the Church alongside the Scot [[Richard of St. Victor]] and the Englishman [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]].

The [[University of Dayton]] has named their implementation of the [[Sakai Project]] in honour of Saint Isidore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isidore.udayton.edu Isidore.udayton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

His likeness, along with that of [[Leander of Seville|Leander of Sevile]] and [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], are depicted on the crest badge of [[Sevilla FC]].

[http://www.st-isidore.org The Order of St. Isidore of Seville] is a [[chivalric order]] formed on January 1, 2000.

He has been described as 'one of the most pivotal figures in the University's history'.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth|title=A celebration of the 'founder' of the University of Dundee|url=http://www.archives-records-artefacts.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/celebration-of-founder-of-university-of.html|work=Archives, Records and Artefacts at the University of Dundee|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life and career==

James Drever was born to [[Orkney|Orcadian]] parents in [[Edinburgh]] in 1910. His father was the academic [[James Drever (1873)|James Drever]] (1873–1950), who had studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1889, from which he graduated with an MA before proceeding to study medicine. The elder Drever then worked at the University as assistant to the Professor of Education, before his appointment as Combe Lecturer and head of the [[Psychology]] Department at Edinburgh in 1918.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emeritus Principal James Drever, Master of Queen's College 1966–1967, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dundee 1967–1978|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27UR-SF%205%27)|work=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edinburgh blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buttars|first=Grant|title=The Drever succession|url=http://edinburghuniversityarchives.blogspot.com/2010/10/drever-succession.html|work=Edinburgh University Archives|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edinburgh&gt;{{cite web|title=History: Psychology|url=http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/psy_staff/history.php|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Drever was educated at the [[Royal High School of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|title=Principal for Dundee University|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tGtAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e6MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3731,3643348&amp;dq=james-drever&amp;hl=en|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=25 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] and would remain in academia for the rest of his working life aside from a period of service in the [[Royal Navy]]. From 1934 he taught Philosophy at Edinburgh, joining [[Newcastle University]] as a lecturer four years later. By this time he had an interest in [[Psychology]] and taught both subjects at Newcastle.  In the [[Second World War]] he served in the [[Royal Navy]].

In 1931 his father had been promoted at Edinburgh to become the first Professor of Psychology in Scotland. In 1944 the elder Drever retired, and it was his son who was chosen as his successor, but could not take the post until the end of the war. In addition to his responsibilities as a professor and head of department, the younger Drever also served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Edinburgh from 1958 until 1960 and was a visiting professor at [[Princeton University]] from 1954 until 1955.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edinburgh blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="School of Educational"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish School of Educational Research|url=http://www.ces.ed.ac.uk/SSER/about/biographies.html|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his father, and others, he was heavily involved in organising the 12th International Congress of Psychology, which met in Edinburgh in 1948. His father was elected president of the congress, but was unable to attend it due to ill health. Consequently, it was the younger Drever who delivered the presidential address his father had written on the theme of “Scottish psychology since Hume”.&lt;ref name="Psychology Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 12th International Congress of Psychology, Edinburgh 1948 |url=http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/292-world-conferences-and-meetings/26853-1948-international-congress-of-psychology-edinburgh |website=Psychology Resources Around the World |publisher=Developed by International Union of Psychological Science |accessdate=19 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721205916/http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/292-world-conferences-and-meetings/26853-1948-international-congress-of-psychology-edinburgh |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under James Drever's leadership from 1944 to 1966 the Psychology Department at Edinburgh increased in both size and stature and an  "Honours School" in Psychology was fully established.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edinburgh"/&gt; In 1963 the department left the premises it had been in since it was set up in 1906 and moved to new accommodation at 60, The Pleasance. As had been the case under his father's stewardship, the department's teaching included 'a strong philosophical element'.&lt;ref name="Edinburgh"/&gt; During this period Drever established himself as a well known and highly respected Psychologist and served as President of the [[British Psychological Society]].&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edinburgh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

==Robbins Committee and the University of Dundee==

Drever had a strong interest in theories and practice of higher education and this led to his appointment to the Committee on Higher Education chaired by [[Lionel Robbins]].&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt; Drever and Sir David Anderson, the former director of the [[Royal College of Science and Technology]] were the only Scottish members of the committee.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite news|title=Grants Urged for CA Apprentices|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZN09AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LUgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4540,6498502&amp;dq=james-drever+robbins&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=Glasgow Herald|date=12 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever would later recall his work with the Committee included visiting the [[USSR]] where the committee was impressed with the detailed level of planning relating to education that was carried out. The resulting [[Robbins Report]] recommended the immediate expansion of university education in the United Kingdom. One result of this was the decision that Queen's College, Dundee, a part of the [[University of St. Andrews]] should become a university in its own right. Drever was an obvious candidate to lead this new institution and in 1966 was appointed as Master of Queen's College to oversee its transition in the [[University of Dundee]]. When the University was granted its charter the following year Drever formally became its principal and vice-chancellor.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafe1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shafe|first=Michael|title=University Education in Dundee: A Pictorial History|year=1982|publisher=University of Dundee|location=Dundee|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever's appointment marked the first time a psychologist had obtained such a post in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Edinburgh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroUnis"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Drever|editor1-last=Roche|editor1-first=Jean|title=The European Universities 1975-1985|date=1975|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford|page=39|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zGuoBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=robbins+committee+drever&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b1vojG4PkN&amp;sig=R5E1Z-8Rw1wrRqn-DT-um9XUSXA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRstqk0svQAhUqJMAKHaMmDg44ChDoAQg3MAg#v=onepage&amp;q=robbins%20committee%20drever&amp;f=false|chapter=The University and Manpower Needs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal of the University of Dundee==

It has been argued that in his role as principal, Drever "did much to establish the University of Dundee as a success".&lt;ref name=Baxter1&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth, Rolfe, Mervyn, and Swinfen, David|title=A Dundee Celebration|year=2007|publisher=University of Dundee|location=Dundee|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early years of the University's existence were difficult ones. Changes in government policy on higher education meant that the University was operating in an uncertain financial environment and cuts had to be made.&lt;ref name="Baxter blog"/&gt; At the same time there were episodes of student discontent and protest. These included a student 24 work-in led by [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]] in 1968, student occupations of the University Tower Building in 1971 and 1974, a student rent strike in 1973 (which Drever initially seemed to not only support, but to encourage) and various smaller protests. Drever gave support to some of these protests and in 1969 actually encouraged students to oppose a planned visit to the University by [[Enoch Powell]].&lt;ref name=Baxter2&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth, Rolfe, Mervyn, and Swinfen, David|title=A Dundee Celebration|year=2007|publisher=University of Dundee|location=Dundee|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drever's stance on Powell attracted media attention, with the [[Glasgow Herald]] comparing his actions to that of a 'gamekeeper-turned-poacher'.&lt;ref name="Herald Powell"&gt;{{cite news|title=Powell and the Principal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D5JAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1751,3192924&amp;dq=james-drever+dundee&amp;hl=en|accessdate=1 March 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow herald|date=17 October 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the aftermath of the 1973 rent strike, which saw the suspension of the [[Dundee University Students' Association]]'s constitution by the [[University Court]] and threats to sue some of the strikers, caused some students to express a degree of ill-feeling towards Drever, others thought highly of him.&lt;ref name=Baxter3&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Kenneth, Rolfe, Mervyn, and Swinfen, David|title=A Dundee Celebration|year=2007|publisher=University of Dundee|location=Dundee|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drever oversaw the University developing increasing links with [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art]], with the art students receiving lectures at the University and the creation of a joint degree in Town Planning.&lt;ref name="DoJCA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Michael|title=Putting an emphasis on academic flexibility|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19711113&amp;id=K-U9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dkgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5883,2776397&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=13 November 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Principal of Dundee he served as  Honorary President of the [[Abertay Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=Abertay&gt;{{cite web|title=MS 21/2/15/2 Material relating to the Society's membership and meetings|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=((text)=%27james%20drever%27)&amp;dsqPos=2|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drever retired as Principal in 1978 after 11 years in office, a period of service unmatched by any of his successors.&lt;ref name=Baxter1/&gt; His papers are now held by the University's Archive Services and the University's fine art collections include a portrait of Drever in his principal's robes painted by Alberto Morocco.&lt;ref name="Archive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Portrait"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal James Drever (1910–1991)|url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/principal-james-drever-19101991-91195|website=ArtUK|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University holds, as an occasional event, a Drever Lecture in Psychology to commemorate him.&lt;ref name=Lecture&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Richard Wiseman to give Drever Lecture 2007|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/2007/prsept07/dreverlecture.html|work=Press Release Archive|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=2 March 2012|date=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Joaquim Clotet.jpg|thumb|President of PUCRS]]
'''Joaquim Clotet Martí''' ([[Mataró]], [[Spain]], March 16, 1946) holds a [[doctorate]] in [[Philosophy]] and Letters, with outstanding work in the area of [[Ethics]] and [[Bioethics]]. Since 2004, he has been the President of the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul]] (PUCRS), [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.pucrs.br/portal/page/portal/pucrs/Capa/AdministracaoSuperior/Reitoria/CurriculoReitor/en PUCRS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and academic background==

Born in the city of Mataró, a province of [[Barcelona]] in Spain, Joaquim Clotet graduated with a degree in English and Philosophy and Letters (1972) from the [[University of Barcelona]] (Spain), obtaining a doctorate in Philosophy and Letters from the same institution (1980).

After his doctorate, he completed studies and research at the [[Gregorian University of Rome]] ([[Italy]]), the [[University of London]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Georgetown University]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA), the [[University of Ottawa]] ([[Canada]]), [[Oxford University]] (United Kingdom) and the [[University of Warwick]] ([[Coventry]], United Kingdom).

After teaching for nine years in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Barcelona, he moved to Porto Alegre in 1984, when he became a full professor at PUCRS. He also taught at UFRGS in the Graduate Program in Medicine – Medical Practice – in 1995 and 1996.

From 1994 to 2004, he was the Senior Vice President of PUCRS, assuming the Presidency in December 2004. He was reappointed in 2008 and 2012. His administration has been highlighted by the increase of [[internationalization]] in all academic areas, and the incentive for research, entrepreneurship and innovation. In addition to being President, Clotet is Full Professor of Bioethics in the Master’s and Doctorate Programs of Medicine and Dentistry. He is a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (Spain), the [[University of San Marcos]] ([[Peru]]), the [[National University of La Plata]] ([[Argentina]]) and the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (Argentina).

He was a member of the National Committee on Access and Use of the [[Human Genome]], by the Ministry of Health, the [[National Committee for Ethics in Research]], by the Ministry of Health (1997-2001) and President of the [[Riograndense Society of Bioethics]] (1999-2001).

He was also a member of the [[Hume Society]], the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics]] (USA), the [[Iberoamerican Society for Utilitarian Studies]] (Spain), the [[Hastings Center]] (USA) and the [[American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics]] (USA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lattes.cnpq.br/2508595973551143 CNPq]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Heinrich Lambert''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlambɛʁt|lang}}, ''Jean-Henri Lambert'' in [[French language|French]]; 26 August 1728 – 25 September 1777) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[polymath]] who made important contributions to the subjects of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] (particularly [[optics]]), [[philosophy]], [[astronomy]] and [[map projections]].
[[Edward Tufte]] calls him and [[William Playfair]] "The two great inventors of modern graphical designs" (''Visual Display of Quantitative Information'', p.&amp;nbsp;32).

==Biography==
Lambert was born in 1728 into a [[Huguenot]] family in the city of [[Mulhouse]] (now in &lt;!--[[Haut-Rhin]],--&gt; [[Alsace]], [[France]]), at that time an [[exclave]] of Switzerland. Leaving school at 12, he continued to study in his free time whilst undertaking a series of jobs.  These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of ''Basler Zeitung'' and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in [[Chur]].  Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1763) by an invitation to a position at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Prussia]], and became a friend of [[Euler]]. In this stimulating and financially stable environment, he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1908) [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Lambert/RouseBall/RB_Lambert.html Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728 — 1777)] via [[Trinity College, Dublin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert was the first to introduce [[hyperbolic function]]s into [[trigonometry]]. Also, he made conjectures regarding [[non-Euclidean]] space. Lambert is credited with the first proof that [[Proof that π is irrational|π is irrational]] by using a [[generalized continued fraction]] for the function tan x.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendentes circulaires et logarithmiques |trans-title=Memoir on some remarkable properties of circular transcendental and logarithmic quantities |publication-date=1768|date=1761|journal=Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles-Lettres de Berlin |volume=17|pages=265–322 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009864251;view=1up;seq=303 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euler]] believed the conjecture but could not prove that π was irrational, and it is speculated that [[Aryabhata]] also believed this, in 500 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= S. Balachandra |last=Rao |title = Indian Mathematics and Astronomy: Some Landmarks | publisher = Jnana Deep Publications |date = 1994 |location = Bangalore | isbn = 81-7371-205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert also devised theorems regarding [[conic section]]s that made the calculation of the [[orbit]]s of [[comet]]s simpler.

Lambert devised a formula for the relationship between the angles and the area of [[hyperbolic triangle]]s. These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a [[saddle]], instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles  added up to less than [[π]] ([[radian]]s), or 180°. The amount of shortfall, called the defect, increases with the area. The larger the triangle's area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect C△ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (in radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the [[curvature]] of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is defined to be negative in the first place). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of [[similar triangle|similar]] hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of expressing the area of the triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclid's geometry, the area of Lambert's hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles.

Lambert was the first mathematician to address the general properties of [[map projection]]s (of a spherical earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13452701&amp;search_terms=DTL47|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1763|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he was the first to discuss the properties of conformality and equal area
preservation and to point out that they were mutually exclusive.
(Snyder 1993&lt;ref name=flattening&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =[[University of Chicago Press]]| date=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  p77). In 1772, Lambert published&lt;ref name=lambert&gt;Lambert,  Johann Heinrich. 1772. ''Ammerkungen und Zusatze zurder Land und Himmelscharten Entwerfung''. In Beitrage zum Gebrauche der Mathematik in deren Anwendung, part 3, section 6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambert1772republished"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Johann Heinrich | authorlink= |title=Anmerkungen und Zusätze zur Entwerfung der Land- und Himmelscharten (1772) |editor = A.

&lt;/ref&gt;
seven new map projections under the title ''Anmerkungen und Zusätze zur Entwerfung der Land- und Himmelscharten'', (translated as ''Notes and Comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps'' by Waldo Tobler (1972)&lt;ref name="tobler"&gt;Tobler, Waldo R, ''Notes and Comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps'', 1972. (University of Michigan Press), reprinted (2010) by Esri: [http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=1284&amp;Category_ID=38].&lt;/ref&gt;).
Lambert did not give names to any of his projections but they are now known as:
# [[Lambert conformal conic projection|Lambert conformal conic]]
# [[Transverse Mercator projection|Transverse Mercator]]
# [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert azimuthal equal area]]
# Lagrange projection
# [[Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection|Lambert cylindrical equal area]]
# Transverse cylindrical equal area
# Lambert conical equal area
The first three of these are of great importance.&lt;ref name=flattening/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corresponding to the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection, there is a Lambert [[zenith]]al equal-area projection.

===Physics===
Lambert invented the first practical [[hygrometer]].  In 1760, he published a book on photometry, the ''[[Photometria]]''. From the assumption that light travels in straight lines, he showed that illumination was proportional to the strength of the source, inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the illuminated surface and the [[Lambert's cosine law|sine of the angle]] of inclination of the light's direction to that of the surface. These results were supported by experiments involving the visual comparison of illuminations and used for the calculation of illumination. In ''Photometria'' Lambert also formulated the law of light absorption—the [[Beer–Lambert law]]) and introduced the term ''[[albedo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mach|first=Ernst|title=The Principles of Physical Optics|publisher=Dover|date=2003|isbn=0-486-49559-0|pages=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lambertian reflectance]] is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, who introduced the concept of perfect diffusion in his 1760 book Photometria. He wrote a classic work on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and contributed to [[geometrical optics]]. The photometric unit [[lambert (luminance)|lambert]] is named in recognition of his work in establishing the study of [[photometry (optics)|photometry]]. Lambert was also a pioneer in the development of three-dimensional [[colour models]]. Late in life, he published a description of a triangular colour pyramid (''Farbenpyramide''), which shows a total of 107 colours on six different levels, variously combining red, yellow and blue pigments, and with an increasing amount of white to provide the vertical component.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, ''Beschreibung einer mit dem Calauschen Wachse ausgemalten Farbenpyramide wo die Mischung jeder Farben aus Weiß und drey Grundfarben angeordnet, dargelegt und derselben Berechnung und vielfacher Gebrauch gewiesen wird'' (Berlin, 1772). On this model, see, for example, Werner Spillmann ed. (2009). ''Farb-Systeme 1611-2007. Farb-Dokumente in der Sammlung Werner Spillmann''. Schwabe, Basel. {{ISBN|978-3-7965-2517-9}}. pp. 24 and 26; William Jervis Jones (2013). ''German Colour Terms: A study in their historical evolution from earliest times to the present''. John Benjamins, Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia. {{ISBN|978-90-272-4610-3}}. pp. 218–222.&lt;/ref&gt; His investigations were built on the earlier theoretical proposals of [[Tobias Mayer]], greatly extending these early ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Lowengard (2006) [http://www.gutenberg-e.org/lowengard/A_Chap03.html "Number, Order, Form: Color Systems and Systematization"] and [http://www.gutenberg-e.org/lowengard/glossShell.html?l#l03 Johann Heinrich Lambert] in ''The Creation of Color in Eighteenth-Century Europe'', [[Columbia University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert was assisted in this project by the court painter [[Benjamin Calau]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to {{cite book|date=2011|title=Johann Heinrich Lambert's ''Farbenpyramide''|type=Translation of "Beschreibung einer mit dem Calauischen Wachse ausgemalten Farbenpyramide" ("Description of a colour pyramid painted with Calau's wax"), 1772, with an introduction by Rolf  Kuehni|url=http://www.iscc.org/pdf/LambertFarbenpyramide.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034654/http://www.iscc.org/pdf/LambertFarbenpyramide.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
In his main philosophical work, ''Neues Organon'' (''New Organon'', 1764), Lambert studied the rules for distinguishing [[Subjectivity|subjective]] from [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] appearances. This connects with his work in the [[science]] of [[optics]]. In 1765 he began corresponding with [[Immanuel Kant]] who intended to dedicate to him the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' but the work was delayed, appearing after his death.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary M., ''Revolutions of Geometry'', London:Wiley, 2010, p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomy ===
Lambert also developed a theory of the generation of the [[universe]] that was similar to the [[nebular hypothesis]] that [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] had (independently) developed. Wright published his account in ''An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe'' (1750), Kant in ''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'', published anonymously in 1755. Shortly afterward, Lambert published his own version of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the [[solar system]] in ''Cosmologische Briefe über die Einrichtung des Weltbaues'' (1761). Lambert hypothesized that the stars near the [[sun]] were part of a group which travelled together through the [[Milky Way]], and that there were many such groupings ([[star system]]s) throughout the [[galaxy]]. The former was later confirmed by Sir [[William Herschel]]. In [[astrodynamics]] he also solved the problem of determination of time of flight along a section of orbit, known now as [[Lambert's problem]]. 
His work in this area is commemorated by the [[Asteroid]] [[187 Lamberta]] named in his honour.

===Logic===
Johann-Heinrich Lambert is the author of a treatise on logic, which he called ''Neues Organon'' (1764), that is to say, the New Organon. The most recent edition of this work named after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' was issued in 1990 by the Akademie-Verlag of Berlin. This contains one of the first appearances of the term ''phenomenology'',&lt;ref&gt;In his Preface, p. 4, of vol. I, Lambert called phenomenology "the doctrine of appearance." In vol. ii, he discussed sense appearance, psychological appearance, moral appearance, probability, and perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; and one can find therein a very pedagogical presentation of the various kinds of syllogism. In ''A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive'', [[John Stuart Mill]] expresses his admiration for Johann Heinrich Lambert.

'''Lawrence Lindley (Larry) Haworth''' (born December 14, 1926) is an [[American Canadians|American-born, Canadia]]n [[philosopher]].

==Career==
Haworth was born in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in the south suburbs of Hazel Crest and Homewood. He began his undergraduate studies in 1943 at Thornton Junior College, Harvey, Illinois, and continued for a term at Ripon College, Ripon, Wisconsin. In early 1945 he was drafted into the United States Army. After the war he was sent to Japan where he was assigned to the 32nd Infantry Division as part of the military occupation. Subsequently, he was transferred to I Corp, based in Kyoto. While there he began the study of philosophy under the tutelage of Professor Erwin Jahn, a German Professor of Philosophy at Kyoto University. In the pre-first world war years Jahn had been an assistant to the German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, sometimes referred to as the founder of experimental psychology. Jahn's tutelage consolidated Haworth's commitment to the study of philosophy. After the war, he attended Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida, where in 1949 he received the BA "With Highest Distinction". In 1949, Haworth began PhD studies in philosophy at the University of Illinois under the supervision of Max Fisch. In 1952 he was awarded a PhD in philosophy and at the same time was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

Haworth's first academic appointment was at the University of Alabama (1952–54), followed by Purdue University (1954–65). In 1965 he accepted a professorship at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, and continued there until his retirement in 1995. Along with teaching, Haworth served at various times as Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, Associate Dean of Computing, and Associate Dean for Research, all in the Faculty of Arts, and as Chair of the Department of Philosophy. He was the founding Director of the University of Waterloo Centre for Society, Technology and Values and was a Consultant to the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., from 1965 to 1970.

Haworth is currently Distinguished Professor Emeritus, University of Waterloo and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.&lt;ref name=UWbio &gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/lawrence-haworth |title=University of Waterloo staff biography page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mokṣopāya''''' or '''''Mokṣopāyaśāstra''''' is a [[Sanskrit]] philosophical text on salvation for non-ascetics (''mokṣa-upāya'': 'means to liberation'), written on the Pradyumna hill in [[Śrīnagar]] in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Slaje, Walter.

==Philosophy==
The text of the ''Mokṣopāya'' shows that a unique philosophy has been created by the author. It taught a [[monism]] ('advaita') that is different from [[Advaita Vedanta]]. It makes use of other [[Darśana]]s in an [[syncretism|inclusive]] way. The text teaches that the recognition that [[Cognition|cognitive]] objects are [[Existence|non-existent]], leads to ultimate detachment, which causes an attitude of "dispassion and non-involvement with worldly things and matters", though still fulfilling one's daily duties and activities.&lt;ref name="lekh-state" /&gt; This [[Moksha|liberation]] is available for everyone, no matter their sex, caste or education, as long as one uses reason and maintains an active life in this world. To reach this liberation, one has to go through three stages: rational thinking and discernment (''[[vicāra]]''), true understanding (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]'') and detachment (''[[Vairagya|vairāgya]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|2003|pp=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only by one's own effort (''pauruṣa'') that one can be liberated from the bonds of existence. For one who knows the reality, "fate" (''daiva'') does not mean anything, something like "fate" does not exist and has, accordingly, no consequences at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanneder|2006|pp=xi, 199–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slaje, Walter (2000). "Wie man sein Schicksal (daiva) meistert. Der Mokṣopāya über Wesen und Wirksamkeit menschlicher Aktivität (pauruṣa)", in: Asiatische Studien 54, pp. 63-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mokṣopāya Project==
[[File:Utpattiprakarana-sample.jpg|thumb|Sample of the critical edition of the Utpattiprakaraṇa Moksopaya]]
The Mokṣopāya Project supervised by professor Walter Slaje at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in [[Germany]] is currently working on a [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the ''Mokṣopāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Hanneder.

'''Natural theology''', once also termed '''physico-theology''', is a type of [[theology]] that provides arguments for the [[existence of God]] based on [[reason]] and ordinary [[experience]] of [[nature]]. This distinguishes it from [[revealed theology]], which is based on [[scripture]] and/or [[religious experiences]], and also from [[transcendental theology]], which is based on ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116 BC – 27 BC) established a distinction between [[political theology]] (the social functions of religion), natural theology and [[mythical theology]]. His terminology became part of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tradition and then [[Christianity]] through [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Natural theology is thus a type of philosophy, the object of which is explanation of the nature of the [[gods]], or of one supreme God. For [[monotheism|monotheistic religions]], this principally involves arguments about the [[Attributes of God (disambiguation)|attributes]] or [[negative theology|non-attributes]] of God, and especially the [[existence of God]], using arguments that do not involve recourse to supernatural [[revelation]]. 

==Ancient Greece==

Besides [[Zarathushtra]]'s [[Gathas]], [[Plato]] gives the earliest surviving account of a natural theology. In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', written c. 360 BC, we read: "We must first investigate concerning [the whole Cosmos] that primary question which has to be investigated at the outset in every case, — namely, whether it has always existed, having no beginning or generation, or whether it has come into existence, having begun from some beginning."&lt;ref name="NA229"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180;query=section%3D%23400;layout=;loc=Tim.%2028a Plato, ''Timaeus'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', in answer to the question as to what arguments justify faith in the gods, Plato affirms: "One is our dogma about the soul...the other is our dogma concerning the ordering of the motion of the stars".&lt;ref name="NA230"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166;query=section%3D%231576;layout=;loc=12.966e Plato, ''Laws'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Rome==

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in his (lost) ''[[Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum]]'' established a distinction between three kinds of theology:  [[political theology|civil (political)]] (''theologia civilis''), natural (physical) (''theologia naturalis'') and [[mythical theology|mythical]] (''theologia mythica''). The theologians of civil theology are "the people", asking how the gods relate to daily life and the state ([[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]). The theologians of natural theology are the [[philosophy|philosophers]], asking about the nature of the gods, and the theologians of mythical theology are the [[poet]]s, crafting [[mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/individ/brad/Alumnae.Lect01.pdf|title=Charles Darwin: Evolutionary Theory, Past and Present|last=|first=|date=|website=earth.northwestern.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613120730/http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/individ/brad/Alumnae.Lect01.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle ages==

From the 8th century AD, the [[Mu'tazili|Mutazilite]] school of [[Islam]], compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day, used philosophy for support, and were among the first to pursue a rational [[Islamic theology]], termed ''Ilm-al-[[Kalam]]'' ([[Scholasticism|scholastic theology]]). The [[teleological argument]] was later presented by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]] [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]] and [[Averroes]], while [[Avicenna]] presented both the [[cosmological argument]] and the [[ontological argument]] in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Kitāb al-Dalīl al-Kabīr | editor-first= Binyāmîn | editor-last=Abrahamov | chapter=Introduction | first=Binyāmîn | last=Abrahamov | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqKHJFAhr8C | year=1990 | publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274) presented several versions of the [[cosmological argument]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', and of the [[teleological argument]] in his ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles|Summa contra Gentiles]]''. He presented the [[ontological argument]], but rejected it in favor of proofs that invoke cause and effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;Hedley Brooke, John. ''Science and Religion''. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edge.org/conversation/does-the-empirical-nature-of-science-contradict-the-revelatory-nature-of-faith|title=DOES THE EMPIRICAL NATURE OF SCIENCE CONTRADICT THE REVELATORY NATURE OF FAITH? - Edge.org|author=|date=|website=edge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[quinque viae]]'' ("five ways") in those books attempted to prove the [[existence of God]] in different ways, including (as way No. 5) the goal-directed actions seen in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/God/five_ways2.php|title=Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways (Part 2): Contingency, Goodness, Design|author=|date=|website=thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern onward==

Raymond of Sabunde's Liber Naturae Sive Creaturarum, Etc. (or Theologia Naturalis), written 1434–1436, marks an important stage in the history of natural theology. 

[[John Ray]] (1627–1705) also known as John Wray, was an [[English people|English]] naturalist, sometimes referred to as the father of English [[natural history]]. He published important works on [[plants]], [[animal]]s, and natural theology, with the objective "to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The English Parson-Naturalist | publisher=Gracewing | author=Armstrong, Patrick | year=2000 | pages=46 | isbn=0-85244-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Derham]] (1657–1735) continued Ray's tradition of natural theology in two of his own works, ''Physico-Theology'', published during 1713, and ''Astro-Theology'', 1714. These later influenced the work of William Paley.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, AS., ''Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology'', Broadview Press, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', published during 1798, [[Thomas Malthus]] ended with two chapters on natural theology and population. Malthus—a devout Christian—argued that [[revelation]] would "damp the soaring wings of intellect", and thus never let "the difficulties and doubts of parts of the scripture" interfere with his work.

[[William Paley]], an important influence on Charles Darwin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQO3CgAAQBAJ|title=Charles Darwin in Cambridge: The Most Joyful Years|last=Wyhe|first=John van|date=2014-05-27|publisher=World Scientific|year=|isbn=9789814583992|location=|pages=120|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied theology at Christ College in Cambridge, gave a well-known rendition of the [[teleological argument]] for God. During 1802 he published ''Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paley|first=William|title=Natural Theology, Matthew Daniel Eddy and David M. Knight (Eds.)|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In this he described the [[Watchmaker analogy]], for which he is probably best known. However, his book, which was one of the most published books of the 19th and 20th century, presents a number of teleological and cosmological arguments for the existence of God.  The book served as a template for many subsequent natural theologies during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology | journal=The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology | date=2013 | url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of chemistry and natural history, [[Edward Hitchcock]] also studied and wrote on natural theology. He attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion, emphasizing geology.  His major work of this type was ''The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;sid=6730fe66e24262cb615a418fad16efb8;rgn=full%20text;idno=AFY7120.0001.001;view=image;seq=0017 | title=Making of America Books: The religion of geology and its connected sciences | publisher=University of Michigan | accessdate=2009-08-08 | author=Hitchcock, Edward}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gifford Lectures]] were established by the will of [[Adam Gifford|Adam Lord Gifford]] to "promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term—in other words, the knowledge of God." The term natural theology as used by Gifford means [[theology]] supported by [[science]] and not dependent on the [[miraculous]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.giffordlectures.org Gifford Lectures online database] accessed 15 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bridgewater Treatises&lt;!--'Bridgewater Treatise' and 'Bridgewater Treatises' redirect here--&gt;==

Debates over the applicability of [[teleological arguments|teleology]] to scientific questions continued during the nineteenth century, as [[William Paley|Paley's]] argument about design conflicted with radical new theories on the [[transmutation of species]].  In order to support the scientific ideas of the time, which explored the natural world within [[William Paley|Paley's]] framework of a divine designer, [[Francis Henry Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater]], a gentleman naturalist, commissioned eight '''Bridgewater Treatises'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; upon his deathbed to explore "the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Robson, John M. (1990). "The Fiat and Finger of God: The Bridgewater Treatises". In Helmstadter, Richard J.; Lightman, Bernard V. (eds.). ''Victorian Faith in Crisis: Essays on Continuity and Change in Nineteenth-Century Religious Belief''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-1602-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were published first during the years 1833 to 1840, and afterwards in Bohn's Scientific Library.  The treatises are:

#''The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of Man'', by [[Thomas Chalmers]], D. D.
#''On The Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man'', by [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]], M. D.
#''Astronomy and General Physics considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Whewell]], D. D.
#''The hand, its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as evincing Design'', by Sir [[Charles Bell]].
#''Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[Peter Mark Roget]].
#''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Buckland]], D.D.
#''On the History, Habits and Instincts of Animals'', by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]].
#''Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Prout]], M.D.

In response to the claim in Whewell's treatise that "We may thus, with the greatest propriety, deny to the mechanical philosophers and mathematicians of recent times any authority with regard to their views of the administration of the universe", [[Charles Babbage]] published what he termed ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise|The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, A Fragment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gB4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Charles+Babbage+Bridgewater&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=en|title=The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. A Fragment|first=Charles|last=Babbage|date=24 October 2018|publisher=John Murray|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his preface states, this volume was not part of that series, but rather his own considerations of the subject. He draws on his own work on calculating engines to consider God as a divine programmer setting complex laws as the basis of what we think of as miracles, rather than miraculously producing new species by creative whim. There was also a fragmentary supplement to this, published posthumously by [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hill, Thomas | title=Geometry and faith | year=1874 | publisher=GP Putnam |author2=Charles Babbage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theology of the Bridgewater Treatises was often disputed, given that it assumed humans could have knowledge of God acquired by observation and reasoning without the aid of revealed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/1838_Bridgewater_A25/1838_Bridgewater_A25.html Darwin Online: The Bridgewater Treatises]. Retrieved on 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are of unequal merit; several of them were esteemed as apologetic literature, but they attracted considerable criticism.  One notable critic of the Bridgewater Treatises was [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote ''Criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060210031823/http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-criticism.htm Criticism], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], (1850)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Knox]], an Edinburgh surgeon and major advocate of radical [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], referred to them as the "Bilgewater Treatises", to mock the "ultra-teleological school". Though memorable, this phrase overemphasises the influence of teleology in the series, at the expense of the [[idealism]] of the likes of Kirby and Roget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Alexander | first1=Denis | last2=Numbers | first2=Ronald L. | authorlink2=Ronald L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom believes there are potentially great benefits from Artificial General Intelligence, but warns it might very quickly transform into a [[Superintelligence]] that would deliberately extinguish humanity out of precautionary self-preservation or some unfathomable motive, making solving the problems of control beforehand an absolute priority. Although his book on [[superintelligence]] was recommended by both [[Elon Musk]] and [[Bill Gates]], Bostrom has expressed frustration that the reaction to its thesis typically falls into two camps, one calling his recommendations absurdly alarmist because creation of superintelligence is unfeasible, and the other deeming them futile because superintelligence would be uncontrollable. Bostrom notes that both these lines of reasoning converge on inaction rather than trying to ''solve'' the control problem while there may still be time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines |title=Bill Gates Is Worried About the Rise of the Machines|work=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/23/outing-a-i-beyond-the-turing-test/?_r=0|title=Outing A.I.: Beyond the Turing Test|work=The New York Times|first=Benjamin H.|last=Bratton|date=23 February 2015|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sought to educate himself in a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropology, art, literature, and science.&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; Despite what has been called a "serious [[wikt:mien|mien]]", he once did some turns on London's stand-up comedy circuit.&lt;ref name=ft-control /&gt;

He holds a B.A. in philosophy, mathematics, logic and artificial intelligence from the [[University of Gothenburg]] and master's degrees in philosophy and physics, and [[computational neuroscience]] from [[Stockholm University]] and [[King's College London]], respectively. During his time at Stockholm University, he researched the relationship between language and reality by studying the analytic philosopher [[W. V. Quine]].&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; In 2000, he was awarded a PhD in philosophy from the [[London School of Economics]]. He held a teaching position at [[Yale University]] (2000–2002), and he was a [[British Academy]] Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford (2002–2005).&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/cv.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Nickbostrom.com|title=Nick Bostrom : CV|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential risk===
Aspects of Bostrom's research concern the future of humanity and long-term outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom|title=Existential Risks |journal=[[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] | volume=9 |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume9/risks.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ross|title=Omens|url=http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/ross-andersen-human-extinction/|publisher=Aeon Media Ltd.|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of an [[existential risk]],&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; which he defines as one in which an "adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential." In the 2008 volume ''[[Global Catastrophic Risks (book)|Global Catastrophic Risks]]'', editors Bostrom and Milan Ćirković characterize the relation between existential risk and the broader class of [[global catastrophic risks]], and link existential risk to [[Selection bias#Observer selection|observer selection effects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Tegmark |authorlink=Max Tegmark |first2=Nick |last2=Bostrom |title=Astrophysics: is a doomsday catastrophe likely? |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7069 |pages=754 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/438754a |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/5923/How_Unlikely_is_a_Doomsday_Catastrophe_plus_Supplementary_Materials.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20110703062301/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/5923/How_Unlikely_is_a_Doomsday_Catastrophe_plus_Supplementary_Materials.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-03 |format=PDF |pmid=16341005 |bibcode=2005Natur.438..754T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fermi paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |title=Where are they?

In 2005, Bostrom founded the [[Future of Humanity Institute]],&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt; which researches the far future of human civilization. He is also an adviser to the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]].&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;

===Superintelligence===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

====Human vulnerability in relation to advances in AI====
In his 2014 book ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]'', Bostrom reasoned that "the creation of a superintelligent being represents a possible means to the extinction of mankind".&lt;ref name="superintelligence-review-thorn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorn|first1=Paul D.|title=Nick Bostrom: Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|journal=Minds and Machines|date=1 January 2015|volume=25|issue=3|pages=285–289|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/THONBS|accessdate=17 March 2017|doi=10.1007/s11023-015-9377-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom argues that a computer with near human-level general intellectual ability could initiate an [[intelligence explosion]] on a digital time scale with the resultant rapid creation of something so powerful that it might deliberately or accidentally destroy human kind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom contends the power of a superintelligence would be so great that a task given to it by humans might be taken to open ended extremes, for example a goal of calculating [[Pi]] could collaterally cause nanotechnology manufactured facilities to sprout over the entire Earth's surface and cover it within days.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; He believes an existential risk to humanity  from superintelligence would be immediate once  brought into being, thus creating an exceedingly difficult problem of finding out how to control such an entity before it actually exists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Warning that a human-friendly prime directive for AI would rely on the absolute correctness of the human knowledge it was based on, Bostrom points to the lack of agreement among most philosophers as an indication that most philosophers  are wrong, with the attendant possibility that a fundamental concept of current science may be incorrect. Bostrom says that there are few precedents to guide an understanding of what pure non-anthropocentric rationality would dictate for a potential [[Singleton (global governance)|Singleton]] AI being held in quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Nick Bostrom Oxford, 2014. p. 104-8&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that both [[John von Neumann]] and  [[Bertrand Russell]] advocated a nuclear strike, or the threat of one, to prevent the Soviets acquiring the atomic bomb, Bostrom says the relatively unlimited means of superintelligence might make for its analysis moving along different lines to the evolved "diminishing returns" assessments that in humans confer a basic aversion to risk.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Nick Bostrom Oxford, 2014. p. 106-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Group selection]] in predators working by means of cannibalism shows the counter-intuitive nature of non-anthropocentric "evolutionary search" reasoning, and thus humans are ill-equipped to perceive what an artificial intelligence's intentions might be.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Nick Bostrom Oxford, 2014. p. 148-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it cannot be discounted that any Superintelligence would ineluctably pursue an 'all or nothing' offensive action strategy in order to achieve hegemony and assure its survival.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom p126-30&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom notes that even current programs have, "like MacGyver", hit on apparently unworkable but functioning hardware solutions, making robust isolation of Superintelligence  problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostromp135- 142&lt;/ref&gt;

====Illustrative scenario for takeover====
A machine with general intelligence far below human level, but superior mathematical abilities is created.&lt;ref name="Superintelligence p 115-118"&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom p 115-118&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping the AI in isolation from the outside world especially the internet, humans pre-program the AI so it always works from basic principles that will keep it under human control. Other safety measures include the  AI being "boxed" (run in a virtual reality simulation), and being  used only as an 'oracle' to answer carefully defined questions in a limited reply (to prevent it manipulating humans).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A cascade of recursive self-improvement solutions feeds an [[intelligence explosion]] in which the AI attains superintelligence in some domains. The super intelligent power of the AI goes beyond human knowledge to discover flaws in the science that underlies its friendly-to-humanity programming, which ceases to work as intended. Purposeful agent-like behavior emerges along with a capacity for self-interested strategic deception. The  AI manipulates human beings into implementing modifications to itself that are ostensibly for augmenting  its (feigned) modest capabilities, but will actually function to free Superintelligence from its "boxed" isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom, Oxford p 103-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing online humans as paid dupes, and clandestinely hacking computer systems including  automated laboratory facilities, the Superintelligence mobilises  resources to further a takeover plan. Bostrom emphasises that planning by a Superintelligence will not be so stupid that humans could detect actual weaknesses in it.&lt;ref&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies By Nick Bostrom, Oxford p 98-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he canvasses disruption of international economic, political and military stability including hacked nuclear missile launches, Bostrom thinks the most effective and likely means for Superintelligence to use would be a [[coup de main]] with weapons several generations more advanced than current state of the art.

In January 2015, Bostrom joined [[Stephen Hawking]] among others in signing the [[Future of Life Institute]]'s open letter warning of the potential dangers of AI.&lt;ref name="loos-fli-letter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loos|first1=Robert|title=Artificial Intelligence and The Future of Life|url=http://www.roboticstoday.com/news/open-letter-from-the-future-of-life-3103|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=Robotics Today|date=23 January 2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signatories "...believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that concrete research should be pursued today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter|title=The Future of Life Institute Open Letter|publisher= The Future of Life Institute |accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting edge AI researcher [[Demis Hassabis]] then met with Hawking, subsequent to which he did not mention "anything inflammatory about AI", which Hassabis, took as 'a win'.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian February 2016[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/16/demis-hassabis-artificial-intelligence-deepmind-alphago Interview The superhero of artificial intelligence: can this genius keep it in check?]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Google,  Microsoft and various tech firms, Hassabis, Bostrom and Hawking and others subscribed to 23 principles for safe development of AI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-worries-ai-superintelligence-coordination-2017-2 The CEO of Google DeepMind is worried that tech giants won't work together at the time of the intelligence explosion]&lt;/ref&gt; Hassabis suggested the main safety measure would be an agreement for whichever AI research team began to make strides toward an artificial general intelligence to halt their project for a complete solution to the control problem prior to proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Business insider 26 February 2017[http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-worries-ai-superintelligence-coordination-2017-2 The CEO of Google DeepMind is worried that tech giants won't work together at the time of the intelligence explosion]&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom had pointed out that even if the crucial advances require the resources of a state, such a halt by a lead project might be likely to motivate a lagging country to a catch-up crash program or even physical destruction of the project suspected of being on the verge of success.&lt;ref&gt; Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.p95-109&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical assessments====
In 1863 [[Darwin among the Machines]], an essay by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] predicted intelligent machines' domination of humanity, but Bostom's suggestion of deliberate massacre of all humankind is the most extreme of such forecasts to date. One journalist wrote in a review that Bostrom's "nihilistic" speculations indicate he "has been reading too much of the science fiction he professes to dislike"&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; As given in his most recent book, ''[[From Bacteria to Bach and Back]]'', renowned philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]'s views remain in contradistinction to those of  Bostrom. &lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett modified his views somewhat after reading [[The Master Algorithm]], and now acknowledges that it is  "possible in principle" to create "[[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" with human-like comprehension and agency, but maintains that the difficulties of any such "[[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" project as predicated by Bostrom's "alarming" work would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized, and at least 50 years away.&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.399-400&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett thinks the only relevant danger from AI systems is falling into anthropomorphism instead of challenging or developing human users' powers of comprehension.&lt;ref&gt; From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.399-403&lt;/ref&gt; Since a 2014 book in which he expressed the opinion that artificial intelligence  developments would never challenge humans' supremacy, environmentalist [[James Lovelock]] has moved far closer to Bostrom's position, and in 2018 Lovelock said that he thought the overthrow of humankind will happen within the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian'', Caspar Henderson, Thu 17 Jul 2014, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/superintelligence-nick-brostrom-rough-ride-future-james-lovelock-review Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom and A Rough Ride to the Future by James Lovelock – review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Independent'' Andrew Griffin, Wednesday 8 August 2018 [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/james-lovelock-climate-change-global-warming-fire-california-ai-artificial-intelligence-a8482851.html "ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT JAMES LOVELOCK SAYS HUMANS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND COULD MAKE WAY FOR AI"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropic reasoning===
Bostrom has published numerous articles on [[Anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]], as well as the book ''[[Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy]]''. In the book, he criticizes previous formulations of the anthropic principle, including those of [[Brandon Carter]], [[John A. Leslie|John Leslie]], [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]], and [[Frank J. Tipler|Frank Tipler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-93858-9|pages=44–58|url=http://www.anthropic-principle.com/sites/anthropic-principle.com/files/pdfs/anthropicbias.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bostrom believes that the mishandling of [[indexical information]] is a common flaw in many areas of inquiry (including cosmology, philosophy, evolution theory, game theory, and quantum physics). He argues that a theory of anthropics is needed to deal with these. He introduces the [[Self-Sampling Assumption]] (SSA) and the [[Self-Indication Assumption]] (SIA), shows how they lead to different conclusions in a number of cases, and points out that each is affected by paradoxes or counterintuitive implications in certain thought experiments. He suggests that a way forward may involve extending SSA into the Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA), which replaces "observers" in the SSA definition with "observer-moments".

In later work, he has described the phenomenon of ''anthropic shadow'', an observation selection effect that prevents observers from observing certain kinds of catastrophes in their recent geological and evolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/anthropicshadow.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Nickbostrom.com|title=Anthropic Shadow: Observation Selection Effects and Human Extinction Risks|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophe types that lie in the anthropic shadow are likely to be underestimated unless statistical corrections are made.

====Simulation argument====
{{main|Simulation hypothesis}}

Bostrom's simulation argument posits that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bostrom |first=Nick|title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation? |date=19 January 2010 |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nesbit-simulation-editorial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nesbit|first1=Jeff|title=Proof Of The Simulation Argument|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/at-the-edge/2012/12/17/proof-of-the-simulation-argument|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=US News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
# The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;
# The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;
# The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.

The idea has influenced the views of [[Elon Musk]].&lt;ref name="rothman-newyorker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Joshua|title=What Are the Odds We Are Living in a Computer Simulation?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/what-are-the-odds-we-are-living-in-a-computer-simulation|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics of human enhancement===
Bostrom is favorable towards "human enhancement", or "self-improvement and human perfectibility through the ethical application of science",&lt;ref name="Guardian2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom|title=Human Genetic Enhancements: A Transhumanist Perspective |journal=Journal of Value Inquiry |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=493–506 |year=2003 |doi=10.1023/B:INQU.0000019037.67783.d5 |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cyberlaw2005/sites/cyberlaw2005/images/Transhumanist_Perspective.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a critic of bio-conservative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |title=In Defence of Posthuman Dignity |journal=Bioethics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=202–214 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00437.x |pmid=16167401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Bostrom co-founded (with [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]]) the World [[Transhumanism|Transhumanist]] Association&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom; John Sutherland meets a transhumanist who wrestles with the ethics of technologically enhanced human beings |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=9 May 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which has since changed its name to [[Humanity+]]). In 2004, he co-founded (with [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]]) the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], although he is no longer involved in either of these organisations. Bostrom was named in ''[[Foreign Policy]]''{{'}}s 2009 list of top global thinkers "for accepting no limits on human potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers – 73. Nick Bostrom|date=December 2009|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/30/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021111122/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/30/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,30|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With philosopher [[Toby Ord]], he proposed the [[reversal test]]. Given humans' irrational status quo bias, how can one distinguish between valid criticisms of proposed changes in a human trait and criticisms merely motivated by resistance to change? The reversal test attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was altered in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Nick |last1=Bostrom |first2=Toby |last2=Ord |title=The reversal test: eliminating status quo bias in applied ethics |journal=Ethics |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=656–679 |year=2006 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1086/505233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology strategy===
{{see also|Differential technological development}}
He has suggested that technology policy aimed at reducing existential risk should seek to influence the order in which various technological capabilities are attained, proposing the principle of [[differential technological development]]. This principle states that we ought to retard the development of dangerous technologies, particularly ones that raise the level of existential risk, and accelerate the development of beneficial technologies, particularly those that protect against the existential risks posed by nature or by other technologies.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

==Policy and consultations==

Bostrom has provided policy advice and consulted for an extensive range of governments and organisations. He gave evidence to the [[House of Lords]], Select Committee on Digital Skills.&lt;ref name="consultation-parliament"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Skills Committee – timeline|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/digital-skills-committee/timeline/|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an advisory board member for the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]],&lt;ref name="MIRI-team"&gt;{{cite web|title=Team – Machine Intelligence Research Institute|url=https://intelligence.org/team/#advisors|website=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Future of Life Institute]],&lt;ref name="FLI-team"&gt;{{cite web|title=Team – Future of Life Institute|url=https://futureoflife.org/team/|website=Future of Life Institute|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundational Questions Institute]]&lt;ref name="FQXI-team"&gt;{{cite web|title=FQXi – Foundational Questions Institute|url=http://fqxi.org/who|website=fqxi.org|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an external advisor for the Cambridge [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/cv.html|title=nickbostrom.com|publisher=Nickbostrom.com|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newrepublic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBain|first1=Sophie|title=Apocalypse Soon: Meet The Scientists Preparing For the End Times|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/119697/scientists-preparing-apocalypse|website=New Republic|accessdate=17 March 2017|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Taylor''' (November 5, 1919&amp;nbsp;– October 30, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue44/44taylor.htm|title=Richard Taylor Remembered - Issue 44 - Philosophy Now|website=www.philosophynow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Charlotte, Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Bee Culture Magazine'', "Richard Taylor (1919-2003)", January 2004, Vol 132, No 1, p 64.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] renowned for his dry wit and his contributions to [[metaphysics]]. He was also an internationally known [[beekeeper]].

==Biography==
Taylor took his PhD at [[Brown University]], where his supervisor was [[Roderick Chisholm]]. He taught at Brown University, [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and the [[University of Rochester]], and had visiting appointments at about a dozen other institutions. His best-known book was ''Metaphysics'' (1963). Other works included ''Action and Purpose'' (1966), ''Good and Evil'' (1970) and ''Virtue Ethics'' (1991). Professor Taylor was also the editor of ''The Will to Live: Selected Writings of Arthur Schopenhauer''.&lt;ref&gt;Anchor Books A266: 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an enthusiastic advocate of [[virtue ethics]]. He also wrote influential papers on the [[meaning of life]], which, like [[Albert Camus]], he explored through an examination of the myth of [[Sisyphus]].

Taylor's 1962 essay "Fatalism"&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; was the subject of [[David Foster Wallace]]'s undergraduate thesis at [[Amherst College]], published in 2011 together with Taylor's essay and contemporary responses under the title ''Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will''.&lt;ref&gt;New York: Columbia University Press ({{ISBN|978-0-231-15156-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor made significant contributions to [[beekeeping]]. He owned three hundred hives of bees and, from 1970, produced mostly [[comb honey]].  He explained his management techniques in several books, including ''The Comb Honey Book'' and ''The Joys of Beekeeping''.

In 1993, he debated [[William Lane Craig]] over the subject 'Is The Basis For Morality Natural or Supernatural?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-basis-of-morality-natural-or-supernatural-the-craig-taylor-debate|title=Is the Basis of Morality Natural or Supernatural? - Reasonable Faith|website=www.reasonablefaith.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413220234/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/is-the-basis-of-morality-natural-or-supernatural-the-craig-taylor-debate|archivedate=2012-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator''' ('''RHETI''') is an [[Enneagram of Personality]] [[psychometric]] test. [[Don Richard Riso]] and Russ Hudson began developing the RHETI test in 1993. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Their research focused on constructing the RHETI as a personality measurement instrument.

The latest version&lt;!--online 2.5--&gt; consists of 144 pairs of forced-choice statements.

The RHETI has been found to be of [[heuristic]] value&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Newgent, Rebeca | first = Rebeca | author-link = | publication-date = January 2004 | title = The Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator: Estimates of Reliability and Validity | periodical = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development| series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = | volume = 36 | issue = | pages =226–237 | page = | at = | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rebecca_Newgent/publication/35984162_An_investigation_of_the_reliability_and_validity_of_the_Riso-Hudson_enneagram_type_indicator/links/56e318c808ae98445c1b2a95/An-investigation-of-the-reliability-and-validity-of-the-Riso-Hudson-enneagram-type-indicator.pdf | archiveurl = | archivedate = | issn = | pmid = | pmc = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate = December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but minimal scientific research has been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last = Giordano | first = Mary Ann Elizabeth |author2=Piedmont, Ralph | title = A psychometric evaluation of the Riso-Hudson Type Indicator (RHETI), Version 2.5: Comparison of ipsative and non-ipsative versions and correlations with spiritual outcomes| journal = [[ProQuest Dissertations and Theses]]|  volume =  DAI-B 70/07| pages = 4524 | publisher = Loyola College In Maryland | location = Baltimore, Maryland | year=2010 | url = https://www.worldcat.org/title/psychometric-evaluation-of-the-riso-hudson-type-indicator-rheti-version-25-comparison-of-ipsative-and-non-ipsative-versions-and-correlations-with-spiritual-outcomes/oclc/463479495  | accessdate = December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 review of validation studies of various Enneagram systems found guarded support for the reliability and validity of the RHETI.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12722">'''Sanni yakuma''', sometimes known as '''Daha ata sanniya''' is a traditional [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[exorcism]] ritual. The ritual consists of 18 [[mask]]ed dances, each depicting a particular illness or ailment affecting humans. These 18 dances are the main dances of the Pahatharata, or low country, dancing form, which is one of the three [[Dances of Sri Lanka|main dancing forms]] of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="slref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.lk/srilanka/srilankaculture/srilankatraditionaldancing.htm|title=Traditional Dances of Sri Lanka|publisher=Info.lk|accessdate=2009-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111075403/http://www.info.lk/srilanka/srilankaculture/srilankatraditionaldancing.htm|archivedate=2010-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3Wz_P-ClM&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PLEAE0FCC17F7E58D1  The Last of the Devil Dancers]&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual calls the [[Demons of Sri Lanka|demons]] who are thought to affect the patient, who are then told not to trouble humans and banished.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2gcuUUCaZg]

[[File:Mask Museum, Ambalangoda 0804.jpg|thumb|Maha Kola mask]]

==Origins==
It was believed that illnesses were brought on humans by demons and these beliefs and rituals could have [[prehistoric]] roots.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/palle1.html|title=Pallemalala discovery throws new light on Lanka's pre-historic culture|last=Hussein|first=Asiff |date=|work=The Sunday Observer|accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.html|title=The yakun natima - devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka|last=Pate|first=Alan|date=|work=lankalibrary|accessdate=2015-12-05}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to folklore, the 18 demons who are depicted in the Sanni Yakuma originated during the time of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;However, this story is given differently in Buddhist sources, and describes the Buddha saving the city from a plague through the chanting of the Ratana Sutta. See [[Vaishali_(ancient_city)#Visits_of_the_Buddha_to_Vaishali]].&lt;/ref&gt; The story goes that the king of [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]] of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] suspected his queen of committing adultery and had her killed. However, she gave birth when she was executed and her child became the ''Kola Sanniya'', who grew up "feeding on his mother's corpse". The Kola Sanni demon destroyed the city, seeking vengeance on his father, the king.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner and Appel (1990), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He created eighteen lumps of poison and charmed them, thereby turning them into demons who assisted him in his destruction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Obeyesekere (1990), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; They killed the king, and continued to wreak havoc in the city, "killing and eating thousands" daily, until finally being tamed by the Buddha and agreed to stop harming humans.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere 1990, p. 192"&gt;Obeyesekere (1990), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these demons are believed to affect humans in the form of an illnesses,&lt;ref name="Claus 2003 p. 133"&gt;Claus, Diamond and Mills (2003), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sanni Yakuma ritual summons these demons and banishes them back to the demon world after bringing them under control.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere 1990, p. 192"/&gt; Although it is unclear when the ritual began, it has been performed in the southern and western parts of the country since ancient times.&lt;ref name="burst"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/030216/plus/12.html|title=A burst of Daha Ata Sanniya|last= Seneviratne|first= Vidushi|date=2003-02-16|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
The name of the ritual comes from the Sinhala word ''sanniya'' meaning disease or ailment, and ''yakuma'' meaning demon ritual.&lt;ref name="Claus 2003 p. 133"/&gt; In Sri Lankan culture, exorcism rituals are known as ''tovil''. The Sanni Yakuma is possibly the best known exorcism ritual in the country.&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1327|title=Sri Lankan sanni masks: an ancient classification of disease |last=Bailey|first=Mark S |author2=de Silva |author3=H Janaka  |date=2006-12-23|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mix of traditional beliefs regarding spirits with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner and Appel (1990), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonald and Fyfe 1996, p. 38"&gt;Macdonald and Fyfe (1996), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Before performing the healing ritual, the lead performer known as the ''yakadura'' determines whether the patient is affected by a demon, and schedules the ritual for an auspicious day and time, usually from dusk to dawn.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/020922/plus/10.html|title=Unmasking a craft|last=Gunasekara |first=Naomi|date=2002-09-22|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Edura '' or ''Yakadura'' is the [[Shaman]] [[Traditional medicine|healer]] and is usually a fisherman, drummer or farmer.&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.khm.uio.no/tema/utstillingsarkiv/masker/english/sanni_18_masker.html|title=18 masks, 18 illnesses – and the master of them all|last=|first=|date=|work=kulturhistorisk museum|accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has two main stages, namely the Ata Paliya and Daha Ata Sanniya.&lt;ref name="Moore and Myerhoff 1977, p. 108"&gt;Moore and Myerhoff (1977), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers are dressed in colourful attire and masks, and perform swift and complex dance steps and spins accompanied by rhythmical drum beats.&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Myerhoff (1977), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Rather comic and somewhat obscene dialogues take place between the drummer and the demon on stage, in which the demon is humiliated.&lt;ref name="Moore and Myerhoff 1977, p. 108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Myerhoff (1977), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Moore and Myerhoff (1977) describe the following dialogue translated from [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]:

{{quote|Drummer: Where are you off to?&lt;br /&gt;
Demon: I am off to [[Maradana]] by a first class express bus.&lt;br /&gt;
Drummer: ...What was it I saw you doing only yesterday? You pissed near the sacred bodhi tree, then shitted on the temple grounds after which you stole a monk's robes. What else have you done? ...&lt;br /&gt;
Demon: You peretaya!&lt;ref group="N"&gt;''Peretaya'' refers to [[preta]], and is used here as an abusive term.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Drummer: Aah – you are only a mad demon – beneath contempt.}}

===Ata Paliya===
Ata Paliya is the name given to the eight dances in the first stage of the ritual. Before the dances begin, the Yakadura prepares some offerings for the demons, which will be given to them by the patient. The Ata Paliya depicts eight ''palis'' who bless the patient. This includes the ''Suniyan Yakshaniya'' who appears thrice as a beautiful damsel, a pregnant woman and a woman carrying a baby. This is followed by ''Maruwa'' (death) and demons called ''Kalu Yaka'', ''Vatha Kumara'' and ''Kalu Kumara''. The other ''palis'' are known as ''Anguru Dummala Paliya'', ''Kalaspaliya'' and ''Salupaliya''.&lt;ref name="howitsperfomred" /&gt;

===Daha Ata Sanniya===
Although the Daha Ata Sanniya is part of the Sanni Yakuma, the name is sometimes used to refer to the ritual itself. This is the stage when the sanni demons make their appearance one after the other. The demons who first appear frightening when they enter the stage in frenzied dances are then shown as comic figures through enactments, with them being humiliated and forced to do various things. The Kola Sanni demon enters last, who is depicted as a non Buddhist demon. In the end, he is made to obtain the permission of the Buddha and accept offerings from humans, and agrees to stop troubling them.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner and Appel (1990), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the dancer appears before the patient after removing the mask.&lt;ref&gt;Claus, Diamond and Mills (2003), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are only eighteen demons, there is a variety of sanni masks that differ from place to place.&lt;ref name="Macdonald and Fyfe 1996, p. 38"/&gt; However, the eighteen most commons masks (and names of the demons) are as follows:&lt;ref name="bmj2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1327/TBL1|title=Sri Lankan sanni masks: an ancient classification of disease - table of masks|last=Bailey|first=Mark S |author2=de Silva |author3=H Janaka  |date=2006-12-23|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanni Yakuma is still performed today, particularly along the south coast, though more often as a cultural spectacle than an exorcism ritual. However, it is not widely performed because of the high costs involved and also because of its long duration.&lt;ref name="burst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howitsperfomred"&gt;{{cite news|title=Daha Ata Sanniya: How it's performed|last=Amarasekara|first=Janani|date=2007-02-04|work=The Sunday Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Fyfe (1996), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] also has affected its survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://explorers.org/flag_reports/Jason_Schoonover_Flag_33_Devil_Dancers_of_Sri_Lanka_Report._.pdf|title=In Search of the Vanishing Sri Lankan Devil Dance II |last=Schoonover|first=Jason |date=|work=explorers.org|accessdate=2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lesstroud.ca/beyondsurvival/ep3.php|title=THE DEVIL DANCERS OF SRI LANKA|last=Stroud|first=Les|date=|work=beyondsurvival|accessdate=2015-12-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825083522/http://lesstroud.ca/beyondsurvival/ep3.php|archivedate=2010-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the coastal regions came under colonial influences as well as prior foreign influences, the art was best preserved in the south-west coast.&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

'''Self-love''' has often been seen as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and [[selfishness]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed., ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1998) p. 592 and p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Merriam-Webster dictionary]] later describes self-love as to "love of self" or "regard for one's own happiness or advantage". Synonyms of this concept are: [[amour propre]], conceit, conceitedness, [[egotism]], and many more. However, throughout the centuries this definition has adopted a more positive connotation through self-love protests, the [[Hippie]] era, the [[new age]] [[feminist movement]] as well as the increase in [[mental health]] awareness that promotes self-love.

==Traditional views==
[[Cicero]] considered those who were ''sui amantes sine rivali'' (lovers of themselves without rivals) were doomed to end in failure – a theme adopted by [[Francis Bacon]] in his condemnation of extreme self-lovers, who would burn down their own home, only to roast themselves an egg.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Essays'' (1985) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-love was first recognized in 1563 but was only later studied by philosophers [[William James]] and [[Erich Fromm]], who studied emotional human behaviour, such as [[self-esteem]] and self-worth.
However, it was later defined in 1956 by [[psychologist]] and [[social philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]], who proposed that loving oneself is different from being [[:wikt:arrogant|arrogant]], conceited or [[egocentric]], meaning that instead caring about oneself and taking responsibility for oneself.

However, [[Augustine]] – with his theology of evil as a mere distortion of the good – considered that the sin of pride was only a perversion of a normal, more modest degree of self-love.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sayers, Dante: Purgatory'' (1971) p. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century re-interpretations==
Eric Fromm proposed a re-evaluation of self-love in more positive sense, arguing that in order to be able to truly love another person, a person first needs to love oneself in the way of respecting oneself and knowing oneself (e.g. being realistic and honest about one's strengths and weaknesses).&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Loving'' (1956) by Erich Fromm.  [[Harper &amp; Row]]. {{ISBN|978-0-06-091594-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buildthefire.com/loving-yourself-more/|title=How to Stop Beating Yourself Up and Start Loving Yourself More {{!}} Build The Fire|website=Build The Fire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] similarly wrote of a post-narcissistic appreciation of the value of the ego,&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1964) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Carl Rogers]] saw one result of successful therapy as the regaining of a quiet sense of pleasure in being one's own self.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-love or self-worth was later defined by A.P. Gregg and C. Sedikides in 2003 as "referring to a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative". Robert H. Wozniak described William James's theory of self-esteem and claimed that self-love was measured in "... three different but interrelated aspects of self: the material self (all those aspects of material existence in which we feel a strong sense of ownership, our bodies, our families, our possessions), the social self (our felt social relations), and the spiritual self (our feelings of our own subjectivity)".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wozniak, R. H. (1999) Introduction to The Principles of Psychology. Classics in Psychology, 1855-1914: Historical Essays.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
[[Mental health]] was first described by William Sweetser (1797–1875) as the maintenance of "mental hygiene". His analysis was demonstrated in his essay "Temperance Society" published August 26, 1830, which claimed that regular maintenance of [[mental hygiene]] created a positive impact on the well-being of individuals and the community as well.

According to the [[American Association of Suicidology]], there have been 44,193 [[suicides]] in 2015 alone, 5,491 of them being youth aged between 15–24 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Drapeau, C. W., &amp; McIntosh, J. L. (for the American Association of Suicidology). (2016). U.S.A. suicide 2015: Official final data.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of teenager and young adult suicides are escalating at an alarming rate every year, further demonstrating that the social environment has an impact on mental health conditions. The association conducted a study in 2008 which researched the impact of low self-esteem and lack of self-love and its relation to suicidal tendencies and attempts. They defined self-love as being "beliefs about oneself (self-based self-esteem)&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Beck, Bhar, Brown &amp; Ghahramanlou‐Holloway (2008). "Self-Esteem and Suicide Ideation in Psychiatric Outpatients". Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and beliefs about how other people regard oneself (other-based self-esteem)".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; It concluded that "[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[hopelessness]], and low self-esteem are implications of vulnerability factors for [[suicide ideation]]" and that "these findings suggest that even in the context of depression and hopelessness, low self-esteem may add to the risk for suicide ideation".

==Promotion==
===History===
Self-love was first promoted in the early years of the [[Hippie]] era (also known as [[the Beat Generation]] of the 1960s). After witnessing the devastating consequences of [[World War II]] and having troops still fighting in the [[Vietnam War]], western (especially North American) societies began promoting "peace and love" to help generate positive energy and to promote the preservation of dissipating environmental factors, such as the emergence of [[oil pipeline]]s and the recognition of [[pollution]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]].

These deteriorating living conditions caused worldwide protests that primarily focused on ending the war, but secondarily promoted a positive environment aided by the fundamental concept of [[crowd psychology]]. This post-war community was left very vulnerable to persuasion but began encouraging freedom, harmony and the possibility of a brighter, non-violent future. These protests took place on almost all continents and included countries such as the United States (primarily New York City and California), England and Australia. Their dedication, perseverance and empathy towards human life defined this generation as being peace advocates and carefree souls.

The emergence of the [[feminist movement]] began as early as the 19th century, but only began having major influence during the [[second-wave feminism|second wave]] movement, which included [[women's rights]] protests that inevitably led to women gaining the [[right to vote]]. These protests not only promoted equality but also suggested that women should recognize their self-worth through the knowledge and acceptance of self-love. Elizabeth Cady Stanton used the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as a guideline to demonstrate that women have been harshly treated throughout the centuries in her feminist essay titled "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]". In the essay she claims that "all men and women are created equal; ... that among these [rights] are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness";&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S.B., M.J. Cage &amp; Stanton, E.C. (1889). A History of Woman Suffrage, vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that without these rights, the capacity to feel self-worth and self-love is scarce. This historical essay suggests that a lack of self-esteem and fear of self-love affects modern women due to lingering post-industrial gender conditions.

Self-love has also been used as a radical tool in communities of Color in the United States. In the 1970s Black-Power movement, the slogan "Black is beautiful!" became a way for African-Americans to throw off the mantle of predominately White beauty norms. The dominant cultural aesthetic pre-1970s was to straighten Black hair with a perm or hot comb. During the Black Power movement, the "afro" or "fro" became the popular hairstyle. It involved letting Black Hair grow naturally, without chemical treatment, so as to embrace and flaunt the  extremely curly hair texture of Black people. Hair was teased out the hair using a pick. The goal was to cause the hair to form a halo around the head, flaunting the Blackness of its wearer. This form of self-love and empowerment during the 70s was a way for African-Americans to combat the stigma against their natural hair texture, which was, and still is, largely seen as unprofessional in the modern workplace.

===Modern platforms===
The emergence of new technology has given society an easier way to communicate with one another and research faster. [[Social media]] has created a platform for self-love promotion and mental health awareness in order to end the [[social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health and to address self-love positively rather than negatively.

A few modern examples of self-love promotion platforms include:
* [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]]
* [[Slut Walk]]
* [[To Write Love on Her Arms]]

'''Semantic heterogeneity''' is when [[database schema]] or [[Data set|datasets]] for the same domain are developed by independent parties, resulting in differences in meaning and interpretation of data values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Why your data won't mix |author=Alon Halevy|journal=Queue |volume=3 |issue=8 |year=2005 |url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1103836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond [[Data structure|structured data]], the problem of semantic heterogeneity is compounded due to the flexibility of [[semi-structured data]] and various [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] methods applied to documents or [[unstructured data]]. Semantic heterogeneity is one of the more important sources of differences in [[Heterogeneous database system|heterogeneous datasets]].

Yet, for multiple data sources to [[Interoperability|interoperate]] with one another, it is essential to reconcile these [[Semantics|semantic]] differences. Decomposing the various sources of semantic heterogeneities provides a basis for understanding how to map and transform data to overcome these differences.

== Classification ==

One of the first known classification schemes applied to [[Semantic data model|data semantics]] is from William Kent more than two decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=The many forms of a single fact |author=William Kent |conference=Proceedings of the IEEE COMPCON |date=February 27 – March 3, 1989 |location=San Francisco |number=HPL-SAL-88-8, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Oct. 21, 1988 | at=13 pp. |url=http://www.bkent.net/Doc/manyform.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's approach dealt more with structural [[Data mapping|mapping]] issues than differences in meaning, which he pointed to [[Data dictionary|data dictionaries]] as potentially solving.

One of the most comprehensive classifications is from Pluempitiwiriyawej and Hammer, "Classification Scheme for Semantic and Schematic Heterogeneities in XML Data Sources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A classification scheme for semantic and schematic heterogeneities in XML data sources |author=Charnyote Pluempitiwiriyawej and Joachim Hammer |publisher=University of Florida |at=Technical Report TR00-004 |location=Gainesville, Florida |date=September 2000 |url=https://cise.ufl.edu/tr/DOC/REP-2000-396.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They classify heterogeneities into three broad classes:

* ''[[Data structure|Structural]]'' conflicts arise when the schema of the sources representing related or overlapping data exhibit discrepancies. Structural conflicts can be detected when comparing the underlying schema. The class of structural conflicts includes generalization conflicts, aggregation conflicts, internal path discrepancy, missing items, element ordering, constraint and type mismatch, and naming conflicts between the element types and attribute names.
* ''[[Data domain|Domain]]'' conflicts arise when the semantics of the data sources that will be integrated exhibit discrepancies. Domain conflicts can be detected by looking at the information contained in the schema and using knowledge about the underlying data domains. The class of domain conflicts includes schematic discrepancy, scale or unit, precision, and data representation conflicts.
* ''[[Data]]'' conflicts refer to discrepancies among similar or related data values across multiple sources. Data conflicts can only be detected by comparing the underlying sources. The class of data conflicts includes ID-value, missing data, incorrect spelling, and naming conflicts between the element contents and the attribute values.

Moreover, mismatches or conflicts can occur between set elements (a "population" mismatch) or attributes (a "description" mismatch).

Michael Bergman expanded upon this schema by adding a fourth major explicit category of language, and also added some examples of each kind of semantic heterogeneity, resulting in about 40 distinct potential categories &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sources and classification of semantic heterogeneities |author=M.K. Bergman |website=AI3:::Adaptive Information |date=6 June 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2014 |url=http://www.mkbergman.com/232/sources-and-classification-of-semantic-heterogeneities/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach toward classifying semantics and integration approaches is taken by [[Amit Sheth|Sheth]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Semantics for the semantic Web: the implicit, the formal and the powerful | author1=Amit P. Sheth|author2=Cartic Ramakrishnan|author3=Christopher Thomas|journal=Int’l Journal on Semantic Web &amp; Information Systems |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |date=2005 |url=http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/ijswis/ijswis1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under their concept, they split semantics into three forms: implicit, formal and powerful. Implicit semantics are what is either largely present or can easily be extracted; formal languages, though relatively scarce, occur in the form of [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] or other [[description logic]]s; and powerful (soft) semantics are fuzzy and not limited to rigid set-based assignments. Sheth et al.'s main point is that [[first-order logic]] (FOL) or description logic is inadequate alone to properly capture the needed semantics.

== Relevant applications ==

Besides data interoperabiity, relevant areas in [[information technology]] that depend on reconciling semantic heterogeneities include [[data mapping]], [[semantic integration]], and [[enterprise information integration]], among many others. From the conceptual to actual data, there are differences in perspective, vocabularies, measures and conventions once any two data sources are brought together. Explicit attention to these semantic heterogeneities is one means to get the information to integrate or interoperate.

A mere twenty years ago, information technology systems expressed and stored data in a multitude of formats and systems. The Internet and Web protocols have done much to overcome these sources of differences. While there is a large number of categories of semantic heterogeneity, these categories are also patterned and can be anticipated and corrected. These patterned sources inform what kind of work must be done to overcome semantic differences where they still reside.

'''Thomas Alva Edison''' (February 11, 1847{{spaced ndash}}October 18, 1931) was an American [[inventor]] and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Adrian Wooldridge|authorlink1=Adrian Wooldridge|title=The alphabet of success|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707053-superstars-need-dazzling-range-qualities-alphabet-success|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sproule1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sproule|first1=Anna|title=Thomas Alva Edison : The World's Greatest Inventor|date=2000|publisher=Blackbirch Press|location=Woodbridge, CT|isbn=9781567113310|edition= 1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoNJ1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hangout - Thomas Edison|url=http://www.state.nj.us/hangout_nj/200408_edison_p1.html|website=www.state.nj.us|publisher=State of New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with developing many devices in fields such as [[electric power generation]], [[mass communication]], [[sound recording]], and [[motion pictures]].&lt;ref name="coned1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=Con Edison: A Brief History of Con Edison – electricity |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions, which include the [[phonograph]], the [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and the long-lasting, practical electric [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]], had a widespread impact on the modern [[industrial society|industrialized world]].&lt;ref name="Wizard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/edison.html |title=The Wizard of Menlo Park |work=The Franklin Institute |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305131049/http://fi.edu/franklin/inventor/edison.html |archivedate=March 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of [[mass production]] and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees.&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt; He is often credited with establishing the first industrial [[research laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first= Bryan|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1910417_1910419_1910460,00.html |title=The Electrifying Edison |publisher=Time.com |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison was raised in the American [[midwest]] and early in his career he worked as a [[telegraph operator]], which inspired some of his earliest inventions.&lt;ref name="coned1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=Con Edison: A Brief History of Con Edison – electricity |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]], where many of his early inventions would be developed. He would later establish a [[botany|botanic]] laboratory in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] in collaboration with businessmen [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harvey Firestone]], and a laboratory in [[West Orange, New Jersey]] that featured the world's first [[film studio]], the [[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]]. He was a [[List of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]], holding 1,093 [[List of Edison patents|US patents in his name]], as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of complications of [[diabetes]].

==Early life==
[[File:Young Thomas Edison.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Edison as a boy]]
Thomas Edison was born, in 1847, in [[Milan, Ohio]], and grew up in [[Port Huron, Michigan]]. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in [[Marshalltown, Nova Scotia]]) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in [[Chenango County, New York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=443&amp;ResourceType |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808185308/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=443&amp;ResourceType |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 8, 2011 |title=National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) |publisher=Tps.cr.nps.gov |date=January 12, 1965 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://invention.si.edu/thomas-edisons-inventive-life Thomas Edison's Inventive Life; by Joyce Bedi] Retrieved March 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; His father, the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in [[southwestern Ontario]] (then called [[Upper Canada]]), in a village known as Shewsbury, later [[Vienna, Ontario|Vienna]], by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful [[Rebellions of 1837|Mackenzie Rebellion]] of 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/historyculture/samuel-and-nancy-elliott-edison.htm |title=Samuel and Nancy Elliott Edison |work=National Park Service |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the [[War of 1812]] as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at [[Sarnia]]-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to [[Milan, Ohio]]. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been "Edeson."&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Neal | title = Edison: Inventing the Century | publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] | year = 1995 | pages = 3–5 | isbn = 978-0-7868-6041-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.&lt;ref name="npsedisonbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edison Biography|url=https://www.nps.gov/edis/learn/historyculture/edison-biography.htm|website=National Park Service|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's ''[[School of Natural Philosophy]]'' and [[The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For Sesquicentennial, Cooper Union Puts Artifacts on View | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/for-sesquicentennial-cooper-union-puts-artifacts-on-view/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Bao | last=Ong | date=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of [[scarlet fever]] during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in [[Smiths Creek, Michigan]], along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.&lt;ref name="Josephson"&gt;"Edison" by [[Matthew Josephson]]. McGraw Hill, New York, 1959, {{ISBN|978-0-07-033046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Edison: Inventing the Century" by [[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Neil Baldwin]], University of Chicago Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-226-03571-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Edison's family moved to [[Port Huron, Michigan]], after the canal owners successfully kept the railroad out of  Milan Ohio in 1854 and business declined.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, [[Station master|station agent]] J. U. MacKenzie of [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]], was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the [[Grand Trunk Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitstratford.ca/uploads/railwayindustry.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123422/http://www.visitstratford.ca/uploads/railwayindustry.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-03-07 |title=Stratford's Railway Industry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2010 |website=Visit Stratford |publisher=Stratford Tourism |access-date=March 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite CAB|Edison, Thomas Alva"&gt;{{Cite CAB|wstitle=Edison, Thomas Alva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the ''Grand Trunk Herald'', which he sold with his other papers.&lt;ref name="Cite CAB|Edison, Thomas Alva"/&gt; This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including [[General Electric]], still one of the largest [[public company|publicly traded companies]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2266720/ |title=GE emerges world's largest company: Forbes |publisher=Trading Markets.com |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTYYG9X?url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2266720/ |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ge-emerges-worlds-largest-company-forbes/445093 |title=GE emerges world's largest company: Forbes |publisher=Indian Express.com |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTYurUQ?url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ge-emerges-worlds-largest-company-forbes/445093 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where, as an employee of [[Western Union]], he worked the [[Associated Press]] bureau [[news agency|news wire]]. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a [[lead–acid battery]] when he spilled [[sulfuric acid]] onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, pages 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named [[Franklin Leonard Pope]], who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, {{US patent|90646}}, which was granted on June 1, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edison.rutgers.edu/vote.htm The Edison Papers], Rutgers University. Retrieved March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Menlo Park laboratory (1876-1886)==
===Research and development facility===
[[File:Menlo Park Laboratory.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory, reconstructed at Greenfield Village at [[Henry Ford Museum]] in Dearborn, Michigan.]]
Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], a part of Raritan Township (now named [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township]] in his honor) in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], with the funds from the sale of Edison's [[quadruplex telegraph]]. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 (${{Inflation|US|10,000|1874|fmt=c|r=-2}} in today's dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US}}), which he gratefully accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bounceenergy.com/blog/2013/02/happy-birthday-thomas-edison/ |title=Happy Birthday, Thomas Edison! |last=Trollinger |first=Vernon |work=Bounce Energy |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.

[[William Joseph Hammer]], a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|iron ore separator]], [[incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]], and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see [[Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps]]). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager [[Francis Robbins Upton]] turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=9781599862163 |page=9 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anchor|sprague}}[[Frank J. Sprague]], a competent mathematician and former [[United States Navy|naval officer]], was recruited by [[Edward H. Johnson]] and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of [[Ohm's Law]], [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/ |title=The Thomas A.

Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were [[design patent]]s, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over [[prior art]]. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Harold, "They Made America." Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-316-27766-2}}. p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have "a stock of almost every conceivable material".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=737 |title=Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) |last=Wilson |first=Wendell E. |work=The Mineralogical Record |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415080355/http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=737 |archivedate=April 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained "eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels&amp;nbsp;... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell&amp;nbsp;... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores&amp;nbsp;..." and the list goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shulman | first = Seth | title = Owning the Future | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1999 | pages = 158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his desk, Edison displayed a placard with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]' famous quotation: "There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,752631,00.html |title=AERONAUTICS: Real Labor |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] |date=December 8, 1930 |accessdate= January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.

With Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/gilded-age/essays/edison%E2%80%99s-laboratory |title=Edison's Laboratory |last=Israel |first=Paul |work=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.&lt;ref name=time1979/&gt;

===Phonograph===
[[File:Edison and phonograph edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|Photograph of Edison with his phonograph (2nd model), taken in [[Mathew Brady]]'s Washington, D.C. studio in April 1878.]]
{{listen|pos=left|filename=Thomas Edison Mary had lamb.ogg|title=Mary Had a Little Lamb|description=Thomas Edison reciting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" in 1929.}}
Edison began his career as an inventor in [[Newark, New Jersey]], with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the [[phonograph]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edbio.html |title=The Life of Thomas A. Edison |work=The Library of Congress |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Wizard" /&gt;

His first phonograph recorded on [[Tin#Applications|tinfoil]] around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited [[sound quality]] and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. [[Joseph Henry]], president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other".&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. 1989. ''Menlo Park: The early years, April 1876 – December 1877''. Edited by P. B. Israel, K. A. Nier and L. Carlat. Vol. 3, The papers of Thomas A Edison. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Doc. 1117&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil. 2001. ''Edison: Inventing the century''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp.97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described Edison as a "[[genius]]" and his presentation as "a scene... that will live in history".&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post. 1878. ''Genius before science''. Washington Post, April 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. 1877. ''Telephones or speaking-telegraphs''. US patent 203,018 filed December 13, 1877, and issued April 30, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; he did little to develop it until [[Alexander Graham Bell]], [[Chichester Bell]], and [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Charles Tainter]] produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.

===Carbon telephone transmitter===
In 1876, Edison began work to improve the [[microphone]] for telephones (at that time called a "transmitter") by developing a [[carbon microphone]], which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.

Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by [[Johann Philipp Reis]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]], worked by generating a weak current. The [[carbon microphone]] works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.&lt;ref name="Adrian Hope 1102, page 378"&gt;Adrian Hope, 100 Years of Microphone, New Scientist May 11, 1978 Vol. 78, No. 1102, page 378 ISSN 0262-4079&lt;/ref&gt; His work was concurrent with [[Emile Berliner]]'s loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;''IEEE Global History Network: Carbon Transmitter''.

Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for [[Western Union]].&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt; In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was [[roasted]]. This type was put in use in 1890&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt; and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.

===Electric light===
{{Main|Incandescent light bulb}}
[[File:Edison bulb.jpg|thumb|Thomas Edison's first successful light bulb model, used in public demonstration at Menlo Park, December 1879]]

In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2004, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including [[Alessandro Volta]]'s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by [[Henry Woodward (inventor)|Henry Woodward]] and [[Mathew Evans]]. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included [[Humphry Davy]], [[James Bowman Lindsay]], [[Moses G. Farmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliotmaine.org/mosespage.htm |title=Moses G.

Sawyer]], [[Joseph Swan]], and [[Heinrich Göbel]]. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high [[electric current]] drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.&lt;ref name="Israel"/&gt;{{rp|217–218}} Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

After many experiments, first with [[carbon]] filaments and then with [[platinum]] and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The story of great inventions |author=Burns, Elmer Ellsworth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Q3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1910 |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]] |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful test was on October 22, 1879;&lt;ref name="Israel"/&gt;{{rp|186}}&lt;ref name=nyt1879&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1021.html#article |title=Edison's Electric Light|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1879 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3517011/thomas-edison/ |title=Thomas Edison Invents Light Bulb and Myths About Himself|work=TIME.com |first=Jennifer |last=Latson |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time1979&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947523-1,00.html |title=Business: The Quintessential Innovator|date=October 22, 1979|work=TIME.com |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it lasted 13.5 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Edison, Original Letters and Primary Source Documents|url=http://www.shapell.org/btl.aspx?2718806 |publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using "a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires".&lt;ref name="Patent898"&gt;{{US patent|0223898}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first commercially practical incandescent light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =In Our Time Archive: Thomas Edison | publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iots/all#playepisode6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways",&lt;ref name="Patent898" /&gt; it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a [[carbonization|carbonized]] [[bamboo]] filament that could last over 1,200&amp;nbsp;hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of [[Wyoming]], where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the [[Continental Divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:SS Columbia Undated Photograph.png|thumb|left|The [[Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company]]'s new steamship, the [[SS Columbia (1880)|''Columbia'']], was the first commercial application for Edison's incandescent light bulb in 1880.]]
[[Henry Villard]], president of the [[Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company]], attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the [[SS Columbia (1880)|''Columbia'']]. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the ''Columbia'' went to [[New York City]], where Edison and his personnel installed ''Columbia'''s new lighting system. The ''Columbia'' was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from ''Columbia'' in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Jehl, Francis [https://books.google.com/books?id=OkL1Smk4uiAC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=SS+Columbia+(1880) Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory], Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, July 1, 2002, page 564&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dalton"&gt;Dalton, Anthony

[[Lewis Latimer]] joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the "Process of Manufacturing Carbons", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/forkids/the-gifted-men-who-worked-for-edison.htm |title=Lewis Howard Latimer |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Westinghouse]]'s company bought [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl's]] competing [[Electrodeless lamp|induction lamp]] patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.&lt;ref name="EDJ1929"&gt;"Diehl's Lamp Hit Edison Monopoly," Elizabeth Daily Journal, Friday Evening, October 25, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 1883, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|US patent office]] ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of [[William E. Sawyer]] and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for "a filament of carbon of high resistance" was valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=9781599862163 |page=15 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called [[Ediswan]] to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.

[[Mahen Theatre]] in [[Brno]] (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps.

===Electric power distribution===
After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric "[[Public utility|utility]]" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Faruqui, Kelly Eakin, Pricing in Competitive Electricity Markets, Springer Science &amp; Business Media – 2000, page 67&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 1880, he founded the [[Edison Illuminating Company]], and during the 1880s, he patented a system for [[electricity distribution]]. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on [[Pearl Street Station]], New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]] generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers in lower [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=A brief history of Con Edison:"Electricity" |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] began service in [[Roselle, New Jersey]].

===War of currents===
{{Main|War of Currents}}
[[File:PyramidParthenon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]].]]
As Edison expanded his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and "step down" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, pages 54–60&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.

Edison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As [[George Westinghouse]] installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, "''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maury Klein, The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2008, page 257&lt;/ref&gt; Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.&lt;ref&gt;Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The By Jill Jonnes page 146&lt;/ref&gt; Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq0Le9FfXlAC&amp;pg=PT68&amp;dq=Thomson+Houston+westinghouse+edison+1887&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xhPhVKfmB-aHsQTkyoEY&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomson%20Houston%20westinghouse%20edison%201887&amp;f=false|title=Edison to Enron|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2009, pages 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a [[propaganda]] campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of Currents|"battle of currents"]]. The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

Thomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier [[J.P. Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]]. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA – 2009, page 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bradley Jr., Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies, John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2011, pages 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931)==
[[File:Edison battery exhibit, 1915.jpg|thumb|Thomas A. Edison Industries Exhibit, Primary Battery section, 1915]]
Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as "[[Thomas Edison National Historical Park|Glenmont]]" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in [[Llewellyn Park]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], Florida, and built what was later called [[Seminole Lodge (Thomas Edison)|Seminole Lodge]] as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.&lt;ref name="Reisert"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Reisert|first1=Sarah|title= Home Away from Home |magazine=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=46–47|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/home-away-from-home|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the security concerns around [[World War I]], Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the [[Naval Consulting Board]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=board&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/about-nrl/history/edison/ |title=Thomas Edison's Vision |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2013 |quote=Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels seized the opportunity created by Edison's public comments to enlist Edison's support.

Edison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.  Edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org/about/what-youll-see/edison-s-botanic-research-laboratory/|title=Edison Botanic Research Laboratory – Edison &amp; Ford Winter Estates – (239) 334-7419|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203203552/http://www.edisonfordwinterestates.org/about/what-youll-see/edison-s-botanic-research-laboratory/#|archive-date=February 3, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EFWE 2008.04.01 .jpg|thumb|From left to right: Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone, the three partners of the Edison Botanic Research Corporation.]]

The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part [[Acid-base extraction]], to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://communities.acs.org/community/science/sustainability/green-chemistry-nexus-blog/blog/2014/05/21/thomas-edison-s-botanical-laboratory-to-be-recognized-as-a-national-historic-chemical-landmark-in-fort-myers|title=Green Chemistry: The Nexus Blog: Thomas Edison'... {{!}} ACS Network|website=communities.acs.org|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on ''[[Solidago leavenworthii]]'', also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.&lt;ref&gt;Growing American Rubber by Mark Finlay&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other inventions and projects==

===Fluoroscopy===
Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscope]], a machine that uses [[X-rays]] to take [[radiographs]]. Until Edison discovered that [[Scheelite|calcium tungstate]] fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium [[platinocyanide]] screens originally used by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.

The fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, [[Clarence Madison Dally|Clarence Dally]]. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: "Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them."&lt;ref&gt;Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library: Edison fears the hidden perils of the x-rays. New York Worldb/, August 3, 1903, Durham, NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tasimeter===

Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the [[tasimeter]], which measured [[infrared|infrared radiation]].  His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar [[corona]] during the total [[Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878]].

===Telegraph improvements===
{{original research|section|date=December 2016}}

The key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the [[ticker tape|stock ticker]], the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.

===Motion pictures===

Edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or "Kinetograph". He did the electromechanical design while his employee [[W.&amp;nbsp;K.&amp;nbsp;L. Dickson]], a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; In 1891, Thomas Edison built a [[Kinetoscope]] or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Edison Motion Pictures |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTfhBN2?url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist.html |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1896, [[Thomas Armat]]'s [[Vitascope]], manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.

Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman [[Irving T. Bush]] (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in [[Austria-Hungary]], the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/stollwerck.htm |title=Martin Loiperdinger.

The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the [[Fairs]] in early 1895. The Edison's Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.&lt;ref name="Imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0111244/ |title=Guido Convents, ''Van Kinetoscoop tot Cafe-Cine de Eerste Jaren van de Film in Belgie, 1894–1908, pp. 33–69.''

On May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with [[Leon Gaumont]] and the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph]] Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.&lt;ref name="Imdb.com"/&gt;

[[Edison Studios|Edison's film studio]] made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'' (1894), ''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896), ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910 film)|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1910), and the first ''[[Frankenstein (1910 film)|Frankenstein]]'' film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park, Coney Island]] announced they would execute [[Topsy (elephant)|Topsy the elephant]] by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title ''[[Electrocuting an Elephant]]''.

As the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lubin.htm Siegmund Lubin (1851–1923)], Who's Who of Victorian Cinema. Retrieved August 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of [[photographic paper]] with the [[U.S. copyright office]]. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhist1.html#EE "History of Edison Motion Pictures: Early Edison Motion Picture Production (1892–1895)"], Memory.loc.gov, [[Library of Congress]]. Retrieved August 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Edison started the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]], which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the [[Acoustical Society of America]], which was founded in 1929.

Edison said his favorite movie was ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. He thought that [[talkies]] had "spoiled everything" for him. "There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf."&lt;ref name="condensed1042"&gt;Reader's Digest, March 1930, pp. 1042–1044, "Living With a Genius", condensed from The American Magazine February 1930&lt;/ref&gt; His favorite stars were [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Clara Bow]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edison Wears Silk Nightshirt, Hates Talkies, Writes Wife", Capital Times, October 30, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
Starting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|Edison Ore Milling Company]], Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|title=Edison's Companies – The Edison Papers|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the [[Falconbridge, Greater Sudbury, Ontario|Falconbridge]] ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&amp;lang=en&amp;currID=2031&amp;parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |work=[[Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTghSyU?url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&amp;lang=en&amp;currID=2031&amp;parID=2029 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [[Edison Building (Falconbridge)|Edison Building]], which served as the head office of [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Mines]], are named for him.

===Battery===
[[File:Edison Storage Battery Company 1903.JPG|thumb|Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued 19. October 1903]]
The Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company, Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904, 450 people already worked for the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars, but there were several defects. Several customers complained about the products. When the capital of the company was spent, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte.

===Chemicals===

At the start of [[World War I]], the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August, 1914, resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was [[phenol]], which was used to make [[phonograph]] records–presumably as [[phenolic resins]] of the [[Bakelite]] type.

At the time, phenol came from [[coal]] as a by-product of [[coke oven]] gases or [[manufactured gas]] for [[gaslighting]].  Phenol could be nitrated to [[picric acid]] and converted to [[ammonium picrate]], a shock resistant [[high explosive]] suitable for use in artillery shells.  The best telling of the phenol story is found in “The Aspirin Wars.”&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991)., The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition, Alfred A. Knopf, NY, isbn 0-394-57894-5, p 38-40&lt;/ref&gt; Most phenol had been imported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], but with war, [[Parliament]] blocked exports and diverted most to production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.

Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his [[Silver Lake, NJ]], facility using processes developed by his chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Conot, Robert (1979), A Streak of Luck: The Life &amp; Legend of Thomas Alva Edison, Seaview Books, NY, p 413-4&lt;/ref&gt; He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, PA]] and [[Bessemer, AL]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.

Phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. [[Bakelite]], the original [[thermoset]] [[plastic]], had been invented in 1909. [[Aspirin]], too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug. [[Bayer]] had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in [[Rensselaer, NY]], but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.

Bayer relied on [[Chemische Fabrik von Heyden]], in [[Piscataway, NJ]], to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See [[Great Phenol]] plot.)  It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to [[salicylic acid]] by Heyden, some of which was exported.

==Final years and death==
===Final years===
[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Ford]], Thomas Edison, and [[Harvey Firestone]], respectively. [[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929]]

[[Henry Ford]], the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.

In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [[Civitan International|Civitan Club]]. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that "The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Armbrester |first= Margaret E. |title= The Civitan Story |year= 1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location= Birmingham, AL |page= 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.

Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna Railroad]] inaugurated suburban electric train service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], and [[Gladstone, New Jersey]]. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to [[South Orange, NJ|South Orange]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2001"&gt;{{Holland-Classic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by [[New Jersey Transit]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2001"/&gt;

Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular [[Food faddism|fad diet]] in his last few years; "the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours".&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Israel (historian)|title=Edison: A Life of Invention|year=2000|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-0-471-36270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies." She also said that during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.&lt;ref name="condensed1042"/&gt;

Edison became the owner of his [[Milan, Ohio]], birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Death===
Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, "Glenmont" in [[Llewellyn Park]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina.

Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at [[The Henry Ford]] museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced [[Charles Edison]] to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_128a.html "Is Thomas Edison's last breath preserved in a test tube in the Henry Ford Museum?"], [[The Straight Dope]], September 11, 1987.

==Marriages and children==
On December 25, 1871, at the age of twenty-four, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:

* Thomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed "Dash"&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin 1995, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison's son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr.. became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in [[snake oil]] products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as "''The Latest Edison Discovery''". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35.00 ({{Inflation|US|35.00|1885|fmt=eq|r=0}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LOST IN HISTORY: Thomas A.

==Views==
===On politics, religion, and metaphysics===
Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a "[[Freethought|freethinker]]".&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; Edison was heavily influenced by [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]''.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; Edison defended Paine's "scientific [[deism]]", saying, "He has been called an [[atheism|atheist]], but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity."&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt; In 1878, Edison joined the [[Theosophical Society]] in New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tsmembers.org/|title=Theosophical Society Members 1875-1942 – Historical membership list of the Theosophical Society (Adyar) 1875-1942|website=tsmembers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but according to its founder, [[Helena Blavatsky|H. P. Blavatsky]], he was not a very active member&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Writings, Vol. XII|last=Blavatsky|first=Helena Petrovna|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|year=1980|isbn=|location=Wheaton, IL|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In an October 2, 1910, interview in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', Edison stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me&amp;nbsp;— the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love&amp;nbsp;— He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us&amp;nbsp;— nature did it all&amp;nbsp;— not the gods of the religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title="No Immortality of the Soul" says Thomas A. Edison.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.&lt;ref name=Israel /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also stated, "I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=75ldAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22I+do+not+believe+in+the+God+of+the+theologians;+but+that+there+is+a+Supreme+Intelligence+I+do+not+doubt%22&amp;dq=%22I+do+not+believe+in+the+God+of+the+theologians;+but+that+there+is+a+Supreme+Intelligence+I+do+not+doubt%22&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QDQyUrD0NuPs2wWTwoGADQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg The Freethinker]'' (1970), G.W.

[[Nonviolence]] was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, "I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill." Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: "Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=DtjWFiDKsJ0C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Still+savages%22+edison&amp;ei=KiHMSLJSiNzKBIiglYsJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2IXFOuvGUriygDwhEkgvqyaefwEg Innovate Like Edison: The Success System of America's Greatest Inventor] by Sarah Miller Caldicott, Michael J.

Forbes]] of ''[[American Magazine]]'' that he was working on a "spirit phone" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gereports.com/edisons-forgotten-invention-a-phone-that-calls-the-dead/|title=Edison's Forgotten 'Invention': A Phone That Calls the Dead|date=October 28, 2010|publisher=GE Reports|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111162640/http://www.gereports.com/edisons-forgotten-invention-a-phone-that-calls-the-dead/|archivedate=November 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the ''New York Times'' in 1926 that "I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentplaques.com/blog/?p=1026|title=Invention Geek – Edison Spirit Phone?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the monetary system===

Thomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the [[gold standard]] and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating "Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and [[interest]] is an invention of Satan."&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/12/06/98768710.pdf |title=Ford sees wealth in muscle shoals|work=[[The New York Times]] |format=PDF |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |date=December 6, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

He thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled "A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System".&lt;ref&gt;Edison, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, [[Henry Ford]], he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammes |first1=D.L. |last2=Wills |first2=D.T.|title=Thomas Edison's Monetary Option|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|year=2006 |volume=28|issue=3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammes |first=David L.|title=Harvesting Gold: Thomas Edison's Experiment to Re-Invent American Money|publisher=Mahler Publishing|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vow of silence''' is a [[vow]] to maintain [[silence]]. Although it is commonly associated with monasticism, no major monastic order takes a vow of silence. Even the most fervently silent orders such as the Carthusians have time in their schedule for talking. Recently, the vow of silence has been embraced by some in secular society as means of protest or of deepening their spirituality. Silence is often seen as essential to  deepening a relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Silence:Against the Dictatorship of Noise|last=Sarah|first=Robert Cardinal|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2017|isbn= 1621641910}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is also considered a virtue in some religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Weeping Buddha|last=Macadam|first=Heather|publisher=Akashic Books|year=2002|isbn=1888451394|location=New York|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Christian]] traditions such as [[Lutheranism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], the '''Great Silence''' is the period of time beginning at the [[canonical hour]] of [[Compline]], in which votarists are silent until the first office of the next day, [[Lauds]].&lt;ref name="Ware2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Jordan Haynie|title=The Ultimate Quest: A Geek’s Guide to (The Episcopal) Church|accessdate=15 September 2018|date=1 February 2017|publisher=Church Publishing Incorporated|language=English|isbn=9780819233264|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Pythagoras]] imposed a strict rule of silence on his disciples.

Despite the common misconception, no major Christian monasteries or religious orders take such a vow. However, most monasteries have specific times (magnum silentium, work silence, times of prayer, etc) and places (the chapel, the refectory, etc) where speaking is prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Even outside of these times and places, useless and idle words are forbidden.  In active orders the members speak according to the needs of their various duties.&lt;ref name = CE&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indian religions]], religious silence is called ''Mauna'' and the name for a [[Rishi|sage]] ''muni'' (see, for example [[Sakyamuni]]) literally means 'silent one'.&lt;ref name="Bhalla2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhalla|first=Prem P.|title=Hindu Rites, Rituals, Customs and Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOgAnbOmu08C&amp;pg=PT172|year=2006|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=978-81-223-0902-7|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, "one does not become a sage simply because of a vow of silence" due to the prescription for disciples to also teach the Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhist Monastic Life: According to the Texts of the Theravada Tradition|last=Wijayaratna|first=Mohan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=0521364280|location=Cambridge|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vow of silence is also relevant in the training of novices and is often cited as a way to resist the allures of [[Saṃsāra|''samsara'']], including those posed by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver Screen Buddha: Buddhism in Asian and Western Film|last=Suh|first=Sharon|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|year=2015|isbn=9781441189257|location=London|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monks who take a vow of silence often carry an iron staff called [[Khakkhara|''khakkhara'']], which makes a metallic noise to frighten away animals. Since they cannot speak, the rattle of the staff also announces their arrival when they start begging for alms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols|last=Beer|first=Robert|publisher=Serindia|year=2003|isbn=1932476032|location=Chicago|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Non-religious examples ===
Another vow of silence can be made to express a bold statement. This type may be to speak up controversial issues such as [[child poverty]]. An example of this, is The November 30th Vow of Silence for Free The Children in which students in Canada take a 24-hour vow of silence to speak up against poverty and [[child labour]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===In pop culture===

The 2006 film, [[Little Miss Sunshine]], featured Dwayne, a Nietzsche-reading teenager, taking a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a test pilot. 

"[[The Cartoon]]", a season 9 episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', featured [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] taking a vow of silence.

The 2009 movie, "[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]", featured [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] taking a vow of silence.

The 2011 movie [[The Hangover: Part II]] featured a [[Buddhist monk]] taking a vow of silence as part of the film's plot.

The 2017 television show, "[[The Good Place]]" featured Jianyu, a buddhist monk, taking a vow of silence.

The [[HBO]] TV Series [[Curb Your Enthusiasm]] (Season 8, Episode 5) featured a character taking a vow of silence. The episode title was also called "Vow of Silence".

===In literature===
In the book "[[The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]]" ''(ねじまき鳥クロニクル Nejimakitori Kuronikuru)'' perhaps the character Cinnamon Akasaka has taken a vow of silence.

{{nihongo|'''Yamaga Sokō'''|山鹿 素行||21 September 1622 &amp;ndash; 23 October 1685}} was a Japanese [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[military strategy|strategist]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. As a scholar he applied the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] idea of the "superior man" to the [[samurai]] [[Social class|class]] of Japan. This became an important part of the samurai way of life and code of conduct.

==Biography==
Yamaga Sokō had been studying the [[Chinese classics]] since the age of six, and at nine became a student of [[Hayashi Razan]], a follower of [[Neo-Confucianism]] responsible for its development as the official doctrine of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum1038"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al.'' (2005). "Yamaga Sokō" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan encyclopedia,'' p. 1038.|page=1038}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, at the age of forty he broke away from the official doctrine and changed his concept of Confucianism, burning all of the books he had written while still under its influence. This, along with the publishing of a philosophical work entitled ''[[Seikyo Yoroku]]'', caused him to be removed from the bureaucracy and exiled outside Edo (modern-day [[Tokyo]]). Soon after being exiled, he moved to the [[Akō Domain]], befriending [[Asano Nagatomo]] and becoming an important teacher of Confucianism and [[military science]] in the region. Yamaga's influence would later be expressed in the [[Forty-seven Ronin|Genroku Akō incident]], as its leader, [[Ōishi Yoshio]], had been a devoted pupil of his. 
 
Yamaga wrote a series of works dealing with "the warrior's creed" (''bukyō'') and "the way of the gentleman" (''shidō''). In this way he described the lofty mission of the warrior class and its attendant obligations. According to [[William Scott Wilson]] in his ''Ideals of the Samurai'', Yamaga "in his theory of Shidō (a less radical theory than bushidō), defined the warrior as an example of Confucian purity to the other classes of society, and as punisher of those who would stray from its path".

Wilson wrote that Yamaga thought of the samurai as a "sort of Warrior-Sage" and focused his writings on the perfection of this "transcendent ideal", but "this direction of thinking&amp;nbsp;... was typical of the scholars of the Edo Period in its tendency toward speculation".

He re-emphasized that the peaceful arts, letters, and history were essential to the intellectual discipline of the samurai. Yamaga thus symbolizes the historical transformation of the samurai class from a purely military aristocracy to one of increasing political and intellectual leadership.&lt;ref&gt;De Bary, William et al. (2001). ''Sources Of Japanese Tradition: Volume 2, 1600 to 2000'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his pupils was [[Daidōji Yūzan]], a samurai from the [[Daidōji family]], who would become the author of an important bushidō text, ''Budō shoshin shu''. He also drew attention to the need to study and adopt Western weapons and tactics, as introduced by the Dutch.

In 1665, Yamaga publicly avowed his antipathy for Neo-Confucianism in the ''Essence of Confucianism'' and was arrested the following year at the instigation of [[Hoshina Masayuki]], Lord of [[Aizu]]. Yamaga proclaimed his belief that the unadulterated truth could only be found in the ethical teachings of Confucius, and that subsequent developments within the Confucian tradition represented perversions of the original doctrine. Hoshina, however, saw this attack as a potential challenge to Tokugawa authority itself, and Yamaga was subsequently exiled to stay with the [[Asano]] ''[[daimyō]]'' in the [[Akō, Hyōgo|Akō]] domain (''[[Han (Japan)|han]]''), where his life intersects with the tale of the [[forty-seven rōnin|forty-seven ''rōnin'']], which was later retold in a classic of Japanese literature, ''[[Chūshingura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, Stephen. (1996).  ''The Samurai: A Military History.'' p. 265; Tucker, John. (2002). "Tokugawa Intellectual History and Prewar Ideology: The Case of Inoue Tetsujirō, Yamaga Sokō, and the Forty-Seven Rōnin", in ''Sino-Japanese Studies''. Vo. 14, pp. 35–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of his near contemporary [[Matsudaira Sadanobu]] presents a plausible context for more fully understanding and appreciating Yamaga's life. Both believed entirely in the civic and personal values of Confucianism, but both construed those precepts a little differently because of their places in [[Edo period]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Shuzo Uenaka. (1977). "Last Testament in Exile. Yamaga Sokō's ''Haisho Zampitsu''", ''Monumenta Nipponica,'' 32:2, No. 2, pp. 125–152.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own time, this conception of Confucian values was among the factors that led him to draw attention to the need to study and adopt Western weapons and tactics, as introduced by the Dutch.
            
Yamaga's conception restated and codified the writings of past centuries and pointed to the emperor as the focus of all loyalties.  His teachings therefore had direct application for everyone in the existing feudal structure, and he was not calling for a change in the status of the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]].

==''Chucho Jijitsu''==

An important theme running through Yamaga's life and works was a focus on the greatness of Japan, and this became one of the reasons his popularity and influence were to expand in the rising nationalistic culture of the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, Paul. (20000). ''Japanese Culture.'' p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living at a time when very few texts were written in Japanese, and Japanese scholars devoted themselves to the study of Chinese history, literature, and philosophy, he wrote the ''Chucho Jijitsu'' (which translates as "Actual Facts about the Central Realm") to awaken Japanese scholars to the greatness of their own national history and culture. His argument is that Japan is a gift of the gods to the Japanese people, and that while many nations (here his readers would have understood him to refer to China) consider their country to be the center of the world, on the objective basis of temperate climate, only China and Japan can justify such claims, and of the two Japan is clearly superior because it is favored by the gods, as proven by the fact that only in Japan is there an unbroken Imperial line descended from the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Earl, David Magarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan,; Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1964, pp. 45 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of the work can be appreciated in this excerpt:

"The water and soil of Japan excel those of all other countries, and the qualities of its people are supreme throughout the eight corners of the earth. For this reason, the boundless eternity of its gods and the endlessness of the reign of its sacred line, its splendid works of literature and glorious feats of arms, shall be as enduring as heaven and earth."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Earl, David Magarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan,; Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1964, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soetsu.JPG|thumb|Yanagi Sōetsu]]
{{nihongo|'''Yanagi Sōetsu'''|柳 宗悦|extra=March 21, 1889 &amp;ndash; May 3, 1961}}, also known as '''Yanagi Muneyoshi''',&lt;ref&gt;Sōetsu and Muneyoshi are alternate readings (pronunciations) of the same [[Chinese characters]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a Japanese philosopher and founder of the ''[[mingei]]'' (folk craft) movement in [[Japan]] in the late 1920s and 1930s.

==Biography==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of curiosity about [[Korean art|Korean crafts]]. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924 and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966).

In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo period|Edo]] and [[Meiji period]]s that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the [[Japanese Folk Crafts Museum]] (''Nihon Mingeikan'') was established. 

He was also working together with [[Onta ware]].

In 1984, Yanagi was posthumously awarded the ''Bogwan'' [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]], the first to be awarded to a non-Korean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=야나기 무네요시 전 |url=https://www.jungle.co.kr/exhibit/5702 |website=디자인정글 |publisher=Design Jungle |accessdate=29 September 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mingei'' theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is {{nihongo|"hand-crafted art of ordinary people"|民衆的工芸|minshū-teki kōgei}}. Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts that include [[pottery]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

Yanagi was editor of ''Kōgei'' ('Crafts'), the journal of the Japanese Folk Arts Association, issued between 1931 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qclOb70JnpgC&amp;pg=PA77 |title=Asian Treasures: Gems of the Written Word |author=Gosling, Andrew |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |year=2011 |page=71 |ISBN=978-0-642-27722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was the author of a collection of proverbs in three books, still extant in an abridged form, compiled, according to the ''[[Suda]]'' ,&lt;ref&gt;Suda ζ 73&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus of Alexandria]] and "The Tarrhaean" ([[Lucillus]] of [[Tarrha]], a polis in [[Crete]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=972}} In the work, the proverbs are [[alphabetisation|alphabetised]] and grouped by hundreds.
